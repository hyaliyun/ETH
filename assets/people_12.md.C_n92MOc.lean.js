He died in Livorno, Italy on April 27, 1994.http://www.bpp.it/Apulia/html/archivio/2005/II/art/R05II117.htm Barba was a maverick hospitality executive whose career was sometimes overshadowed by the fame of his younger brother, Eugenio Barba, the well-known Italian theater producer. But Ernesto was a colorful figure in his own right, and had a long career in and out of the traditional halls of the corporate hotel industry. He was a long time Hilton executive, but in the mid 1970s was more or less exiled by them in part because of his sometimes outrageous ideas for promoting their hotels. He is reported to have suggested opening vegetarian restaurants in some Hilton hotels before the idea became less sensationalistic. His last position within Hilton was as general manager of the Taipei Hilton. Thereafter, he became a sort of freelance hotel promoter and general manager, very active in Spain and Asia. Among his clients were the twin Soto Grande hotels on the Mediterranean Sea, along the Costa del Sol. Barba was recruited to reopen the two properties for commercial business after they lay empty following the death of Francisco Franco, the Spanish leader, who had used the hotels as his personal retreat for many years. Barba then supervised the launch of the Ritz Taipei, and was later retained as the general manager of the Shangrila Hotel which soon became the Sheraton Taipei. He had some distractions, however, left over from the defeat of Italian fascism at the end of World War II, and in the 1970s he became a senior follower of the Indian spiritual group called the Ananda Marga, whose leader Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar was unjustly imprisoned with a false accusation (and then later cleared of charges). Barba trained a large group of young members in the art of vegetarian cooking. Barba thus first opened a cooking school and vegetarian restaurant, called Alfalfa, at the Soto Grande Hotels in 1978. Barba's promotion skills were superb and, had he spoken fluent English, they would no doubt have been even more impressive. However he didn‚Äôt, and as a result, he hired western, native English speaking marketing partners to help bring his client properties to the attention of western, English speaking, travelers. Among these was Michael Adams,Brooks, Gordon. \\"Filling hotels with people and ambiance\\" The China Post March 25, 1981 an American graphic designer and writer. Barba recruited other international talent as well, and some of those individuals went on to larger hospitality careers, including Dorian Landers, Barba's food-and-beverage-manager-of-choice, who is the founder and CEO of the Malaysia-based hospitality development and consulting firm Hostasia Co.. Dorian Landers, true to Barba's stylishness for flamboyance also worked with Bill Bensley to develop some of the best luxury hotels in Asia. Also in Barba's employ at one time was Louis Ercout, an executive chef who eventually founded Prospections Group, a leading hotel executive recruitment agency in Santa Monica, CA. Barba rightfully understood that creating a buzz of fashion and pop culture could generate meaningful free publicity for a hotel property, and he was therefore always organizing fashion shows and other events to get attention in the local press. When the budget permitted, he went higher on the pop ladder to attract news-worthy personalities to his hotels. In this spirit, he retained Japanese pop artist Tadanori Yokoo to design the interiors of one important restaurant in the Ritz Taipei. As a testament to his persuasive promotion skills, Barba managed to coax Jeanne Moreau, the French actress/icon to come, free of charge, to the opening ceremony of the Soto Grande Hotels in 1978. Later, in Taipei, he spoke on the phone with Gina Lollobrigida, attempting to lore her to the opening of the Ritz Taipei Hotel, one of the top properties in his string of successful launches. For whatever reason, that fell through, but he had a back-up plan. He easily got Anne Parillaud, the young ‚ÄúBrooke Shields‚Äù of Paris (who later won the French Oscar for her lead role in La Femme Nikita) to come instead. At the time, she was 19 and was considered the new Brigitte Bardot. Although he successfully launched perhaps half a dozen privately owned hotel properties, he had a very strong management style, and sometimes introduced his personal beliefs into the public arena of a hotel. A case in point. He had a private booth reserved for his meals in one restaurant of the Shangrila Hotel (soon to be the Sheraton Taipei). It was in the Pizza Pub there, and he took his vegetarian meals in that booth. But on the wall of the booth he displayed a portrait of Benito Mussolini, and this was in 1981. When he was not using it, the booth was open for regular diners in the restaurant, and the portrait was a source of some concern among some of the hotel‚Äôs guests. In 1990, Barba, true to his spirit of adventure went to manage the infamous Holiday Inn In Lhasa (Tibet); one of his last ventures. His flamboyant and controversial management of the hotel is a source of humor in the top-selling book on Tibet; The Hotel on the Roof of the World. Barba was a brilliant hotel promoter who brought far more excitement to the properties he managed than his clients could normally hope for. He was seemingly a type A personality and he died, apparently of a heart attack, in 1994. His brother, Eugenio Barba, is still alive.

Although born in Dublin, she was raised from an early age in London, the youngest of eight children. Bradley was among the first ballroom dance professionals of the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing (ISTD) who standardised the basic techniques of foxtrot, tango, quickstep and waltz. These are the English ballroom dances of what is now the World Dance Council's International Dancesport category. For her activities she had earned herself an informal title \\"The First Lady of the Ballroom\\". The early years Youth Her father was a strict Roman Catholic, who abhorred dancing and the theatre. He died when she was ten, and an older sister subsequently succumbed to tuberculosis. It was feared that Josephine might be infected, so the family moved from London to Chorley Wood, at that time a rural village. Ballroom dance In 1924 she danced with an American, G.K. Anderson, in a competition at the Embassy Club in Regent Street. She was the professional dancer of the two. They won that, and went on to win the Daily Sketch Foxtrot competition, for which pro-am couples were eligible. In the 1924 World Championship at the Queen's Hall, the couple won again, to become World Foxtrot Champions.Bradley, Josephine. 1947. Dancing through life. Hollis & Carter, London. In the overall World Championships for 1924 (professional), and again in 1925, Maxwell Stewart and Barbara Miles won, ahead of Victor Sylvester and Phyllis Clarke. That same year (1924), Bradley started her first dance school in the Knightsbridge Hotel. She was asked by the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing (ISTD) to join a working group to codify the dances and develop a syllabus for teachers. The ISTD formed its Ballroom Branch with Bradley, Eve Tynegate Smith, Murielle Simmons, Cynthia Humphreys and Victor Silvester as founder members. Bradley was a leading figure in the British ballroom dance world. She was active in ballroom dancing in general, and the ISTD in particular, right up to the end of her long life. Bradley was Chairman of the ISTD Ballroom Branch from 1924 to 1947. As an examiner for the ISTD, she toured Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. One of her pupils, Eveline Burchill, went on to set up a dance school in Dublin and also judged ISTD competitions. Marriage In 1927 Bradley married Douglas Wellesley-Smith, whom she had met in 1919. He had won the Military Cross (MC) in World War I, as a Captain in the 1st Battalion, the Lincolnshire Regiment. He had been twice wounded by bayonet thrusts, and they met when he was convalescing. Needing some light exercise, he came to her for dance lessons. They became regular dance partners in 1925. Their marriage lasted only four years until his death at the age of 35. She later found a dancing partner in Frank Ford, but she never married again. Ballroom orchestra Bradley was one of several top-class dancers who sought to rival Victor Silvester. His 'big idea' was to provide strict-tempo music for dances and dance teaching studios, and he succeeded to an almost unbelievable extent. A feature of all the strict tempo bands was the absence of a singer, who might have interfered with the clarity of the rhythm. With record sales reaching 75 million, and his orchestra regularly on BBC radio (and later, television), Silvester was the dominant public figure in the dancing world.Silvester, Victor.

Because of his lack of shyness and boundaries, he gains a lot of fans and has no trouble with flirting with women. Vivian Porter, his latest date, accidentally falls to her death following a fight with him. Following the accident, he moves to Los Angeles, where he starts to work at a radio station called KOZY, owned by Rick Harris. There, he meets Jon Price, an aspiring disc jockey waiting for his big break. Jon is in a relationship with Sharon Penn, a young woman who is working as a lawyer. Soon, Karlin shocks his colleagues and audience with his sexual conversations on air. He befriends Jon and offers him a spot as his co-host. Although Harris is not fond of their show, the ratings increase with huge amounts. Jon joins Karlin in partying all night and they come up with an idea to make people call and confess to big crimes to increase their ratings even more. When Jon finds out that Karlin is making his friends call the station to confess to crimes which were never committed, he feels that he is betraying his audience. They get into an argument, but Karlin eventually makes him promise to keep quiet, by promising him his own radio show. As they become very popular, Jon's new materialistic attitude irritates Sharon. When she finds out that he is cheating on her with a woman named Cynthia, she immediately leaves him. Meanwhile, Jon finds out that the murder Karlin's friend talked about wasn't made up. Upon confronting Karlin, he immediately wants to confront the police, but Karlin threatens to tell that he was an accomplice if he does. Not much later, Karlin, who was actually the one who committed the murder that was described, poisons his next victim, Cynthia. It turns out that he made the calls to the radio station himself, which were recorded with a different voice. When Jon refuses to keep silent any longer, Karlin frames him for the murder. Trying to serve justice, Jon decides to immediately visit Karlin's friend, only to find Karlin. Karlin tries to poison him with cyanide and, as Jon starts to react to the poisoning, admits that he planned everything that has happened. Not only does he admit to the murder of Vivian and Cynthia, but he also reveals his plans of making him look like Eddie, having falsely placed evidence in his house and making his death look like a suicide. However, it turns out that Jon didn't drink the bourbon containing the cyanide, and faked his cringing to get him to confess. When Karlin tries to shoot him, Jon reveals that he put a microphone on his body, and that all the listeners on the radio already heard his confession. A gun fight follows and Karlin is eventually shot and killed by the police. In the end, Jon resigns from the radio station and convinces Sharon to give him another chance.

It is the first to be released on the PlayStation 2. The British version of the game featured the Leeds United and England national football team defender Rio Ferdinand on the cover. Gameplay This is Football 2002 was licensed by FIFPro. However English club Arsenal and Italian club Juventus were unlicensed and were listed in the game as \\"Highbury\\" and \\"Turin\\" respectively. The game introduced a number of features unique to football games at the time, such as being able to make players deliberately dive (a feature described at the time as controversial). It also granted players the opportunity to deliberately foul with two-footed tackles. Release This is Football 2002 was released in September 2001 to be the first football game released before Christmas prior to the release of the FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer series of games. Reception This is Football 2002 received \\"generally positive\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The BBC praised This Is Football 2002 for its unique gameplay features such as the deliberate dives but stated that the tactics and AI was poor compared to the FIFA and PES series. Wales on Sunday likewise praised the detail of players and stadiums but criticized it for being similar to previous football games. IGN gave it a 8.1/10 review praising its gameplay and graphics but criticised the sound effects of the crowd. The majority of reviews put the majority of the negatives down to the developers' inexperience of making football games compared to the longer-running rival franchises. Copa90 named it as one of their top 10 football games in history.

Dust 514 took place in New Eden and was directly connected to CCP's game Eve Online. There was direct interaction between the two; player actions in one game affected the political, economic, legal, environmental, and social status of the other. The two games were officially connected on January 10, 2013 in preparation for the open beta on January 22. The full game was released worldwide on May 14, 2013. While previews of the game were highly positive, the full game received a mixed reception upon its initial release. It received constant updates and hotfixes deployed after release. The game was shut down by CCP on May 30, 2016. Setting Dust 514 took place in the same fictional universe as Eve Online, a science fiction massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) set 21,000 years in the future. The Eve Online backstory explains that humanity, after using up the Earth's resources, began to colonize the rest of the Milky Way. The development of faster-than- light travel allowed mankind to expand at an extremely fast pace, leading to violent competition between space-faring corporations. A natural wormhole was discovered, and humanity entered through it to find an empty new galaxy which they began colonizing. However, the wormhole connecting the two galaxies collapsed, leaving the young colonies cut off from the worlds that had supplied them. Without support, many of the colonies in the new galaxy died off, and over time the few that remained lost their knowledge of both their technology and of their origins from Earth. Eventually, a new era began when civilization was rebuilt and faster-than-light travel was rediscovered. Five unique space-faring cultures emerged from the colonies to become the only interstellar powers in the new galaxy; the Amarr, Caldari, Gallente, Jove and Minmatar. Eve Online players take the role of capsuleers, who are elite starship pilots made immortal using cloning technology and consciousness transfers. For much of Eve history, only capsuleers were immortal because the technology required to download consciousness was linked to a capsule that encloses them and leaves them in suspended animation. The capsule was designed specifically as an interface for pilots to control the ship that they were placed within. However, the discovery of a special implant made it possible to achieve a transfer of consciousness without the use of a capsule, so it became possible to make immortals that were not pilots. Dust 514 players took the role of immortal ground-based soldiers which were created by the military shortly after the implant was discovered. Gameplay Dust 514 allowed players to customize infantry and vehicles with a modular fitting system similar to the ship fitting system in Eve Online. Dust 514 was a first-person shooter with elements of massively multiplayer online games. Combat took place on the various planets found in Eve Online, each offering a substantial amount of unique maps and sockets. Planets were divided into several large districts, which held resources and installations that dust players had to fight for control over in Planetary Conquest battles, or PC battles for short. Only the natural landscapes of each planet remained constant; the placement of buildings and surface structures was controlled by the player corporations. Infantry in Dust 514 were equipped with \\"dropsuits\\" which functioned similarly to the ship hulls in Eve Online. Dropsuits had various module slots which players could utilize to fit different weapons, equipment and skins. Dust 514 entities had two different health meters: Shields and Armor; of which each had individual advantages and disadvantages. In addition, certain weapons affected one health type more than the other. For instance, the Scrambler Rifle would deal 20 percent more damage to shields but 20 percent less damage to armor. There were 3 different dropsuit variants for each race with corresponding advantages and disadvantages; light, medium, and heavy dropsuits; each of which branched out to their corresponding specialized dropsuit. Some examples were the Caldari Heavy Frame which could lead to the Caldari Commando and Sentinel, the Gallente Medium Frame led to the Gallente Assault and Logistics, and the Minmatar Light Frame led to the Minmatar Scout. This gave players a broad range of customization choices and the ability to create specialized fits to perform specific roles and tactics on the battlefield. Skill training, in a manner similar to Eve Online, was also available. CCP has stated that it would take seven years to train all skills, and that it was not intended for any player to learn all of the skills. Instead, CCP believed that players would naturally become specialized by selecting a certain set of skills and becoming \\"really, really good at them.\\" These skills unlocked new and better items, better passive bonuses, as well as unlocking other skills. Player- driven vehicles were also available in the game; these could be transported to anywhere within the battlefield using \\"rapid deployment vehicles (RDV)\\" at the request of players. Vehicles shared the modular fitting system that infantry dropsuits had but modules cost more than those of a dropsuit. Different game modes in Dust 514 were Ambush, Acquisition, Domination, and Skirmish. In Ambush and Ambush OMS, the goal of each team was to deplete the event team's Clone reserves. In Acquisition, the goal was to control timed nodes that move every five minutes. In Domination and Skirmish, the goal of each team was to destroy the opposing mobile command center. Although Dust 514 players were mercenaries, they could also seize territory from planets within a section of the Eve universe called Molden Heath for their own alliance and corporation, which took place in the form of Corporation vs. Corporation matches. This allowed Dust 514 corporations to build infrastructure on captured territory, but it was unclear what manufacturing power Dust 514 corporations would have. Dust 514 players could also work together with Eve players in capturing systems in Eve Online's factional warfare space; Dust 514 players could speed up or slow down the rate at which a system could be captured by winning battles for the attacking faction. Connection to Eve Online In a demonstration by CCP Games, an Eve Online Abaddon-class battleship (left) fires on a ground target designated by a Dust 514 soldier (right). All combat within Dust 514 took place, in real-time, on planets found in the Eve Online universe. The player alliances and corporations of Eve Online could hire Dust 514 players as mercenaries to fight for control over planets; the outcome of such battles were expected to eventually affect the sovereignty of player-run political powers in Eve Online. A direct form of interaction came in the form of \\"orbital bombardments\\". Orbital bombardments allowed a player in Eve Online to provide direct assistance to friendly forces in a battle in Dust 514. If a player in Eve Online were in position above a planet with proper bombardment equipment, the player could fire upon a target designated by a friendly Dust 514 player. This was first shown to the public as an actual in-game mechanic during EVE Fanfest 2012, although it had been previously featured during the 2011 fanfest in a cinematic trailer titled A Future Vision. Both games shared the same namespace, so a player in Dust 514 could not choose a username that already existed in Eve Online or vice versa. This allowed players from both games to join the same corporation or alliance, as well as communicate between the two games in real-time. In an interview conducted by Simon Carless of Gamasutra, CCP CEO Hilmar Veigar P√©tursson said that he hoped \\"these [Eve Online and Dust 514] communities will meld over time\\", bridging the two environments. He described the relationship between the flying-oriented nature of Eve Online and the infantry-oriented nature of Dust 514, saying \\"while the fleet does the flying, the infantry does the dying\\". The massive Eve universe would have been the platform for all planetary combat. Brandon Laurino, executive producer of Dust 514, stated that there would not be a set number of maps at launch, saying \\"We are covering literally a universe of planets, so there's thousands of different maps and they're all available to everyone who's playing.\\" Development Dust 514 was announced on August 18, 2009 at the Game Developers Conference in Cologne, Germany where it was introduced with a short trailer featuring real time footage of the game. In 2010, CCP updated Eve Online with the Tyrannis expansion. Tyrannis introduced planetary interaction, allowing players to harvest resources from planets using ground installations. A developer blog by CCP mentioned that, while the expansion alone would not include planetary combat, the upcoming Dust 514 game would deal with the combat aspect by allowing players to \\"project military force for attack and defense of planetary installations.\\" Planets in Eve Online previously held no value; the Tyrannis expansion was intended to tie into Dust 514 by giving players \\"a reason to want to fight over [the planets].\\" The original logo for Dust 514, used from its announcement up to E3 2011 CCP Games reached an agreement with Epic Games China in 2010 to license Unreal Engine 3 for use in Dust 514. During E3 2011, it was confirmed that Dust 514 would be released exclusively on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita. A beta would be held before the end of 2011 followed by a release in the summer of 2012. However, afterward CCP opted to put more work into the game to improve it further and have a release date in 2013, rather than a 2012 release date. Dust 514 was initially slated to be the first cross platform game, pitting Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 players with each other but CCP later dropped the Xbox 360 as a potential platform; the choice of PlayStation 3 exclusive was determined by Sony's more open platform allowing Dust 514 to connect to the Eve Online server Tranquility, whereas Microsoft's Xbox Live did not. It was also confirmed after E3 2011 that Dust 514 utilized Havok middleware technology. Dust 514 was connected to Tranquility, the live production server of Eve Online, on January 10, 2013. The complexity of running two games on one server proved to be a unique challenge for the developers. To mitigate any performance issues that this might have on either of the two games, CCP designed a server architecture such that the majority of Dust 514 gameplay was run on various \\"battle clusters\\" across the world. These server clusters would handle all the latency sensitive first-person shooter aspects of Dust 514. The main Eve cluster, located in London, would only communicate with Dust 514 for information such as character names. The game was released on May 14, 2013, with an update titled Uprising. This release build improved many aspects of the game, such as the graphics and character progression, and introduced the planetary conquest mechanic. Although Uprising was the initial release build, CCP said that it would not be the final major update: \\"Even when we take off the beta tag the launches don‚Äôt stop. We‚Äôll launch significant updates indefinitely... It‚Äôs an on-going service that will keep getting better and better.\\" Future developments At CCP's 2012 Fanfest, even before the release of Dust 514, CCP had already revealed ideas for expansions in 2013. Possible future features included the ability to traverse on planets with \\"hostile\\" environments (such as lava planets) and the addition of mechanized exoskeletons that players could use, called MTACs. At CCP's 2014 Fanfest, the company revealed that development would be split between Dust 514 and Project Legion, a prototype for a PC-based first-person shooter that would attempt to address some of the shortcomings in Dust 514. They planned on developing a distinct experience in the new prototype that was more aligned with their vision, while continuing to maintain some limited development of Dust 514. Had they decided the prototype was successful they stated they would have transferred existing player profiles and assets to the new game. This announcement was met with criticism from some of the player base, leading groups of core players to believe that CCP was abandoning Dust 514 in favor of Project Legion. At Eve Fanfest 2015, CCP said that while Project Legion was in works their main focus was on Dust 514.http://www.vg247.com/2015/03/21/project-legion-dust-514-ccp-pc-ps3/ However, CCP announced that Dust 514 would officially shut down on May 30, 2016. On April 21, 2016, CCP announced development of the game Project Nova, a free-to-play first-person lobby shooter for the PC using Unreal Engine 4 set in the EVE Online universe. CCP developer CCP Rattati emphasized that Project Nova was a project not a product; there was no guarantee that it would become a CCP game. PlayStation Home In the PlayStation's online social gaming platform PlayStation Home, a game space for Dust 514 was released on June 13, 2012. The game space provided information about mercenaries and the Eve Universe as well as a mini-game known as Slay, a tabletop strategy game. Users could also earn special rewards such as a Merc Dropsuit and a Companion Drone. The game space for Dust 514 became unavailable when PlayStation Home was closed on March 31, 2015. Business model Unlike Eve Online, Dust 514 did not require a monthly subscription. It instead used a micro-transaction model, making the game free to play. The game had two currencies: Aurum; which could be earned or bought with real money, and ISK; similar to but non-fungible with the primary currency in Eve Online that shares the same name. CCP's chief marketing officer, David Reid, compared this model to that of League of Legends. Reid said that Dust 514 is not a \\"pay-to-win\\" game. While some equipment could have been purchased with Aurum, the only benefit was a slightly different skin and lower skill requirements. Since the skills in question actually improved the performance of the equipment, performance of the Aurum-bought gear was actually slightly sub-par unless the skills were trained anyway. Reception Pre-release Before release Dust 514 was considered innovative for its connection to another game. IGN said that the game was highly ambitious and called it \\"...a Glimpse of the Future\\", while PC Gamer praised the orbital bombardment mechanic and the unprecedented amount of customization available. Release Upon release the game received mixed reception from critics. It attained an average aggregate score of 59.10% on GameRankings and 59/100 on Metacritic, indicating mixed or average reviews. Criticisms were generally focused on the bugs and poor execution of the gameplay. IGN's Vince Ingenito stated that Dust 514's incredible depth and customization were eclipsed by its poor graphics and gameplay mechanics. Additionally, Ingenito criticized the way the game implemented the free-to- play business model, saying it took too long for players to get into the equipment that they wanted. He ultimately gave the game a score of 5.8/10, calling it mediocre. Destructoid's Chris Carter gave the game a rating of 6/10, calling it an ambitious and complex shooter that still needed \\"a ton of work\\". Among the aspects that he criticized were the underwhelming graphics, the uninnovative game modes, and the tedious grind. Eurogamer reviewer Paul Dean wrote that Dust 514 has great potential but is \\"saddled with a very dull debut.\\" Dean noted that despite having interesting factors, such as the metagame and social connection to Eve Online, the game itself was mediocre and contained many bugs. However Alex Locher of PlayStation Universe praised the unique nature of Dust 514, commending its technological accomplishments and meaningful player interaction. As Locher remarked, \\"Dust 514 isn't some superficial and meaningless military shooter; it's a pioneering endeavour of programming, technology and consumer communication that has already created something unlike you've ever seen in gaming\\". Despite having mixed critical reception, CEO of the publisher CCP Games Hilmar Veigar P√©tursson said in March 2015 that the company is very satisfied with the sales of the game, saying that \\"Dust 514 is a profitable business of the company.\\" References External links Dust 514 on PlayStation.com Category:2013 video games Category:Eve Online Category:First-person shooters Category:Free-to-play video games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 3-only games Category:PlayStation Move-compatible games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Video games developed in China Category:Video games with cross-platform play Category:Massively multiplayer online first-person shooter games Category:Inactive massively multiplayer online games Category:Products and services discontinued in 2016 ","title":"Dust 514"},{"id":"24034064","text":"John Joseph McCort (February 16, 1860 - April 21, 1936) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church.

Characters *Hakim is the grandfather, a retired Pakistani army officer *Salman is the father who oscillates between prideful exuberance and the daily grind that preys on his feelings of self-worth *Khulsoom is Salman's wife who misses her native land and struggles to impart her traditional values onto her American-raised children *Salahuddin is the eldest son who is a successful businessman *Fatima is the middle child and a social justice activist *Ghafur is the youngest child History Ali, who is an attorney and writer in the Bay Area, began writing the play in 2001 while studying at the University of California, Berkeley. The idea for the play came from Ali's writing professor, Ishmael Reed, who encouraged him to write a theatrical piece that shed light on the inner lives of American Muslims, an increasingly marginalized American religious community. In 2004, the play established its \\"grassroots/seat of the pants\\" mode of operation with a series of staged readings launched at the Mehran Restaurant in Newark, California, and continued with Oakland Public Library sponsored events. Ali explained his choice of the play's ironic title in the February 2011 issue of American Theatre, saying it refers to \\"hundreds of years of alleged inherent acrimony between the West and Islam....I wanted to reframe that within this multi-hyphenated Muslim-American family. These 'crusaders,' instead of being blood-thirsty warmongers, are nuanced, hypocritical, self-involved, quirky people. Instead of Kalashnikovs and swords and missiles, we see them fighting with stinging barbs and wit and regrets and secrets‚Äîgood old-fashioned drama and melodrama.\\" Premiere The two-act play officially premiered as a 2005 showcase productionBullock, Ken (July 8, 2005), \\"Election Section: Play Explores Post-9/11 Tensions in Family Portrait\\", Berkeley Daily Planet. at the Tony Award-winning Berkeley Repertory Theatre. The play was and continues to be directed by acclaimed choreographer and director Carla Blank. Its NYC debut, on September 11, 2009, at the Nuyorican Poets Caf√© was followed by a sold-out five-week run, which broke attendance records for plays at this landmark Off-Broadway theater. In his Nuyorican program notes, Ali explained the choice of this date for the play's New York opening: \\"I believe by proactively confronting the history of that day through art and dialogue we can finally move beyond the anger, the violence, the extremism, the separatism, the pain and the regret, and build a bridge of understanding and reconciliation.\\" The play received its international premiere performances at MuslimFest in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, on July 31 and August 1, 2010, and was showcased in Washington, D.C.'s Atlas Performing Arts Center on November 12, 2010, and at the Kennedy Center's Millennium Hall on November 14, 2010. The one-hour performance of Act One remains archived on the Kennedy Center website.

The road connects Bilu Junction south of Rehovot, with Yehud Ma'arav Junction, running through Rehovot, Ness Ziona, Rishon LeZion and Beit Dagan and spanning a distance of approximately 22 km. Route description For most of its length, Route 412 is an urban road, widely changing its width depending on available urban space. Its urban sections are usually very busy, passing through the crowded city centers of Rehovot, Ness Ziona and Rishon LeZion with many signaled intersections. Route 412 starts at Bilu Junction, a large intersection with Highway 40, making it the central entrance to Rehovot from the south. It runs north as a four-lane (two lanes in each direction) divided urban road until it reaches central Rehovot, where it narrows in size to one lane in each direction. Leaving the city center, it once again widens to four lanes until it reaches a level crossing with the Lod - Ashkelon Railway, just west of the Rehovot Railway Station. It then widens to five lanes (three northbound, two southbound) as it leaves Rehovot. Entering Ness Ziona, there is a large junction with Road 4303 leading towards Highway 42. The road passes through Ness Ziona as a four-lane divided urban road. Exiting Ness Ziona, HaRishonim Interchange connects the road with Route 431. Passing through Rishon LeZion, the road varies in length between five (three northbound, two southbound) to six lanes, with the right lane serving as a public transportation lane during rush hours. Exiting Rishon LeZion, the road reaches Beit Dagan Junction with Highway 44. From Beit Dagan Junction, Route 412 becomes a standard inter-city highway, with two lanes in each direction, paved shoulders, a concrete median barrier and few signaled intersections. The road bypasses Beit Dagan and Or Yehuda to its terminus at Yehud Ma'arav Junction, the south-western entrance to Yehud. Future plans A road bridge designed to replace the over-crowded railway crossing in Rehovot is currently under construction. The bridge will be built by the Ayalon Highway Company and it is due for completion in 2014. A dedicated bus rapid transit route is planned along the urban section of Route 412, between Bilu Junction and Beit Dagan Junction, as part of a larger mass-transit system designed to serve the entire Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area. From Beit Dagan Junction, the BRT route will continue north-west along Highway 44 to its terminus at Holon Interchange, where it will meet the Green Line of the Tel Aviv Light Rail.

Often, in a noisy or crowded room it is almost impossible for an individual who is hard of hearing to distinguish one voice among many. This is often exacerbated by the effect of room acoustics on the quality of perceived speech. Hearing aids are able to amplify and process these sounds, and improve the speech to noise ratio. However, if the sound is too distorted by the time it reaches the listener, even the best hearing aids will struggle to unscramble the signal. Assistive listening devices offer a more adaptive alternative to hearing aids, but can be more complex and cumbersome. A common usage is to aid people who are hard of hearing (HOH) by amplification and providing a better signal to noise ratio (SNR). The ALD may be used to help HOH people hear televisions and other audio devices, or to help people hear speech through public address or sound reinforcement systems, such as in places of worship or lectures. The assistive listening device usually uses a microphone to capture an audio source near its origin and broadcast it wirelessly through means of frequency modulation (FM), infrared (IR), an audio induction loop, or another method. The person who is listening may use a wireless Receiver to tune into the signal and listen at their preferred volume. There are also other consumer ALDs such as alarm clocks with bed shakers, amplified stethoscopes, baby monitors, and flashing door bell indicators. Most FM assistive listening devices operate on seventeen channels between 72.1000 and 75.800 MHz. The use of a wireless microphone placed next to the person speaking eliminates the sounds between them and listener, which reduces the effects of reverberation from poor room acoustics, background noise around the listener, and background noise around the speaker (by using a directional microphone).

Ordered in the spring of 1767 from the Toulon shipyard, she was launched on 3 August 1768. She saw service in the American War of Independence, and was destroyed in battle during it. Career  D'Estaing's squadron (1778-1779)  At the time of the French entry to the American War of Independence, C√©sar was under the command of Captain Louis de Raimondis, flag captain to Chef d'Escadre Broves. On 13 April 1778, C√©sar sailed from Toulon bound for America, with the 12 ships of Estaing's fleet. The fleet arrived at the mouth of the Delaware River, north of Baltimore, on 8 July and pursued several enemy ships. On 8 August, it forced the straits at New York and entered the mouth of the Connecticut River, where the British forces were anchored. The British burnt seven of their ships and their stores. On 11 August 1778, C√©sar was separated from the squadron by a violent storm at the time when they were about to engage in a battle with the forces of Richard Howe. On 16 August 1778, C√©sar battled HMS Iris and then went to shelter in Boston, where she was joined by the other French ships. Captain Raimondis had his right arm shot off in the battle, and was evacuated at Boston on 27 October 1778. First officer Castellet took over. In December 1778, after d'Estaing's squadron had transferred to the West Indies, the C√©sar took part in the Battle of St. Lucia. On 6 July 1779 C√©sar was part of the rear squadron in the hard-fought battle of Grenada against the forces of John Byron. After Estaing's failure to support the Siege of Savannah in October 1779, C√©sar returned to France with the other ships that had arrived on America in 1778 in order to be refitted and to recruit new crew.  De Grasse's fleet (1781-1782)  In 1781, C√©sar left for the West Indies under the command of Charles R√©gis de Coriolis d'Espinouse in the fleet of the Comte de Grasse.

On 5 September 1781 C√©sar was present at the decisive battle of the Chesapeake, which completed the encirclement of the British forces at Yorktown. In 1782, still with De Grasse's fleet, C√©sar sailed to the West Indies and in January took part in the Battle of Saint Kitts. C√©sar was then at the Battle of the Saintes on 12 April 1782, during which she was totally dismasted and then captured by . A prize crew of 58 men and one lieutenant were placed on the ship and the crew were locked below deck. Here around 9pm they accidentally started a fire whilst breaking into the officers liquor cabinet. The fire spread and at 10.30pm reached the magazine, causing it to explode. The C√©sar was destroyed, killing 400 French sailors and 50 British members of the prize crew. To make things worse, during the 90 minutes before the explosion they were jumping in the water, not realising that the ship was surrounded by sharks. The ship's captain, Bernard de Marigny, who was injured and confined to his cabin, was killed in the explosion.Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.156 C√©sar was one of the twenty ships lost by the French Navy during the American War of Independence.

The cheaply made film tells an old story and adds nothing fresh, but it was presented with force. Aside from Lawrence Tierney's finely tuned, menacing performance, the acting was sub par. It was Tierney's performance that kept the film alive in the tradition of the old-fashioned gangsters like those portrayed by Cagney and Robinson.\\"Schwartz, Dennis.

It is also known as the Lindell Chocolate Shoppe. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1982.  Joseph Bosch  Joseph Bosch, C. 1903 Joseph Bosch was born in Baden, Germany in 1850. (47 pages, with map and 12 photos) He emigrated to New York with his family when he was four, then moved to Wisconsin at the age of twelve, where his father was a brewer.Biographical Sketches of Leading Citizens of Houghton, Baraga, and Marquette Counties, Michigan, Biographical Publishing Co, Chicago, 1903, pp. 121-123 In 1867, the family moved to Lake Linden; there, Bosch worked as a miner of the Calumet & Hecla company. However, he harbored the desire to become a brewmaster, and travelled to Milwaukee, Wisconsin to work at the Schlitz Brewery, then on to Cleveland, Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky before returning to Lake Linden in 1874 to found the Torch Lake Brewery. Two years later he admitted business partners and changed the name to Joseph Bosch & Company. In 1894 he again changed the name, this time to Bosch Brewing Company, and in 1899 the brewery was the largest in the Upper Peninsula, with a capacity of 60,000 barrels annually. Bosch was also the president of Lake Linden's First National Bank, organized in 1888, and participated in various mercantile enterprises, including those carried on in the Joseph Bosch Building.  History  In May 1887, fire swept through the village of Lake Linden, affecting 75% of the structures then within the village and completely destroying many. Joseph Bosch suffered a substantial amount of property loss. After the disaster, the village council decreed a fire prevention zone, within which structures had to be constructed of brick or stone, and roofed with fireproof materials. In particular, this zone covered the first three blocks of Calumet Street, where the Joseph Bosch Building now stands. In the late 1800s, Bosch built three structures in this area: the Bosch Bottling Works at 347 Third Street, the First National Bank at 346 Third Street, and the Joseph Bosch Building at 302 Calumet Street. The Joseph Bosch Building was constructed in 1887, immediately after the fire. It originally housed the N. Reding Company, which was partially owned by Bosch. In 1892, Bosch bought out Reding, and in 1893 re-incorporated the business as the Poull Mercantile Company, managed by Bosch's brother-in-law N. G. Poull. In 1902, the company was sold to the Lake Linden Co-op. Over the next few years, a number of other businesses used the building, including and Edward Lieblein's wholesale grocery and an indoor archery range. In 1916, Greek immigrants Louis Grammatiskakia and James Pamopallis bought the building, combining their previously separate candy-making businesses. They remodelled the building into a restaurant, christened The Lindell, and installed plate glass windows in the front and remodelled the interior in an Arts and Crafts style. The new restaurant opened in 1918. The business was sold to two brothers, John and Angelo Gekas, who ran it for 43 years.History of Lindell's Restaurant, retrieved 8/18/09 Then, In 1977, Richard and Frances Grunow purchased the building, and it continues to be well-maintained and operated as a restaurant.  Description  The Joseph Bosch Building is a two-story Italianate commercial building with two entranced and a recessed center second-story entrance on the front facade. It sits on a stone foundation with a full basement and has a flat roof.Bosch, Joseph, Building from the state of Michigan, retrieved 8/18/09 The building has plate glass windows in the first floor and arched windows on the second story with decorative brick and stone hoods with prominent keystones. The windows are arranged in two banks of four, with a single window in the narrow recess the north side, altering the symmetry of the facade. An ornate metal cornice lines the top of the building. A 1920s era sign made of metal and neon advertising the Lindell Chocolate Shoppe hangs in front of the building.

It was named for its occurrence in the Alacr√°n silver/arsenic/antimony mine, Pampa Larga, Chile. It is generally more rare than realgar and orpiment. Its origin is hydrothermal. It occurs as subhedral to euhedral tabular orange to pale gray crystals that are transparent to translucent. It has a yellow-orange streak with a hardness of 1.5. It crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system. It occurs with realgar and uzonite as flattened and prismatic grains up to 0.5 mm across. Composition When alacranite was first discovered in 1970 by Clark, it was associated with barite and calcite veins in the Alacran silver mine. Burns, P. and Pervival, J. (2001) Alacranite, As4S4: A new occurrence, new formula and determination of the crystal structure. Canadian Mineralogist, 39, 809-818. They also assumed that the mineral was identical to the species occurring in the Ag-As- Sb vein deposit at Alacran due to the similarity of its X-ray diffraction powder pattern. They discovered that alacranite was similar to the high- temperature Œ± polymorph of As4S4 in X-ray characteristics. In addition, alacranite was considered as realgar-like mineral. After that, they reported the composition of alacranite as As8S9 when they noticed another occurrence of Alacranite in Uzon Caldera associated with realgar and uzonite as cement in sandy gravels. They reported the composition of alacranite to be As8S9 regarding to the electron-microprobe analyses. When they analyzed a mineral during seafloor sampling consisting of red and orange arsenic sulfides by X-ray diffraction, a mixture of realgar and alacranite was resulted and it was noticed that the mineral was identical to synthetic Œ≤-As4S4 supposed that the original chemical formula of alacranite (As8S9) was incorrect.Bonazzi P., Bindi L., Popova V., Pratesi G. and Menchetti S. 2003: Alacranite, As8S9: structural study of the holotype and re-assignment of the original chemical formula. American Mineralogist, 88(11-12), pp. 1796-1800/> They argued that it is identical to alacranite because of the similarity of the physical properties and the unit-cell dimensions but further studies argue that it is different with respect to chemical formula and unit-cell volume. The chemistry of the average of four analyses in Uzon caldera, Russia corresponding to alacranite results in 67.35% arsenic and 32.61% sulfur resulting in a total of 99.96%, yielding the formula As7.98S9.02, ideally As8S9. Structure X-ray crystallography The structure of alacranite remained unsolved until further studies collected specimens containing crystals of alacranite. A group that studies seafloor hydrothermal, submarine volcanism and regional tectonics in Papua New Guinea collected samples that consists of clay minerals, pyrite, sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, sulfosalts and arsenic- bearing sulfides like realgar and alacranite. Data were gathered at different times using monochromatic X-radiation when a crystal of alacranite with approximate dimensions 0.14 √ó 0.10 √ó 0.06 mm was placed in a platform 3-circle goniometer equipped with a 1K charge-coupled device for 2Œ∏ up to 56.7¬∞. The data shows reflection statistics and systematic absences that indicates space group C2/c referring to the monoclinic symmetry for alacranite. Final results of the experiment show that alacranite is isostructural with the compound Œ±-As4S4 and it is the third mineral polymorph with the formula As4S4, the others are realgar and pararealgar. The three minerals consist of covalently bonded As4S4 molecules. In alacranite, each arsenic atom is bonded to one arsenic atom and two sulfur atoms, while the sulfur atoms bonded only to two arsenic atoms. The structure of molecules in alacranite is chemically the same as in realgar held together by van der Waals forces but different in the arrangement of the As4S4 in both structures. The differences between alacranite and realgar are demonstrated in the unit cell sizes and the packed structures of both minerals. Alacranite has a C-centered unit cell that is smaller than the primitive cell of realgar and also the structure of alacranite has a closely and more orderly packed structure than realgar. Fourier analysis Further studies of a single crystal of alacranite with dimensions 30 √ó 60 √ó 120 mm was examined using direct methods, Fourier syntheses and structure refinement resulting in intensities violating the C lattice type and symmetries like h0l reflections with l = 2n + 1 were absent. These results confirm the P2/c space group of alacranite resulting in a structure of two different kinds of cage-like molecules that are packing closely and found in the Œ≤-phase. The first molecule is identical to the As4S4 which is realgar where every As atom links one As and two S atoms and that is determined in the structure of the Œ≤-phase and realgar. The second molecule in the structure of alacranite is found to be chemically and structurally identical to As4S5 which is uzonite. Upon exposure to light, As4S4 molecule expands its unit cell volume and hence, transfers to As4S5. This transformation could be described to the variation of the inter molecular distances. Bonnazzi, P. (2006) Light-induced changes in molecular arsenic sulfides: State of the art and new evidence by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. American Mineralogist, 91,1323. These coherent orders of both molecules along [110] attributes to the change of the translation symmetry from C (Œ≤-phase) to P which is alacranite. In both molecules, the distances of the As-S bond are about 2.205 to 2.238 angstrom. However, the As-As bond distance in the As4S4 is longer than the As-As bond contained in As4S5 molecule within alacranite structure. Bonnazzi, P. and Bindi, L. (2008) A crystallographic review of arsenic sulfides: effects of chemical variations and changes induced by exposure to light. Mineralogical Crystallography. 223, 132-147. It was also shown that the unit-cell volume increases proportionally with increasing S content of minerals with ranging composition from As4S4 to As8S9 where alacranite has the biggest unit-cell in this range. Evidence supports that alacranite has a P2/c space group whereas the high-temperature and less content of S form is considered to be a new mineral that corresponds to the species from alacran previously described by which is As4S4 that crystallizes with the space group C2/c and has a smaller volume. Physical properties Alacranite occurs as cement in sandy gravel and in hydrothermal As-S veins. It occurs with a grain size up to 0.5 mm as flattened and prismatic crystals. Some forms are weak, dull or tarnished. It appears an orange to pale gray crystals with rose-yellow internal reflections with a yellow-orange streak. It has adamantine, vitreous, resinous and greasy luster and it is transparent. The weak chemical bonding in its structure gives the mineral a low Mohs hardness of around 1.5 and weak forms. It has an imperfect cleavage and its fracture is conchoidal and very brittle. Its specific gravity is measured to be around 3.43. When it reacts with 5 molar potassium hydroxide, alacranite changes color to brown. It changes into brown-gray flakes when it is heated, and boiling it should return its color to brown. However, if it is mixed with hydrochloric acid or nitric acid, it does not show any activity.

Geologic occurrence Alacranite was first found in the Uzon Caldera, Russia. The Uzon caldera is located near the eastern volcanic belt of the Kamchatka peninsula. The area is a basaltic shield volcano with lacustrine sediments, faulting and extension, dome formation and hydrothermal fluids from hot springs within the caldera.http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2004AM/finalprogram/abstract_78738.htm Amounts of realgar, stibnite, cinnabar and pyrite are contained in sediments near active hot springs. Alacranite occurs in the condensation zone of a hydrothermal Hg-Sb-As system in the Uzon caldera. Alacranite could also be found in hydrothermal As-S veins. It was named alacranite after its occurrence in the Alacran mine in Chile due to its similarities in X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples from the Uzon caldera to those in the Alacan mine.

Plot In New York, the East Side youth gang, consisting of: Muggs McGinnis (Leo Gorcey), Danny Collins (Bobby Jordan), Glimpy Stone (Huntz Hall), Scruno (Ernest Morrison), Skinny (Bill Lawrence), and Peewee (David Gorcey), are falsely arrested on the wharf because the truck they are playing in was stolen. They are remanded to Wilton Reform School, where Muggs, the wise-cracking leader of the gang, is dubbed \\"Mr. Wise Guy\\" by the brutal guard Jed Miller (Dick Ryan). Jim Barnes (Jack Mulhall), the new warden, reassures Danny's older brother Bill (Douglas Fowley), who has bad memories of the school from when he served as a guard there, that his testimony describing the place's cruelty eventually resulted in the dismissal of the former warden and the adoption of gentler rules. Bill is given a tour of the school by Barnes's secretary, Ann Mitchell (Joan Barclay), and later takes her out to dinner. That night, while Bill buys cigarettes in a drugstore, escaped convict Luke Manning (Guinn Williams) robs the place and murders the clerk. Manning takes Bill hostage in his car and forces him to lead the police on a chase. Manning escapes when Bill crashes the car, and Bill is later convicted of robbery and murder and sentenced to execution. In the reform school, the boys have been battling with two toughs, \\"Rice Pudding\\" Charlie(Gabriel Dell) and Chalky Jones (Bobby Stone), but when Barnes witnesses Miller encouraging a fistfight, he demands Miller's resignation. Chalky tries to get the kids in trouble by informing Barnes of their plans to run away, but in an effort to establish a code of honor, Barnes punishes Chalky for being an informer. When Muggs and his pals see newsreel footage of a man and woman accepting the winnings from a lottery, they recognize the man as Knobby (Billy Gilbert), the driver of the stolen truck. They link Knobby to Manning based on information given to them by Charlie, who is Manning's nephew. Armed with information that could prove Bill's innocence, the boys escape from the reform school and go to the apartment of Dorothy Melton (Ann Doran), the woman from the newsreel. The kids hold the pair, who had been planning to leave town with the lottery money which actually belongs to Manning, who was afraid of being seen. Manning appears at Dorothy's apartment to demand his money and hits Dorothy for double-crossing him with Knobby. Before the situation can worsen, the police arrive and arrest the criminals. Bill gets a reprieve from the governor, and Ann and the boys see him off as he reports for active military duty. Upon seeing Miller also being drafted, Bill tell his Sergeant to book him up for the guard house before Bill starts to beat up Miller while the boys are watching and cheering.

The only reference to Comosicus is a passage in the writings of the Roman historian Jordanes. Sources Jordanes refers to Burebista as king of Dacia, but then goes on to discuss a high priest called Dicineus who taught the Dacians astronomy and whose wisdom was revered. He then says that \\"after the death of Dicienus, they held Comosicus in almost equal honour, because he was not inferior in knowledge. By reason of his wisdom he was accounted their priest and king, and he judged the people with the greatest uprightness. When he too had departed Coryllus ascended the throne as king of the Goths [Getae] and for forty years ruled his people in Dacia.\\"The Origin and Deeds of the Goths Interpretations \\"Coryllus\\" is widely believed to be identical to Scorilo, but there is no other evidence concerning Comosicus. Jordanes' ambiguity about the status of Dicineus in relation to Burebista possibly arises from the fact that after Burebista's assassination in 44 BC his empire dissolved, with the exception of the nucleus around the OrƒÉ≈ütie Mountains, while the rest divided into various kingdoms.Strabo, Geography, VII:3.5 The concept of a priest-judge may have provided a trans-tribal unity. Louis Marin refers to Dicineus as \\"a sort of double for the king, a double who also stood in for Burebista's successor Comosicus\\", since Comosicus embodies a \\"twin royalty, political and religious\\".Marin, Louis, \\"Utopian Discourse and Narrative of Origins\\", On Representation, Stanford University Press, 2001, pp.109; 415. Since Comosicus's successor Scorilo appears to have come to power sometime between 30 and 40 AD, Comosicus's accession immediately after Burebista would imply an impossibly long reign. Other evidence suggests that a ruler called Cotiso was the dominant power in the late 1st century BC. Ioana A. Oltean argues that Comosicus probably succeeded Cotiso at some point during the campaign of Marcus Vinicius in the Dacian area c.9 BC and ruled until 29 AD. He may have been the first Dacian ruler to combine the positions of priest and king.

He was one of a series of rulers following the Great King Burebista. Duras' immediate successor was Decebalus. Duras and Diurpaneus In Jordanes' king- list Duras succeeds \\"Coryllus\\", a name widely believed to be a corruption of Scorilo. Duras appears to have been ruler of Dacia from around 69.Mihai B«érbulescu, et al, The History of Transylvania: (Until 1541), Romanian Cultural Institute, 2005, p.88. Dacian power was expanding in this period, spreading to Slovakia, Moldavia, and Wallachia. A Dacian raid into the Roman province of Moesia in 69 was pushed back by Licinius Mucianus.Julian Bennett, Trajan: Optimus Princeps: A Life and Times, Routledge, London, 1997, p.86. This may be when Scorilo died, and Duras took over as king. Duras may be identical to the \\"Diurpaneus\\" (or \\"Dorpaneus\\") identified in Roman sources as the Dacian leader who, in the winter of 85, ravaged the southern banks of the Danube, which the Romans defended for many years. Many authors refer to him as \\"Duras-Diurpaneus\\".Hildegard Temporini, Wolfgang Haas, Politische Geschichte: (Provinzen und Randv√∂lker: Griechischer Balkanraum; Kleinasien), Walter de Gruyter, 1979, p.167.Constantin Olteanu, The Romanian armed power concept: a historical approach, Military Publishing House, 1982, p.39.Romania: Pages of History, Volume 4, Agerpres Publishing House, 1979, p.75. Other scholars argue that Duras and Diurpaneus are different individuals, or that Diurpaneus is identical to Decebalus.Ioana A. Oltean, Dacia: Landscape, Colonization and Romanization, Routledge, 2007, p.49-50. War with Rome The Roman governor of Moesia, Oppius Sabinus, raised an army and went to war with the Dacians following the Dacian (Getae) raids into Roman territory.Brian W. Jones, The Emperor Domitian, Routledge, London, 1992, p.138 Diurpaneus and his people defeated and decapitated Oppius Sabinus. When news of the defeat reached Rome, the citizens became fearful that the conquering enemy would invade and spread destruction further into the Empire. Because of this fear, Domitian was obliged to move with his entire army into Illyria and Moesia, the latter of which was now split into Upper and Lower regions. He ordered his commander Cornelius Fuscus to cross the Danube. The Dacians were pushed back across the Danube, but Fuscus suffered a crushing defeat when ambushed by \\"Diurpaneus\\". At this point, the probably elderly Duras seems to have ceded power to Decebalus. Duras' concession of leadership was made peacefully. He continued to live in one of the palaces in Sarmizegetusa while serving as an advisor to Decebalus.

Lovell Federal Health Care Center (FHCC), opened Oct. 1, 2010, and is the United States' first federal health care center that partners the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense into a single, fully integrated federal health care facility. Location The medical center is located in North Chicago, Illinois, and is on the grounds of the former North Chicago VA Medical Center opened on 1 March 1926.FAP-437 (Lake Front Hwy) from I-94 to IL-132, Lake County: Environmental Impact Statement 1985 During the years from 1928 to 1939, an additional six buildings were constructed. In 1939, the hospital was renamed the Downey Veteran Administration Hospital. In 1976 the hospital reverted to its original North Chicago Veterans Affairs Medical Center name. The arrangement incorporates facilities and services from both the former North Chicago VA Medical Center and the former Naval Health Clinic Great Lakes, a part of Naval Station Great Lakes. The center is a system of facilities throughout Northeastern Illinois and Southern Wisconsin that provide medical and dental services to U.S. military veterans, recruits, active duty and eligible beneficiaries. History The merger was accomplished in three phases and is named in honor of Apollo 13 astronaut, Captain James A. Lovell, USN. The Base Realignment and Closure committee's recommendations of 1995, Executive Order 13214 of 2001 (Presidential Task Force to Improve Healthcare Delivery for our Nation's Veterans), the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhancement Services (CARES) study of 2001, the Center for Naval Analysis recommendations of 2002, and Congressional support drove the integration of these two federal departments. The unique partnership began in October 2002 when the Veterans Health Administration and the DoD signed an Executive Council Decision Memo, directing the partnership between the two medical centers. The first phase of the partnership was accomplished in October 2003, when the U.S. Navy shifted their inpatient mental health care to the North Chicago VAMC. Phase II of the partnership included a $13 million VA renovation and modernization project to expand the Emergency and Surgery Departments at the North Chicago VAMC. As part of this phase, the U.S. Navy transferred all operating room, intensive care unit and emergency room services to the VA, including pediatrics. The North Chicago VA Medical Center is the only Veterans Affair] facility to offer pediatrics. In addition, all NHCGL inpatient medical, surgical and services were transferred to the North Chicago VAMC. This phase was completed in June 2006. Phase III included a $130 million DoD construction project to build a new ambulatory care center next to the North Chicago VAMC, renovation of more than of existing space, and a new parking garage and surface parking area. This phase was completed in December 2010. Beneficiaries The design of the medical center allows for medical care for military veterans, active-duty military members, their families, and TRICARE-eligible retirees. Leadership The center is led by a Veterans Affairs Senior Executive Services Officer as Director, and a U.S. Navy Captain as Deputy Director.

The airfield was an all-weather temporary field built by the XII Engineering Command of the United States Army Twelfth Air Force using a graded earth compacted surface with a prefabricated hessian (burlap) surfacing known as PHS. PHS was made of an asphalt-impregnated jute which was rolled out over the compacted surface over a square mesh track (SMT) grid of wire joined in 3-inch squares. Pierced Steel Planking was also used for parking areas and dispersal sites when it was available. Dumps for supplies, bombs, ammunition, gasoline drums, drinking water, and an electrical grid for communications and lighting were also constructed. Tents were used for billeting and support facilities, and an access road was built to connect the airfield facilities with existing roads. The Twelfth's 340th Bombardment Group with their North American B-25 Mitchell medium bombers occupied the airfield on January 2, 1944. When Mount Vesuvius erupted in March 1944, the B-25s were covered with hot ash that burned the fabric control surfaces, glazed, melted, or cracked the Plexiglas, and even tipped some B-25s onto their tails from the weight of the ash and tephra. The eruption destroyed the base and nearly all of the 340th's planes. Estimates vary from 70-90 aircraft.one eye witness noted 88 B-25 Mitchell destroyed (pdf) No lives were lost at Pompeii Airfield and the only casualties in the 340th were a sprained wrist and a few cuts, but the effects of the volcano on the aircraft proved insurmountable despite a major effort by the 12th Air Force to repair and salvage the damaged planes.Casper, Jack and Ver Keljik, Eds., 489th Bomb Squadron, 1947.

He is also a practicing personal injury lawyer. Biography Critzos was the last champion trained by Kim Ki Whang, and was known for his close relationship to Kim (most believe him to be the son Kim never had and that Kim became his surrogate father). Critzos gave the eulogy at Kim's funeral at the request of Kim's wife and daughter. Today, Kim's uniform, training sticks and belt hang in Critzos' private dojo, along with two authentic 19th century Samurai coats of armor and a Samurai sword from the 1800s. Critzos began his training with Kim on September 4, 1973. He continued under Kim's tutelage until September 16, 1993, when Kim died. Presently, he is the coach of the United States Naval Academy Karate-do team, a program he founded in 1992. Further, he is an attorney practicing law in the Washington, D.C. area. He concentrates his practice on serious personal injuries and auto accidents, and is the head of his firm which has two offices in the D.C. area. Competition career During his competition career, Critzos was successful in the traditional martial arts circuit from 1979 to 1985 when he retired amid controversy which was written about by Black Belt Magazine in an article entitled \\"Traditional Controversy\\". The article exposed the widely known, but rarely talked about judging flaws and abuses that existed on the traditional circuit. It also led to changes to curb the abuses. As explained in the article, when faced with the alternatives of maintaining a higher standard or turning a blind eye for the sake of winning, Critzos chose the higher road. Today, he stands by his decision. He came out of retirement in 1989 for a single appearance and won the All American Open in Madison Square Garden for the 5th time as Heavyweight Champion. This was the last year that the All American was held in Madison Square Garden and therefore, Critzos was the last heavyweight champion to win in the Garden. He came out of retirement again in 1994 to win the U.S. Open for the 5th time as Heavyweight/Grand Champion at the age of 39. During his career, he also won the All American Invitational 5 times as Heavyweight Champion/2 time Grand Champion; the All American Open 5 times as Heavyweight Champion; the U.S. Open 5 times as Heavyweight Champion/Grand Champion, the Eastern Regionals twice as Heavyweight Champion/Grand Champion; the North American Championships as Heavyweight Champion/Grand Champion; the Keystone State Championships, Ki Yun Yi's National Championships, and numerous other traditional style contests as Heavyweight Champion/Grand Champion. He did not compete on the American Circuit, but rather confined his career to the Traditional Circuit which he believed had a higher level of competition. He has been inducted into Henry Cho's All American Open Hall of Fame, The United States Naval Academy Karate-do Hall of Fame, The Keystone State Championships Hall of Fame, the Tae Kwon Do Hall of Fame (Outstanding Player & Outstanding Leadership), and the Hellenic Hall of Fame, which is the largest ethnic hall of fame in the world. He was featured on the cover of Official Karate Magazine in which he demonstrated some of his winning techniques. Presently, he is the head instructor of the United States Naval Academy Karate-do Team, which he founded in 1992. He is the only student of Kim that has chosen to progress in belt rank one degree at a time as opposed to jumping degrees in an effort to speed the enhancement of his standing, and is an 8th degree black belt. Further, he has only accepted his advancement from contemporaries of his instructor. His first 5 Black Belt Degrees were awarded by Kim. After Kim's death on September 16, 1993, he was awarded a 6th degree by S. Henry Cho and a 7th degree by Sok Ho Kang. The 7th degree was awarded in April 2009 at an examination that was held at the United States Naval Academy and is the highest rank to ever have been awarded at one of the Military Academies in the United States. This examination was attended by numerous dignitaries from around the country as well as the Commandant of Midshipmen. Grand Master Jon Chung Kim of Allentown, Pennsylvania awarded him an 8th degree in 2014. He has followed in his instructor's footsteps in that he has produced numerous champions, still adheres to the traditional style of focused training and advances the philosophical perspective of the warrior. Education Critzos graduated the University of Maryland in 1980 with a BA in Economics and a BS in Finance. He was a double degree major. He went on to George Washington University and enrolled in the MBA program focusing on Finance. Prior to completing his master's degree, he was accepted into George Mason University's School of Law. He accepted the invitation and graduated with his Juris Doctor degree in 1984.

Too little debt often means foregoing the tax, monitoring, and other advantages of debt, a less expensive form of capital compared to equity. However, too much debt can expose a company to a higher than acceptable riskAggarwal, Raj, Cynthia Harrington, Adam Kobor, and Pamela Peterson Drake, \\"Capital Structure and Leverage\\", Chapter 4 in Michelle R. Clayman, Martin S. Fridson and George H. Troughton, (eds.)

Third World multinational corporations A recent development in the evolution of multinational corporations (MNCs) is that they have started originating in emerging markets. While traditional MNCs from the industrialized countries have used brand names and technology to overcome the liability of foreignness when they invest overseas, there is much interest in understanding how the new MNCs from the emerging economies overcome the liability of being foreign when they invest overseas. Research in this field is important and shows how large companies in emerging markets develop. Especially, how they overcome the liabilities incurred when investing overseas and this research has exposed specific dynamics of these entities.Aggarwal, Raj, \\"Emerging Third World Multinationals: A Case Study of the Foreign Operations of Singapore Firms.\\" Contemporary Southeast Asia 7 (No. 3, December 1985): 193-208.

It is a symbol and an architectural landmark of the city of Vyborg.  History  Vyborg Castle in 14th century The fortress was conceived by Torkel Knutsson, the Lord High Constable of Sweden, who led in the 1290s a crusade to Karelia, the Third Finnish Crusade, which was actually aimed against the Russian state of Novgorod. He chose the location of the new fortress to command the Bay of Vyborg, which was a trading site already used by locals. From the bay, a river leads inland, ultimately connecting the place to several districts, lakes, and indirectly also to rivers going to Lake Ladoga.  1293 construction By request of Torkel Knutsson the main fortress tower was constructed in 1293. According to the Russian military historians the first fortifications consisted of a rectangular donjon type tower and the closed perimeter of a defensive wall, which surrounded the tower. Russian archaeological excavations confirm this fact. The builders constructed the tower from huge boulders, according to traditions of the Italian fortification style then dominant in Europe. The tower was named for a legendary king of Norway, Olaf Sacred, who confirmed Christianity in Scandinavia and was later canonised. The foundation of the tower is made of stone laid without application of a building solution; the tower walls are composed of stones cemented with use of a strong solution and revetted by boulders. The tower is rectangular (size is 15.5 —Ö 15.6 meters), with walls 4.5 meters thick. The tower top has a crenelated wall on which a wooden gallery for defenders was erected. The castle cellar was used for storage of supplies and a prison, while the ground floor was used for living space. The new fortress was repeatedly besieged by the armies of the Novgorod Republic, the most serious siege occurring in 1322. In this siege the most advanced artillery of the age was used: stone fougasse, including possibly the heavy arbalest. As a result of excavation, it has been discovered that wooden structures were once attached to the walls of the stone structure. Researchers have discovered traces burnt down in 14th century of a workshop processing bone and sheet bronze. They cannot, however, conclude with confidence whether or not a foundry works was present. In 1403 Vyborg received the official status of a city. Most likely at the beginning of 15th century the coast was connected with the lock by a bateau bridge named Fortress bridge. Vyborg Castle in 15th century Before attaining the royal throne of Sweden, Karl Knutsson (Bonde) took residence in Vyborg in 1442 and began strengthening and expanding the castle. He constructed new premises and strengthened the castle with new walls and towers, arranging it on the model of the European cities of that time. The tower of St. Olav received one more circle around it, connecting it with a group of buildings with which it was brought under a single roof in 1442‚Äì1448.  Constructions of later time  In the middle of 16th century Swedish king Gustav Vasa reconstructed and strengthened a fortress for expansion of borders of the state on the east. In 1525 the German count Johan von Hoya, brother-in-law of Gustav Vasa, became deputy of the castle. Instead of taking actions to strengthen the castle as a military fortress he began to arrange balls and tournaments which demanded considerable expenses. King Gustav sent an army to conquer Vyborg and count Johan von Hoya fled to L√ºbeck. In 1555 when Gustav Vasa was preparing for his next war with Russia he visited Vyborg and spent some time living in the castle. He noted its shabby condition and mentioned in a letter ¬´those lacks and errors¬ª which he has seen in Finland. flagstaff in 1827 The king considered it a priority to carry out an urgent reconstruction of the defensive works both in the castle and in the city. Between 1556 and 1560 building was directed by deputy Klas Kristersson Horn. During this reconstruction Vyborg castle took the general form that it has retained to this day, but Horn did not have time to finish the defensive works and Tower of St. Olav was finally reconstructed by his son, Eric XIV. In 1561‚Äì1564 the top part of the quadrangular tower was disassembled, and three floors re- erected in the form of an octangle. The tower was built of brick with a roof covered in lead specially brought from Stockholm. Over an entry gate, by order of the king, were placed the arms ¬´three crowns¬ª; in the tower were placed artillery of large calibre; and in a cellar was installed a warehouse for kernels. Destructions of a tower after a fire 1834. The image is dated 1839 During the Great Northern War Russian armies under Peter I took all the fortresses of Karelia and Ingria: in 1703‚Äì1704 ‚Äì Nyenschantz, Jama, Koporye, Noteburg, and Ivangorod. Vyborg fell on June, 13th 1710. Destructions of a tower after a fire 1856. The image is dated 1880 The Medieval interiors of the castle remained up to the middle of 19th century, but the most part have been destroyed by fire. In 1834 lightning struck a flagstaff of the tower, sparking a fire that burnt down the wooden support beams; the tower was restored in 1844. From during celebrations on the occasion of opening of Saimaa Canal fireworks were arranged. These ignited the dome of the tower and from there the fire was thrown down on buildings standing nearby, consuming all of Vyborg Castle in flames. The fire consumed the wooden buildings abutting the Tower of St. Olav, and only the Commandant's house and buildings of the Forward courtyard escaped. Tower restoration was undertaken by the engineer corps under Colonel E. Lezedov on the orders of Russian Military Office in 1891‚Äì1894. The tower gate was given a granite stoop, and the internal premises were built anew, including the addition of a metal ladder mounted to the top part of the tower leading up to a viewing platform. On postcard the beginnings 20th century From May 1, 1913 through August 6, 1914 Nikolay Suhomlin supervised engineering and civil work on the fortress. In the 1920s Finnish authorities again repaired the tower and partially opened it to the public, but it remained a military facility.  Current state  Following the Second World War the territory on which the tower is built passed under the jurisdiction of Soviet Union. The castle lagged behind as a military facility and after 1964 it was transferred to the Vyborg state museum of local lore. In the castle, work continues on the maintenance and safety of the monument, and now Vyborg Castle is seen as a unique monument of West European military architecture that was shaped by developments from the 13th through 19th centuries. Since 2000 the museum has been known as the State museum ¬´Vyborg Castle¬ª. It is now due for major restoration. Artem Novikov, chairman of the Russian Association of restorers, plans to begin restoration in 2010‚Äì2012.

The whole council was up for election and the Conservative party gained overall control of the council from no overall control. Campaign The election was seen as being a straight fight between the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives. Before the election the Conservatives were optimistic that Torbay would be one of the councils that they would gain in the 2000 local elections and they targeted it as a council that they had to win. This emphasis on the council included two visits by William Hague the Conservative party leader. Pre-election the Liberal Democrats only had control of the council based on the casting vote of the mayor, while the Conservatives needed 5 gains to take control. Conservative leaflets led with the theme of \\"Keep the Pound\\" but locally they accused the Liberal Democrat administration of incompetence and attacked the 22% Council Tax rise over the previous two years. The Liberal Democrats were also attacked over the council's decision to not put on any floral displays in 1999 to save money, which was seen as being an error for an area dependent on tourism. However the Liberal Democrats accused the Conservatives of playing on voters fears about asylum seekers being housed in the area. Election result The results saw the Conservatives win 32 of the 36 seats on the council, with the Liberal Democrats reduced to just 4 seats after having run the council since 1991. Liberal Democrat losses included the leader of the council, Anne Williams, and the mayor, John Turner. The Labour party lost both their seats on the council blaming a poor turnout at 33% and the recent rise of only 75 pence in the state pension for their defeat. Following the election William Hague flew to Torbay to celebrate the results and described them as having begun the revival of the party. The result was seen as being an omen for the next general election, where the sitting Liberal Democrat member of parliament Adrian Sanders only had a majority of 12 over the Conservatives. However the 2001 general election would see the Liberal Democrats hold the parliamentary constituency with an increased majority.

Kirch Media went bankrupt in 2002 and Discovery Communications subsequently became the sole owner of the channel. The channel was later joined by sister channel with the launch on Animal Planet in 2004, Discovery Geschichte in 2005 and Discovery HD in 2006. Discovery Channel was exclusively available through Premiere until 2009, when a new agreement was entered between Premiere and Discovery.

Spin-offs/Sequels The success of the Archie Marries Veronica/Archie Marries Betty storyline led to the comic series, Life with Archie: The Married Life, a similar storyline called \\"Archie Marries Valerie\\", depicting Archie marrying Valerie from Josie and the Pussycats, shown in Archie #631-634, and a six issue mini-series for the storylines tenth anniversary. Life with Archie: The Married Life Life with Archie: The Married Life was based on the Archie Marries Veronica/Archie Marries Betty storyline, but was not a direct continuation on it. The series lasted from 2010 to 2014, ending with 37 issues. Issues 1-35 contained two stories each, the first story was Archie Marries Veronica and the second one was Archie Marries Betty. The last two issues, on the other hand, were structured differently. Instead of having two stories both issues had one, but were twice as long as the others. Also, neither issue made it clear whether Archie was married to Betty or Veronica. Together both issues make up The Death of Archie storyline. Archie Marries Valerie The \\"Archie Marries Valerie\\" storyline was similar to the Archie Marries Veronica/Archie Marries Betty storyline, but had some major differences. For instance, Valerie was the one who walked up Memory Lane instead of Archie and she could see the future in portals rather than actually experiencing it. She sees a future in where she marries Archie, then they both quit their respective bands due to their touring schedules keeping them apart, and later have a little girl named Star who is gifted with her parents' musical talent. However, she decides to stop watching it after she sees that they cannot get a moment's peace due to Star becoming an object of attention for the media. Then she witness glimpses of other futures and in each one Archie is married to a different woman. Some of these futures had Archie being married to Cheryl Blossom, Sabrina Spellman, and even Josie. Seeing these futures Valerie runs out of Memory Lane and happily reunites with Archie.Issues no. 631-634, March- June 2012 Archie: The Married Life 10th Anniversary On February 28, 2019 it was announced that a six issue mini-series would be released to celebrate the storylines 10th anniversary.https://www.previewsworld.com/Article/226831-Archie-To- Revisit-10th-Anniversary-of-Archies-Wedding-With-Archie-The-Married-Life The mini-series focuses on Archie's marriage to Veronica and Betty ten years later.

Chiikuhane or Subiya language is classified under Zone K.40 of Bantu languages; a language of northern Botswana, Caprivi Strip, Namibia and Western Zambia up to Victoria Falls (Guthrie, 1967-1971).Baumbach (1997:337) classified it as a \\"Zone k42 Bantu language\\". Torrend (1931), Shamukuni (1972), and Colson (1996) classified Chiikuhane language under the Bantu Botatwe group; indicating that the language is related to Western Tonga in Zambia and one of the earliest languages of the Zambezi believed to have arrived around Iron Age era. Bantu Botatwe share the distinctive root ‚Äì tatwe for three (Bostoen, 2009). They include Subiya, Tonga, Toka, Leya, Fwe, Twa, Shanjo, Totela, Ila and Lenje (Bostoen, 2009). In the Caprivi, Subiya has been classified together with Fwe, Totela and Mbalangwe as one group of languages (Elderkin, 1998). Subiya language has a complete grammar book and a textbook containing folklore, superstitions and songs written in French and Subiya in 1896 and 1899 respectively, by the French Missionary Edouard Jacottet. Subiya language also has a complete grammatical sketch written in English and Subiya in the 1960s by Daniel Matengu Shamukuni. Introduction Subiya is the dominant language of south-west Zambezia, along a portion of the Zambezi river south of Barotseland, and in the lands lying between the Chobe-Linyanti river which is also known as the Ikuhane river (Bantu Language Classification. Part 3; Arnot, 1882). The Canada Council Special Grant for Linguistics (1968) refers to Subiya as the people found west of Victoria Falls. Subiya is one of the most ancient of Bantu languages, more so than Tonga (Bantu Language Classification. Part3). The name Veekuhane has two meanings; one being the followers of Chief Ikuhane, son of Iteenge and second known chief of the Subiya (Masule, 1982; Ramsay, Morton & Mgadla, 1996; Ramsay, 2002; Ndana 2011). The other meaning of Veekuhane is that it refers to the people who live along the Ikuhane (Chobe) river (Shamukuni, 1972; Matengu, 1982). From Mbalakalungu (Parakarungu) to Ngoma Gate, the river is known as Iteenge (Roodt,2004). Pretorius (1975) claims that the Subiya were originally called Batwa -a collection of small clans who lived under autonomous headmen on the islands of the Kafue flood plains. It is likely that it was while at Kafue flood plains in the early or around 15th century that they started to identify themselves as a tribe, probably under the first chief Muniteenge Iteenge (Masule, 1995). Kruger (1984), as cited by Likando (n.d.) and Ndana (2011), claim that the Subiya reached the Upper Zambezi plains around 1440, whereas Masule (1995) suggests that they reached the Zambezi Valley in 1575 and settled at Ilulire near Senanga now in the Western Province of Zambia. Tlou& Campbell (1983) and McIntyre (2007) posit that the Subiya had established a powerful state of Iteenge by 1600 at Luchiindo on the Chobe River, westwards towards the Okavango Delta. Around this period the Bayei lived in the Okavango Delta where they were later joined by the Hambukushu who were fleeing the Lozi in Katima Mulilo and settled the upper reaches of the Okavango Delta. According to Pretorius, the Batwa were a collection of groups such as Fwe, Leya and Toka. However, this school of thought that Basubiya were called Batwa or are an offspring of the Batwa is doubtful. The Batwa are largely accepted as a San group or some ethnicities related to the Pigmies of the Congo forest. There are three theories that attempt to explain the origin of the name Subiya. According to Pretorius (1975), the name Subiya was given to Veekuhane in 1700 by the invading Aluyi (Lozi proper) under Chief Mwanambinyi. Subiya is said to be derived from the Aluyi word ‚Äòsubalala‚Äô which means to ‚Äòpush a kingdom‚Äô because the Veekuhane were active in governing and running the Aluyi (Lozi) kingdom. It was derived from the Aluyi (Lozi) phrase ‚Äòsubiyanokusubalalaumulonga‚Äô meaning ‚Äòthe Subiya are trying to push the kingdom‚Äô (Pretorius, 1975). Shamukuni (1972) claims that the name Subiya was derived from ‚ÄòSubira‚Äô which referred to their brownish complexion. The name was given to them by neighbouring tribes as a nickname. According to Samunzala (2003) the Tonga particularly addressed the Subiya as \\"uwe u musubila\\" meaning you light skinned one. This version is supported by Flint (2003), who revealed that Lozi men particularly valued Subiya women for their lighter skins and general good looks. Masule (1995) agrees with this version, but claims that the Subiya appeared light in complexion (subira) because they smeared their skins with red-brownish ochre. The Subiya lived between the confluence of the Chobe and the Zambezi rivers, along the northern banks of the Zambezi as far north as Nakabuunze (Katima-Mulilo) and called this land Iteenge (Shamukuni, 1972; Pretorius, 1975; Masule, 1995; Tlou and Campbell, 1983; Ramsay, 2002). The Subiya were politically and militarily strong, with a recognized line of chiefs dating back two and a half centuries and is one of the tribes of the Zambezi to have been mentioned by the early explorers and missionaries during the 18th century (Shamukuni, 1972; Pretorius, 1975; Ramsden, 1977; Matengu, 1995; Flint, 2003). Since the advent of colonialism and attainment of independence, the Subiya tribe has been split into three regions; the Subiya of Chikuzu region (Mwandi/Sesheke of Western Province, Zambia); Iteenge-Mukulu (Caprivi Strip, Namibia) and Iteenge-Muniini (Chobe District, Botswana) (Arnot, 1882; Shamukuni, 1972; Matengu, 1995, Ramsay, 2002). Definition of Terms *Chobe is a Subiya word that appears in Subiya folklore written in 1896 which implies incest or bad omen (malweeza) because of an incest incident that occurred along a bushy section of the river. *Munitenge is the Subiya word for King/Chief/Kgosi *Moolyi is the Subiya word for Queen *Mukwaye is the Subiya name for a princess *Iteenge is the Subiya name for land around the Zambezi-Chobe basin; which includes Chobe District in Botswana, Caprivi Strip in Namibia and Sesheke District of Zambia. *Ikuhane is the Subiya name for the Chobe River. *Lyaambayi is the Subiya name for the Zambezi River. *Simwiine is a subiya name for any chief Political Structure According to Ndana (2011: 3) like other African groups, Veekuhane have clear political, social and economic structures/organisation. A hierarchical political structure is discernible even today, albeit in a more diluted form due to the influence of modern political organisation. Matengu Masule, an oral historian claims that the Veekuhane ruling \\"cabinet\\" (Kaziva ka Itenge) had the Muniteenge (king) or simwine (chief) as its political figurehead and supported by three main branches: the Ngambela (the prime minister/advisor) responsible for administration of justice; the Inkazaana (female royalists) responsible for security and the Insuzuzu (the army commander) responsible for defence. Under each of these major branches there fell other key players. Below the army commander was the Namaya (female spy), Shamunziriri (the magician or medicine men) and the Mukuunkula-we-Nkoondo (the army). The advisor was assisted by the Manduna (councillors) and the Ichiimbizo/kapaswa/kapaso (the chief's messengers). The female royalists were assisted by the Muauumbe (security ladies) and the Mabukweenda (male strangers). Social Organization The social and economic organisations of the Veekuhane are closely associated with the riverine environment to which they have adapted through centuries of their evolution as a people. The riverine environment is a source of food, building material, religious beliefs/practices, spirituality, and identity. It is difficult to imagine the Veekuhane outside the riverine environment. They would remark rhetorically in the face of possible relocations in times of increased water volumes, \\"hozwisa inswi mu meenzi, mpohona chi ihala?\\" (If you take fish out of water, can it survive?). Like in other human societies, among the Veekuhane, the family is the smallest social organisation and the foundation for the larger community. At the head of the family is generally the eldest male (usually the grandfather) with the youngest child occupying the very lowest rank in the family. A group of related families living closer to one another forms a ward. Relation could be a result of birth, marriage, adoption or immigration. Marriage is central among Veekuhane as a means of cementing and extending family relations. A married woman is expected to relocate to join her in-laws, although as Shamukuni observes, a groom could under certain circumstances live with his in-laws permanently (1972:170). A married couple is expected to have their irapa, a Chiikuhane word that has both literal and metaphorical meanings for home, enclosure and family respectively. How the couple manages its irapa, ensures a particular status in society. Albeit waning in modern times, polygamy is prevalent among Veekuhane. Religious Beliefs While it is difficult to establish the institutional religion of Veekuhane, it is possible to note that they have always believed in the existence of a supreme being (Ireeza) whose transcendence could only be bridged by routing their requests through intermediaries known as vazimu (ancestors/gods). Several praise epithets from a common Subiya prayer are used to denote the Supreme Being: Shandandulu(All knowing); Muvuumbi (Creator); Sha-Mukuungayokunganyairoongo (the moulder who puts together clay);Shamanganga (The Healer / The Great Doctor) to mention only these. To Veekuhane, belief and veneration of Ireeza did not contradict the use of traditional medicine. Rather, they saw the constructive utilization of flora for medicinal purposes as sanctioned by the Creator. Although research needs to be carried out on Veekuhane sacred sites, there is nevertheless the famous Chidino cha Luchiindo (the Shrine of Luchiindo) where the Muniteenges were sent to be invested in ruler-ship matters and could go to consult their ancestors and seek guidance on chieftain matters. It is in such shrines where rain-making ceremonies are conducted. Stories about that voices of people singing and talking could be heard when at Luchiindo. Due to its sacred nature, entry to this only surviving shrine is restricted, with possibilities of no return. Although still un-researched, water is in my opinion a major symbol of Ikuhane spirituality. Given the people's adaptation to and comfort with water and the flood plains, and the regular intervals with which floods occur, it is my belief that water as a source of life and as life itself, lies at the very core of Subiya spirituality. Economy Special dish of Masiko which is a rare cuisine of the Subiya people who live in the northern part of Botswana. According to Shamukuni, Veekuhane have a diverse economy that includes: pottery, blacksmith, basketry, hunting, carving and agriculture. As agriculturalists, they continue to till the land, rear animals predominantly cattle and chicken, and few sheep, goats, donkeys and horses. Cattle are a source of draught power, protein in the form of milk and meat, and symbol of social status as the more cattle one has the more power s/he commanded in society. Further, cattle and so are other edible domestic animals play significant religious functions as in the case of healing and cleansing ceremonies. Oral traditions hold that prior to the advent of coffins, cattle skins were used to wrap the deceased prior to interment. Veekuhane are also a fishing people of repute who have perfected their fishing skills over the many centuries of their evolution. Before the adoption of the modern fishing nets, they employed traditionally crafted nets known as lukuku which when cast in specific fishing areas would allow fish to get in but deny them exit. The danger with this technology was that it trapped unintended victims such as pythons which when caught, were nevertheless put to good use for human consumption and as sources of necessary healing oil to cure mild deafness as well as being ointment which when applied on one's body scarred away snakes. Other than traps, fish was also killed using spears. Fish remains to date an important part of Ikuhane diet not only as a source of protein but also as a source of intelligence. There is a belief among the people that one who eats fish and its head in particular, performs well in school. Arts and culture Like all other languages, Chikuhane has its own linguistic and philosophical intricacies evident in the different verbal arts the speakers produce. In an exploratory survey Ndana (1999) has demonstrated that Chikuhane has a corpus of oral literature which he feels deserves preservation in order to safe-guard the verbal artistry it contains. Such verbal compositions include and not limited to fables, poetry, songs, and witticisms. There is, however, a great decline in the knowledge of both the arts and culture among young people. This is probably attributed to urban life, where young Subiyas are influenced by the external cultures and exposed to various forms of art that do not originate from Subiyas.

Subiya Kings and Queens Royal Lineage (edited by Mubiana Katukula)  1.Iteenge (1440s/1570s) He was the first known chief of the tribe. He is believed to have led the migration from the North and settled at Kafue floodplains. The Zambezi ‚ÄìChobe basin is known as Iteenge in Subiya after him. 2.Ikuhane (1575 - 1600) He was the son of Iteenge and the second chief of the tribe. He migrated from the Kafue floodplains and settled along the Zambezi valley in the present day Zambia. He later moved southwards and settled along the Chobe River which is called Ikuhane in Subiya. 3.Lilundu - Lituu (1640 ‚Äì 1665) He succeeded his father Chief Ikuhane. He migrated from the Chobe River southwards and settled at Mababe (Mavava) south of Savuti (Savuta) in present-day Botswana. 4.Queen Mwale Ikuhane(1665 ‚Äì 1700) She was the first queen to rule the Subiya tribe. She succeeded her brother Lilundu - Lituu and settled at Goha Hills north of Savuti in present Botswana and the place came to be known as Ngulwa-Mwaale. 5.Cheete (1700s) He ruled over a section of the Subiya who fled Lozi attacks and lived in Tokaland near Livingstone, Zambia. 6.Sikute (1700s) Sikute led a section of the Subiya from the western tips of Iteenge today known as Linyanti swamps to the Chungwe- namutitima (Victoria Falls). There he joined the Leya and married one of their women. Sikute carried with him the Subiya royal drums known as the Makuwakuwa which had mystical powers. Sikute was also believed to have a pot of medicine which when opened released an epidemic in an area. Due to Sikute's migration the Subiya became one of the tribes of the Victoria Falls together with the Leya and the Toka. It is believed that when Chief Mukuni of the Leya defeated the Subiya of Sikute and captured them together with their royal drums, the magical drums escaped into the Zambezi and settled at the bottom where their sound continued to be heard for many years afterwards. 7.Saanjo(1700s) He was also called Singongi. He succeeded Queen Mwaale at Goha Hills (Ngulwa-Mwaale) in Chobe District, Botswana. Saanjo had three children with his wife Chaaze, two boys called Mafwira I and Nsundano I and their sister Mwaale. 8.Mafwira I (1700s) He was the eldest son of Chief Saanjo with his wife Chaaze. He led the Subiya migration from Goha Hills back to the Ikuhane (Chobe) River and settled at Kavimba in the present Chobe enclave, Botswana. His rule was unpopular and soon deposed and replaced by his younger brother, Nsundano I. 9.Nsundano I (1700s -1750) He was also called Lyiverenge. He migrated northwards from Kavimba and established his headquarters at Luchindo in the present Caprivi Strip, Namibia, opposite Ngoma border post. Today Luchindo is a shrine (Chidino) of all the Basubiya tribe. 10.Liswani I (1830-1845) He was the son of Princess Mwaale, the daughter of Chief Saanjo and sister to Mafwira I and Nsundano I. His father was Sikarumbu, who was also known as Raliswani. He succeeded Nsundano I; his maternal uncle. He was married to Malyangala with whom he had a son named Maiba I. He had his headquarters at Isuswa in the modern Caprivi Strip, Namibia. He rescued Sekgoma I, son of Kgari of Bamangwato and Letsholathebe, son of Moremi I of Batawana from Sebitwane at Kazungula. 11.Nkonkwena I (1845-1876) He was known by his nickname ‚ÄòMutolalizuki‚Äô. He was the son of Princess Nsazwe, the elder sister of Chief Liswani I. His father was Kabende. Chief Nkonkwena had three sisters namely, Ntolwa, Mpambo and Chire. Chief Nkonkwena I was a polygamist. His wives were Nkungano and Ikume. Ikume begot Mafwira II, the chief of the Subiya of Gumare in north-west Botswana and his brother Nsundano. Ikume gave birth to one son called Sinvula. He established his headquarters at Impalila Island in the modern Caprivi Strip, Namibia. He fled from Barotse to seek refuge in Khamas‚Äôs land where he died at Rakops in 1878. 12.Queen Ntolwa (1876-1900) She was the younger sister of Nkonkwena I and the second queen to rule the Subiya. She was married toMbanga and had four sons named Chombo, Mwampole, Kasaila and Mwanamwali. She built her royal palace at Isuswa in the present day Caprivi Strip, Namibia. She succeeded her brother Chief Nkonkwena I, after the latter feared the Lozi and fled to Boteti. 13.Mwanamwale I (1876) He was the son of Queen Ntolwa with her husband Mbanga. He and a section of Subiya men were following his fleeing uncle Nkonkwena, who was heading for Boteti. They went as far as Sitengu Pan, about twenty-eight miles south of Kasane but failed to catch him up. They then returned to Impalila Island, crossed the Zambezi and established his leadership at Sesheke in Zambia. 14.Mwanamwale II He succeeded MwanamwaleI; his father at Sesheke, Zambia. His real name was Munikuunku but he was famously known by his nickname Inguu; meaning the shephard. 15.Kabuku (August 1886) He was installed Subiya chief at Sesheke now in the Western Province of Zambia. In Sesheke the Subiya chief's title is Mwanamwale as opposed to Muniteenge or Moraliswani used in Caprivi Strip and Chobe District. He probably succeeded Mwanamwale II. 16.Maiba I (1900 ‚Äì 1909) He was the only son of Liswani I. He fled to Boteti under the guidance of his cousin Nkonkwena I. He returned from Boteti in the 1900 and succeeded Queen Ntoolwa at Isuswa as the Subiya Chief in Caprivi Strip, Namibia. By now Subiya chieftainship was divided along colonial lines of Northern Rhodesia, South West Africa, Namibia and Bechuanaland Protectorate. 17\\\\. Chika II (1901-1927). He was also called Chika Chika.He was the son of a commoner Chika and Malyangala. Chika was a hunter from Zambia who came to live among Basubia. He died leaving his wife, Malyangala, pregnant. At the time Muniteenge Liswani I married Malyangala while she was still pregnant. Malyangala gave birth to a boy, and Liswani I gave him the name of Chika, his real father. Chika Chika was among the Basubiya who fled from Mpalila Islands to Rakops under the leadership of Nkonkwena I in 1876.He returned from Rakops in 1900 and settled briefly among a section of Basubiya at Mababe (Mavava).In 1901 he was installed regent of Basubiya at Munga west of Kavimba on behalf of the young Prince Sinvula Nkonkwena who was then living among the Basubiya of Livingstone in the former Northern Rhodesia (toady's Zambia) 18.Chika Matondo Tongo(1909 ‚Äì 1927) and 1937 - 1945 He was a regent acting for the young Liswaninyana. Liswaninyana was the eldest son of Chief Maiba I and Chika-Matondo Tongo was appointed regent by virtue of marriage to Mulela; who was Liswaninyana's maternal aunt. He established his headquarters at Schuckmannsburg (Luhonono) in Eastern Caprivi, Namibia. 19.Liswaninyana (1927-1937) He was the eldest son of Maiba I with his wife Kahundu. He established his royal headquarters at Kasika Village in the modern Caprivi Strip, Namibia opposite Chiduudu (Sedudu Island). He died shortly after assuming the throne and Chika Matondo continued to act on the throne till 1945. 20.Sinvula Nkonkwena (1928-1968) He was born in Khama's land; Tsienyane at Rokops. He was the son of Chief Nkonkwena I with his wife Ikume. He established his headquarters at Munga Village north-west of Kavimba, Chobe District, Botswana. His brothers were Mafwira II and Nsundano. 21.Sinvula Maiba (1945-1965) He was the son of Maiba I and also the younger brother of Liswaninyana. His home village was Mahundu in the present day Eastern Caprivi Strip, Namibia. He built his headquarters at Kabbe Village in the present Eastern Caprivi Strip, Namibia. 22.Mutwa Liswani II (1965-1996) He was the second eldest son of Sinvula Maiba above. His elder brother was Shakufweba. He established his royal headquarters at Vwikalo (Bukalo) in the present day Caprivi Strip, Namibia. 23.Maiba II Sinvula (1968-to date) He is the son of Sinvula Nkonkwena and also the grandson of Nkonkwena I. He succeeded his aged father and set his headquarters at Kavimba Village, Chobe District, Botswana. 24.Maiba Liswani III (1996 ‚Äìto date). He is the youngest son of Sinvula Maiba. He succeeded his elder brother Mutwa Liswani II who died in 1996. He has also maintained the headquarters placed at Bukalo, Caprivi Strip, Namibia by his late brother. Edited by Mubiana Kelvin Katukula Conclusion The Basubiya kingdom of Iteenge collapsed in 1876 when Nkonkwena I feared the Barotse and fled to Khama's country in Boteti. Followers of Nkonkwena still reside at Rakops, Central District of Botswana even to date. The Basubiya dynasty in Sesheke, Mwandi District of Zambia under the Mwanamwales had since crumbled and has come under the rule of the Litunga (King) of Barotseland of Western Province of Zambia. The Subiya dynasties of Chobe District and Caprivi Strip are recognized chiefs on both sides of the Chobe River. It has been suggested from oral traditions that there was a Subiya chief by the name Majira but there is no evidence that suggests the era of his reign. Mafwira II; son of Nkonkwena broke away from his father in Rakops with his followers in 1878 and settled at Tlhale near Gumare in the North-Western Botswana also known as Ngamiland. His followers can still be found today at BoSubiya Ward of Gumare. In August, 1886, Mwanamwale Kabuku was installed as the Subiya chief at Sesheke now Western Province of Zambia. In 1901, Chika Chika who was also known as Chika II became the Regent of the Subiya of Bechuanaland at Munga in Chobe; acting for the young Prince Sinvula Nkonkwena. References 1\\\\. Arnot, T, S.

Due to the complexity of biological systems simplified models are often used, which should only be as complex as necessary. The aim of biosimulations is model- based prediction of the behaviour and the dynamics of biological systems e.g. the response of an organ or a single cell towards a chemical. However the quality of model-based predictions strongly depends on the quality of the model, which in turn is defined by the quality of the data and the profoundness of the knowledge. Pharmacy Biosimulation is becoming increasingly important for drug development.M. Bertau, E. Mosekilde, H.V. Westerhoff (Edts.): Biosimulation in Drug Development. 1st Edition Wiley-VCH, Weinheim 2008 Since on average only 11% of all drug candidates are approved,I. Kola, J. Landis: Can the pharmaceutical industry reduce attrition rates? In:Nat.Rev.Drug Discov. Nr. 3, 2004, S.711-715 it is anticipated that biosimulation may be the tool to predict whether a candidate drug will fail in the development process e.g. in clinical trials due to adverse side effects, bad pharmacokinetics or even toxicity. The early prediction if a drug will fail in animals or humans would be a key to reduce both drug development costs and the amount of required animal experiments and clinical trials. The latter is also in line with the so-called \\"3Rs\\" which refer to the principle of reduction and replacement of animal experiments as well as to the refinement of the methodology in cases where animal tests are still necessary.J. Richmond: The 3Rs - Past, Present and Future. In:Scand.J.Lab.Anim.Sci Vol. 2(27), 2000, S. 84-92 In a future scenario, biosimulation would change the way substances are tested, in which in vivo and in vitro tests are substituted by tests in silico.Models that take drugs. In:The Economist (US) June 11, 2005 Due to the importance of biosimulation in drug development a number of research projects exist which aim for simulating metabolism, toxicity, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetics of a drug candidate. Some of the research projects are listed below: * BioSim project; funded by the 6th frame program of the European Union * NSR Physiome Project * Hepatosys Moreover, a few software tools already exist, which aim for predicting the toxicity of a substance or even try to simulate the virtual patient (Entelos).

He sat in the Irish House of Commons, and was made Lord President of Munster in Ireland. Family He was the fifth son of Henry Norris, 1st Baron Norreys, of Rycote House and Wytham Abbey in Oxfordshire (the latter previously in Berkshire), and his wife, Margery, the youngest daughter of John Williams, 1st Baron Williams of Thame. He matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1571, aged 15, graduating Bachelor of Arts on 6 April 1576. Sir John Norris, and Sir Edward Norris were his brothers. He married Bridget, daughter of Sir William Kingsmill of Sydmonton in Hampshire, by whom he had one daughter, Elizabeth, his sole heiress, who married Sir John Jephson of Froyle in Hampshire. Their son William Jephson sat in the Long Parliament. Norreys built Mallow Castle, which remained in his daughter's family until the 1980s. Mallow Castle Military career In December 1579, he became, through the death of his eldest brother, William, and the influence of Sir William Pelham, captain of a troop of horse in Ireland. He took an active part in the following year in the campaign against Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond; but during the absence of Sir Nicholas Malby, Lord President of Connaught, in the winter of 1580‚Äì81, he acted as governor of that province, and pursued the Burkes and other disturbers of the peace. In 1581‚Äì82 he was occupied, apparently between Clonmel and Kilmallock, in watching the movements of the Earl of Desmond, and on the retirement, of Captain John Zouche in August 1582, on account of ill- health, he became colonel of the forces in Munster. He compelled the Earl of Desmond to abandon the siege of Dingle, but he lacked the resources to do more. In consequence of the appointment of Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormond as governor of Munster, Norris was able, early in 1583, to pay a brief visit to England. On his return he found employment in Ulster in settling a dispute between Hugh Oge O'Neill and Shane MacBrian O'Neill as to the possession of the castle of Edendougher (Shane's Castle), which he handed over to the latter as captain of Lower Clandeboye. He was commended by Lords-justices Adam Loftus and Henry Wallop. In the autumn of 1584 he took part in Sir John Perrot's expedition against the Scots in Antrim, and in scouring the woods of Glenconkein in search of Sorley Boy MacDonnell he was wounded in the knee with an arrow. He returned to Munster, and in 1585‚Äì86 represented Limerick in Parliament. In December 1585 he was appointed vice-president of Munster during the absence in the Low Countries of his brother John. It was a precarious situation. Under instructions from England, Norris, in March 1587, arrested James Fitzedmund Fitzgerald, seneschal of Imokilly, Patrick Condon, and others, whose loyalty was at least doubtful. The marriage of Ellen, daughter and sole heiress of Donald McCarthy, 1st Earl of Clancare, was a politically sensitive topic and Norris himself rejected her as his bride. In June 1588 the matter became serious, when Florence MacCarthy married her and so united in himself the two main branches of the clan Carthy. Norris arrested Florence, but was induced to believe that he had acted innocently. In December he was knighted by Sir William Fitzwilliam; and Sir John Popham having consented to resign his seignory in the plantation of Munster, Norris obtained a grant of six thousand acres (24 km¬≤) in and about Mallow. The Spanish Armada was over but the air was still full of rumours of invasion, and in 1589‚Äì90 Norris was engaged with Edmund Yorke, an engineer who had been sent over from England expressly for the purpose, in strengthening the fortifications of Limerick, Waterford, and Duncannon. He lacked cash, and a detachment at Limerick in May 1590 mutinied, and marched to Dublin. The ringleaders were punished by Sir William Fitzwilliam. Norris was in the winter of 1592‚Äì93 in England to report on the Munster plantation; he returned to Ireland about May 1593. With the exception of disturbances over the summer by Donnogh MacCarthy, the Earl of Clancare's bastard son, the province was peaceful. On 10 August 1594 Norris went to Dublin to meet the new lord-deputy, Sir William Russell, whom he attended in his progress through Ulster. In the following year he served under his brother, Sir John Norris, against the Earl of Tyrone, and was wounded in the thigh in the engagement that took place halfway between Newry and Armagh on 4 September. He assisted Sir John Norris as commissioner for the pacification of Connaught in June 1596; but in August he was engaged in repelling an incursion of the MacSheehys and O'Briens into Munster. He hanged ninety of them within ten days; but they proved tenacious. He again in September accompanied Sir John Norris into Connaught. Sir Richard Bingham's disgrace had temporarily deprived the province of its governor, and he was appointed by his brother provisional president of Connaught, on Sir Geoffrey Fenton's. The arrival shortly afterwards of the new president, Sir Conyers Clifford, saw him return to Munster, and in June 1597 he had pacified it. On the death of Sir John Norris in that year he succeeded him on 20 September as Lord President of Munster. Thomas Burgh, 3rd Baron Burgh died also, and Norris was on 29 October elected by the council, as lord justice of Ireland. The election was not confirmed by Elizabeth, on the ground that his presence was specially required in Munster. Accordingly, Loftus and Gardiner having been appointed lords justices, Norris returned to Munster on 29 November. Later years and death On the general insurrection of the Irish after the Battle of the Yellow Ford, on 14 August 1598, and the irruption into Munster of the Leinster Irish, under Owny MacRory O'More, Norris concentrated his forces in the neighbourhood of Mallow; but, not feeling sufficiently strong to encounter Owny MacRory, he withdrew to Cork. He was blamed for his retreat, for example in a letter of John Chamberlain on 22 November 1598. His situation deteriorated, but towards the end of December, he managed, though fiercely attacked by William Burke, to relieve Kilmallock. But a second expedition on 27 March 1599 only resulted in the capture of Carriglea Castle, and on 4 April he returned to Cork, skirmishing with the Irish all the way. The arrival of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex afforded him a breathing space. He went to Kilkenny to meet the lord-lieutenant, and, returning to Munster, was on his way from Buttevant to Limerick on 30 May, when encountered Irish troops under Thomas Burke. In the skirmish he was wounded by a pike in the neck. The Burkes were routed, and Norris reached Limerick apparently on 4 June. Having revictualled Askeaton, he joined Essex at Kilmallock, and attended him in his progress through the province till his departure on 20 June. But his wound became worse. He was taken to Mallow Castle, and, after lingering for some time in great pain, he died there on 20 August 1599. Literary connection Norris is mentioned by Lodowick Bryskett as one of the company to whom Edmund Spenser on a well-known occasion unfolded his project of The Faerie Queene.

Prostitutes, clients and any involved third parties (such as pimps and brothel keepers) are criminalised by the country's Penal Code. However, a draft of a new Penal Code that does not prohibit prostitution was presented for debate in the Rwandan Parliament in December 2017. Due to the immense poverty in the country, many women have been forced into prostitution to make a living. In 2012 it was estimated that there were 12,278 sex workers in the country. It is thought that 45.8% of sex workers in Rwanda are HIV positive. Overview Although prostitution is illegal it is widespread, particularly in the capital, Kigali, and other urban centres. Many prostitutes work from bars. Often men who are seeking prostitutes sit at the bar, and those who are not sit away from the bar counter. A significant number of university students use sex work to supplement their income. Sex workers report harassment from the police. On 23 September 2006, the Minister of Gender and Family Promotion Valeria Nyirahabineza ordered prostitutes in Rwanda to stop selling sex otherwise they would face legal action. She claimed that prostitution was a root cause of the HIV problem facing Rwanda. In March 2007 President Paul Kagame gave a speech stating that prostitution in Rwanda must be stopped. He stated: \\"It is not part of Rwanda‚Äôs path to development and, therefore, must stop\\". The Rwanda Law Reform Commission started a review of the penal law in 2015 in an attempt to bring the country's laws up date. The Draft Penal Code removes the prohibition of prostitution except for forced prostitution. Parliament started debating the Draft Penal Code in November 2017. Legal situation Section 4 of the Penal Code deals with prostitution: Sub-section : Obligations and penalties for failure to comply * Article 204: Definition of prostitution * Article 205: Obligations to be fulfilled by a prostitute ::Any person who engages in prostitution shall fulfill, for a period not exceeding one year, one or more of the following obligations: ::: 1¬∞ not to leave territorial limits determined by the Court; ::: 2¬∞ not to go to certain places determined by the court; ::: 3¬∞ to be subjected to surveillance measures; ::: 4¬∞ to seek medical treatment; ::: 5¬∞ to periodically report to administrative services or authorities determined by the court. ::A person who violates any of the obligations under items 1¬∫ to 5¬∫ of this Article, shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of at least three (3) months but less than six (6) months. ::If a person subsequently commits prostitution as provided under Paragraph 2 of this Article shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of six (6) months to two (2) years and a fine of fifty thousand (50,000) to five hundred thousand (500,000) Rwandan francs or one of these penalties. ::The penalties under paragraph 2 of this Article shall also apply to any person caught having sexual intercourse with a prostitute. Sub-section 2: Incitement to prostitution * Article 206: Encouraging, inciting or manipulating a person for the purpose of prostitution * Article 207: Discouraging efforts to rehabilitate prostitutes * Article 208: Advertisement for facilitation of prostitution Sub-section 3: Exploitation of the prostitution * Article 209: Running, managing or investing in a brothel * Article 210: Sharing the proceeds of prostitution * Article 211: Sharing the proceeds of prostitution by a child * Article 212: Aiding, abetting and protecting prostitution * Article 213: Providing a facility for prostitution Sub-section 4: Aggravating circumstances * Article 214: Aggravating circumstances for prostitution-related offence Serial murders of prostitutes A number of women, mostly prostitutes, were murdered in Kigali between July and August 2012. The total number of victims was variously reported as fifteen and eighteen. The murders may have been the work of one person, with some people referring to the killer as the \\"African Jack the Ripper\\". One victim was described by neighbours as having had the words \\"I will stop once I have killed 400 prostitutes\\" carved into the flesh of her stomach, although this was dismissed as a rumour by the police. It was reported in November 2012 that eight men had been arrested and that one of them had confessed to the murders. Sex trafficking Rwanda is a source, transit, and to a lesser extent, destination country for women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Rwandan girls and some boys, some of whom are secondary school students between the ages of 13 to 18, are exploited in commercial sex in hotels, at times through the facilitation of hotel owners. Local human rights groups reported in 2016 that some Rwandan girls in domestic work, who become pregnant and thereby have their employment terminated by their employers and are unable to return to their home villages, are subsequently exploited in sex trafficking. Some Rwandan men, women, and children are subjected to sex trafficking to destinations around the world; the primary destinations for Rwandan victims are Uganda, the DRC, and other parts of East Africa. Rwandan victims are also reportedly exploited in sex trafficking to China. In previous years, Rwandan victims were exploited in South Africa, Malaysia, the United States, and Europe. In 2016, some Rwandan girls were forced into marriages with men in Tanzania and may have experienced commercial sexual exploitation through these marriages. Reporting in 2013 indicated that Kampala- and Nairobi-based labour recruiters and brokers recruited Rwandan workers through fraudulent offers of employment abroad and subjected them to sex trafficking. Refugees fleeing conflict and political violence in Burundi and the DRC remain highly vulnerable to trafficking in Rwanda or are subjected to exploitation in third countries after transiting Rwanda. According to an international organisation, there has been an increase in sex trafficking of Burundian male and female teenagers through Rwanda to third countries since 2015. Burundian refugee girls transited through Rwanda were exploited in sex trafficking in Uganda. Separately, female child refugees in a Congolese refugee camp were reportedly subjected to sex trafficking in nearby towns in 2015, allegedly facilitated by one civilian and three RDF soldiers assigned to the camp. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Rwanda as a 'Tier 2' country.

The composer later disowned the work, and the suite does not have an opus number.DSCH Publishers In 1939, before the Soviet forces were to invade Finland, the Party Secretary of Leningrad Andrei Zhdanov commissioned a celebratory piece from Shostakovich, a theme to be performed as the marching bands of the Red Army would be parading through the Finnish capital Helsinki.Edwards 2006, p. 98 Shostakovich finished composing on 3 December 1939, as the Red Army was advancing in the Finnish front and the puppet regime Finnish Democratic Republic was founded three days earlier. The only early historical source of the suite is a letter which Shostakovich sent his friend Levon Atovmyan on 5 December 1939. In the letter, Shostakovich apologizes he could not make to symphony act in Moscow, as the Leningrad military districts commissioned a suite for Finnish folk songs. The deadline was on 2 December, but he finished on 3 December.Manninen 2002, p. 33 The exact commission date is uncertain, but according to the Finnish historian Ohto Manninen, it was probably commissioned on 25 November, though not earlier than 23 November. The earlier date is not likely as Shostakovich sent a telegram on 22 November to Atovmyan where Shostakovich was certain he would arrive in Moscow.Manninen 2002, p. 34 The war began on 30 November 1939. However, the Winter War was a bitter experience for the Red Army, the Red Army parade in Helsinki never happened, and Shostakovich would never lay claim to the authorship of this work.

Dzhumagaliev killed and cannibalized at least nine people, targeting mainly women in the Almaty area, and is believed to have killed more until his arrest. He was declared insane and imprisoned in a mental hospital until escaping in 1989, but was recaptured two years later, and is currently serving his sentence. Background Nikolai Dzhumagaliev was born on 15 November 1952, in Uzynagash, Kazakh SSR, Soviet Union, to a Kazakh father and Belarusian mother, the third of four children and only son of his family. After completing the ninth grade of school, Dzhumagaliev entered a railway school; following his graduation, he was assigned to work in Atyrau. In 1970, at age 18, he was conscripted into the Soviet Army, serving in chemical defense in Samarkand, Uzbek SSR. After completing his service, Dzhumagaliev tried to become a driver and to enter university, but achieved neither goal. As an alternative, he travelled the Soviet Union, visiting the Ural Mountains, Siberia, and Murmansk, where he tried a number of professions, including sailor, forwarder, electrician, and bulldozer operator. In 1977, he returned to Uzynagash in Kazakhstan to take a job as a firefighter, contracting both syphilis and trichomoniasis that same year. First murder Dzhumagaliev planned his first murder very carefully. In January 1979, he killed a woman travelling along a rural path outside of Uzynagash. During the investigation, Dzhumagaliev described his first murder: On January 25, 1979, the body of the woman was discovered. A criminal case was opened, but the investigation did not lead to the killer's capture. Further murders and first arrest In 1979, Dzhumagaliev committed five more murders. On August 21, in a drunken stupor, he accidentally shot a fellow fireman, for which he was arrested. At the Serbsky Center, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. In less than a year, he was released and returned to Uzynagash. Upon his return, he committed three more murders. Dzhumagaliev's ninth murder was the one that led to his capture. He invited some friends and their girlfriends to his home. He killed one of them and began to dismember him in the next room. When the other guests came looking for them and saw what was happening, they fled in horror from the house and reported it to the police. The arriving policemen caught the cannibal on his knees, smeared with blood. The police were so shocked at what they found that Dzhumagaliev was able to escape. He fled to the mountains naked, with a hatchet in his hands. He was tracked down and taken into custody the next day, on December 19, 1980. A relative of his was also arrested. Less than a year later, December 3, 1981, Dzhumagaliev went on trial. Since he had a previously been diagnosed with schizophrenia, he was again declared insane and remanded to a special treatment center, where he spent the next eight years. Shortly after Dzhumagaliev's 1980 crimes had gained wide attention, another maniac by the name of Alexander Skrynnik was operating in Chi»ôinƒÉu. He killed women and dismembered their bodies, after which he brought the body parts to his friend. The head of one of Skrynnik's victims was shown on television. In Chi»ôinƒÉu, rumors spread that the man-eating maniac Dzhumagaliev had escaped and reached the Moldovan capital. The rumors were put to rest when Skrynnik was convicted of the crimes, sentenced to death, and executed. Escape On August 29, 1989, while being transferred to an ordinary mental hospital, Dzhumagaliev managed to escape, using the car in which he was being transported. He wandered for a long time around the USSR, and according to some reports, committed a series of murders in Moscow and Kazakhstan. In the past, Dzhumagaliev had previously been pronounced \\"cured\\" several times and released, returning to his native village, where he was not well received. Knowing that the villagers would likely turn him in, he did not return there. Dzhumagaliev was declared a fugitive. For several years, he was reported to be seen around Moscow, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. He hid in the mountains for two years, mainly in Kyrgyzstan, where he collected medical plants, bartering them for food with the local population. With each passing day, it became harder for him to hide, as hang-gliders pestered him constantly and motor vehicles were also engaged in the search. Dzhumagaliev decided to divert attention from Kyrgyzstan and put investigators on the wrong track by making them think that he was in the capital. The maniac asked a person with whom he was familiar to take a letter he had written to a friend in Bishkek and mail it from Moscow. The letter ended with the terrible words: \\"...now I will return soon. There are a lot of beautiful women here. No one will notice their loss.\\" His stratagem worked, as the press and various publications spread the rumors that Dzhumagaliev was in the capital. The population of Moscow was alarmed by a small item in the Kuranty newspaper, which said that Dzhumagaliev was seen in the city and surrounding region. Later, in an effort to eliminate panic, a refutation was issued by the authorities. Capture and fate Dzhumagaliev decided to end his adventures by staging a theft, intending to return to Tashkent and go to prison for a minor crime. His plan was successful, and in April 1991, Dzhumagaliev was arrested for stealing sheep in Fergana. He claimed to be Chinese and, accordingly, was placed in the general cell of the SIZO. During interrogations, he willingly confessed to the theft, but could not explain how he had made his way to the Soviet Union. Because of this discrepancy, a request was sent to Moscow for assistance. Colonel Yury Dubyagin, who had participated in the effort to capture Dzhumagaliev, arrived in Fergana from the capital. The sheep thief was revealed as the cannibal, was taken into custody, and returned to a psychiatric hospital in Kazakhstan. Dzhumagaliev said that he hoped that court would accept evidence of his recovery and release him in the future. Previously, he was recognized as cured and released, and immediately dismembered bodies were found in the vicinity. Currently, Nikolai Dzhumagaliev is isolated from society and is incarcerated in a specialized psychiatric clinic, fenced with barbed wire, in the village of Aktas in the Almaty region. There he is engaged in the repair of small equipment. He once filed an application to be given the death penalty, but it was regarded by experts as a symptom of the deterioration of his condition. Doctors say about him: \\"His behavior is orderly; the patient is calm. He willingly works in the department, helping the staff. We have no grounds to believe that he poses a danger to others. He can quietly be in society and be observed in a regular hospital.\\" The question of his discharge is still open. Specialists studying serial killers strongly disagree with the conclusions of the clinic's doctors. In September 2014, Dzhumagaliev was charged with and convicted of his tenth murder, which he had committed in 1990 in Aktobe.Aktobe News - The ogre Dzhumagaliev was found guilty of another murder In January 2016, there were rumors in WhatsApp and Facebook about his possible escape.Information about the escape of a cannibal from a mental hospital in the Almaty region turned out to be falseIf the cannibal Dzhumagaliev had run away, we would not have stood there like this - doctors of a mental hospital in Almaty region However, this was never confirmed. The police tracked down the author of the false report, who turned out to be a 21-year-old female resident from Dzhumagaliev's native village. She was subsequently arrested and confessed.

The Prior of Sempringham was granted permission in 1268 to hold this annual fair, from 23 to 25 June,Platts, Graham (1985); Land and People in Medieval Lincolnshire (History of Lincolnshire, volume 4), appendix 1, History of Lincolnshire Committee for the Society for Lincolnshire History and Archaeology. confirming an earlier charter. The fair continued until living memory, being run as a horse fair until 1954. It seems likely that earlier fairs were held on the same days, one of which is the feast day of St √Ütheldreda, long associated with the site. Historian Graham Platts' view is that there should be scepticism over a belief that the fair developed from earlier summer solstice rites.Platts, Graham (1985); Land and People in Medieval Lincolnshire (History of Lincolnshire, volume 4), p. 143, History of Lincolnshire Committee for the Society for Lincolnshire History and Archaeology. The District Council have erected an information board at the site, with historical text and a photograph of the horse fair in 1908. Location Stow Horse Fair, 1978 Stow Fair was held at the now Stow Green Hill, next to Mareham Lane between Sleaford and Rippingale via Threekingham. This, is thought to be the route of a Roman Road aligned with King Street. The location is on the edge of the Limestone hills, looking North over the fen country toward Sleaford. It is toward the end of a small ridge of high ground pushing east into the fen from Walcott. The field is around above sea level. It would have been a commanding position at the time. A nearby farm is called Stow Farm, and the lane into Horbling is called Stow Lane. The area is signposted \\"Stow\\" from the A15 at Threekingham Few Roman remains have been found along the route of Mareham Lane. A fenced field at the corner of Mareham Lane and Stow Lane bears a notice board with historical information. The land is owned by the Crown Commissioners and farmed under a tenancy. Pedestrian access to the site is permitted, although metal detection is forbidden. Originally the fair could have extended over a larger area, and the field is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.RSM no. 22610 Chapel The Domesday Book records two churches in Threekingham; St Peter and St Mary. The church of St Mary was at Stow Green. Funerary remains have been found at Stow Green date back to the 11th- and 12th-century, and the church survived until the 18th century. It is possible that it was the site of an Early Medieval nunnery, founded in the late 7th century by St Werburgh and dedicated to St √Ütheldreda. It was probably destroyed by the Danes c.870. Historian David Roffe describes St √Ütheldreda's connection with Stow Green, saying the site, called \\"√Üdeldre√∞estowe,\\" was chosen because the saint's staff took root and sprouted leaves there.Roffe, David (2000) \\"St √Üthelthryth and the Monastery of Alftham\\" Roffe.co.uk.

Critical reviews  The two Sonny Thompson sides were reviewed by Metronome in its September 1946 issue: \\"This is the pianist who came into the Caf√© Society Uptown two months ago. It's said he's potentially great, but since both these sides are just so much fast flashy boogie woogie, with a meaningless pseudo-classical departure, we'll reserve our raves.\\" Reviewing Saunders' \\"Red, the Be Bop Guy\\", Metronome said, \\"Saunders' little Chicago band does a vocal novelty that sounds more like typical jump music than be bop. It's a medium-tempo blues with a good beat and some tricky alto by Nat Jones. The same Mr. Jones, who played clarinet for the Duke for a while some three years ago, plays a sweet solo on 'Vi,' but the band and performance are out of kilter and perhaps a trifle off center.\\" The October 1946 issue of Metronome, referring to the Eddie Wiggins sides: \\"This little band from Chicago, which opened at New York's Aquarium last month, jumps healthily in 'Onyx,' with good solos by alto and vibes and some spirited riffing. Nothing sensational here, but very good for an unknown band of which you expected nothing. 'Orientale' shifts the alto man to oboe for a performance that sounds alarmingly like its title and is a weird mixture of exotic sound effects and jump piano. It gets better as it goes along and turns out to be a fast blues, then back comes that oboe.\\"  See also  * List of record labels References Category:American record labels ","title":"Sultan Records"},{"id":"24035143","text":"Romance on the Run is a 1938 American comedy crime film directed by Gus Meins and starring Donald Woods and Patricia Ellis.  Plot  A very expensive necklace known as the \\"Czarina's Tears\\" is stolen from Phelps' jewelry shop. The next morning, Phelps (Granville Bates) goes to see insurance company manager J. W. Ridgeway (Andrew Tombes). Ridgeway is certain Phelps' policy was not renewed, but his young secretary, Miss Dale Harrison (Patricia Ellis), informs him she renewed it while he was away. Lieutenant Eckhart (William Demarest) wants Ridgeway to leave the case entirely to the police, but Ridgeway hires private investigator Drake (Donald Woods). Drake suspects nightclub singer Lily Lamont (Grace Bradley). Drake introduces Lily to safecracker Charlie Cooper (Craig Reynolds) at the nightclub. They pretend they do not know each other, but they do. Drake breaks into Cooper's apartment to search for the necklace. Cooper discovers him and holds him at gunpoint, but Drake manages to disarm him and find the necklace. He collects his fee of $10,000, which disgusts Eckhart, who suspects Drake is involved in all the robberies he solves. Phelps shows up to retrieve his necklace, but quickly realizes it is only an imitation. Drake is told the bad news by his sidekick Whitey Whitehouse. Drake and Whitey rush to the train station (Drake found train tickets in Cooper's apartment) and spot Lily. Meanwhile, Miss Harris also arrives, trying to catch Ridgeway before he leaves on a business trip. Seeing Drake, she follows him to Cincinnati. On the way, she notifies Eckhart by telegram. In Cincinnati, Lily and Cooper visit fence Mondoon, but the necklace is too dangerous for him to handle. When Drake and Whitey show up, a chase ensues; Drake ends up with the crooks' car - and Lily's suitcase, which contains the jewelry. Now the thieves, as well as Eckhart, pursue Drake, Whitey and Gale, who head to New Orleans (and another fence) in search of the crooks. Drake's trio run out of gas in the middle of nowhere. They see a house and encounter a family of hillbillies. One of the children finds the necklace in a jar of face cream, witnessed only by Gale. Gale takes the necklace and, after trying repeatedly to tell Drake, gives up and hitches a ride, while Eckhart arrests the other four. Back at the office, Gale switches the fake necklace with the real one, bailing Drake out of trouble. Drake makes an appointment with her at the city hall, implying they are going to get married.

At the height of his career in the late 1990s, he was considered one of the best players. He is well known as a friend and teammate to Jon Finkel. Career O'Mahoney-Schwartz first qualified for the Pro Tour in its inaugural season, at Pro Tour Columbus. An unimpressive finish left him outside the top sixty- four needed to win money, and unqualified for the World Championship. The following season saw O'Mahoney-Schwartz make it back to the Pro Tour with a higher degree of success and consistency. He played five of seven events winning money at two of them. The following year was O'Mahoney-Schwartz's break-out season. He reached the quarter finals of Grand Prix Toronto, the first event of the season. After a weak finish at Pro Tour Chicago, he made top eight of the second Pro Tour of the year in Mainz. In the elimination bracket, he made it all the way to the finals before losing to Matt Place. A string of Grand Prix top eights including wins in Madrid and Zurich put him in third place in the Player of the Year Race, at the end of the season. At Pro Tour Los Angeles the following year, he reached the top eight for a second time. He won the event, defeating Mike Long, Terry Lau, and Jon Finkel in the quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals respectively. His other top finishes that season were at Grand Prix Boston and Oslo.

It is the administrative center of Pulyny Raion. Population: The town was first mentioned in the middle of the twelfth century under the name Chortolisy. In the annals there was a mention of a \\"Devil's Wood\\" () nearby, which presumably lies behind the name; it was so called because of impenetrable thickets, swamps, and the debris of dead trees. Chortolisy was located on one of the ancient paths leading from Kyiv to the lands further west. In the fourteenth century the settlement belonged to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and from the sixteenth century to Polish feudal lords. In 1578, the settlement was mentioned under a new name, Pulyny. From 1793, right-bank Ukraine became part of Russia, the village of Pulyny became part of the Zhitomir district. Villagers engaged in agriculture and trade. After the abolition of serfdom in 1861, handicrafts and industry developed in the village; there were a candle factory, a furniture factory, two workshops, and a match factory. By the beginning of the twentieth century there were an iron foundry, a steam mill, two breweries, and a brickyard which also manufactured tiles and ceramic ware. By 1899 there was a population of 2,125 people. As a result of the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War, the Soviet government was finally established in Pulyny in June 1920. On June 20, 1930, the town became the administrative center of the Pulin German Autonomous Region (), which included thirty selsoviets. From February 1931 it belonged to the Kyiv Oblast.A.

In psychiatry, the term is also more narrowly used to indicate a phobia of the contents of a house: \\"fear of household appliances, equipment, bathtubs, household chemicals, and other common objects in the home.\\"Doctor, Ronald Manual, Ada P. Kahn, and Christine A. Adamec. 2008. The Encyclopedia of Phobias, Fears, and Anxieties (3rd ed.). Infobase Publishing. pp. 281, 286. In contrast, domatophobia specifically refers to the fear of a house itself. In 1808, poet and essayist Robert Southey used the word to describe a desire (particularly by the English) to leave home and travel. Southey's usage as a synonym for wanderlust was picked up by other 19th-century writers. The term has been used in political contexts to refer critically to political ideologies that repudiate one's own culture and laud others. One prominent such usage was by Roger Scruton in his 2004 book England and the Need for Nations. In psychiatry In psychiatric usage, oikophobia may narrowly refer to fear of the physical space of the home interior, where it is especially linked to the fear of household appliances, baths, electrical equipment, and other aspects of the home perceived to be potentially dangerous. In this psychiatric context, the term is properly applied to fear of the objects within the house, whereas the fear of the house itself is referred to as domatophobia. In the post-World War II era, some commentators used the term to refer to a supposed \\"fear and loathing of housework\\" experienced by women who worked outside of the home and who were attracted to a consumerist lifestyle.Moeller, Robert G. 1993. Protecting motherhood: Women and the family in the politics of postwar West Germany. University of California Press. p. 140. Southey's usage In his Letters from England (1808), Robert Southey describes oikophobia as a product of \\"a certain state of civilisation or luxury.\\" referring to the habit among wealthy people to visit spa towns and seaside resorts in the summer months. He also mentions the fashion for picturesque travel to wild landscapes, such as the highlands of Scotland.Southey, Robert. 1808. Letters from England 1. New York: David Longworth. pp. 157‚Äì59. Southey's link of oikophobia to wealth and the search for new experiences was taken up by other writers, and cited in dictionaries.Black, Richard. 1874.

In 1959, Anglo-Egyptian author Bothaina Abd el-Hamid Mohamed used Southey's concept in his book Oikophobia: or, A literary craze for education through travel.Mohamed, Bothaina Abd el-Hamid. 1959. Oikophobia;: Or, A literary craze for education through travel. Anglo-Egyptian Books.  Political usage  In his 2004 book England and the Need for Nations, British conservative philosopher Roger Scruton adapted the word to mean \\"the repudiation of inheritance and home.\\"Scruton, Roger. 2004. \\"Oikophobia.\\" pp. 33‚Äì38 in England and the Need for Nations. London: Civitas. He argues that it is \\"a stage through which the adolescent mind normally passes,\\" but that it is a feature of some, typically leftist, political impulses and ideologies that espouse xenophilia, i.e. preference for foreign cultures.Scruton, Roger. \\"Oikophobia and Xenophilia.\\" pp. 287‚Äì92 in Stereotypes and Nations, edited by T. Walas. Cracow International Cultural Center. Scruton uses the term as the antithesis of xenophobia.Lacroix, Justine, and Kalypso Nicolaƒ´dis. 2011. European Stories: Intellectual Debates on Europe in National Contexts. Oxford University Press. p. 159. In his book, Roger Scruton: Philosopher on Dover Beach, Mark Dooley describes oikophobia as centered within the Western academic establishment on \\"both the common culture of the West, and the old educational curriculum that sought to transmit its humane values.\\" This disposition has grown out of, for example, the writings of Jacques Derrida and of Michel Foucault's \\"assault on 'bourgeois' society result[ing] in an 'anti- culture' that took direct aim at holy and sacred things, condemning and repudiating them as oppressive and power-ridden.\\"Dooley, Mark. 2009. Roger Scruton: Philosopher on Dover Beach. Continuum. He continues: > Derrida is a classic oikophobe in so far as he repudiates the longing for > home that the Western theological, legal, and literary traditions satisfy.‚Ä¶ > Derrida's deconstruction seeks to block the path to this 'core experience' > of membership, preferring instead a rootless existence founded 'upon > nothing.' An extreme aversion to the sacred, and the thwarting of the connection of the sacred to the culture of the West is described as the underlying motif of oikophobia; and not the substitution of Judeo-Christianity by another coherent system of belief. The paradox of the oikophobe seems to be that any opposition directed at the theological and cultural tradition of the West is to be encouraged even if it is \\"significantly more parochial, exclusivist, patriarchal, and ethnocentric.\\" Scruton describes \\"a chronic form of oikophobia [which] has spread through the American universities, in the guise of political correctness.\\" Scruton's usage has been taken up by some U.S. political commentators to refer to what they see as a rejection of traditional U.S. culture by the liberal elite. In August 2010, James Taranto wrote a column in the Wall Street Journal entitled \\"Oikophobia: Why the liberal elite finds Americans revolting\\", in which he criticizes supporters of the proposed Islamic center in New York as oikophobes who were defending Muslims and aimed to \\"exploit the 9/11 atrocity.\\" In the Netherlands, the term oikophobia has been adopted by politician and writer Thierry Baudet, which he describes in his book, Oikophobia: The Fear of Home.

It is the period in which the cumulative net present value of a project equals zero.  Calculation  Cumulative discounted cash flows will start with a negative value due to the original cost of investment, but as cash is generated each year after the original investment the discounted cash flows for those years will be positive, and the cumulative discounted cash flows will progress in a positive direction towards zero. When the negative cumulative discounted cash flows become positive, or recover, DPP occurs. Discounted payback period is calculated by the formula: :DPP = Year before DPP occurs + Cumulative Discounted Cash flow in year before recovery √∑ Discounted cash flow in year after recovery Advantages Discounted payback period helps businesses reject or accept projects by helping determine their profitability while taking into account the time-value of money. This is done via the decision rule: If the DPP is less than its useful life, or any predetermined period, the project can be accepted. If the DPP is greater than the specified period or the project's useful life, the project should be rejected. The DPP also helps compare mutually exclusive projects, as the project with the shorter DPP should be accepted.  Disadvantages  The discounted payback method still does not offer concrete decision criteria to determine if an investment increases a firm's value. In order to calculate DPP, an estimate of the cost of capital is required. Another disadvantage is that cash flows beyond the discounted payback period are ignored entirely with this method.

It is a member of the borage family, Boraginaceae. One of its common names, anacua, is derived from the Mexican Spanish word anacahuite, as is that of the related Cordia boissieri, the anacahuita. That word in turn is derived from the Nahuatl words ƒÅmatl, meaning \\"paper,\\" and cuahuitl, meaning \\"tree,\\" possibly referring to the bark. It is also known as knockaway, a corruption of anacua, and sandpaper tree. Alternate spellings are anaqua and anachua. Description Anacua reaches a height of and a diameter of , often producing suckers or multiple trunks. The bark is reddish-brown to gray with narrow furrows and peeling scales. The dark green leaves are and wide and elliptical or ovate. Their upper surfaces are remarkably rough, feeling like low-grade sandpaper. Anacua is a partial evergreen, replacing some of the leaves in early spring. Abundant white flowers form in panicles or cymes in length at the ends of twigs, making trees appear to be covered in snow when in bloom from spring to summer. Flowers are wide and have 5 corolla lobes. The fruits are spherical drupes 8 mm in diameter and yellowish-orange. The drupes contain two stones, each with two seeds. In addition to being edible by humans, the drupes are eaten by mammals and birds such as the clay- colored thrush. The lifespan of an Anacua is at least 50 years. Habitat Anacua is found on dry hillsides as a shrub, but reaches tree size in the moist soils of riparian zones and floodplains. It can be found at elevations from sea level to . Ecology The leaves of E. anacua are the sole food source of the Texas tortoise beetle (Coptocycla texana).

Mayhew‚Äôs animal shelter, head office and Community Vet Clinic are based in Kensal Green, North London.  History  Mayhew was established in 1886 as ‚ÄòThe Home for Starving and Deserted Cats‚Äô. In 1904, it was re-branded as ‚ÄòThe Mayhew Animal Home‚Äô in honour of the first superintendent, Anne Mayhew. During World War Two, ‚ÄòThe Mayhew Animal Home‚Äô remained open to care for and offer refuge to homeless animals and their owners. In 1998, the site expanded to include a Community Veterinary Clinic, and between 2000 and 2012, initiatives such as the current community support and animal welfare services, Mayhew International and TheraPaws programmes were established. In 2017, ‚ÄòThe Mayhew Animal Home‚Äô rebranded to ‚ÄòMayhew‚Äô. In January 2019, the Duchess of Sussex became Mayhew‚Äôs Royal Patron.  Governance  Mayhew‚Äôs CEO is Caroline Yates, assisted by a Senior Management Team, who report to a Board of Trustees.  Funding  Mayhew is entirely funded by public donations, and can care for up to 30 dogs and 150 cats in their UK rescue center at any one time. Mayhew also funds outreach work which enables them to provide care and veterinary treatment for owned and stray cats and dogs in the local community. The organization has almost 80 permanent staff members, and is helped by over 200 volunteers. In 2018, Mayhew‚Äôs reported income was ¬£2,781,141. This includes a 14% raise in income from donations and an overall increase in total income of 27% comparative to 2017.  Ethos  Mayhew‚Äôs core aim is to reduce the number of animals in need, by delivering a broad range of pro-active, community-based welfare, veterinary and education services in the UK and overseas. Mayhew understands the links between social issues and animal welfare, and believe that by helping people, they can help animals too. By taking a realistic and non-judgmental view of the difficult situations people can face, Mayhew are able to care for and re- home dogs and cats in need, change human behavior and inform and educate the general public about animal welfare.  Patronage  In 2019, Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex became a Royal Patron of Mayhew.  Services  Community Support Mayhew is more than an animal rescue shelter. The organization helps people and animals in the local community through a number of unique support projects, from providing free and low cost veterinary treatment to controlling the population of feral cats and educating young people about responsible pet ownership. Mayhew‚Äôs Animal Welfare Officers go out into the community every day to provide ongoing support to pet owners in difficulty, and assist animals in need. Through an innovative Pet Refuge programme, the Animal Welfare Officers arrange shelter and care for the pets of people in a crisis for a short period of time, and build trusting relationships with animal owners to ensure Mayhew is their first point of contact in their time of need. Mayhew have also been a lifeline for homeless and rough sleepers for over 17 years, and work closely with homeless charities across London to ensure people are kept with their animals as much as possible. Animal Welfare Officers provide food, safety equipment and medical care and advice to the pets of homeless people, and regularly visit hostels and help centers to undertake free general health checks. Through these unique initiatives, Mayhew believe they have a better chance of preventing cases of animal cruelty and neglect. Rehoming Mayhew rescues and rehomes hundreds of dogs, cats, puppies and kittens every single year. Every animal that comes into the shelter receives a full behavioral and health assessment, and is given any necessary veterinary treatment required before being placed up for adoption. Through their innovative Rehome From Home scheme, Mayhew also help pets who are able to stay with their existing owner until a new family is found. The organization also runs an animal foster care service, which provides temporary homes for animals who may not cope well in a shelter environment, or who have been awaiting adoption for a very long time. These services help to free up space in Mayhew‚Äôs shelter, and lower the risk of unwanted and abandoned animals being euthanized elsewhere. Community Vet Clinic Mayhew's Community Vet Clinic offers free or low-cost preventative care including neutering, microchipping and vaccinations for all pet owners and in- house animals. Services also include flea and worming treatment, and emergency care when an animal has nowhere else to go. Mayhew‚Äôs Nurse Clinic offers basic care for pets, from nail clipping to dental checks. Mayhew‚Äôs Vet Clinic reception is open Monday ‚Äì Saturday from 9am until 5pm to book appointments, order repeat prescriptions or make a general enquiry. Mayhew International Mayhew International was officially established in 2012, and currently runs animal welfare projects Afghanistan, Georgia, Russia and India. Mayhew International works with governments, local communities and charitable groups in all four countries to help improve animal welfare overseas, address issues around dog and cat populations in urban areas and change attitudes towards stray and companion animals amongst local residents. The organizations‚Äô primary goals for their international work is to control and reduce free- roaming dog and cat populations humanely, eradicate rabies and other infectious diseases caught from dogs and spread between animals and people, and improve veterinary standards abroad through access to training. Mayhew International neuter around 95,000 animals, vaccinated almost 105,000 dogs against rabies, trained 564 veterinary professionals and become a registered NGO in both Afghanistan and Georgia. Mayhew International also completed the first ever dog population survey in Kabul, where they have also delivered the first mass canine rabies vaccination programme and in 2017 signed a landmark agreement with Kabul Municipality to stop unethical dog culling. Veterinary surgeon and Mayhew International Afghanistan Country Director Dr Abdul-Jalil Mohammadzai has won multiple awards for his groundbreaking work in Kabul, including the Association of Dogs and Cats Home (ADCH) Special Recognition Award in 2017, the Animal Hero Awards Special Recognition Award in 2018 and the RCVS International Award in 2019. TheraPaws TheraPaws is a dog therapy programme run by Mayhew, that works to improve wellbeing in the local community. A team of Mayhew volunteers take their owned therapy dogs into care and residential homes, hospices, hospitals and day care centers across London to engage with residents, provide companionship and brighten up their day. TheraPaws specializes in visits to people suffering from ill mental health, elderly people with dementia, and to palliative care units; where the dogs encourage social interaction and promote emotional and physical wellbeing. In 2018, volunteers made over 700 TheraPaws visits in over 60 locations across 14 London boroughs. TheraPaws dogs also pay additional visits to corporate clients, as studies have indicated that spending time with an animal can reduce stress and improve mood, and has a positive impact of the wellbeing and productivity of teams and individuals. In return for a donation, volunteers will visit an office in London for up to 90 minutes and help staff to de- stress.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 14, 1972, based on its association with Augusta Jane Evans. She was one of the most popular American novelists of the nineteenth century and the first female author in the United States to earn over $100,000 for her work, but has been largely forgotten in recent times. History Colonel John Murrell of Georgia had the Greek Revival style house built in 1840 for his daughter, Mrs. William A. Hardaway. It was then sold in 1855 to Alfred Batre, son of Adolphe Batre, Mobile Mayor (1830), who purchased it for his new bride Hortense Addison, daughter of Lloyd Dulany Addison of the Oxon Hill Manor Addison's.http://nscda.org/wp- content/uploads/2014/05/AL_Our_Founding_Mothers.pdf Augusta Jane Evans purchased the house from Batre in 1857 for her father, Matthew R. Evans, with the proceeds from her first book, Inez: A Tale of the Alamo. Matthew Evans had relocated his family to Mobile from San Antonio, Texas in 1849. The Batre's would move into 110 S Franklin Street, then 400 Church Street. https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/69224589/hortense-batre Augusta Evans went on to write two of her most famous novels at Georgia Cottage, Macaria and St. Elmo. She married Lorenzo Madison Wilson in the parlor of the house in 1868. Following her marriage she moved into her husband's Greek Revival mansion, Ashland, namesake of the modern Ashland Place neighborhood. Georgia Cottage remained in the Evans family until 1879, when it was sold to Andrew Damrell. Damrell's heirs sold it in 1926 to J.N. Brownlee, and it was subsequently purchased by Dr. Edward Simmons Sledge in 1935. Dr. Sledge's son, Eugene Bondurant Sledge, grew up at Georgia Cottage. He served in the United States Marines during World War II and became a noted university professor and author. His memoir With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa was, in part, the basis for Ken Burn's PBS documentary, The War, and the HBO miniseries, The Pacific. Architecture and grounds Although now deep within the Mobile city limits, Georgia Cottage was a country house when originally built. Slave labor was utilized in its construction. The one-story wood-frame structure, on a brick foundation, is a stylistic blending of Gulf Coast cottage and Greek Revival forms. It has matching side wings to each side of the main block and a hipped roof. The house is situated at the end of a long avenue of live oaks, planted prior to 1840. The avenue is listed with Alabama's Famous and Historic Trees Program.

Catalytic hydrogenation The catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles is often the most economical route available for the production of primary amines. Catalysts for the reaction often include group 10 metals such as Raney nickel, palladium black, or platinum dioxide. However, other catalysts, such as cobalt boride, also can be selective for primary amine production: : R-C‚â°N + 2 H2 ‚Üí R-CH2NH2 A commercial application of this technology includes the production of hexamethylenediamine from adiponitrile, a precursor to Nylon 66. Depending on reaction conditions, intermediate imines can also undergo attack by amine products to afford secondary and tertiary amines: : 2 R-C‚â°N + 4 H2 ‚Üí (R-CH2)2NH + NH3 : 3 R-C‚â°N + 6 H2 ‚Üí (R-CH2)3N + 2 NH3 Such reactions proceed via enamine intermediates. The most important reaction condition for selective primary amine production is catalyst choice. Other important factors include solvent choice, solution pH, steric effects, temperature, and the pressure of hydrogen. Stoichiometric reductions Reducing agents for the non-catalytic conversion to amines include lithium aluminium hydride, lithium borohydride, diborane, or elemental sodium in alcohol solvents.  To aldehydes  Nitriles can also be reduced to aldehydes. The Stephen aldehyde synthesis uses Tin(II) chloride and hydrochloric acid to yield an aldehyde via the hydrolysis of a resulting iminium salt. Aldehydes can also form using a hydrogen donor followed by in- situ hydrolysis of an imine. Useful reagents for this reaction include formic acid with a hydrogenation catalysis or metal hydrides which are used to add one mol of hydrogen to the nitrile. For example, sodium borohydride reduces nitriles in alcoholic solvents with a CoCl2 catalyst or Raney nickel. Reducing agent Diisobutylaluminium hydride, or DIBAL-H, is another commonly used metal hydride. DIBAL-H acts as a hydride source, adding a hydride ion to the carbon of the nitrile. The resulting imine is a relatively stable intermediate that can be hydrolyzed to the aldehyde.Carey, F. A.; Sundberg, R. J.; Advanced Organic Chemistry, Part B: Reactions and Synthesis  Mechanism  The mechanism for the reduction of a nitrile to an aldehyde with DIBAL-H. DIBAL-H is added in controlled amounts at low temperatures to achieve partial reduction of the nitrile. The aluminum atom in DIBAL acts as a Lewis acid, accepting an electron pair from the nitrile. The nitrile is then reduced by the transfer of a hydride ion to the carbon of the carbon-nitrile triple bond, producing an imine. After a workup with water, the aluminum complex is hydrolyzed to produce the desired aldehyde.Solomons, T W. G, Craig B. Fryhle, and S A. Snyder. Organic Chemistry. , 2014. Print. Because the hydrolytic workup generates the aldehyde at the end, the nitrile does not undergo over- reduction. Electrochemical methods Benzonitriles can also be reduced electrochemically.

Date accessed: 3 June 2012 In 1628 he was elected Member of Parliament for Marlborough and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. On 21 March 1631 he unsuccessfully applied for the post of secretary to the chancellor of the exchequer.. Cites: Report on Lord Cowper's MSS. i. 428). Stratford designed to appoint him captain of a company in the Irish army, but the influence exerted for Lorenzo Gary frustrated the intention.. Cites: Strafford Letters, i. 128, 138. As a courtier Percy was more fortunate; he obtained great influence with Queen Henrietta Maria, and employed it to further the interests of his brother, the Earl of Northumberland, and his brother-in-law, the Earl of Leicester.. Cites: Strafford Letters i. 363; Collins, Peerage; Sydney Papers, ii. 506, 527, 642). In March 1633 Percy acted as Lord Weston's friend in the quarrel between him and the Earl of Holland.. Cites: Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1633-4, x. 12. His favour, however, continued to increase; in November 1639 he was appointed master of the horse to the Prince of Wales, and on 6 June 1640 he was appointed captain and governor of Jersey for life.. Cites: Collins, Peerage (Brydges), ii. 344, Sydney Papers, ii. 620). In April 1640, Percy was elected MP for Portsmouth in the Short Parliament. He was elected MP for Northumberland for the Long Parliament in November 1640. Percy was one of the originators of what was termed the \\"First Army Plot\\" in March 1641, but according to his own story simply designed to procure a declaration from the army in support of the king's policy, and was innocent of the plan to bring it up to London in order to put force on the parliament. When the plot was discovered he endeavoured to flee to France, but was set upon and wounded by the country people in Sussex, and remained for some time in hiding. To facilitate his own escape, he was induced to write a letter to his brother, giving an account of the conspiracy, which furnished the popular leaders with conclusive proof of the reality of the design, and was held by the Royalists to be a treacherous betrayal of his duty to the King.. Cites: Claredon, Rebellion, iii. 223, 228; Rushworth, iv. 255). The sole punishment inflicted upon him for his share in the plot was his expulsion from the House of Commons, which took place on 9 December 1641.. Cites: Commons' Journals, ii. 337; Evelyn, Diary, ed. Wheatley, iv. 75). Percy went to France, but at the outbreak of the war made himself useful to Queen Henrietta Maria, who employed him as an agent to King Charles, and obtained his restoration to favour. \\"Truly\\", she wrote, \\"I think him very faithful, and that we may trust him\\". Thanks to her support, he became on 22 May 1643 general of the ordnance in the king's army, and was created on 28 June of the same year Baron Percy of Alnwick.. Cites: Green, Letters of Henrietta Maria, p. 138; Black, Oxford Docquets, pp. 40, 52).A volume of Percy's correspondence as general of the ordnance is preserved in the Bodleian Library (. Cites: Rawlinson MS. D. 395). Percy fought at the Battle of Cropredy Bridge on 29 June 1644, and accompanied the king into Cornwall in his pursuit of the Earl of Essex; but, having taken part in Henry Wilmot's intrigue to force the king to make peace, he fell into disgrace, and was obliged to resign his command.. Cites: 14 August 1644; Diary of Richard Symonds, p. 64). \\"His removal\\" says Clarendon, \\"added to the ill- humour of the army; for though he was generally unloved as a proud and supercilious person, yet he had always three or four persons of good credit and reputation, who were esteemed by him, with whom he lived very well; and though he did not draw the good fellows to him by drinking, yet he eat well, which in the general scarcity of that time drew many votaries to him, who bore very ill the want of his table, and so Avere not without some inclination to murmur even on his behalf.\\". Cites: Rebellion, viii. 98). On 11 January 1645 Percy and two other Royalist peers were placed under arrest by the King on the charge of holding correspondence with his enemies and uttering disrespectful speeches, but in reality on account of the persistency with which they urged him to open negotiations with Parliament.. Cites: Gardiner, Great Civil War, ii. 114. Percy was released a few weeks later, and, having procured a pass from Essex, sought to take ship for the continent. On his way he was taken prisoner by William Waller and Oliver Cromwell at Andover. Among Percy's party \\"there was a youth of so fair a countenance that Cromwell doubted of his condition, and, to confirm himself, willed him to sing, which he did with such a daintiness that Cromwell scrupled not to say to Lord Percy that being a warrior he did wisely to be accompanied by Amazons, on which that lord in some confusion did acknowledge that she was a damsel; this afterwards gave cause for scoff at the king's party\\".. Cites: Recollections by Sir William Waller, 1788, p. 125). Percy arrived at Paris at the end of March 1645, and, though the King had cautioned the Queen not to trust him too much, was speedily as great a favourite with Henrietta as before.. Cites: Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1644-5, pp. 372, 390, 483). In March 1648 he was wounded in a duel with Prince Rupert, and in the following October was put under arrest for giving the lie to Lord Colepeper in the presence of the Prince of Wales.. Cites: Hamilton Papers, i. 178; Whitelocke, Memorials, ii. 423). As Percy belonged to the queen's party and to the faction of Secretary Robert Long, he is spoken of with great severity in the correspondence of Edward Hyde and Edward Nicholas. They regarded him as an atheist because he favoured Hobbes, and advised Charles II to comply with the demands of the Presbyterians or any other party which would undertake to restore his throne. When he was made Lord Chamberlain and admitted to the Privy Council, their disgust knew no bounds.. Cites: Nicholas Papers, i. 172, 213, 285, 293, ii. 18, 20, 113). Hyde, however, was subsequently reconciled to Percy, who brought about a meeting between the queen and the chancellor of the exchequer, and is praised in the History of the Rebellion for his economical administration of the king's household.. Cites: History of the Rebellion xiv. 89, 93). When Percy thought of making his peace with the Protector, Hyde dissuaded him, and told him that few men were so fit to be about the king's person, or engaged in the counsels likely to carry him home.. Cites: Cal. Clarendon Papers, iii. 161, 330). Percy died unmarried at Paris in France in around March 1659.. Cites: Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1658-9, pp. 115, 335, 562).

He headed the criminal group along with Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez. Antonio was considered by Mexican security forces as one of Mexico's most-wanted men. Born in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Antonio initially worked as a car washer at a local police station with his brother Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, former leader of the cartel. By the late 1980s, he entered the drug trade, and later became the crime boss of Matamoros, where he controlled the city's drug trafficking shipments and all organized crime activities. Few details were known of Antonio's criminal career prior to 1999, when his brother Osiel confronted federal agents at gunpoint with several of his gunmen in Matamoros. In 1998, Antonio avoided arrest after FBI and DEA agents tracked his whereabouts inside a domicile in Houston. Back in Mexico, his brother Osiel was the Gulf Cartel's main leader and had created a paramilitary squad known as Los Zetas, formed by soldiers who left the Mexican military. When Osiel was arrested in 2003, Antonio and Costilla S√°nchez took the lead of the criminal organization, and Los Zetas eventually broke apart from the Gulf Cartel in 2010. However, Antonio was killed in an eight-hour shootout between Gulf Cartel gunmen and soldiers of the Mexican Navy in Matamoros on 5 November 2010. According to the Mexican government, ten people were killed that day in Matamoros, but local media outlets suggested that over 40 people were killed by gunfire. One anonymous law enforcement officer, witnesses, and several local newspapers indicated over 100 were killed in Matamoros.  Criminal career  Early life Antonio Ezequiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n was born on 5 March 1962 in El Mezquital ranch in the border city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico. As a teenager, Antonio Ezequiel and his brother Osiel earned their living by washing cars at the headquarters of the Federal Judicial Police in their hometown. By the late 1980s, C√°rdenas Guill√©n started his criminal career under the Gulf Cartel, where he became a high-ranking leader and commanded organized crime activities and drug trafficking in Matamoros. His contact with the police in Matamoros marked the life of the C√°rdenas Guill√©n clan; federal reports of the Procuradur√≠a General de la Rep√∫blica (PGR) suggest that the drug lord had solid business relations with police and military men. Witnesses indicate that Antonio frequented public places in Matamoros, Reynosa, Ciudad Victoria, and other cities in the state of Tamaulipas surrounded by a number of municipal and state police officers, whose superiors have allegedly remained loyal to the Gulf Cartel for over half a century. His henchmen reportedly wore bullet-proof vests with the Spanish insignias for the Gulf Cartel (C√°rtel del Golfo ‚Äì C.D.G.) embellished across their chests. Although some of Antonio Ezequiel's men were reported to have worn military garbs while on duty, their uniforms have also become more subtle with time. For example, some Gulf Cartel gunmen wear tennis shoes of the same color, caps with the logo \\"CDG‚ÄìTT\\" (Gulf Cartel‚ÄìTony Tormenta), or trucks emblazoned with the same logo to help them distinguish themselves from rival gangs. A decade before ascending in the Gulf Cartel leadership rankings, C√°rdenas Guill√©n avoided arrest by FBI and DEA agents in 1998, after they raided his home in Houston, Texas. The federal agents saw the drug lord leave, but they decided to pursue a search warrant than to chase him, given the activity in the neighborhood, the number of cars at the parking lot near his house, and the lack of sufficient agents in the operative. Inside the domicile, the US authorities discovered \\"cash, numerous vehicles, cocaine, marijuana, firearms and one 1996 Sea Doo Bombardier with expired Florida registration.\\" In 1998, the federal agents knew little about C√°rdenas Guill√©n and the criminal organization he worked for. The FBI later closed the investigation in February 1999 due to the drug lord's fugitive status, his local indictments, and the lack of information available in the Houston jurisdiction. Ten months later in November 1999, the C√°rdenas Guill√©n surname started to gain momentum when Antonio Ezequiel's brother Osiel and several of his gunmen stopped two US federal agents at gunpoint in the streets of Matamoros. After a tense standoff, the agents convinced Osiel to let them go. Under orders of his brother Osiel, Antonio Ezequiel ordered the drug lord Gregorio Sauceda Gamboa (alias El Goyo) and his henchmen to execute 6 prison guards in Matamoros on 20 January 2005, reportedly as a reprisal for Osiel's treatment at Altiplano prison. Their corpses were discovered inside a Ford Explorer near the Matamoros federal prison. In May 2005, he commanded a battalion of over 100 Zeta members to fight off Los Pelones, an enforcer group working for the Beltr√°n Leyva Cartel, in the state of Guerrero. Rank accession In 2003, Osiel was arrested in Matamoros following a shootout with the Mexican military, and was extradited to the United States in 2007. In exchange for a life sentence, Osiel cooperated with the U.S. authorities by supplying information on the workings of the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas. When Osiel was arrested, Antonio Ezequiel inherited the Gulf Cartel along with Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez, a former policeman in Matamoros. He and other Gulf Cartel leaders were responsible for trafficking multi-ton drug shipments of cocaine and marijuana from Mexico to the United States. Antonio Ezequiel received a federal indictment in 2008 in the District of Columbia for drug trafficking violations. He also directed the flow of narcotics through land, sea, and air from Venezuela and Colombia to Guatemala and the U.S-Mexico border. When Osiel was imprisoned, several high-ranking lieutenants in the Gulf Cartel got together to appoint leaders and their turfs. According to the declarations of Zeta leader Mateo D√≠az L√≥pez (alias Comandante Mateo), Antonio Ezequiel was given the turf of Matamoros, one of the leading smuggling routes for the cartel. But Antonio Ezequiel never had the edge; one of his most trusted men, Ramiro Garc√≠a Hern√°ndez (alias El Mati), was arrested in 2004. Deemed inexperienced, Costilla S√°nchez, Lazcano, and high-ranking leader V√≠ctor Manuel V√°zquez Mireles (alias El Meme Loco) moved Antonio Ezequiel to command the Gulf Cartel in Canc√∫n. But after failing to meet the Gulf Cartel's demands, he was replaced. With Osiel imprisoned, however, Costilla S√°nchez was deemed more powerful than Antonio Ezequiel. According to the declaration of the imprisoned drug lord Jaime Gonz√°lez Dur√°n (alias El Hummer), Osiel appointed Costilla S√°nchez while still in prison, and left his brother Antonio as a representative of his clan. Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, too, was part of the first tier circle, but he headed Los Zetas, while the other two commanded the Gulf Cartel directly. The triumvirate of Antonio Ezequiel, Costilla S√°nchez, and Lazcano controlled the flow of narcotics from the southern state of Quintana Roo to the northern Tamaulipas state. Although initially part of a single command structure during the Osiel era, members within Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel began to follow orders of their respective commanders. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the Gulf Cartel \\"operated with a certain structure that allowed for rivalries among lieutenants to exist without affecting the organization as a whole\\". But with Osiel's absence, several top leaders within the cartel fought to take control of the leadership void. This eventually resulted in the split of the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas in early 2010, prompting daily shootouts and killings from both fronts. The conflict between both groups triggered in Reynosa, Tamaulipas in January 2010, when Samuel Flores Borrego of the Gulf Cartel killed a Zetas leader. When the fighting broke out in Reynosa, Antonio and Los Escorpiones, his private army, made their way into Valle Hermoso, Tamaulipas and took the city from Zetas's control. Several municipal and transit police officers ‚Äì who were on Los Zetas's payroll ‚Äì were hung from light poles as a message from Antonio to his rivals. Death For at least six months, the Mexican Armed Forces were trying to hunt down Antonio Ezequiel, nearly capturing him on two occasions. The drug lord managed to avoid capture in several occasions by relying on the armed squadron known as Los Escorpiones (The Scorpions), which served as his private army. Among the first operations to capture the drug lord occurred on 31 March 2010, when the Mexican military confronted Antonio Ezequiel's bodyguards at Tres Culturas neighborhood in Matamoros. On 7 April 2010, there were two shootouts in Matamoros between Mexican marines and members of the Gulf Cartel. The intelligence information collected in these shootouts allowed the Mexican Armed Forces to locate the domicile of Antonio Ezequiel on 14 September 2010 at Fraccionamiento R√≠o in Matamoros. But heavily armed gunmen of the Gulf Cartel intercepted the raid and protected their leader, who escaped in an armored vehicle. Two military men were killed in the operation, but the government managed to gain more information on the logistics of the inner circle of Antonio Ezequiel. On 1 November 2010, the Mexican authorities learned once again that Antonio Ezequiel was spending the night in a safe house at the Expo Fiesta Oriente neighborhood in Matamoros. But before the authorities got to the location, the drug lord left and avoided his capture. Antonio Ezequiel was killed on 5 November 2010 following an eight-hour shootout between gunmen of the Gulf Cartel and soldiers of the Mexican Navy in his hometown of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Government sources claimed that this operation‚Äîwhere more than 660 marines, 17 vehicles, and 3 helicopters participated‚Äîleft 10 dead: three marines, one soldier, four Gulf Cartel gunmen, journalist Carlos Alberto Guajardo Romero, and the drug lord Antonio Ezequiel. The shootout began at around 10:00 a.m. and extended to 6:00 p.m., when Antonio Ezequiel and gunmen of his inner circle were killed. The intensity of the shootout forced the temporary closure of the international bridges that connect Matamoros with the US border city of Brownsville, Texas, along with the University of Texas at Brownsville, which sits on the edge of the Rio Grande River. The daylight clashes generated a wave of panic among the citizens of Matamoros, who turned to social networks like Twitter and Facebook to report the violence. \\"Shelter, everyone! Don't leave your houses please. Pass the word,\\" read one tweet. People hid inside their homes or in windowless offices, sometimes peaking to see the cartel mayhem. Witnesses reported seeing military men carrying guns, and armed Gulf Cartel members in their own military uniforms. Power went out in several parts of downtown Matamoros, where most of the heavy gunfighting took place. Communication equipment, like cellphones and radios, were not working. Gulf Cartel gunmen hijacked several buses to block roads all across the city to prevent the mobilization of the Mexican Armed Forces. Hovering helicopters from the Navy shot down at Antonio Ezequiel's henchmen. \\"The city was paralyzed,\\" said an office worker who hid for hours inside a building. \\"It was a nightmare. It went on and on.\\" News reports described 5 November 2010 as one of Matamoros's bloodiest days. When the military arrived at Antonio Ezequiel's location in downtown Matamoros to arrest him at 3:30 p.m., his gunmen tried to protect the drug lord by launching several grenades and shooting at the officers. At the scene, at least 300 grenades were detonated, and gunfire perforated the building where Antonio Ezequiel hid. Gulf Cartel snipers, who hid in the rooftops of the drug lord's hiding place, shot at the Mexican marines, who later entered the building and killed Antonio Ezequiel and several bodyguards of his inner circle. Contrary to government reports, the newspapers The Brownsville Herald and The Monitor, which are based in the Rio Grande Valley, reported that at least 47 dead from the shootings that broke out on 5 November 2010 in Matamoros. According to an anonymous source inside of Mexican law enforcement, at least 30 people had been killed by noon; by the afternoon, 17 had been gunned down near the Matamoros city hall in the downtown area by grenades and heavy-calibre gunshots. Other sources varied in their countdown. Some local sources suggest that 55 or more people had been killed in the shootout. Comments left by readers at The Brownsville Herald and its sister page El Heraldo reported at least 70 dead. Although not officially confirmed, an anonymous law enforcement officer, KVEO-TV, and several online sources and witnesses mentioned that the two-day death toll in Matamoros may have \\"easily passed\\" 100. However, the exact figures of those killed in Matamoros are virtually unknown. Funeral The corpse of Antonio Ezequiel was given to Hermelinda Rivera (wife) and Carla Elizabeth C√°rdenas Rivera (daughter) by the PGR at the Servicio M√©dico forensic installations in Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas on 9 November 2010. The family of the drug lord had plans to carry out a funeral in memory of him. Aftermath Antonio Ezequiel was killed by the Mexican Navy at around 6:00 p.m. in downtown Matamoros on 5 November 2010, but the roadblocks set by organized crime continued throughout the rest of the day. The drug lord had reportedly called for backup when he was surrounded by the Navy, but when he was killed, his reinforcements from Reynosa, Tamaulipas (which consisted of over 80 SUVs filled with gunmen) dispersed. The international bridges in Matamoros were reopened by 7:00 p.m. after crowds of people had waited all afternoon. In Reynosa at around 9:15 p.m., a grenade exploded inside a vehicle parked outside Plaza Real, the busiest shopping center in the city and just four miles away from the Hidalgo‚ÄìReynosa International Bridge. Reynosa also reported several shootings between the Mexican Army and organized crime on the highway that connects the city with the border town of Matamoros. In the municipalities of San Fernando, R√≠o Bravo, Jaumave, D√≠az Ordaz, Nuevo Laredo, Ciudad Mier, Guerrero, Miguel Alem√°n, Valle Hermoso, and Ciudad Victoria, most of the daily city activities were cancelled throughout the whole day. Organized crime gunmen and risk situations were reported in these areas, too. Early in the morning the next day, some of the residents in Matamoros went to the site where most of the heavy fighting took place. They stood at awe as they looked at the bullet- ridden cement building and the shattered windows. Since the early morning, gossip started to surround the death of Antonio Ezequiel. Sporadic gunfire was reported in the city and in Valle Hermoso, Tamaulipas, a city south of Matamoros. Grenade attacks and armed confrontations reportedly resulted in several casualties throughout Matamoros; in Valle Hermoso, only four deaths were unofficially confirmed. Law enforcement officials confirmed that an armed confrontation broke out between gunmen of Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel in Ejido Las Rusias neighborhood, and shootouts in the Lauro Villar and Roberto Guerra avenues in Matamoros. The casualties in these confrontations were difficult to calculate because both criminal organizations picked up the corpses of their fallen comrades and reportedly disposed them in clandestine graves. Roadblocks imposed by organized crime were set up in Reynosa following the death of Antonio Ezequiel, but it is unclear if they were directly related to his death. Phone services in the area continued to remain sporadic, with residents only able to use them at random hours of the day. With Antonio Ezequiel dead, Los Zetas celebrated the death of their rival's leader by hanging banners at pedestrian bridges in several cities in northeastern Mexico, where they mocked his brother Osiel and the Gulf Cartel. Pamphlets written with \\"z\\" instead of \\"s\\" were distributed across Matamoros with a message by Los Zetas to the general population and to members of the rival Gulf Cartel. \\"The group of Loz Zetaz is informing you and giving you the opportunity to join with no hard feelingz,\\" one of the pamphlets read. \\"Those who don't loze their head and their dezcendants.\\" Other banners with similar messages were put up in other states besides Tamaulipas. In the state of Veracruz, they were put up in the municipalities of Boca del R√≠o, Medell√≠n de Bravo, Poza Rica, Acayucan, Coatzacoalcos, Mart√≠nez de la Torre, P√°nuco, Pueblo Viejo, Tampico Alto and Tantoyuca. In Nuevo Le√≥n, most of the banners were put up in Monterrey, but the authorities also reported in the municipalities of Cadereyta, Ju√°rez, Guadalupe and San Pedro Garza Garc√≠a. More banners were reported in San Luis Potos√≠, Oaxaca, and Quintana Roo. On 6 November 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama contacted former Mexican President Felipe Calder√≥n by phone and expressed his full support to put an end to the impunity of Mexico's organized crime syndicates. He expressed his condolences for the Mexican servicemen and the journalist that died in the operative. Among the most intense battles between the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas following the death of Antonio Ezequiel occurred in Ciudad Mier, Tamaulipas, a small, painteresque town on the U.S.-Mexico border. Roughly five days after the drug lord's death, over 300 people left the town to shelter in the nearby city of Miguel Alem√°n, while others left to seek refuge with family members that resided in Starr and Zapata County in Texas. Ciudad Mier experienced rounds of drug cartel violence because the area is a strategic route for drug traffickers. The highway that connects Ciudad Mier with Monterrey is a lucrative smuggling route for narcotics. The Mexican government responded to the citizens' plea by sending reinforcements to restore order because the violence had been \\"non-stop in Ciudad Mier since [Antonio Ezequiel's] death.\\" But by the end of 2010, around 95% of the population in Ciudad Mier had left and relocated elsewhere due to the violence generated by Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel. In 2011, President Calder√≥n visited the border town and inaugurated a military barrack for the 105th battalion in the municipality. After long periods of sporadic violence, Ciudad Mier returned to normal in early 2013. Residents credit the presence of the Mexican Armed Forces for returning peace to the border town. \\"Thanks to the army, families are coming back,\\" said a school principal from Ciudad Mier. Antonio Ezequiel was succeeded by Costilla S√°nchez and his brother Mario C√°rdenas Guill√©n, arrested on 3 September 2012. His nephew Rafael C√°rdenas Vela became the regional leader of the Gulf Cartel in Matamoros but he was displaced by Costilla S√°nchez and was arrested on 20 October 2011. A month later in November 2011, Antonio Ezequiel's son Ezequiel C√°rdenas Rivera was arrested by the Navy along with for other Gulf Cartel members in Matamoros. Since Antonio Ezequiel was killed, the Gulf Cartel separated into two different factions: Los Rojos, a group loyal to the C√°rdenas Guill√©n family; and Los Metros, a group started by Costilla S√°nchez. Analysis of repercussions Shortly after Antonio Ezequiel was killed, a mood of uncertainty surrounded civilians and authorities. Most feared that his death would shake the criminal underworld in Tamaulipas and herald more violence from Los Zetas, who might look to carry out a full-scale incursion in the Gulf Cartel territories and carry out kidnappings, extortions, and other violent acts in the state. Malcolm Beith, author of the book \\"The Last Narco\\", stated shortly after Antonio Ezequiel's death that Zeta leader Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano was possibly going to move deep into Tamaulipas and try to fight the remaining forces of the Gulf Cartel, thereby creating more violence. Researcher Humberto Palomares said, \\"They [the government] cut off one head and many more grow back [and create violence]\\", in reference to the fall of Antonio Ezequiel. Stratfor and border security expert Sylvia Longmire, however, believed that Antonio Ezequiel's death was not going to drastically alter the dynamics of the criminal world, and that his absence may possibly bring some level of relative peace in the Tamaulipas area. The intelligence agency stated that Antonio Ezequiel was only a leader in the Gulf Cartel because of his brother Osiel; Costilla S√°nchez, on the other hand, was the one who actually controlled the day-to-day operations. Antonio Ezequiel was also known for his explosive personality and cocaine addiction. It was rumored that the drug lord was hot-tempered and lived an outlandish lifestyle, and that many commanders within the Gulf Cartel believed in more than one occasion that his position as leader threatened the whole organization. Longmire believed that Los Zetas would move into Reynosa and Matamoros shortly after the drug lord's death to \\"test the waters\\", but she stated that the Gulf Cartel, under the command of Costilla S√°nchez, stood a chance to fight them off and continue its illicit activities. Former President Felipe Calderon made taking down drug kingpins a security priority of his political administration (2006‚Äì2012). His aggressive campaign against organized crime successfully removed many drug cartel leaders from Mexico's leading drug trafficking organizations. However, his strategy has also been criticized for sparking more violence. When a drug baron is arrested or killed, the criminal organization may experiences a leadership void, which leads to infighting for succession, possible fragmentation, and new competition from other crime syndicates. This practice, commonly referred to as the \\"kingpin strategy\\", worked to bring down the hegemony of the Cali and the Medell√≠n Cartels in Colombia in the 1990s. But its implementation in Mexico has brought more violence and has led to instability in the criminal underworld. However, the Mexican government provides a different interpretation of the strategy. They suggest that violence does not increase in Mexico's already violent states, and that troops are sent when violence already exists in an area. Therefore, the strategy is a product, not the cause, of the violence. Los Escorpiones Antonio Ezequiel commanded an elite enforcer group known as Los Escorpiones (The Scorpions), which served as his private army during the 5 November 2010 shootout in Matamoros that resulted in the drug lord's death. Los Escorpiones reportedly set up roadblocks, rocket-propelled grenade attacks, and snipers to prevent the capture of their leader. According to the PGR and the Mexican Armed Forces, the group was originally formed by Antonio Ezequiel in 2002 as a parallel to his brother's personal army, Los Zetas. However, his brother Osiel never approved of the group's creation and subsequently cut all communication with him, although he allowed him to work on his own. Known for their brutal tactics, Los Escorpiones is composed of at least 60 former state, judicial, and municipal police officers. The enforcer group served as the armed wing of the Gulf Cartel, and they were key in the territorial war against Los Zetas in Reynosa and Matamoros in the first half of 2010. Along with Antonio Ezequiel, the following members of Los Escorpiones were killed on 5 November 2010 in Matamoros: Sergio Antonio Fuentes (alias El Tyson or Escorpi√≥n 1); Ra√∫l Marmolejo G√≥mez (alias Escorpi√≥n 18) Hugo Lira (alias Escorpi√≥n 26) and Refugio Adalberto Vargas Cort√©s (alias Escorpi√≥n 42). The arrests of Marco Antonio Cortez Rodr√≠guez (alias Escorpi√≥n 37) and of Josu√© Gonz√°lez Rodr√≠guez (alias Escorpi√≥n 43) allowed the authorities to understand the structure of Los Escorpiones. There are several music videos on YouTube that exalt the power of Los Escorpiones through narcocorridos, a Mexican drug ballad that tells stories of drug lords and their exploits.  Charges and bounty  Antonio Ezequiel was one of the eleven most-wanted Mexican fugitives sought by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He was charged in a 2008 federal indictment in the District of Columbia, and the United States Department of State was offering a reward of up to US$5 million for information leading to his arrest and/or conviction. The Mexican government under the Attorney General of Mexico (PGR) was offering a $30 million pesos bounty (about US$2.5 million). According to the U.S. Department of State and the DEA, Antonio Ezequiel was 6 ft (1.83 m) tall, and weighed approximately 215 lbs (97.5 kilos). He had an alternative date of birth on 5 May 1962. He had black- colored hair and brown eyes, and his aliases were Marcos Ledezma, El Licenciado (The Certified or The Lawyer), and Tony Tormenta (Tony the Storm), which he earned for his explosive personality and for beheading and torturing his rivals. Kingpin Act sanction On 20 July 2009, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Antonio Ezequiel under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the \\"Kingpin Act\\"), for his involvement in drug trafficking along with three other international criminals. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S.  See also  * Mexican Drug War References Bibliography * Category:1962 births Category:2010 deaths Category:Gulf Cartel members Category:People of the Mexican Drug War Category:Mexican drug traffickers Category:Mexican money launderers Category:People from Matamoros, Tamaulipas Category:People shot dead by law enforcement officers in Mexico Category:People sanctioned under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act Category:People involved in the 1999 Matamoros standoff ","title":"Antonio C√°rdenas Guill√©n"},{"id":"24035661","text":"The 93rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry (or 93rd OVI) was an infantry regiment in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

RESCOs include investor owned, publicly owned, cooperatives, and community organisations.  Main characteristics  The main characteristics of a RESCO are: * The household serviced does not own the generation equipment, which is owned by an external organisation such as a Government agency or the RESCO; * The user does not carry out maintenance, all maintenance and repair service is provided by the RESCO; * The user pays a service charge that covers the capital repayment requirement and the cost of providing for maintenance and repairs. The concept is much like that of a conventional electric utility in that the generation equipment is not owned by the user and the electricity that is generated is made available to the customer for a fee. The fee charged to the user includes any required capital replacement cost and all operating, maintenance and repair costs plus a profit for the operating organisation. There are two significant differences between the conventional utility approach and that of the RESCO. For a RESCO: * Generation may be distributed among many households instead of being centralised at a power station; * Many organisations regulated by the government may provide services independently of each other.  RESCOs & rural electrification  RESCOs have been very successful in the expansion of rural electrification projects worldwide because: * Low income rural households receive electricity without having to invest in renewable energy equipment, something that they would not normally be able to afford due to the high initial cost. * Equipment is properly maintained and components replaced by the RESCO, making sure that the service is not interrupted, * Equipment is owned by an organization that directly or indirectly represents the users (beneficiaries of the funding). As a result of all this, donors are prepared to contribute with funding to the RESCO concept because it makes their aid (1) effective, (2) sustainable and (3) accountable.Akura, Terubentau & Torra Griso, Marc \\"Solar Home Systems Technical & Management Model in Kiribati\\". SOPAC Regional Energy Meeting , Tonga, 20 ‚Äì 24 April 2009  RESCOs in the Pacific  Pacific Governments have provided rural electrification to remote locations by means of four main institutional set- ups, which are: * Engaging the power utility in carrying out the rural electrification. This is the approach followed in Marshall Islands by the Marshall Electric Company (MEC) or in the Federated States of Micronesia by the Yap State Public Service Corporation (YSPSC) and the Chuuk Power Utility Corporation (CPUC). * Setting up a different entity for the rural electrification (RESCO), but still centralising much of the decision making process in Government officials through the nomination of a board of directors. This is the strategy applied in Kiribati, with the Kiribati Solar Energy Company Ltd (KSEC). * Decentralising operation and maintenance by engaging the private sector, while keeping the ownership of the equipment in the hands of a government department. This is the solution followed in Fiji with the RESCO charter and in Pohnpei State (Federated States of Micronesia). * Decentralising operation and maintenance by engaging the users, and transferring ownership of the equipment to the organisation that represents them. This was the solution followed in Tonga though the Ha'apai District Solar Electricity Committee before deciding to engage the power utility in providing the service.

A Rose page 255 In Pakistan, the community is often referred to as Gadi Rajput, and sometimes Gaddi.  History and origin  There a number of theories as to the origin of the Gaddi community. In South Asia, there are two distinct groups who go by the name Gaddi. In the foothills of the Himalaya, in what are now the state of Himachal Pradesh and the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir resides a Hindu nomadic community known as the Gaddi. The Muslim Gaddi of North India is not an alpine community, but are found in the plains of North India, distributed in the states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, and have never been nomadic. Prior to the independence in 1947, Muslim Gaddi communities were also found in Haryana. In fact, it is unclear whether there is any connection between the two groups other than the sharing of a common name.A Glossary of the Tribes & Castes of Punjab by H. A Rose page 255 With regards to the Muslim Gaddi, there are different theories as to their origin. According to some sources, the Gaddi are said to be Gurelbansi ganda, who were converted to Islam, during the rule of the Mughals, although the exact circumstances of their conversion are unclear.People of India: Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part two by K S Singh page 475 Manohar Publications While in Haryana and Rajasthan, the Gaddi themselves claim to be of Rajput origin, and those of Bihar claim Arab ancestry.

This is shown by the fact that most Gaddi in Bihar and Jharkhand still speak Bhojpuri, the language of eastern Uttar Pradesh, and not the local Sadri language.People of India Bihar Volume XVI Part One edited by S Gopal & Hetukar Jha pages 306 to 310 Seagull Books According to some other sources, they were the earliest inhabitants of Awadh, and this region they are often also referred. .Tribes and Castes of North Western Provinces and Oudh Volume II by William Crooke pages 370 to 372 A Research Book (in Urdu) on Gaddi casts has been written by Abdul Jabbar Khan, A Gaddi Scholar, discussing all casts and sub casts of Gaddi present in India and Pakistan . The Origin and the initial use of Word \\"Gaddi\\" is discussed in detail in the book.Qaum Gaddi (Gaddi Cast), Afghan or Rajput in the light of indopak history. By Abdul Jabbar Gaddi The Gaddi have five sub- divisions, which are the Sadhre, Nyodha, Othi, Badgaia, and Swaetye. Like many other Muslims groups in North India, the Gaddi community is further divided into clans, known as biradaris, which are said to be descended from a common ancestor. Their main biradaris are the Aheer, Ahawar, Bachhar, Bais, and teli Malik. Marriages are preferred within the biradari. Their hereditary occupation was that of the production and sale of milk, but the Muslim Gaddi of Karnal and Ambala in Haryana, and the Doab region of western Uttar Pradesh were and still are mainly peasant cultivators. The Gaddi speak Urdu and well as various dialects of Hindi, such as Khari boli in western Uttar Pradesh, Haryanvi in Pakistan and Bhojpuri in Bihar.People of India: Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part two by K S Singh page 475 Manohar Publications  Present circumstances  The Gaddi are found throughout the states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan in India and have OBC status, and the provinces of Punjab and Sindh. As consequence of the grant of OBC status, the community is eligible to obtain the benefit of a number of affirmitative action programmes of the Government of India.  In India  In North India, the Gaddi are a community that has been associated with cattle farming. They are involved in the selling of milk, especially those settled in towns. They have much in common with other pastoral communities, In addition, the western Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana the Gaddi have always possessed agricultural land, and are a small and medium scale cultivators. However, in eastern Uttar Pradesh, the word Gaddi is almost become synonymous with milk selling.Social inequality among Indian Muslims Parvez A. Abbasi Published 1999 by A.C. Brothers in Udaipur . In Uttar Pradesh, Gaddis are found mainly in the eastern and western regions of the state, in the districts of Allahabad (on the bank of river Ganges), Aligarh, Kanpur, Unnao, Meerut, Badayun, Badohi, Sitapur, sandila, hardoi, lucknow, Lakhimpur, Bareilly, and Bahraich.People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part two by K S Singh page 478 Manohar Publications However, the community is concentrated mainly in western Uttar Pradesh, in particular the districts of Meerut, Bulandshahr and Aligarh and historically in the neighbouring areas of Haryana such as Karnal and Ambala.Tribes and Castes of North Western Provinces and Oudh Volume II by William Crooke pages 370 to 372 The western Uttar Pradesh Gaddi, like other neighbouring peasant castes have benefited from the effects of the green revolution, and many have successfully begun mechanising their farming, such as buying tractors.Social inequality among Indian Muslims Parvez A. Abbasi Published 1999 by A.C. Brothers in Udaipur . The Gaddi are Muslims of the Sunni sect. They are an endogamous community, practising clan and village exogamy in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh (i.e. not marrying within the clan). Among other Gaddi communities, marriages are preferred within the biradari, and with a marked preference for parallel cousin and cross cousin marriages. The Gaddi tend to reside in multi clan and multi religious villages, often occupying their own quarters. In western Uttar Pradesh, the Gaddi are what is often referred to as the dominant clan, usually making between half and two thirds of the population of the village, and their villages are referred to as Gaddi villages.Social inequality among Indian Muslims Parvez A. Abbasi Published 1999 by A.C. Brothers in Udaipur . In Awadh, Bihar and Jharkhand the Gaddi are often one of the occupational clans, and are never numerically dominant. Each of their settlement contains an informal clan association, known as a biradari panchayat. The panchayat is headed by a chaudhary, a position that is often hereditary within a particular family. Among the duties of the panchayat is the resolving of intra community disputes and punishing those who breach community norms.People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part two by K S Singh page 478 Manohar Publications The Gaddi in Rajasthan are found mainly in Bundi, Bharatpur, and Sawai Madhopur districts.all most gaddi clan live in sawai Madhopur and gangapur city and coloney 1-(rajeev coloney, gaddi mirzapur, namner and village Mahanandpur(Doyda), pawta. They speak a mixed dialect of Hindi and Urdu, as well as the Marwari dialect. According to their traditions, they acquired the name Gaddi from their ancestral occupation of cleaning the thrones (Gaddi in Urdu) of the Mughal Emperors. The community claims to be of Rajput ancestry that converted to Islam. In Rajasthan, the community consists of small and medium-sized farmers. A small member of Gaddi are employed govt sarvis, The Gaddi of Rajasthan have their own clan council, the Gaddi Navayung Mandal, which act as institution for social control as well as welfare for the community. Like other Muslim communities in Rajasthan, they are strictly endogamous.People of India: Rajasthan Volume XXXVIII Part One edited by B.K Lavania, D.

They are said to have emigrated from Uttar Pradesh in the 19th century, and their earliest settlement was Bihar Sharif. The Gaddi are found in Ranchi, Dhanbad, Lohardaga, Chakradharpur, Rohtas and Jameshedpur. The Gaddi are strictly endogamous, and practice both cross-cousin and parallel cousin marriages. They speak both Urdu and Bhojpuri. The Gaddi of Bihar are largely landless, relying on the selling of milk, and are a semi- urban community. A small number of the community have become businessmen and petty traders. The Gaddi have their own clan association, the Bihar Gaddi Anjuman.People of India Bihar Volume XVI Part One edited by S Gopal & Hetukar Jha pages 306 to 310 Seagull Books  In Pakistan  The Haryana and Delhi Gaddi emigrated to Pakistan, after the independence in 1947. In the Ambala and Karnal, the Gaddi were already a community of small cultivators, and they remain so in Pakistan. According to the traditions of the Haryana Gaddi, they are a Rajput clan, that is believed to have accepted Islam during reign of Sultan Mahmood Ghazanwi, and as such the community refers to itself as Gadi Rajputs. The Gaddi are now found mainly in central and south Punjab, in the districts of Muzaffargarh, Okara, Shaikhupura, Gujranwala and Nankana Sahib . They are particularly concentrated in the districts of Gujranwala and Shaikhupura District Bhakkar, and towns of Kot Addu and Kundhya. The Punjab Gaddi live in multi ethnic villages, but occupy their own distinct quarters. Most Gaddi remain small and medium scale farmers, although a good number also seek in employment in the armed forces and police. Like in India, most Gaddi settlements contain biradari panchayats, which act as instruments of social control, and they remain strictly endogamous, preferring to marry close kin, such as parallel cousins. The community speak Haryanvi among themselves, and Punjabi with the wider community. Most Gaddi also now speak Urdu, and are Sunni. The Gaddis of Delhi and Rajasthan have settled in Sindh and are still involved with dairy farming, and are found mainly in the cities of Karachi, Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas. They speak Haryanvi among themselves and Urdu with outsiders. Many of those settled in Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas also speak Sindhi. The Gaddi have set up their own clan association, the All Pakistan Anjuman-e-Biradri Gaddi, which has set up community centres and acts a community welfare association. Besides these, in Karachi, they have a separate community registered with the name \\"Anjuman Rajput Gaddi\\" with central office in Ranchore Lane, an old city area of Karachi. This community is living in Karachi since migrating from India after independence in a closed community system having population concentration in Ranchore Lane, Burns Road, its adjoining areas and Mehmoodabad.

The power plant is a run-of-the-river type on Chandra River, a tributary of Chenab River, in the Kishtwar region, a rugged, mountainous section of the Himalayas, and several hundred kilometers from larger cities. It consists of a tall gravity dam which diverts water through a long headrace tunnel to the power station which discharges back into the Chenab. The project provides peaking power to the Northern Grid with beneficiary states being Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Delhi and Union Territory of Chandigarh. It was constructed between 1985 and 2007. Background Begun in 1985, the Dulhasti Power project, set in the northern Indian provinces of Jammu and Kashmir, represents an example of a disaster in project cost estimation and delivery. As initially conceived, the project's cost was estimated at 1.6 billion rupees (about $50 million). By the time the contract was let, the cost estimate had risen to 4.5 billion rupees and later successively to 8, 11, 16, and 24 billion rupees (nearly $750 million). The project became operational on 7 April 2007 and has been generating 1907 Million Units of electricity in a 90% Dependable year. Contracting and design The contract for the power generation project was first awarded to a French consortium at a price of $50 million, who almost immediately asked for an upward price revision. The site was intended to capitalize on the proximity to a large river systems capable of providing the water capacity needed to run a hydroelectric plant of Dulhasti's dimensions. Unfortunately, the site selected for the project came with some serious drawbacks as well. First, it was sited in the disputed border region between Pakistan and India. Jammu and Kashmir have been the epicenter of numerous and serious clashes between separatist forces demanding independence and Indian army . Constructing such an obvious target as a power plant in the disputed area was sure to provoke reaction by militant groups, using it as their chief means of opposition. Thus, the additional costs of providing security to the site quickly became prohibitively expensive. A second problem concerns the sheer geographical challenge of creating a large plant in a region almost totally devoid of supporting infrastructure, including an adequate logistics network (roads and rail lines). Building the plant in the foothills of the Himalayas may be scenic, but it is not cost effective, particularly as almost all supplies had to be brought in with air transportation, at exorbitant costs. All raw materials, including cement, wood, stone, and steel, had to be hauled by helicopter for miles over snowbound areas.

The band was fronted by a male and a female vocalist, and produced music that is said to \\"transcend the boundaries\\" of its genre in creativity. CCM magazine likened their music to that of Sixpence None the Richer, Jars of Clay and Out of the Grey. Background The band began with the trio of Stef Loy (an American), Bo H, and Mangus Sjolander (both Swedes), who were in a band, Perry and the Poor Boys, who released one album, No Fear in Love, under this configuration in 1992. After several years of worldwide tours, the band found themselves back in Sweden. They began adding members, including Sooi Groeneveld van der Laan (Dutch) as vocalist. Their debut, She Walks Alone With Me, was released in 1994. The song \\"Black Lips Saturday\\" was their biggest hit, earning the band airplay in Europe. The band experienced some success through Europe, and the release was picked up by a British label. However, they found roadblocks from the American market, and were unable to book shows due to the diversity of countries that they lived in. Their second effort was produced by Armand John Petri to build an American-friendly pop sound. According to frontman Stef Loy \\"Armand... thought we should settle down on the first [U.S.] effort. He helped me relearn how to write pop songs.\\" \\"He stripped down the music, and we had to rebuild it again.\\" The effort was successful as the band gained the attention of multiple American labels. They eventually signed with Atlanta-based Gray Dot Records, releasing All Good Weeds Grow Up in 1998. The band once again produced themselves for the third album, Moth & Rust, released in 1999. According to the band, this record became more of a lyrical than musical an exploration. \\"Previous CDs have been either therapy for the songwriter or fun lyrical meanderings. This... is the first time I actually have a message [directed toward] the listener,\\" songwriter Stef Loy explained, \\"Now I‚Äôm trying purposely to give the listener something to think about.\\" The albums' title and primary message were taken from Matthew 6:19‚Äì20. The album is themed on philosophical and spiritual points such as the decline of morality and absolutes, and hidden dangers in the American Dream.

It also stars actor Dennis O'Keefe and singers Carmen Miranda and Perry Como. The film is also known as Come Back to Me in the United Kingdom. Plot summary \\"Doll Face\\" Carroll is an entertainer looking to expand her repertoire. After a failed audition, where she is recognized as a burlesque performer from the Gaiety Theatre, her manager and fianc√© Mike Hannegan suggest she writes an autobiography to project a more literate image and he hires Frederick Manly Gerard as a ghostwriter. Doll Face agrees on the condition she is allowed to dedicate the book to Mike with \\"For the love of Mike\\". Another performer in the burlesque show, Chita Chula, remarks that if the book is a success and Doll Face leaves the show it will probably have to close down. Mike then decides to produce a Broadway show of his own with the financial aid of the performers themselves. Frederick offers to put up any money missing. Chita Chula (portrayed by Carmen Miranda) is skeptical she can pull it off, but Mike assures her she'll \\"probably wound up being another Carmen Miranda!\\", something Chita Chula perceives as an insult. Mike leaks word on the book to the press and, riding the publicity, argues the show got all the press it needs and that the book, although all but finished, needs not to be published. Doll Face, however, decides to go through with it and goes to Jamaica with Frederick for some final touch-ups. Boat engine trouble leaves them marooned on an island and, when Mike finds them, he misreads the situation and breaks up with her. Without \\"Doll Face\\" as headliner, the Gaiety Theatre struggles and Mike is forced to finally shut it down. Doll Face releases her book The Genius DeMilo and when Mike sees she dedicated the book to Frederick instead of him, he regrets leaving her. After Doll Face refuses to talk to Mike, he sends a lawyer to stop her show in the middle of opening night, since she is under contract not to appear in any show not produced by him. She agrees to see him and he asks her forgiveness. After they reunite, she tricks the producer of her show to give Mike a 25% share and co-producer credit so the show can continue. Differences from play The film is based on the 1943 play The Naked Genius written by Gypsy Rose Lee. In the opening credits, she is billed under her birth name, Louise Hovick.

Production and filming Title card of Doll Face. The film is also known as Come Back to Me in the United Kingdom. Other titles considered during production were The Naked Genius (from Gypsy Rose Lee's play) and Here's a Kiss. The working titles of this film were The Naked Genius and Here's a Kiss. The Motion Picture Production Code did not allow the studio to use The Naked Genius neither as the title of the film nor as title of \\"Doll Face's\\" fictional autobiography. The Production Code Administration also strongly protested the depiction of the lead character as a stripper and several screenplays submitted by the studio were not approved. In late July 1945, Production Code Administration head Joseph I. Breen cautioned studio public relations head Jason S. Joy: Playwright and renowned stripper, Gypsy Rose Lee, was credited onscreen using her real name Louise Hovick. The Hollywood Reporter (6 April 1944) wrote that the producer George Jessel had offered Lee a role in the picture, but she did not appear in the film. According to The Hollywood Reporter (June 1944), Carole Landis would star in the film and Jackie Gleason would perform the \\"comedy lead\\", and yet another news item (July 1945) reported that William Eythe was scheduled to play the \\"romantic lead\\", and that fifteen-year-old singer Hazel Dawn had been included in the cast. However, Dawn's appearance in the completed picture has not been confirmed. Dennis O'Keefe was borrowed for the film from Edward Small's company. Doll Face was the screen debuts of Martha Stewart and Lex Barker. Producer Bryan Foy, filled in for director Lewis Seiler for three days while Seiler was ill. Jimmy McHugh and Harold Adamson submitted the song \\"True to the Navy\\" for inclusion in the film and a production number featuring it was filmed at a cost between $60,000 and $75,000. However, McHugh and Adamson had previously submitted the song to Paramount which had used it in their 1945 film Bring on the Girls. Paramount refused to license the song for use in Doll Face, and the musical number had to be cut. In a December 1945 letter to Twentieth Century-Fox studio president Spyros Skouras, studio attorney George Wasson speculated that Paramount refused to license the song because Twentieth Century-Fox had obtained the distribution rights to Tales of Manhattan and clearance for the use of the title Sentimental Journey, both of which Paramount also wanted. Chorus performs \\"Dig You Later (A-Hubba Hubba Hubba)\\" in the Show-within-a-show. A suit was filed against the studio for plagiarizing another composition. According to the legal records, Irving Weissman filed suit against the studio, claiming that the song \\"Dig You Later (A Hubba-Hubba-Hubba)\\" was plagiarized from one of his compositions. The case was dismissed in September 1948 by a federal court judge, but Weissman again filed suit through a state court. The disposition of the second suit has not been determined.

The discussion brings into consideration the Jewish understanding of nature, and its reciprocal, the miraculous. This analysis thus underpins much of Orthodox Judaism's world view, particularly as regards questions of interaction with the natural world. Classical Jewish philosophy Divine providence is discussed by all of the major Jewish philosophers, but its extent and nature is a matter of dispute.\\"Jewish Philosophy\\" Dagobert D. Runes, Dictionary of Philosophy, 1942. There are, broadly, two views, differing largely as to the frequency with which God intervenes in the natural order. The first view admits a frequency of miracles. Here there is a stability of the natural order which nevertheless allows for the interference of God in the regulation of human events, or even in disturbing the natural order on occasion. The second, rationalist view does not deny the occurrence of miracles, but attempts to limit it, and will rationalize the numerous miraculous events related in the Bible and bring them within the sphere of the natural order. Nachmanides Nachmanides The teachings of Nachmanides are largely representative of the first view. He holds that the Creator endowed the universe with physical properties, and sustains the natural order, and that any act of providence involves, by definition, an intrusion into the laws of nature. In the absence of providential interference, cause and effect governs the affairs of the universe. In Ramban's view, reward and punishment ‚Äî as well as guidance of the fate of Israel ‚Äî are the typical expressions of such providence (see Ramban: Torat Hashem Temimah). In this sense there is no difference between God causing it to rain (as a reward) and his separating the waters of the Red Sea. Both are the result of Divine intervention. All events (natural or providential) are the result of the direct will of God, and, as such, the seemingly natural order of the world is an illusion. At the same time, any (obvious) breach in the chain of causality involves a \\"compromise\\" in the default cause and effect nature of the universe ‚Äî providence is thus exercised sparingly, and in a \\"seemingly natural\\" manner (Genesis 6:19 ad loc). Thus, whereas the fate of the Jews as a nation is guided by providence, individuals do not enjoy the same providential relationship with the Almighty. Only the righteous and the wicked can expect providential treatment. The fate of more ‚Äúaverage‚Äù individuals is primarily guided by natural law (Deuteronomy 11:13 ad loc). Maimonides Maimonides is representative of the rationalist school. He holds that the pattern of nature is basically immutable.The Purpose of Signs and Miracles According to the Ramban , R. Ezra Bick, vbm-torah.org \\"This Universe remains perpetually with the same properties with which the Creator has endowed it ... none of these will ever be changed except by way of miracle in some individual instances\\", (The Guide for the Perplexed, 2:29)., 2:29 This notwithstanding, Maimonides believes that God rewards and punishes appropriately. To some extent, Maimonides reconciles the two views by defining providence as an essentially natural process. Here individual providence depends on the development of the human mind: that is, the more a man develops his mind the more he is subject to the providence of God. Providence is, in fact, a function of intellectual and spiritual activity: it is the activity, not the person that merits providence. \\"Divine Providence is connected with Divine intellectual influence, and the same beings which are benefited by the latter so as to become intellectual, and to comprehend things comprehensible to rational beings, are also under the control of Divine Providence, which examines all their deeds in order to reward or punish them.\\" (The Guide for the Perplexed 3:17).See also: Mishna Rosh Hashanah: 3:8 discussing various episodes in the desert, and concluding that the Miraculous occurred only \\"when Israel looked upwards and subjected their hearts to their Father in Heaven\\"; Mesillat Yesharim Ch. 13 which states that \\"it is impossible for all of the individuals within a nation to be on an identical level (levels varying in accordance with intelligence), those individuals who have not completely conditioned themselves for the reception of the love of the Blessed One and of His Divine Presence are enabled to attain to it [only] through the chosen few who have.\\"Consistent with Maimonides, Sefer ha-Chinuch - 512 Not to mutter incantations, on Deuteronomy 18:11 ‚Äì states that the practice of saying Tehillim in times of need is designed not to achieve divine favour, but rather to inculcate into one‚Äôs consciousness the idea of divine providence. Further, by defining providence as function of human activity, Maimonides avoids the problem of how God can be affected by events on Earth, lessening any implication of change within God and the resultant implication of a lack of perfection\\"How bad things can happen to good people\\" Rabbi Gidon Rothstein, Moreh Nevukhim ‚Äî Chapter 51, Part 5 (see Divine simplicity). Maimonides views \\"reward and punishment\\" as manifesting in the World to Come as opposed to in this world (see Talmud, Kiddushin 39b; Pirkei Avot 2:16) ‚Äî he therefore defines divine providence as that which facilitates intellectual attainment as opposed to as an instrument of reward and punishment. Contemporary Orthodox thought Both of the above approaches continue to influence contemporary Orthodox Judaism. In general, Nachmanides' view is influential in Haredi Judaism, while Maimonides' view ‚Äî in addition to Nachmanides' ‚Äî underpins much of Modern Orthodox thought. Note that the Hassidic approach departs somewhat from these; see detail below. The difference between the approaches of Nachmanides and Rambam manifests particularly in the importance assigned to, and attitudes toward, three areas: * Derech Eretz (◊ì◊®◊ö ◊ê◊®◊•): involvement with the natural world, particularly for purposes of livelihood. * Technology: the use and manipulation of nature. * Madda (◊û◊ì◊¢): knowledge of the functioning of nature and society, both to facilitate derech eretz and as a complement to Torah study. Haredi Judaism The view of Rabbi Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler is representative of the Haredi approach. To generalise, Rabbi Dessler\\"Rav Eliyohu Eliezer Dessler, zt'l, His Fiftieth Yahrtzeit\\" Rabbi Dov Wein, Dei'ah veDibur, January 2004 (along with the Chazon Ish) teaches that given the illusory \\"nature of nature\\", each individual must find their appropriate balance between personal effort (hishtadlus / hishtadlut ◊î◊©◊™◊ì◊ú◊ï◊™) and trust (bitochon / bitachon ◊ë◊ô◊ò◊ó◊ï◊ü). \\"Rav Dessler\\", relatedly, often repeated the idea that every object and circumstance in the material world should be viewed as a means of serving Hashem (God).ibid * In line with Ramban, Rabbi Dessler defines nature as the arena of \\"Nisayon\\" (◊†◊°◊ô◊ï◊ü Hebrew: [spiritual] test) ‚Äî i.e. one will engage in derech eretz in inverse proportion to his recognition of God's providential role. Rabbi Dessler thus advises (based on Mesillat Yesharim Ch. 21) that one make his Torah fixed (kavua ◊ß◊ë◊ï◊¢) and his derech eretz temporary and contingent on circumstances (arai ◊¢◊®◊ê◊ô). Note that Rabbi Dessler stresses that \\"[one cannot] exploit a tendency to laziness in order to bolster his bitochon in Hashem (\\"trust in God\\") ... Trust in Hashem cannot be built up this way because the goal here is not to refrain from work but to attain certainty in bitochon in Hashem that leads to lessening worldly endeavors.\\" (Michtav m'Eliyahu, vol. 1. pp. 194‚Äì 5) * Given this conception of nature, Rav Dessler castigates preoccupation with technological enterprises and deems this the equivalent of idolatry. He writes that a civilization which is preoccupied with developing the external and the material, and neglects the inner moral content will eventually degenerate to its lowest possible depths:\\"Cellular Terrorism\\" Rabbi Nosson Grossman, Dei'ah veDibur, May 2001 ‚ÄúHappiness in this world comes only as a result of being content with what one has in this world, and striving intensively for spirituality‚Äù and thus ‚Äúthe more that people try to improve this world, the more their troubles will backlash ... Instead of realizing they are drowning in materialism, they search for further ways to enhance physicality‚Äù (See Michtav m'Eliyahu, vol. 2 p. 236‚Äì310 and vol. 3 pp. 143‚Äì70).See also \\"Do We have a Hammer . . . or a Gun?\\" Mordechai Plaut, Dei'ah veDibur, December 2004 * Rav Dessler writes that the acquisition of secular knowledge is unlikely to be other than at the expense of Torah knowledge. \\"The philosophy of Yeshiva education is directed towards one objective alone, to nurture Gedolei Torah (\\"greats in Torah knowledge\\") and Yirei Shamayim (those \\"fearful of Heaven\\") in tandem. For this reason university was prohibited to [yeshiva] students ... [educators] could not see how to nurture Gedolei Torah unless they directed all education towards Torah exclusively\\" (letter in Michtav m'Eliyahu vol. 3).See also \\"Call to Stand Firm Against Chareidi Yeshiva High Schools\\" Yated Ne'eman Staff, December 2003 Modern Orthodox Judaism Joseph B. Soloveitchik echoes Maimonides‚Äô teaching. He writes that \\"the fundamental of providence is ... transformed into a concrete commandment, an obligation incumbent upon man. Man is obliged to broaden the scope and strengthen the intensity of the individual providence that watches over him. Everything is dependent on him; it is all in his hands\\" (Halakhic Man, p. 128). * In line with this emphasis on proactivity, Modern Orthodox thought regards derech eretz, Man's involvement with the natural world, as a divine imperative inherent in the nature of creation (as opposed to as a \\"necessary evil\\" as above). Here, \\"worldly involvement\\" extends to a positive contribution to general society.\\"Practical Endeavor and the Torah U'Madda Debate\\" Rabbi Dr. David Shatz, Torah U'Madda Volume 3: 1991‚Äì1992 This understanding is reflected both in Soloveitchik's conception as well as in the teachings of Samson Raphael Hirsch; see ◊™◊ï◊®◊î ◊ï◊û◊ì◊¢ - Torah Umadda, ◊™◊ï◊®◊î ◊¢◊ù ◊ì◊®◊ö ◊ê◊®◊• - Torah im Derech Eretz. * Similarly, Soloveitchik, in The Lonely Man of Faith, mandates the involvement of human beings in technological activity. This is based on God's blessing to Adam and Eve \\"Fill the land and conquer it\\" (Genesis 1:28), which extends to the obligation of the imitation of God. The use and development of technology, then, is not characterised as \\"prideful\\", but rather is seen as obligatory upon man. * Further, Madda, knowledge of the natural world and society, is regarded as vital in Modern Orthodox thought. This knowledge plays an obvious role in the facilitation of derech eretz and the development of technology. It is also seen as valuable as a complement to Torah study. This further reflects Maimonides, in that he, famously, defines science and philosophy as \\"Handmaidens\\" of Torah study ‚Äî one could not be a learned Jew without this knowledge.\\"Tinsel Town does Morality\\" Rabbi D Hecht, nishma.org Particular divine providence in Hasidic philosophy The Baal Shem Tov travelled in the Ukrainian Carpathians before his teaching In the Middle Ages, the new discipline in Rabbinic Judaism of classic, Medieval Jewish rationalistic philosophy arose, exemplified by its leading figure Maimonides. It sought to bring the tradition in Western Philosophy of independent thinking from first principles, in support and harmony with rabbinic theology of the Talmud. In Rabbinic Judaism, this approach, which had its supporters and detractors, was called hakirah (\\"investigation\\") to distinguish from other traditions in Jewish thought. Another parallel tradition of kabbalah expressed a mystical exegesis of biblical and rabbinic texts, and a metaphysical theology. Both became part of the canon of Rabbinic literature. The classic figure in Jewish thought, Nachmanides, was one of the early exponents of kabbalah, though his Bible commentary avoids using the direct terminology of kabbalah. As the tradition of kabbalah developed it evolved through the successive stages of medieval kabbalah, exemplified in the Zohar, the 16th-century rational synthesis of Cordoveran Kabbalah, the subsequent new paradigm of cosmic rectification in Lurianic Kabbalah and the 18th-century popularisation of Jewish mysticism in Hasidism. The rebuilt synagogue of the Baal Shem Tov in Medzhybizh The teachings of Hasidic philosophy sought the inner divinity within the esoteric structures of kabbalah, by relating them to their internal correspondence in the daily spiritual life of man. It sought to awaken a personal, psychological perception of godliness in dveikut (mystical joy and cleaving to God). The interpretations of Judaism and Jewish philosophy in Hasidism taught new dimensions of divine unity, omnipresence and individual divine providence. In the new teaching of Yisrael Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism, divine providence governs every detail of Creation. He taught that \\"the movement of a leaf in the wind\\" is a part of the Divine purpose of Creation. Based on the Cosmic \\"Tikkun\\" (Rectification) of Lurianic Kabbalah, everything in creation is part of this messianic rectification, and if it were to be missing, then the rectification would be incomplete. The meaning of this can be understood by considering its background in the esoteric structures of kabbalah, especially the teachings of Isaac Luria. In these new doctrines, our physical world and all its details, take on cosmic significance in the divine scheme of creation. Every action and each person is significant, as it relates to the overall redemption of the fallen nitzutzot (divine sparks from the primordial catastrophe of the \\"Shattering of the Vessels\\" of the world of Tohu). The rectification can only be achieved in this lowest realm. This explains that the reason that most of the mitzvot of Judaism involve action is their metaphysical role in achieving the redemption of the hidden divinity in creation. In the words of Luria, every animate and inanimate object has a spiritual form of \\"soul\\" within its physical form, which is its continual creating source in the Divine Light. Even a stone would have this level of a \\"soul\\" though this is not like the living soul of a plant, the conscious soul of an animal, or the intelligent soul of man. It is rather its animating existence in the Divine Will, as in Jewish mysticism, creation is continuous and would revert to nothingness without the constant divine animation within it. Accordingly, in the words of Luria, \\"every leaf contains a soul that came into the world to receive a Rectification\\". Gilgul (the kabbalistic process of reincarnation), the rectification of an individual soul, becomes a microcosmic reflection in Lurianic Kabbalah, to the macrocosmic divine rectification. In Hasidism, the structural dynamics of this cosmic scheme are followed, but instead are related to their inner Divine dimensions in the direct psychological perception and life of man: The Hasidic relation of the Jewish mystical tradition, to the daily life of the common folk, sanctified the world of the shtetl in the popular imagination. Its charismatic adaptions of the profound thought of Hasidic philosophy, entered Yiddish literature, where the ideas of gilgul and dybuk, and the direct immanent Presence of God, affected secular Jewish culture. Divine unity in Hasidism This mystical interpretation of particular Divine Providence is part of the wider Hasidic interpretation of God's Unity. The second section of the Hasidic text the Tanya by Schneur Zalman of Liadi (Shaar Hayichud Vehaemunah-Gate of Unity and Faith), brings the mystical panentheism of the Baal Shem Tov into philosophical explanation. It explains the Hasidic interpretation of God's Unity in the first two lines of the Shema, based upon their interpretation in kabbalah. The emphasis on divine omnipresence and immanence lies behind Hasidic joy and deveikut, and its stress on transforming the material into spiritual worship. In this internalisation of kabbalistic ideas, the Hasidic follower seeks to reveal the unity of hidden divinity in all activities of life. Nachman of Breslov teaches that big part of choices needs faith or, in other words, good relations are supported by faith. Medieval, Rationalist Jewish Philosophers, such as Maimonides, describe Biblical monotheism to mean that there is only one God, and his essence is a unique, simple, infinite unity. Jewish mysticism gives a further explanation, by distinguishing between God's essence and emanation. In kabbalah and especially Hasidism, God's unity means that there is nothing independent of his essence. The new doctrine in Lurianic Kabbalah of God's tzimtzum (\\"withdrawal\\"), received different interpretations after Isaac Luria, from the literal to the metaphorical. To Hasidism and Schneur Zalman, it is unthinkable for the withdrawal of God that \\"makes possible\\" creation to be taken literally. Tzimtzum only relates to the Ohr Ein Sof (\\"infinite light\\"), not the Ein Sof (divine essence) itself, and involved only apparent concealment, not actual concealment. God's unbounded essence is revealed in both complementary infinitude (infinite light) and finitude (finite light). The withdrawal was only the illusion of concealment of the infinite light into the essence of God, to allow the latent potentially finite light to emerge apparent to creation after the tzimtzum. God himself remains unaffected (\\"For I, the Lord, I have not changed\\" Malachi 3:6). His essence was one, alone, before creation, and still one, alone, after creation, without any change. As the tzimtzum was only the illusion of concealment, therefore God's unity is omnipresent. In the Baal Shem Tov's new interpretation, divine providence affects every detail of creation, as everything is part of the unfolding divine unity, and is a necessary part of the kabbalistic messianic rectification. This awareness of the loving purpose and significance of each individual, awakens mystical love and awe of God (deveikut). Lower unity Schneur Zalman explains that God's unity has two levels, that are both paradoxically true. The main text of Kabbalah, the Zohar, describes the first verse of the shema as the \\"Upper level Unity\\", and the second line (\\"Blessed be the Name of the Glory of His Kingdom forever\\") as the \\"Lower level Unity\\". Schneur Zalman gives the Hasidic explanation of this. In kabbalah, all creation is dependent on the immanent, potentially finite, \\"Light that Fills all Worlds\\", that each creation receives continually. Creation is a continuous process, as without the downward flow of spiritual light from God's will, creation would revert to nothingness. Lurianic Kabbalah extends the divine unity in this, by describing the particular nitzot (divine spark) enclothed within, that gives life to each entity. The Baal Shem Tov's Hasidic panentheism describes the further, complete unity of God with creation. In his interpretation, quoted by Schneur Zalman, the creative words of God of Genesis, through innumerable permutations of their Hebrew letters, themselves become each spiritual and physical entity of creation. This extends Luria's divine immanence to complete unity. Isaac Luria's doctrine of the tzimtzum (withdrawal of God), that made a \\"vacuum\\" within which finite creation could take place, is therefore not literal. It is only a concealment of God's creating light, and only from the perspective of creation. God remains in the vacuum exactly as before creation. In reality all creation is completely bittul-nullified to God's light, even though in our realm this utter dependence is presently concealed. From this perspective, of God knowing the creation on its own terms, creation exists, but the essence of anything is only the divine light that continuously recreates it from nothing. God is one, as creation takes place within God. \\"There is nothing outside of Him.\\" This is the \\"Lower Level Unity\\". Higher unity In relation to God's essence, creation affects no change or withdrawal in the divine. \\"There is nothing but God\\". The ability to create can only come from the divine atzmut(essence), whose power of infinitude is described by the Tetragrammaton (name of God). However, \\"It is not the essence of the Divine to create Worlds and sustain them\\", as this ability is only external to the infinite essence. Creation only derives from God's revelatory \\"speech\\" (as in Genesis 1) and even this is unlike the external speech of Man, as it too remains \\"within\\" God. From the upper perspective of God knowing himself on his own terms, creation does not exist, as it is as nothing in relation to God's essence. This monistic acosmism is the \\"Upper Level Unity\\", as from this perspective, only God exists. The illusionism of this is not absolute, as the paradox means that both contradictory upper and lower levels of unity are true.Second section of Tanya: Shaar Hayichud Vehaemunah-Gate of Unity and Faith online text in English with commentary from Chabad.org.

This was exemplified by the aim of the 5th Rebbe, Sholom Dovber Schneersohn, that his yeshiva academies should study Hasidic thought with the logical method of pilpul, traditionally used in Talmudic study. In the Hasidic teachings of Habad, this approach was used by each Rebbe in their public discourses and talks, with each successive leader aiming to bring down the philosophy of Hasidism into greater grasp and articulation. The 7th leader, Menachem Mendel Schneerson typically addressed Hasidic philosophy most often in informal, analytical talks. This approach to Hasidic mysticism enabled it to study the integration of other aspects of Jewish thought, into the Hasidic explanations. In Hasidic terminology, it takes a higher spiritual source in divinity to unite opposing, lower opinions. In Hasidic thought, Talmudic legislation, midrashic imagination, rationalist descriptions and kabbalistic structures are seen to reflect lower dimensions of a higher, essential Divine Unity. This method was used by the 7th Rebbe to address the topic of divine providence. In a series of talks, translated and published in English,Led By G-d's Hand: The Baal Shem Tov\`s Conception of Divine Providence. Kehot Publications. \\"Presents several analytical treatises by the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, which clarify the Baal Shem Tov's conception of the subject of Hashgacha Pratis, Divine Providence\\". the Lubavitcher Rebbe addresses the resolution between the Hasidic conception of divine providence, and its previous formulations in medieval Jewish philosophy and kabbalah. It sees the views of Maimonides and others as part of the new conception of the Baal Shem Tov.

It is the second of three books featuring supernatural investigator John Thunstone. The book derives its title from a line in Hamlet's famous \\"To be, or not to be...\\" soliloquy. Background The character of John Thunstone had previously appeared in a series of short stories by Wellman. Originally published in popular pulp magazines of the day, several of them were collected and reprinted in an anthology, Lonely Vigils. Wellman decided to follow the anthology with the character's first book-length adventure. In his introduction to the novel Wellman mistakenly states that, while many of the locations he mentions have real-life counterparts, Claines is an entirely fictional locale, and such a place has never existed in England. However, a small community named Claines exists, north of Worcester. Main characters John Thunstone is an American scholar and investigator of the paranormal. He has the imposing physical stature and square-jawed good looks of an archetypical literary hero. Although he suffers from no disability, he always carries a cane which was given to him by his good friend Judge Pursuivant. The cane's shaft conceals a silver blade forged by Saint Dunstan, which serves as a formidable weapon against the supernatural creatures Thunstone encounters in his travels. Gram Ensley is the richest man in Claines who also owns the majority of its land. He lives at Chimney Pots, an expansive manor which has been in his family for centuries. Ensley is a respected, if feared, figure in the community and makes significant contributions to the local parish although he does not regularly attend services. Constance Bailey is a self-proclaimed white witch who works at the inn where Thunstone stays. Her benevolent acts of magic are well received by the majority of Claines' inhabitants although she continually draws the ire of Mr. Ensley who openly states his belief that she should be expelled from town. Plot summary While visiting London, John Thunstone hears strange stories concerning the nearby hamlet of Claines, a pair of ancient pagan artifacts, and the annual ritual that accompanies them. As the date of the ritual is only a few days away Thunstone decides to travel to Claines and witness the ritual for himself. While there he experiences strange visions of the distant past and gradually realizes their significance to the present.

Her light AA guns consisted of nine semi-automatic 21-K AA guns and four DK machine guns.Yakubov and Worth, pp. 86‚Äì7 Six 39-Yu torpedo tubes were fitted in two triple mountings.Yakubov and Worth, p. 88 Molotov was the first Soviet ship to carry radar, a Redut-K air warning system, which she used for the entire war. Soviet-designed Mars-1 gunnery radar systems were added by 1944. Wartime modifications By 1943 three of Molotovs 45 mm semi- automatic guns were replaced with twelve fully automatic 70-K AA guns with one thousand rounds per gun and two extra DK machine guns. Her aircraft catapult was removed in 1942 to make room for more light AA guns. In 1943 an improved ZK-1a catapult was fitted and successfully test-launched a Supermarine Spitfire fighter. However, in 1947 the concept was abandoned and the catapult was removed.Yakubov and Worth, p. 89 World War II Molotov firing Molotov was laid down at the Marti South, Nikolayev on 14 January 1937, launched on 4 December 1939 and was completed on 14 June 1941. As the only ship in the Soviet Navy with radar Molotov remained in Sevastopol for the initial period of Operation Barbarossa to provide air warning.Yakubov and Worth, p. 94 The advance of German troops into the Crimea in late October 1941 forced her to transfer to Tuapse where she continued to provide air warning.Rohwer, p. 111 However, the ship did bombard German troops near Feodosiya with nearly 200 180 mm shells on 9 November before returning to Tuapse. Molotov helped to carry the 386th Rifle Division from Poti to Sevastopol between 24 and 28 December 1941. While off-loading troops on 29 December her stern was damaged by German artillery and she shelled Axis positions in retaliation, firing 205 180 mm and 107 100 mm shells. The ship evacuated 600 wounded upon her departure on 30 December. Molotov reprised her role as a transport during the first week of January. Her bow was damaged during a heavy storm in Tuapse when she was thrown against the jetty on 21‚Äì22 January 1942. The ship spent most of the next month under repair, although her bow could not be straightened; the residual damage reduced her speed by several knots. She made a number of bombardment sorties in support of Soviet troops on the Kerch Peninsula until 20 March when she returned to Poti for more permanent repairs. On 12 June Molotov transported 2998 men of the 138th Rifle Brigade to Sevastopol, shelling German positions while unloading. She evacuated 1065 wounded and 350 women and children as she departed. On 14‚Äì15 June the ship returned, carrying 3855 reinforcements in company with other ships, bombarded German positions again, and evacuated 2908 wounded and refugees.Rohwer, p. 172 On 2 August, while returning from another bombardment mission near Feodosiya, of her stern was blown off by Heinkel He 111 torpedo bombers of 6./KG 26 acting in concert with Italian MAS torpedo boats.Rohwer, p. 184 The damage reduced her speed to and Molotov had to be steered by her engines. Molotov was under repair at Poti until 31 July 1943 and used the stern of the incomplete Frunze, the rudder of the incomplete cruiser Zheleznyakov, the steering gear from the cruiser and the steering sensor from the submarine . The loss of three destroyers to German air attack on 6 October 1943 resulted in Stalin's order that forbade the deployment of large naval units without his express permission; this meant the end of Molotovs active participation in the war.Whitley, p. 211 Postwar career Molotov was refitted in November 1945 to repair the last of her wartime damage. She suffered a fire in the shell handling room for Turret #2 on 5 October 1946 that had to be extinguished by flooding the magazine and handling room at the cost of 22 dead and 20 wounded. The ship served as the test bed for the radars intended for the and s during the late 1940s. Molotovs postwar modernization began in 1952 and lasted until 28 January 1955. As part of this modernization Molotov received a radar suite composed of Gyuys for air search, Rif for surface search, Zalp for main-armament gunnery and Yakor' for anti-aircraft gunnery. All of her light anti-aircraft guns were replaced by eleven twin gun water-cooled 37 mm V-11 mounts and her 100 mm guns were reinstalled on fully powered B-34USMA mountings. Her anti-aircraft fire- control system was replaced by a Zenit-26 with SPN-500 stabilized directors. In addition she lost her torpedo tubes, anti-submarine weapons, boat cranes and all remaining aircraft equipment. This cost 200 million rubles, between half and three-quarters the cost of a new Project 68bis .Yakubov and Worth, p. 91 On 29 October 1955 the ship participated in rescue efforts after an explosion sank the ex-Italian battleship Novorossiysk. Five of her own men were lost when the battleship capsized almost three hours after the explosion. She was renamed Slava on 3 August 1957 after Vyacheslav Molotov was purged from the government after an unsuccessful coup against Nikita Khrushchev that same year.Vyacheslav Molotov joked: \\"Firstly the cruiser was named on my family name, now she is named on my first name\\". (\\"Slava\\" means in Russian not only glory, but also is a diminutive of Vyacheslav.) She was reclassified as a training cruiser on 3 August 1961. Slava was deployed to the Mediterranean between 5‚Äì30 June 1967 to show Soviet support of Syria during the Six-Day War. She returned to the Mediterranean between September and December 1970, where the ship assisted the destroyer Bravyi after the latter's collision with the aircraft carrier on 9 November 1970. Slava was sold for scrap on 4 April 1972.Yakubov and Worth, p. 95 Notes Footnotes References * Mandel, Vladimir, \\"Cold War Duty in the Black Sea Fleet,\\" Naval History (Annapolis, Md., April 2011), pp. 42‚Äì48   * External links * Cruiser \\"Molotov\\" from Black Sea Fleet (with photos) * Molotov on navsource.narod.ru (with photos) * Project 26 history Category:Kirov-class cruisers Category:Ships built at the Black Sea Shipyard Category:1939 ships Category:World War II cruisers of the Soviet Union Category:Maritime incidents in August 1942 Category:Ships built in the Soviet Union ","title":"Soviet cruiser Molotov"},{"id":"24036081","text":"Here Today is an extended play released by the hardcore punk band Violent Apathy.

Early life Al-Tamimi was born in Nablus to a Sunni Arab landowning family in 1889. He attended elementary and secondary school in the city and then at the Marjan Preparatory School in Istanbul, Turkey. Because of his well-rated performance at Marjan, he entered and won an academic contest. He enrolled at the Mulkiyya College in Istanbul as a result. He was consequently recognized by the Ottoman Education Ministry and given a grant to learn at the Sorbonne in Paris. There he received a degree in literature and education.Muslih, 1989, p.148. Political career Al-Tamimi served in the local administration of the Ottoman Empire as a principal of a government-run school in Beirut. Despite working for the Ottoman government, in 1911, while in Paris, he and his colleague Awni Abd al-Hadi founded the underground organization, al-Fatat, which called for Arab independence from the empire.Muslih, 1989, p.99.

During the 2000 presidential election, he declared that it was the \\"obligation and responsibility\\" of Catholics \\"to vote for the candidate who will promote what is good and oppose what is evil, who will promote the culture of life and oppose the culture of death, who will promote the well-being of society and oppose its moral disintegration.\\" After thirteen years as Bishop, Dupr√© resigned due to unspecified health reasons on February 11, 2004. His resignation came one day after The Springfield Republican confronted him with accusations of sexual abuse from two men who had known Dupr√© when he was a parish priest and they were altar boys. Dupr√© was also accused by local clergy of covering up abuse charges against other priests, including Richard R. Lavigne. On September 24, 2004, he was indicted by a Hampden County grand jury on two counts of child molestation. He thus became the first Catholic bishop ever to be indicted for sexual abuse. However, the Springfield district attorney's office was forced to drop the charges because the statute of limitations had run out. He then entered St. Luke Institute, a private Catholic psychiatric hospital in Silver Spring, Maryland. As of June 2006, he continued to list his residence as St. Luke's. In June 2010 a Judge released to the public a transcript and videotape of the Bishop's deposition made for a civil lawsuit where after stating his name and date of birth, Dupr√© pleaded the Fifth Amendment in response to three hours of questions. Dupr√© died on December 30, 2016.

Plot summary  The documentary begins with a group of German children playing football in a street bordering the Berlin Wall. In the course of the game, the ball is kicked over to the other side. Using raw footage, the film chronicles the erection of the wall, civilian efforts to communicate with and assist East German escapees, and efforts by GDR border guards to thwart them. Shot in the first year after the wall was built, the film was narrated by Alexander Scourby, speaking for a citizen of West Berlin whose mother and children were stranded on the east side of the wall. The man is shown communicating with his children through hand signals; a risky endeavor, as East German civilians who were caught waving or otherwise communicating with people on the western side of the wall risked being forcibly relocated. For a brief time after the wall was built, civilians were able to escape by jumping from the westward windows of buildings close to the wall. Several such escapes were captured in the film, including one where communist policemen tried to pull a woman back into the room before she fell to the waiting firefighters below. GDR guards are filmed throwing tear gas at civilians on the western side of the wall, who threw the grenades back. After a short time, the windows of those buildings were bricked up, and barbed wire was strung on the rooftops. Trees and houses are shown being razed, lest they be used as escape routes. In the surrounding countryside, more civilians escape, despite the deployment of minefields and barbed wire. Another escapee is seen being injured in the face when she runs into a barbed wire fence. Another incident captured in the film is the death of Peter Fechter, an 18-year-old bricklayer's apprentice, who was shot by GDR border guards while trying to scale the wall and left to bleed to death. A memorial is shown for others who died trying to escape to West Germany. Three minutes of silence are held on the western side to commemorate those lost and killed, and the film ends with a young boy walking alongside the wall. Political censorship Since the 1960s, the short documentary was preserved by the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration. Since the film was deemed a propaganda film, the media production could not be released or shown in the United States until after the Cold War between the Eastern Bloc and Western Bloc countries.

The Argimusco is a high plateau situated just north of Mount Etna in Sicily, southern Italy, between the Nebrodi and Peloritani Mountains. It lies within the boundaries of the communes of Montalbano Elicona, Tripi (which is built on the site of the ancient Abacaenum) and Roccella Valdemone. The site offers a wide panorama of the volcano Etna, the Aeolian Islands, the mountains Rocca Salvatesta and Montagna di Vern√†, cape Tindari, cape Calav√† and cape Milazzo. The rocks It is in the wind and secondly in the rain that the origin of the bizarre form of quartz sandstone rocks must be sought. Numerous of these seems as megaliths in quartz arenite, attributed by local tradition to a prehistoric population, are found in this area, as are ancient menhirs and almost unrecognisable dolmens. It is generally considered that these are, in fact, completely natural, being produced by wind erosion. Amongst the megaliths, around Portella Cerasa, stand two large elongated boulders, while another megalith, not far way, has the appearance of an eagle and is incised with a symbol of the Sun that was worshipped as a god. Further west, at Portella Zilla, a rustic building enclosed the remains of a dolmen with a huge boulder in front, which may be the remains of a fallen menhir. No signs of prehistoric man's presence, such as pottery, tools or bones, are found around the presumed monuments. The Mirror of the Stars Theory Argimusco is called \\"The Mirror of the Stars\\", it's situated just north of Mt. Etna, but is also a marvelous site of shaped megalithic rock structures, considered to be arranged to mimic the pattern of the constellations which they represent. We say that rock art of any kind that represents the constellations (not only modern zodiac signs) is founded on the ancient philosophy of astrology known as sidereal astrology. Not surprisingly, the site has been categorized as being geomantically significant...and has drawn esoteric and occult practitioners throughout the centuries. Argimusco is a place where there are ten stone statues which represent the constellations present in the summer sky The Eagle The Eagle is one of the most fascinating megaliths. It is formed by the overlapping of blocks from the pentagonal faces. The megalith is a bird of prey, with wings half-spread and the head facing south. The eagle in hermetic symbolism is a privileged being which connects earth with heaven. It is the symbol of the soul of the deceased. The latter after the death of material life is born to new life (like the alchemical phoenix rising from the ashes, the soul rises from the alchemical ashes). In the background of the Aquila, stands the beautiful cone of Mount Nettuno (Rocca Salvatesta) that probably in the economy of the site acts as solstice or equinox indicator. Eagle The Alchemical symbols On Argimusco the statues of the Pelican, the Owl and finally a rock that resembles the alchemical alambic have been found. Pellican and Owl Pellican and Owl The profile of Asclepiius On the wall facing west, you notice the haughty profile of a young man who looks with his face upwards to the setting sun. The dual representation suggests the chthonic Italian deity of Janus, then adopted in Roman religion, to whom is dedicated the month of starting of the year. With it were measured various passages of the sun on the solstices on the north-south diagonal. In fact, the Great Cliff of Janus plays a central role in any relationship north (Aeolian Islands) and south (Etna). Ofiucus Virgo (constellation) If we with a look towards the west, we can admire the incredible precision, almost \\"portrait\\", of the megalith of the ‚ÄòPraying Woman‚Äô or ‚ÄòVirgo\\". It is a mysterious androgynous figure twenty-six meters high with her hands clasped in prayer. You notice the elbow, the mantle, the knee, the Phrygian cap on the head, and even the pedestal base. Ritual ablution The Virgin is the center of the \\"Mirror of the stars\\" staged at Argimusco, since all other figures play an ancillary role with respect to it. As a matter of fact, the sun rises in Virgo at summer solstice of 10,500 BC. It embodies the feminine divine figure, which is lunar liquid mercury, as opposed to the divine Apollonian, masculine, solar disk, put in alchemical terms. As a mercurial element, it is precisely located near the Serpens constellation and the bearer of snakes (Ophiuchus), or the symbol of the Caduceus of Hermes (Mercury) consisting of a rod around which wraps themselves, in fact, two snakes (now the symbol of medicine). Particularly significant, high on the megalith of the Virgo is a rectangular pool, that we suppose was used for ritual ablutions. Tetragrammathon and Sexstant On Argimusco there is a Templar tetragram and a stone sextant. The sextant was to serve, according to medieval astrological medical techniques, for the purpose of diagnostic and therapeutic use in association with the Sphere of Pythagoras and the astrolabe.

Burkinabe society only accepts sexual intercourse within marriage. In 2009, Voice of America reported that the number of prostitutes in Burkina Faso had increased as a result of the country's poverty. The increase in prostitution has given rise to fears of an increase in the number of Burkinab√©s infected with HIV and AIDS. UNAIDS estimate there to be 31,000 prostitutes in the country. Burkina Faso has been referred to as \\"a theatre of child labour\\" as many children are trafficked into the country for forced prostitution as well as domestic work. In 1990 the Burkina Faso government ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and there are laws against the commercial sexual exploitation of children. The government has taken measures to ensure the safety of children against sexual abuse and exploitation, but it is still prevalent. Children from poor families relied on prostitution to meet their daily needs and, at times, to help their needy parents. Trafficked children, primarily Nigerian nationals, were also subject to sexual abuse and forced prostitution. In the capital, Ouagadougou, the main area of prostitution is in the Dapoya district. Although homosexuality is illegal in the country, male prostitution takes place, especially in the tourist areas. Forms of prostitution S√©dentaires \\"S√©dentaires\\" () sex workers sit outside their houses on stools trying to attract clients. They tend to be older women and have lower rates than other sex workers. Trotteuses \\"Trotteuses\\" () are street prostitutes. They walk the streets in areas known for prostitution. Many of them are foreign, particularly from Ghana and Togo. Professionnelles de luxe \\"Professionnelles de luxe\\" () are call girls who offer their services, by appointment, in hotels, motels and clients' residences. Their clients are usually businessmen, travellers or tourists. Bar waitresses Waitresses that work in bars, nightclub and hotels sometimes offer sexual services as a sideline. They may use guest rooms, or the client's or waitress's home. Transhumantes These sex workers worker for a \\"Granny\\" or a \\"Tantie\\", who act as their pimp. They travel from town to town and work in places such as construction sites and gold mines. They tend to be younger women between the ages of 16 and 25. Mbaraan Many young women, especially high school students, turn to part-time prostitution to afford \\"luxury\\" goods such as fashionable European clothing. Rural areas Some women in small rural areas will stand by main roads trying to attract clients. This may happen by day or by night. HIV Like other Sub-Saharan African countries the prevalence of HIV/AIDS infection is relatively high, although it is dropping. The country has one of the highest prevalences in West Africa. In 1999, the adult prevalence was 6.4%, by 2016 it had dropped to 0.8%. Sex workers are a high risk group. Prevalence has fallen from 53% in 1998, to 16.2% in 2016 Sex trafficking Burkina Faso is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Burkinabe girls are exploited in sex trafficking. Burkinabe children are transported to Cote d‚ÄôIvoire, Mali, and Niger for sex trafficking. To a lesser extent, traffickers recruit women for ostensibly legitimate employment in Lebanon, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and various European countries and subsequently subject them to forced prostitution. Burkina Faso is a transit country for traffickers transporting children from Mali to Cote d‚ÄôIvoire and women and girls from Cote d‚ÄôIvoire to Saudi Arabia. It is a destination for children subjected to trafficking from neighbouring countries, including Cote d‚ÄôIvoire, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria. Women from other West African countries are fraudulently recruited for employment in Burkina Faso and subsequently subjected to forced prostitution. Nigerian girls are exploited in sex trafficking in Burkina Faso. Nepalese traffickers have subjected Tibetan women to sex trafficking in Burkina Faso. The 2008 anti-trafficking law criminalises all forms of trafficking and prescribes penalties of five to 10 years imprisonment, which are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Law No. 11-2014/AN criminalises ‚Äúchild prostitution‚Äù and the sale of children‚Äîincluding the sale of children for crimes not considered trafficking in the 2000 UN TIP Protocol. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Burkina Faso as a Tier 2 country.

SH-13 is long and runs from U.S. Route 95 (US 95) in Grangeville to US-12 in Kooskia. In addition to those cities, SH-13 also serves the city of Stites and the community of Harpster. SH-13 has one special route, Business Loop 13 in Kooskia. Route description SH-13 begins at an intersection with US-95 in western Grangeville. It heads east through that city along Main Street. East of Grangeville, the highway heads generally northeast along the Harpster Grade Road, through the rolling farmland of Idaho County. east of Grangeville, the terrain becomes mountainous as SH-13 begins a descent towards the South Fork Clearwater River. At the bottom of the descent is an intersection with SH-14 at the western banks of the river. north of its intersection with SH-14, SH-13 crosses the South Fork Clearwater River and continues along the eastern banks. For the rest of its routing, SH-13 runs parallel to the river; a significant portion of which is within sight of the river. Since it lies at the bottom of the river valley, the road way is relatively flat, but it is surrounded by rugged, tree-lined hills. The highway passes through the communities of Harpster and Stites on its way towards Kooskia. As it approaches Kooskia, the river valley widens allowing some space between the river and highway. It passes the city's municipal airport at the southern city limits. Now in the city, the road goes through its business district. The northern and southern halves of the city are separated by of SH-13. At Broadway, SH-13's only child route, State Highway 13 Business (SH-13 Bus.), turns off to the east. Shortly thereafter, the mainline SH-13 crosses the Middle Fork Clearwater River near the confluence of the south and middle forks. At the other side of the bridge, SH-13 ends at US 12. Major intersections Related route SH-13 Business is an alternate connection between SH-13 and US-12 in Kooskia. It begins at an intersection with SH-13 in the northern half of the city and runs east along Broadway. It turns to the southeast before crossing the Middle Fork Clearwater River and ending at US-12.

Mormon‚ÄìMuslim relations have historically been cordial; recent years have seen increasing dialogue between adherents of the two faiths, and cooperation in charitable endeavors.World Muslim Congress: Mormons and Muslims; Mormon-Muslim Interfaith Ramadan Dinner. In terms of a mainstream Islamic as well as Christian perspective, Mormons are sometimes compared to Ahmadiyya in that they are sometimes not accepted as belonging within mainstream Christianity and Islam, respectively.https://www.jstor.org/stable/45225429 This article compares the teachings of Islam to those of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), which is the largest Latter Day Saint church today.Adherents Dot Com, see under \\"Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\\" and \\"Community of Christ\\"; the Community of Christ is the second-largest Latter Day Saint organization. Other, smaller denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement, such as the Community of Christ, Church of Christ (Temple Lot), and the controversial Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints hold significantly different doctrines than those taught by the LDS Church. However, important differences remain between Islamic teaching and the doctrines of these other churches, even where they differ with those of the LDS Church.See Other Latter Day Saint denominations and Islam, below. Overview The Book of Mormon in Arabic. Islam and Latter-day Saint theology both originate in the Abrahamic tradition; LDS theology differs from Mainstream Christianity for being Non-trinitarian. However, whereas Islam insists upon the Eternity, complete Oneness and Uniqueness of God (Allah), LDS Christianity asserts that the Godhead is made up of three distinct \\"beings\\", each of which is referred to as \\"a god\\".Encyclopedia of Mormonism , entry: \\"Godhead\\". Furthermore, its doctrine of Eternal Progression asserts that God was once a man,See The King Follet Sermon: Parallel texts and that humans may become gods themselves.Doctrine & Covenants 132:20. All of this is emphatically rejected by Islam, which views these doctrines as polytheistic, sinful, and idolatrous, totally the opposite to the revelation of the Quran and the teachings of Muhammad, the final prophet of Islam. Both Islam and Latter-day Saints believe that the Christian religion as originally established by Jesus was a true religion, but that Christianity subsequently became deformed to the point that it was beyond simple reformation. Hence, each religion sees its founder (Muhammad for Islam, and Joseph Smith for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) as being a true prophet of God, called to re-establish the true faith. However, each religion differs in regard to how it views Jesus: Latter-day Saints see him as the promised Messiah and the Son of God (as is the case around mainstream Christianity). Islam agrees that Jesus (whom the Quran calls \\"Isa\\") was a Messiah in his own right, but insists that he was only a mortal man, not the Son of God or a divine being. Despite great opposition from many other Christian branches, Latter-day Saints identify themselves as a Christian religion, the \\"restoration\\" of primitive Christianity. Islam does not refer to itself as \\"Christian\\"; it asserts that Jesus and all true followers of Christ's teachings were (and are) actually Muslims ‚Äì a term that means \\"submitters to God\\" ‚Äì in their belief, not Christians as that term is used today.Jesus Was Muslim , from the Islam-Voice website. Similarities Russell M. Nelson, the current Prophet of the LDS Church (as of 2018). Islam believes Muhammad was the last prophet, while Mormonism believes in a line of prophets extending from Joseph Smith to the present day. Basic similarities between the Islamic and Latter-day Saint faiths include, but are not limited to: * A founding prophet who received visits from an angel, leading to revelation of a book of scripture; * A geographical territory associated with the faithful (in Islam the Arab peninsula, in Latter-day Saints the state of Utah in the USA) * A division of the religion into a minimum of two parties after the death of the founding prophet, with one party claiming that leadership should continue through the prophet's descendants, and the other party rejecting this idea;Initially, the second-largest Latter Day Saint group, now known as the Community of Christ, claimed that leadership should continue through Joseph Smith's descendants; this is no longer taught or advocated by that organization, as of 2012. * Special reverence for, though not worship of, their founding prophet; * Belief that their faith represents the genuine, original religion of Adam, and of all true prophets thereafter; * Belief that the text of the Bible, as presently constituted, has been adulterated from its original form; * Assertions that modern Christianity does not conform to the original religion taught by Jesus Christ; * Rejection of the Christian doctrines of original sin and the Trinity; * A belief that theirs constitutes the one and only completely true religion on the earth today; * An active interest in proselytizing nonbelievers; * An emphasis upon family, and the family unit as the foundation for religious life and the transmission of values; * A clergy drawn from the laity, without necessarily requiring collegiate or seminary training (Sunni Islam only); * For differing reasons both the Latter-day Saints and Islam insist that Lucifer (or Iblis in Islam) was cast out of the presence of God and became Satan (or \\"Shay·π≠ƒÅn\\"); * Insistence that their religion is a complete way of life, meant to directly influence every facet of existence; * Belief that good deeds are required for salvation just as much as faith; * Emphasis upon charitable giving, and helping the downtrodden; * Strong emphasis upon chastity, including modesty in dress; * Belief in fasting during specified periods of time; * Prohibition of alcoholic beverages, gambling, and homosexual and bisexual practices; * Strong emphasis upon education, both in the secular and religious arenas; * Belief that one's marriage can potentially continue into the next life, if one is faithful to the religion; * Belief in varying degrees of reward and punishment in the afterlife, depending upon one's performance in this life; * Both Islam and some minor sects of Mormonism allow polygamy. Muslim men can marry up to 4 wives (although this practice is very rare in the Islamic world nowadays), whereas members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Community of Christ have forbidden it in 1890; however, Mormons have practiced polygamy since the very beginning of the Latter Day Saint movement, and it's still permitted and widespread in Mormon fundamentalist sects. Modern day, mainstream Mormons continue to live the laws of polygamy in that men can be sealed in the temple to more than one wife (eg: after divorce or after the death of a wife), while women can only be sealed in the temple to one man and must petition the church for a 'temple divorce' before being sealed to a second husband or husband after the death of the first. Differences Fundamental differences between Islam and Latter-day Saints include, but are not limited to: * Latter-day Saints believe that God the Father has a body of flesh and bones, together with a wife, referred to as \\"Heavenly Mother\\" (although this view is not made explicit in Mormon scripture). Islam emphatically rejects these principles. * Latter-day Saints believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God; he is referred to as \\"a god\\" in their religion. Islam rejects this idea, believing that Jesus was a mortal being chosen to be a Prophet of God, no different from Moses, Abraham, Muhammad, or other prophets of God throughout time, except in that he was raised to heaven, like Elijah and Enoch. * Islam insists that only God is eternal; everything else was created by him ex nihilo. Latter-day Saints deny this, insisting that matter and intelligence are equally eternal, and that God only \\"organized\\" them, rather than creating them out of nothing. * Latter-day Saints believe that Satan was a \\"spirit son\\" of God named Lucifer, whose plan to negate human free will was rejected, leading him to rebel.LDS Pearl of Great Price: Book of Moses 4:1-4; Book of Abraham 3:22-28. Islam rejects this, stating that Iblis, a jinn, refused to prostrate himself before Adam upon God's command, causing God to expel him from his presence, after which he became Satan (or \\"Shay·π≠ƒÅn\\").Quran, Surah 7, vs. 11-12. * Islam believes that the Angels are beings created by God from n≈´r (holy light), who lack free will and serve him unhesitatingly. Latter-day Saints see Angels as humans in spirit form (before birth or after death) or resurrected (immortal) humans. Human spirits who follow Satan may be considered Satan's angels, but the term \\"angel\\" usually refers to those who follow God. * Latter-day Saints believe that those who are faithful may become \\"gods\\" in the next life, through following its teachings and receiving certain necessary ordinances. Islam rejects this position. * Latter-day Saints believe that married couples in the next life will continue to beget children; Islam rejects this principle. * In addition to angels and human beings, Islam believes in a third group of intelligent beings, the jinn. Mormonism ultimately believes in only one group of beings in various stages of existence as disembodied spirits or spirits embodied in mortal or resurrected bodies. * Islam believes that one may become a full-fledged Muslim simply by reciting its profession of faith, the Shahada, while believing sincerely in its teachings.Islam Made Easy For New Muslims , see under \\"Step 1 ‚Äì Embracing Islam. Latter-day Saints believe that the receipt of a series of sacramental ordinances, including baptism and confirmation, are required to become a member of the church. * Latter-day Saints believe in the existence of a Priesthood unique to them, conferred by ordination, which is required to administer sacraments or otherwise officially act in the name of God. Islam rejects this idea. * Islam proclaims that its prophet Muhammad was the \\"seal of the prophets\\"Quran, Surah 33, verse 40. and no further prophets would come after him. Latter-day Saints, while believing that Muhammad was a great and inspired teacher, do not consider him a prophet; it does believe Joseph Smith and his successors (the latest of whom is Russell M. Nelson) to be prophets, which Islam rejects. * Latter-day Saints erect temples throughout the world, where special ordinances are performed for both the living and the dead. Islam does not accept this principle. * Latter-day Saints ban coffee and tea, while Islam does not. They also prohibit tobacco, which is forbidden in Islam by various fatawa but not directly in the Quran. * Islam bans certain kinds of meat, while Latter-day Saints say that all meats may be eaten, but should be used in moderation. Islam also requires that all meats be slaughtered in accordance with prescribed rituals similar to those of Judaism. Latter-day Saints reject this notion. * While Latter-day Saints permit the depiction of God and his prophets in images, Islam expressly bans any depiction of Allah as a form of idolatry; in addition, the majority Sunni portion of it bans the depiction of any prophet of Islam, including Jesus. * Whereas Latter-day Saints have a rigid hierarchical structure, culminating in a single President of the Church, Sunni Islam doesn't recognize any religious authority besides Allah himself and his prophets, most prominently the latest Prophet Muhammad; Shia Islam holds the same view on God, however regards the rightful Imams, eminent descendants from the family of the Prophet Muhammad, as both religious and secular authorities. * Islam requires a pilgrimage to Mecca as part of its religion from those who can afford, while Latter-day Saints do not have any corresponding imperative, although it does encourage members to travel to the nearest temple at least once in their lifetime (and more often if circumstances permit), for the receipt of certain sacred ordinances there. * Islam still permits polygamy under certain specified conditions. While there are some fundamentalist sects of Mormonism that permit unrestricted polygamy, mainstream Mormonism (having previously embraced the principle) officially banned it in 1890. * Latter-day Saints believe in the possibility of continuous revelation from their prophets, whereas Islam considers the Quran to be God's final message to humankind. Similar origins Compendium of the LDS Standard Works: the Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price. Unlike Islamic views of the Quran, the LDS Church regards approved versions of these works in any language to be just as authentic as the originals. The Quran, in traditional Arabic text. For many Muslims, only the Arabic version is considered truly authentic; versions in other languages are considered commentaries on the Arabic original, not exact translations.How to Read the Quran, from Slate. Overview Similarities exist between the origins of Islam and those of Mormonism: * Both Muhammad and Joseph Smith were reportedly inspired to start their movements by angelic visits: the Archangel Jibreel (Gabriel) in the case of Muhammed, and the Angel Moroni for Joseph Smith (following a visit Smith claimed to have received from God and Jesus Christ three years earlier). In each event, the angel in question helped to prepare the prophet to receive a series of revelations from God. * Both Muhammad and Joseph Smith left behind authorized books they claimed to be direct revelations from God, books that their followers accept as Scripture. * Both Muhammad and Joseph Smith were persecuted by hostile locals and later forced to relocate (from Mecca to Medina, and from Missouri to Illinois, respectively) during the formative periods of their careers. * Both Muhammad and Joseph Smith established theocratic city-states during their respective ministries, Muhammad being invited to take the rule of Medina, while Joseph Smith would found Nauvoo, Illinois. Quran Islam holds that the Quran was revealed to Muhammad by the archangel Jibrƒ´l (Gabriel) over a period of approximately 23 years, beginning in 610 CE when he was forty years old, and concluding in 632 CE, the year of his death.Nasr, Seyyed Hossein (2007). \\"Quran\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-68890/Quran. Retrieved 2007-11-04.Living Religions: An Encyclopaedia of the World's Faiths, Mary Pat Fisher, 1997, page 338, I.B. Tauris Publishers. He first began receiving the 114 revelations that would comprise its contents while secluded for meditation and prayer in the Cave of Hira in the mountains outside of Mecca, in what is now Saudi Arabia. According to Islamic tradition, the illiterate Muhammad was confronted there by Jibrƒ´l, who commanded him to \\"recite\\".Quran, Surah 96, verses 1-5. Although deeply distressed by this event, Muhammad was comforted by his wife Khadijah and her Christian cousin, Waraqah ibn Nawfal, who encouraged him to accept the angel's visit. Following a three-year period without any further visits from Jibrƒ´l (during which Muhammad continued to pray and devote himself to spiritual practices), the angel returned once more, and the other 113 Surahs of the Quran were revealed over the next 23 years, which were memorized by their hearers. Muhammad himself did not collect the Quran into a single, written volume; this was largely done after his death.Holy Qur'an: Transmission of the Written Text, from the SunniPath Online Islamic Academy website. Mormon sacred texts Mormons believe that when Joseph Smith, Jr. was seventeen years of age, an angel of God named Moroni appeared to him\\"The Life and Ministry of Joseph Smith‚Äù, Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2007) pp. xxii‚Äì25. and told him of a collection of ancient writings engraved on golden plates by ancient prophets, buried in a nearby hill in Ontario County, New York. These writings became the Book of Mormon, and were said to have described a people whom God had led from Jerusalem to the Western Hemisphere 600 years before Jesus' birth. According to the narrative, Moroni was the last prophet among these people and had buried the record, which God had promised to bring forth in the latter days. Smith stated that he was instructed by Moroni to meet him at the hill annually each September 22 to receive further instructions; four years after the initial visit, in 1827, he was allowed to take the plates and was directed to translate them into English.Joseph Smith‚ÄìHistory [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.59?lang=eng 1:59 In addition to the Book of Mormon, Mormons believe the Doctrine and Covenants to be a series of modern-day revelation from God. These were written by Joseph Smith over a 21-year period (1823‚Äì44), from ages 17 to 38. The first 134 sections were written by Joseph Smith, while the last three sections and two official declarations were added to the Doctrine and Covenants by Smith's successors. The revelations include instruction on church procedures and organization, admonitions to Smith and other church members, interpretation of scripture such as the Book of Revelation and records of visions such as that of Jesus Christ in the Kirtland Temple. Latter Day Saints also accept the Pearl of Great Price, which contains selections from Joseph Smith's \\"New Translation\\" of the Bible, which he claimed were corrections to the King James Version received by direct inspiration from God. It also contains the Book of Abraham, an alleged translation by Smith of an ancient Egyptian papyrus, together with the Mormon \\"Articles of Faith\\" and an extract from Smith's official history. Despite the similarities between the alleged origins of the Quran and Latter Day Saint sacred texts, neither Islam nor Mormonism accepts the scriptures of the other as canonical. Mormons and Muslims God Medallion showing the name of Allah in the Hagia Sophia, Istanbul, Turkey. Perhaps the greatest single area of difference between Mormons and Muslims lies in their religions' differing concepts of God. In Islam, Allah (the Arabic term for God) is seen as being unique, totally transcendent, absolutely and indivisibly One; this concept is called Tawhid in Islamic theology, and does not admit the possibility of division in the Godhead either in personality, essence or otherwise. It holds that God is one (') and unique (ahad). The very term \\"Allah\\" itself is singular, and does not have a plural form in Arabic (unlike English, where \\"god\\" can be pluralized into \\"gods\\"). Allah is perceived by Muslims to be a unique, independent and indivisible being, who is utterly independent of and who precedes all of creation, having created all of it ex nihilo.Vincent J. Cornell, Encyclopedia of Religion, Vol 5, pp.3561-3562. Hence, the idea that there could be more than one God, or that God could be composed of distinct persons (however united these \\"persons\\" might be alleged to be in substance ‚Äì as is held in the mainstream Trinitarian theology of Christianity ‚Äì or in purpose alone, as alleged by the Mormons in opposition to the Christian doctrine), is all heresy of the worst possible kind for a Muslim. In fact, such ideas are referred to as Shirk, which is the most serious sin in Islamic law, and the only one designated by the Quran as being utterly unpardonable for the person who dies in it.Sami Zaatari, Shirk: The Unforgivable Sin in Islam, which contains the Quranic references on this subject. Joseph Smith claimed that he met Jesus and God the Father as two distinct physical beings during his First Vision. In stark contrast, Mormonism believes in a Godhead composed of three separate and distinct beings, who function as a single, unified God under the direction of the Father, who is held to be the senior member of this triad.Deseret Weekly, August 30, 1890, 305, quoting from a sermon of LDS Church President Wilford Woodruff indicating God the Father as being the \\"head\\" of the Mormon Trinity. Although the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants clearly identify the Father, Son and Holy Ghost as being \\"one God\\",Book of Mormon: II Nephi 31:21; Doctrine and Covenants 20:17:33. this unity is seen as a metaphorical \\"oneness\\" in spirit, purpose and glory, rather than a physical or bodily union. The Mormon Book of Abraham, in its account of creation (one that generally parallels the one in the Biblical Book of Genesis), speaks of \\"the Gods\\", rather than \\"God\\", as accomplishing the act of creation.LDS Pearl of Great Price, Book of Abraham, Chapters 4 and 5. Mormon Apostle Jeffrey R. Holland elaborated upon this concept during the General Conference of the LDS Church in 2007: Latter-day Saints also believe, in marked contrast to Islam, that God the Father and Jesus Christ each have physical bodies of flesh and bone,Doctrine and Covenants 130:22. and that the Father was once a man, who progressed to become what he is today.\\"Chapter 2: God the Eternal Father\\", Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2011) pp. 36‚Äì44. Furthermore, they believe that man is capable, by embracing and adhering completely to the Mormon religion, of evolving into a \\"god\\" himself in the next life,See The First Presidency (Joseph F. Smith, John R. Winder, and Anthon H. Lund), in James R. Clark, comp: Messages of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, 4:205-6 the LDS equivalent of theosis. In addition, the existence of a being colloquially known as \\"Heavenly Mother\\" is affirmed by the LDS Church,See Smith, Joseph F. et al., \\"The Origin of Man\\", Improvement Era (November 1909): 80. See also, for example, Hinckley 1991, encouraging Latter-day Saint women not to pray to the Heavenly Mother; or M. Russell Ballard stating \\"we are part of a divine plan designed by Heavenly Parents who love us\\" in his book When Thou Art Converted. though prayer to her or speaking of her as being part of the Mormon Godhead are not encouraged. Islam rejects all of these concepts. Whereas Muslims believe that Allah is absolutely above and separate from all of his creation, having created all of it from nothing,Who Created the Universe and Why? and Why Were We Created?. Mormonism considers both matter and intelligence to be co-eternal with him, and beyond even his power to create or destroy (cf the natural law called the Law of Conservation of Mass, discovered by Antoine Lavoisier in 1785); rather, God (according to Mormonism) \\"organizes\\" the elements into planets, stars, living beings, and so forth.The Contributor, vol. 4, p. 257 (Joseph Smith April 1844 sermon). See also Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses 14:116; and Stephen E. Robinson, LDS Differences in Doctrine. Islam considers this concept to be a deification of creation, which it sees as another form of Shirk.Why Were We Created?. Family relations In Islam, several hadith stress the importance of keeping family relations alive and recommend that the distant relatives ought to be visited, even if took a year to travel to them. Brothers and sisters at home should help their mother when she becomes unable to support her children alone, while at the same time they should be equally benevolent to each other. Muhammad insisted that the most important person in one's life (after Allah) is one's mother, saying: \\"Paradise lies underneath the feet of mothers\\".Quoted in What My Mother Has Advised Me , by Abid Sayd. In Islam, all Muslims are considered brothers and sisters in the faith,Muslims Believe..., see last paragraph. and are often addressed by the titles \\"brother\\" and \\"sister\\". The same holds true in Mormonism.Why Do Mormons Refer to Each Other as Brother and Sister?, from the Mormon Woman website. Mormons also stress the importance of family relations. They designate Sunday as their Sabbath, a day of rest from worldly concerns and endeavors, to concentrate on spiritual matters (including communal worship) and family activities. They also designate Monday evenings as \\"Family Home Evening\\", an evening where all Mormons are encouraged to devote themselves exclusively to family togetherness and joint activities ‚Äì temporal, as well as spiritual.Family Home Evening Website, from the official website of the LDS Church. Though Islam does not have a designated Sabbath (Friday, while the designated day for corporate worship, is otherwise mostly an ordinary work day for Muslims),Is Friday a Substitute for Sabbath or Sunday?. From the Understanding Islam website. it does encourage family togetherness. Mormonism teaches that families can be together throughout eternity, through the rite of eternal marriage and sealing ordinances as performed in Mormon temples. If a Mormon in good standing receives these rites and continues faithful to his or her religion until death, he or she is guaranteed to be reunited in the next life with all other family members who have done the same. Islam declares that all of those who remain faithful to Islam and achieve Jannah (Heaven, or \\"Paradise\\" as it is often called) will be reunited with their families there, or at least so many of them as have remained equally faithful to their religion and achieved the same reward.Quran, Surah 52, verse 21. Prophets Islamic theology recognizes as many as 124,000 prophets. The Quran identifies 25 prophets by name, starting with Adam and ending with Muhammad. Five of these are considered particularly important in Islam: # Nuh (Noah) # Ibrahim (Abraham) # Musa (Moses) # Isa (Jesus) # Muhammad Of these five, four are equally revered in Mormonism, with two uniquely Mormon scriptures, the Book of Abraham and the Book of Moses attributed to two of them. Of the 25 prophets named in the Quran, only Adam, Noah, Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Lot, Joseph, Job, Moses, Aaron, David, Solomon, Elijah, Elisha, Jonah, Zechariah, John and Jesus are recognized by Mormonism. Aaron also lends his name to one of the two \\"priesthoods\\" of Mormonism: the Aaronic priesthood. The other Quranic prophets (Hud, Salih, Shuayb, Dhul-Kifl and Mohammed) are not recognized by Mormons, although Shuayb and Dhul-Kifl are sometimes identified with Jethro and Ezekiel. Hud is sometimes identified with Eber of the Bible.Prophets in Islam . References all three prophets named here, with their corresponding Biblical identities. Muhammad and Joseph Smith Some Latter-day Saints consider Muhammad to have received a portion of God's light, and that moral truths were given to him to enlighten nations and to bring a higher level of understanding to individuals.. See also Brian Hauglid, What Do Mormons Think of Muhammad?. and http://emp.byui.edu/SatterfieldB/FDINT203/FIrst%20Presidency%20Statement%20Feb%201978.html However, it does not consider him to have been a prophet in the same sense as modern-day LDS prophets nor ancient prophets found in the Bible and Book of Mormon, and does not accept the Quran as scripture. Conversely, Islam does not accept Joseph Smith as a prophet, for it believes Muhammad to have been the final prophet of God to humankind.See Muhammad, the Last Prophet, by Dr. Ahmad Shafaat. It equally does not accept the Book of Mormon, or any of the other Latter-day Saint Standard Works, as the Quran is believed to be God's final revelation for all time, and for all people. Jesus In Islam, Jesus is considered to be a human Prophet of God who was sent to guide the Children of Israel with a new scripture, the Injƒ´l, or Gospel.The Oxford Dictionary of Islam, p.158 The Quran states that Jesus was born to Mary (Arabic: Maryam) as the result of a virginal conception, a miraculous event which occurred by the decree of God. To aid him in his ministry, Jesus was given the ability to perform miracles, all by the permission of God rather than his own power. According to the Quran and other Islamic texts, Jesus was neither killed nor crucified,Surah 4:157 clearly states this. but Muslims disagree as to the precise interpretation of these texts; many believe he was raised up alive to Jannah by God. Some Islamic traditions narrate that Jesus will return to Earth near the Day of judgment to restore justice and defeat al-Masƒ´·∏• ad-DajjƒÅl (lit. \\"the false messiah\\", also known as the Antichrist).Encyclopedia of the Qur'an, Jesus\\"Isa\\", Encyclopedia of Islam Like all prophets in Islam, Jesus is considered to have been a Muslim, as he preached for people to adopt the straight path in submission to God's will. Islam rejects that Jesus was God incarnate or the Son of God, stating that he was an ordinary man who, like other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message.In Islam, Jesus' Virgin Birth is not seen as conferring divinity upon him, nor does it make him a Son of God; Muslims compare his miraculous birth to the creation of Adam, who also had no human father. See Do Muslims Believe in the Virgin Birth of Jesus? for further information from the Muslim perspective. Savior *Richard Bushman (2008), Mormonism: A Very Short Introduction, New York: Oxford University Press, , p. 8: \\"As the name of the church ... suggests, Jesus Christ is the premier figure. Smith does not even play the role of the last and culminating prophet, as Muhammad does in Islam\\"; *; *In a 2011 Pew Survey a thousand Mormons were asked to volunteer the one word that best describes Mormons. The most common response from those surveyed was \\"Christian\\" or \\"Christ-centered\\". and premier figure of their religion. According to Mormon doctrine, Jesus Christ is the eldest Son of God the Father. Latter-day Saints identify Jesus with the Old Testament Jehovah per his declaration, \\"I AM that I AM.\\" Because of Christ's suffering, death, and resurrection, all mankind is saved from death, and will rise again and receive a perfected physical body. Furthermore, the Atonement satisfies the demands of justice; grace, forgiveness, and mercy (i.e. salvation) are extended to all who accept Christ as their Savior, receive the saving ordinances that he commanded, and become his life-long disciples.How do the Latter-day Saints Understand Salvation? , from the Brigham Young University website. Mormonism has a different perception of the Christian concept of original sin, and believes individual sin requires an atonement, or infinite, redeeming sacrifice, which had to be accomplished by Jesus Christ after the individual has sought repentance.Atonement . From the LDS dot net website. Salvation and the afterlife Similarities Mormonism and Islam each believe in a life after death: belief in the Last Judgment and an Afterlife is one of the Six Articles of Belief of Islam; it also forms an essential element of the Mormon belief system. Islamic and Mormon concepts of the next world share some common characteristics, which include: *Belief that there are multiple degrees or spiritual levels in heaven (Muslims also believe there are multiple degrees in hell); *Belief that one's place in the afterlife is determined solely by God, based upon one's good works, as well as one's faith; and *Belief that a believer's family, if appropriately faithful to the religion, can join them in the next world. Islam teaches that the purpose of man's creation is essentially to be kind to other human beings and to worship the Creator of the Heavens and Earth: Allah. It furthermore teaches that life lived on this Earth is a test for man to determine each individual's ultimate reward or punishment in the afterlife, which is eternal.What Does Islam Say About Life's Purpose?. These concepts are also held by Mormonism, which views human earthly existence as a trial, designed to see who will prove faithful to God's commands, and thus be worthy to inherit the highest possible exaltation (which Mormons equate to \\"godhood\\", something Islam vehemently opposes). Those who prove less faithful will inherit a lesser reward, but will still be compensated for the good they did.The Purpose of Life, from the Why Mormonism website. See also Ted L. Gibbons, Living Righteously in a Wicked World . Islamic views In Islam, salvation refers to one's entrance to Jannah, or heaven. This word does not encompass the alternate possibility of Jahannam, or hell, nor to the multiple degrees Islam believes to exist in each location. The Quran teaches that the only sin which guarantees damnation for any human being is that of Shirk, or associating other beings or entities with the one, true God: Allah (meaning those who die in such a state; those who repent and embrace Islam during their earthly lives are forgiven this sin).Quran, Surah 4, verse 48. Hence: *Those who die in a state of Shirk will never be forgiven, and will spend eternity in hell.Multiple opinions exist in Islam as to the state of those who never heard of Islam, or did not properly comprehend it. See Fate of the Unlearned in Islam for further details and references. *Those who die believing in the One God (such as Jews and most Christians), but not in Islam, may (or may not) be forgiven by Allah; their eternal state will be determined by him.See previous note. *Those who die believing sincerely in Islam will ultimately be saved, regardless of their deeds; however, Allah may consign them to a period in hell before admitting them to Jannah (also called \\"Paradise\\"), if their deeds warrant it.Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad, Sahia al-Bukhari, 1:2:42. Ultimately, says Islam, all true Muslims will inherit Paradise, even those who are initially confined to hell. However, with multiple levels in Jannah, not every Muslim will inherit the same degree. Furthermore, avoiding hell (described in the Quran as a place of terrible pain and suffering) requires more than belief: it requires repentance from sin and adherence to God's laws. However, Islam emphasizes that good deeds alone do not gain one admission to heaven; ultimately, Allah's mercy alone is what forgives sin and enables man to attain anything good in the next life.Sahih al-Bukhari, 8:76:474. The varying degrees of reward (and of punishment) are a manifestation of God's justice: the level of goodness (or evil) one sows in this life, will be reaped accordingly in the next. Mormonism, for its part, believes almost precisely the same with regard to the role of God's mercy, grace and justice in judgment and salvation.LDS Bible Dictionary: Grace. Latter-day Saint views The Latter-day Saint concept of the afterlife comprises three \\"Degrees of Glory\\", together with a state of existence called \\"Outer Darkness\\", which is not considered a \\"kingdom of glory\\". Entry into one of these kingdoms is determined by God, based upon one's deeds, beliefs and receipt of a series of ordinances mandated by the Latter-day Saint religion. For those who did not have a chance to hear about Jesus Christ or receive Latter-day Saint rites during their earthly life, the LDS Church Temples provide a means for their salvation through proxies who receive the ordinances on their behalf. The three kingdoms are: *The Celestial Kingdom, which is composed of all who have accepted Jesus Christ (in this life or after death), and received all the required ordinances, and who have lived righteous and upright lives on the earth (whether they were Latter-day Saints in this life or not); *The Terrestrial Kingdom, which is reserved for those who refused to accept the saving ordinances by proper authority (Latter-day Saints believe this authority is limited to their church) after having heard of it during this life, but were otherwise honorable and upright people, together with those who failed to live up to the covenants (promises made to God) sufficiently once having received them. *The Telestial Kingdom, which comprises those who refused to accept the gospel of Jesus Christ at all (under the banner of any Christian religion) during their lifetimes, together with \\"liars, and sorcerers, and adulterers, and whore-mongers, and whosoever loves and makes a lie.\\"LDS Doctrine and Covenants 76:103. Although LDS theology declares that even this lowest degree is incomparably better than anything on earth, it also insists that those assigned to this kingdom will be tormented in hell for 1,000 years during the Millennial reign of Christ, prior to entering the Telestial Kingdom.LDS Doctrine and Covenants 76:84, 105-06. In addition to this, there is a fourth destination, which Latter-day Saints specifically reject as being a kingdom or having any glory, referred to as Outer Darkness. This is the abode of those who are sent there after the Last Judgment, where they will dwell in a place of great torment, \\"the end thereof, neither the place thereof, nor their torment, no man knows; Neither was it revealed, neither is, neither will be revealed unto man, except to them who are made partakers thereof.\\"LDS Doctrine and Covenants 76:45-46. This group will comprise Satan and his angels, together with those who have become \\"sons of perdition\\" by committing the unpardonable sin, which is to deny Christ after receiving a witness of him through the Holy Ghost. Charity Charitable giving forms an important part of Islamic and Mormon teaching. One of the Five Pillars of Islam is the payment of Zakat, a mandatory contribution of 2.5% of one's excess wealth, after legitimate needs and expenses (including taxes) have been paid. The poorest Muslims (those below a certain minimum level of wealth) are excused from this payment, as are those who have experienced a net loss in the year's income compared to the previous year's. This money is distributed to extremely poor and needy Muslims, indebted and traveling Muslims, those who seek to propagate the religion, and also to free captives.Islami City: Zakat. Muslims are also enjoined to give above and beyond this 2.5%, in what is referred to as Sadaqah, or charity, according to their means. Islam emphasizes the obligatory nature of Zakat, and states that no one who refuses to give who is able will be accepted by God.Quran, Surah 9, verses 34-35. Mormonism equally emphasizes charitable giving, starting with a tithe of 10% of one's gross income, generally before taxes or expenses are paid. This tithe is mandatory of all who wish to obtain a temple recommend, a requirement to enter LDS temples (as opposed to regular Mormon meetinghouses where anyone can attend weekly worship services).\\"Tithing settlement\\", Church News, 1994-12-10. This money goes to finance the day-to-day operations and activities of the LDS Church. In addition to this, a Fast Sunday is observed once per month, where a special Fast offering is collected to be given to the poor and needy amongst the Mormon people. The amount given during this special offering is generally expected to equal or exceed the amount one would have spent on the two meals which one is asked to forego on that day.\\"Fasting and Fast Offerings\\", churchofjesuschrist.org. U.S. Navy sailors from the HSV-2 Swift move more than 100 tons of humanitarian aid to the pier at Beirut, Lebanon during the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, to be disbursed to Lebanese citizens in coordination with the International Islamic Relief Organization. Mormons and Muslims have recently cooperated in charitable work. In May 2006, the LDS Church donated $1.6 million USD worth of emergency supplies to devastated areas following the earthquake in Java, Indonesia, teaming up with Islamic Relief Worldwide who provided transportation in conjunction with The Islamic Medical Association of North America. That same year, Muslim and Mormon organizations cooperated again in the distribution of humanitarian aid to Lebanese citizens, during the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. Polygamy and celestial marriage In Islam, polygyny is allowed, and is practiced in some countries some Muslim countries, although under certain restrictions. The single passage in the Quran dealing directly with the topic of polygyny is in Surah 4 Verse 3: > And if you fear that you cannot act equitably towards orphans, then marry > such women as seem good to you, two and three and four; but if you fear that > you will not do justice (between them), then (marry) only one or what your > right hands possess; this is more proper, that you may not deviate from the > right course. The practice of polygamy continues among some Muslims worldwide, including a small share (less than 1%)What to Expect When You're Expecting a Co-Wife, from Slate.com. of American Muslims.Philly's Black Muslims Increasingly turn to polygamy. Most American Muslim leaders openly discourage this practice, however, as being contrary to United States law. Early in its history, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints practiced polygamy in the United States and referred to it as \\"plural marriage\\". It was publicly announced by the church in 1852, and the plural marriage ceremony (as conducted by an authorized priesthood leader) was viewed as a sacred, eternal ordinance. Only a small percentage of church members, including leaders, ever practiced polygamy. The practice was formally introduced by Joseph Smith in the LDS Doctrine and Covenants 132, as being from \\"the Lord thy God ...the Alpha and Omega\\".LDS Doctrine and Covenants, Section 132, verses 1-2, 66. These developments quickly led to the enacting of anti-polygamy laws, with the U.S. Congress making polygamy illegal in U.S. territories in 1862. Although Latter- day Saints contended that their religiously based practice of plural marriage was protected by the United States Constitution, the Supreme Court of the United States determined otherwise, leading to the formal ending of the practice in 1890, reinforced by further decrees in 1904 mandating excommunication for any member either practicing or advocating polygamy. Certain fundamentalist Mormon sects continue to practice plural marriage today, albeit outside of the mainstream LDS Church body. Although the mainstream LDS Church has renounced the practice of plural marriage, it still believes and teaches that a celestial marriage contracted between a single unmarried man\\"Unmarried\\", for men, meaning in terms of this world; a Mormon man may be \\"sealed\\" to more than one woman, but not more than one living woman at a time. Mormon women may only ever be \\"sealed\\" to one man, although they may apply for an ecclesiastical divorce (called a \\"Cancellation of Sealing\\"; men, too, may apply for this if they wish to terminate their marriage to a Mormon woman, living or dead) if they wish to be sealed to another man. and a single unmarried woman in one of its temples is eternal. They see such a union as being indispensable for \\"exaltation\\" to \\"godhood\\" in the next life,LDS Doctrine and Covenants, Section 131. and deny an eternal union to all marriages contracted elsewhere. Fasting Fasting forms an important part of both Mormon and Muslim doctrine. Mormons are encouraged to fast from all food and drink (including water) each Fast Sunday (generally the first Sunday of each month). They generally skip two meals during their fast and donate what they would have spent on those meals to those in need. Although this is the only church-scheduled period of recommended fasting, Mormons are encouraged to fast at other times, for personal revelation or during times of prayer and contemplation. Fasting without prayer and sincere devotion to God is not regarded as of much spiritual benefit in the LDS Church. Islam has as one of its \\"five pillars\\" the practice of Sawm, which is not merely fasting from all food and drink (including water), but equally from impure thoughts, words and deeds. Islamic fasting also requires one to refrain from smoking and sexual intercourse during the period of the fast, as well.Sawm Fasting. The infirm and travelers may delay their fasting until a later date, but must make up every obligatory day missed. While Sawm is optional during most of the year (and forbidden altogether on Islam's two holiest days: Eid ul Fitr and Eid ul Adha), it is mandatory during daylight hours throughout the month of Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. It was during this month that the first verses of the Quran were said to have been revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.BBC: Ramadan. The elderly, and those whose health is endangered by fasting (such as diabetics) are excused from doing so, but are required to make up for it by feeding the poor.Ramadan FAQ's , see under \\"Are There Any Exemptions From Fasting?\\" Proselytizing Both Muslims and Mormons are active in proselytizing those outside of their religion, inviting them to learn about their faith and adopt it for themselves, if they so decide. In Islam, this is referred to as Da'wah, and it is considered incumbent upon all Muslims to actively invite non-Muslims to the faith. Da'wah is equally described as the duty to \\"actively encourage fellow Muslims in the pursuance of greater piety in all aspects of their lives\\".The Encyclopaedia of Islam In Islamic theology, the purpose of Da'wah is to invite all people, both Muslims and non-Muslims, to understand the proper worship of God as expressed in the Quran, as well as to inform them about Muhammad. The government of Saudi Arabia spends significant amounts of money to propagate Islam throughout the world, via the building of mosques, printing and distribution of Qurans and other literature, and financing of missionaries. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also has a widespread proselytizing program, and are perhaps best known to others for this activity. Most of these missionaries are young Mormons (generally aged 18‚Äì26), though some are older couples or individuals. All persons aged eight and older, who are considering membership in the LDS Church, are taught by church missionaries prior to baptism. Once this person has been sufficiently instructed, he or she will be interviewed by another missionary to ensure their proper preparation for membership in the church. In certain situations, an interview with the area mission president may be necessary before the church agrees to baptize an individual.LDS Church Handbook of Instructions, pp. 32-34. Images national mosque of Malaysia. Neither Mormons nor Muslims permit drawings or photos inside their places of worship; the Mormons do allow some in the hallways and elsewhere outside of their chapels. According to the Quran, idolatry or assigning partners to the One God () is an egregious sin. It is seen as different from all other sins and is categorized as the one and only categorically unforgivable sin. Hence, depicting religious themes, and specifically God, is seen as inappropriate and unbecoming. Islam does not believe that Allah may be depicted in any artistic manner whatsoever, nor represented by any kind of image, no matter what reason one may have for doing so. Furthermore, the Sunni portion of Islam, comprising approximately 85% of the world's Muslims, also rejects all depictions of their prophets ‚Äì whether artistic or photographic (as in a movie). For instance, the 1998 Dreamworks animated film The Prince of Egypt was banned in Egypt, Malaysia, the Maldives and Indonesia, as these predominately Muslim countries objected to any depiction of Moses, whom Islam views as a prophet.\\"There can be miracles\\", The Independent, January 24, 1999 Latter-day Saints do not generally approve of or own crucifixes, and do not typically have statues in their local ward meeting houses, though some have been erected in LDS Visitor Centers and elsewhere.See Temple Square: Sites, under \\"North and South Visitors' Centers\\" for one example. Portraits of Jesus, together with photographs or paintings of current and/or past church leaders, are allowed in LDS meetinghouses, but not in the main worship area (called the Chapel), and they are not permitted for use as objects of devotion, as in Roman Catholic or Eastern Orthodox churches.LDS Church Handbook of Instructions, pp. 181-82. An exception to the general ban on statues is for an angel blowing a trumpet, commonly identified as Moroni, which is placed on the tallest spire of many LDS temples, facing eastward. These are, however, purely artistic in nature. Muslims performing Wudu, the ritual of washing one's hands, arms, feet and head prior to Salat or other prayers. Washing Muslims are commanded in the QuranQuran, Surah 5, verse 6. to purify themselves prior to prayer by engaging in a ritual of washing known as Wudu. Although there are a few slight differences between the specifics of the Sunni and Shi'ite practice, Wudu always involves using clean water to wash the hands, teeth, mouth, nose, ears, face and neck, the arms up to the elbows, the feet up to the ankles, and running a wet hand over one's hair (called Masah). This must be done prior to each performance of Salat, the five-times-daily ritual prayers required of all Muslims, and must also be done prior to other ritual prayers. Those who have been able to preserve their ritual cleanliness according to Islamic rules are not required to perform Wudu, but are encouraged to do so nonetheless. This washing is accompanied by specified prayers and a sincere intention to perform Wudu in the heart. For those adult Muslims who have had sexual intercourse or any sexual discharge (e.g. of semen),Sahih Muslim, hadith number 616Sharh as- Sunnah by al-Baghawi, vol 2., pg. 9 or who have completed the menstrual cycleMajmoo' Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz by Shaykh Abd al-Aziz ibn Baaz, vol. 10 pg. 161Majmoo' Fataawa Ibn 'Uthaymeen by Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen, vol. 11 pg. 318-319 or given birth,Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 2, Book 23, Hadith number 345 the performance of ghusl is prescribed, replacing Wudu for that particular instance. In Ghusl, one bathes the entire body from head to foot, leaving none of it unwashed, again with sincere intention and prayers. Islam also recommends (i.e. it is mustahab) performance of the full ablution before the FridaySahih al-Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 12, Hadith number 817Majmoo' Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi'ah li Samaahat by Shaykh Abd al-Aziz ibn Baaz, part 12, pg. 404 and EidSharh Mukhtasar, Volume 2, pg. 102 prayers, before entering the ehram, in preparation for hajj,Tamaam al-Minnah by Shaykh al- Albani, pg. 120 after having lost consciousness, and after formally converting to Islam.How to Become Muslim . For those Muslims unable to find clean water to wash with, a ritual known as Tayammum is commanded, in which a Muslim uses \\"clean earth\\" to ritually cleanse his hands, arms, and face. This is only permitted if clean water is unavailable, or if the water is more than 1.7 km away.Lemu, B. A. Islamic Aqidah and Fiqh:A textbook of Islamic Belief and Jurisprudence, revised and expanded edition of Tawhid and Fiqh), IQRA' International Educational Foundation, Chicago, 1997. Although Mormonism does not require a special rite of washing prior to daily prayer or corporate worship, its special ceremony of washing and anointing (also called the \\"Initiatory\\") is an ordinance that symbolizes ritual cleansing and anointing to be a king or queen in heaven. In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, this rite is performed exclusively in temples. The ordinance of washing and anointing symbolizes the ritual cleansings of priests that took place at Israel's Tabernacle, the temple of Solomon, and at later temples in Jerusalem (see Exod. 28:40-42, 29:4-9, 29:20-21, 29:29-30, 30:18-21). As the name suggests, this ordinance has two parts, a ritual washing in water by a like-gendered person specially ordained to this task, followed by anointing with oil. This ritual is generally administered as a precursor to the endowment, one of the most important of Mormon temple ordinances.Boyd K. Packer, \\"Come to the Temple\\", Liahona, October 2007. Dietary rules and alcohol Both Mormonism and Islam forbid the drinking of alcoholic beverages. Both also offer their members a list of substances that are forbidden for consumption to believers. Islamic jurisprudence specifies certain foods as being halƒÅl, or lawful, and others as harƒÅm, or unlawful. These designations are based upon rules found in the Quran. Other restrictions have been added to these in various fatawa (authoritative Islamic statements of religious opinion) given by mujtahids (Islamic scholars) with various degrees of strictness. These are not always held to be authoritative by all Muslims everywhere. According to the Quran, the only foods explicitly forbidden are:Quran: Surah 2, verse 173; Surah 5, verse 3. *Meat from animals that die of themselves, or are strangled, gored or beaten to death; *Anything containing blood; *The meat of swine (this includes all products containing pork, or any derivative or by-product of pork); and *Animals dedicated to, or slaughtered in the name of, anyone other than God. However, should a Muslim find themselves in a situation where no other food is available other than some product mentioned above, he or she is permitted to eat of it, but only in such an amount as proves necessary to sustain one's life.Quran: Surah 2, verse 173. In addition to these items, Islam generally forbids the eating of any beast of prey, or any beast having fangs, together with all meat that has not been slaughtered under the name of Allah, in accordance with Islamic ritual laws. Jewish-certified kosher meat is considered Halal for Muslims, as it is still slaughtered according to ancient practices meant to minimize the animal's suffering, and also to invoke the name of God at the time of the animal's death.The Alert for Haraam . The Quran specifically authorizes consumption of such meat,Quran: Surah 5, verse 5. though modern Muslim practice generally forbids eating of non-Kosher or non-certified-Halal meat (such as is prepared in Western slaughterhouses), because the name of God is no longer mentioned over those animals that are slaughtered there, nor do modern slaughter methods correspond to traditionally approved Muslim ones. and Shaukat A. Ameen, Is the meat of Ahl-al-Kitab Halal?. The second reference contains detailed information about the correct Islamic procedure for slaughtering meat, as well as reasons why non-Kosher and non-Halal-certified meat is no longer considered lawful by many modern Muslims. In addition to these items, Alcoholic beverages ‚Äì or any intoxicant ‚Äì are forbidden in Islam. According to the Quran, \\"intoxicants and games of chance\\" are \\"abominations of Satan's handiwork\\".Quran: Surah 5, verses 90-91; Surah 2, verse 219; the latter verse also prohibits gambling. Similarly, a set of Mormon dietary rules are found in the LDS D&C; 89, which contains three elements: *A list of substances such as wine, strong drink, so-called hot drinks (interpreted as coffee and tea ‚Äì but not herbal teas ‚Äì by the LDS Church), and tobacco, that are not to be used at all (); *A list of foods that may be used, albeit sometimes with certain limitations (including meat, which is advised to be eaten \\"sparingly\\", but this is no longer emphasized) (); and *A promise to those who follow the guidelines, that they shall \\"run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint\\" (). The sole exception made to the prohibitions contained in this \\"Word of Wisdom\\" is for wine used as part of the Mormon Sacrament of Communion), commonly referred to as \\"the Sacrament\\". The revelation indicates that if wine is used for the Sacrament, it must be pure and either \\"of your own make\\" or made by other Mormons. The LDS Church no longer uses wine in its Sacrament, having replaced it with water in conformity to a revelation on the subject;LDS Doctrine and Covenants, Section 27. thus members are no longer permitted to drink any alcoholic beverages. Tobacco, for its part, is stated as being \\"not for the body, neither for the belly, and [it] is not good for man, but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with judgment and skill.\\"LDS Doctrine and Covenants, Section 89, verse 8. While forbidding alcohol, Islam does not prohibit coffee or tea, though some fatawa prohibit tobacco. Conversely, the LDS Church no longer has any restrictions on the types of meat one may eat, or when one may consume them (except for designated fasting periods ‚Äì see above). Other Latter Day Saint denominations and Islam Besides The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the Latter Day Saint movement contains several smaller factions, many (though not all) of which broke from the LDS Church in the decades following Joseph Smith's death. These include, but are not limited to: *The Community of Christ, the second-largest Latter Day Saint faction, headquartered in Independence, Missouri, formerly known as the \\"Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints\\" (RLDS); *The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite), generally considered the third-largest faction, headquartered in Monongahela, Pennsylvania; *The Church of Christ (Temple Lot), headquartered in Independence, Missouri; and *The Church of Christ with the Elijah Message, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), and a host of smaller sects. These churches all reject various teachings of the mainline LDS Church, with specific differences varying from denomination to denomination. Most reject the LDS notion that God was ever once a man, or that man can become a god, as taught within the LDS Church. However, with the notable exception of the Strangites, each of these sects accepts in some way or another the traditional Christian division of the Godhead into three persons: Father, Son and Holy Ghost, thus placing each in fundamental opposition to Islamic dogma. The Strangites are closer to Islam by insisting that only the Father is God;Strang, James J. (1856) Book of the Law of the Lord, Being a Translation From the Egyptian of the Law Given to Moses in Sinai. St. James: Royal Press, pp. 47-63. however, their assertion that God has a body of fleshBook of the Law, chapter 2, \\"The True God,\\" note vs. 9-20, quoted in True & Living God . places them at odds with Islam, as well. Islam does have acceptance of polygamy in common with the Strangites and Fundamentalist Mormons. Strangites, however, have given up the actual practice of (though not belief in) polygamy, while the Fundamentalist Mormons continue to practice it today. The other Latter Day Saint factions generally reject polygamy, together with eternal marriage, the Book of Abraham, and various other distinctive mainline LDS doctrines. While much of this renders them closer to Islam in some ways than the mainline LDS Church, numerous irreconcilable differences in doctrine and practices still persist between these smaller factions and the Muslim faith.See Differences Between the LDS, Temple Lot and Community of Christ Churches; the Community of Christ is referred to as \\"RLDS\\" in this table, which stands for \\"Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints\\", its former name. Also see the Wikipedia article on Community of Christ (differentiation from LDS Church) for a more detailed study of differences between the LDS and Community of Christ churches. These references can provide a starting point for comparison of non- Utah LDS Latter Day Saint beliefs with Islamic beliefs. The Community of Christ has used at least one Quranic text (Surah 5, verse 8) in an official publication for its youth,Ordinary Time, Proper 28 , \\"Words of Encouragement\\". and has offered a \\"Peace Colloquy\\" featuring a speaker who endeavored to present Islam in a positive light.John Esposito, The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality? , address delivered at the 2005 Community of Christ Peace Colloquy, Independence, Missouri.

Early life F. E. Winchcombe was born on 26 April 1855 in Brunswick, Victoria. His parents were John Phillimore Winchcombe, a quarryman who immigrated from Wales, and Julia Sophia Earle. The Welsh Winchcombes were a junior branch of the Gloucestershire clothier family plausibly descended from the 16th century Berkshire clothier Jack O‚ÄôNewbury. Career After graduating, Winchcombe joined the wool brokerage of Mort & Co. In September 1889 Winchcombe formed Winchcombe, Carson & Company with partners Duncan Carson, C. L. Wallis and E. J. Turton. The company served as woolbrokers and cattle agents. Winchcombe was a commissioner for the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, an executive member of the Patriotic Fund for the South African War and a vice-president of the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales. He was three times president of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce (1907‚Äì08, 1909‚Äì10, 1914‚Äì15), a director of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, Atlas Assurance Co. Ltd and James Martin & Co. Ltd, and chairman of Ruthven Ltd, a Queensland pastoral company. He was the first President of the Wildlife Preservation Society of Australia. At a by-election in November 1900, Winchcombe was elected to the Legislative Assembly for Ashfield. He was re- elected unopposed at the 1901 election, and comfortably retained the seat at the 1904 election. He resigned in August 1905 and traveled to Europe. He was appointed to the Legislative Council in 1907, remaining a member until his death. He was a member of the Board of Health (1907‚Äì10). During the First World War he organized the Sydney Chamber of Commerce War Food Fund, helped to establish the State Wool Committee, founded the Universal Service League (1915). He was a trustee of the Regimental Comforts Fund and vice-president of the Soldiers' Club (1915). Personal life He married Annie Amelia Henson (died 1952) at Christ Church St Laurence on 25 September 1878. They had four sons and two daughters. Winchcombe attended St Mark's Church in Darling Point. He was briefly Rector's warden at Christ Church St Laurence (1877‚Äì83). His daughter Edyth married Thomas Bavin. His grandchildren included barrister John Winchcombe Bavin, educationalist Nancy Milner-Gulland and writer and theatrical producer Ian Bevan.

Just east of the station, the two lines enter the Market Street subway. The station originally opened with the 22 Fillmore line (now a trolleybus line) in 1895. History The Market Street Railway opened its 22 Fillmore streetcar line in 1895; it jogged from Church Street to Fillmore Street on a short section of Duboce Avenue. On October 21, 1928, the San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni) N Judah streetcar line opened. It ran on Duboce Avenue between Market Street and the Sunset Tunnel, and shared track and overhead wires with the 22 for one block. Muni took over the ex-Market Street Railway system in September 1944. Muni converted a number of streetcar lines, including the 22, to trolleybus on July 31, 1948; it was rerouted via Hermann Street one block to the north to avoid conflicts between the overhead wires for trolleybuses and streetcars. A diverted M Ocean View streetcar outbound on Church at Duboce Beginning in the late 1960s, construction of the Market Street subway required diversions of Muni's five remaining streetcar lines, which ran on Market Street. The largest diversion routed K, L, and M cars from the Twin Peaks Tunnel onto new tracks on 17th Avenue, joining the J Church on Church Street, and continuing past Market Street on new tracks to join the N Judah tracks on Duboce. An inbound concrete boarding platform was built on Church Street at Duboce Avenue; outbound cars stopped further south on Church Street at Market Street. (Boarding platforms were also built on Duboce Avenue for the N.) Streetcars on the J, K, L, and M lines were routed onto the diversion route on December 2, 1972, though only outbound cars used the diversion north of Market Street until 1973. The new Duboce Portal was constructed on Duboce Avenue east of Church, parallel to the operating surface streetcar line. N Judah trains began using the new portal on weekdays on February 18, 1980 - the first Muni Metro service. On December 17, 1980, the K, L, and M lines began Muni Metro service (and ceased using the diversion route) on weekdays. J Church trains began using the new portal on June 17, 1981. Finally, on September 19, 1982, weekend service was replaced by buses (and converted to Muni Metro trains on November 20), leaving only the inbound J Church stopping on Church at Duboce. This station will be the northern terminus for the J Church service starting in August 2020, when Muni service is projected to return after the COVID-19 pandemic. Accessible sections of high-level platforms were later built east of Church Street, near the entrance to the portal. These accessible platforms serve both lines; because the J Church stop at Market Street is not accessible, outbound J Church trains serve Duboce and Church if required by a passenger (but otherwise do not stop). Since the diversion in 1972, Duboce Avenue between Church Street and Market Street is not open to automobiles. A sidewalk and bike lanes run along the south side of the portal, and a 2-track Muni yard (the pre-1982 route to Market Street) sits on the north side. A Muni operator facility is located next to the yard. Under Muni stop naming conventions, the stop is known as Duboce and Church for the N Judah, and Church and Duboce for the J Church. Failures of the interlocking between the J and N lines can cause significant cascading delays in the Market Street subway. Eight such failures occurred between 2017 and early 2019. As part of August 2020 changes to Muni Metro, the J became an all-surface line to avoid this issue. The J initially terminates at the inbound platform on Church Street at Market Street, providing an accessible transfer between the J and subway trains. A mini-high platform will be constructed on the inbound platform at Church and Duboce, and an outbound mini-high platform will be built on Church Street south of Market Street, allowing the J to be re- extended slightly to Duboce Street in October 2020.

He notably created the role of Barak, the Dyer in the world premiere of Strauss's Die Frau ohne Schatten.  History  Mayr studied medicine in Vienna before being persuaded by Gustav Mahler to pursue a career as a singer. After studying at the Vienna Music Academy for several years, he made his professional opera d√©but to critical acclaim at the Bayreuth Festival in 1902 as Hagen in Wagner's G√∂tterd√§mmerung.

Brockway is located on the north shore of Lake Tahoe on State Line Point, adjacent to the Nevada state border. It lies at an elevation of 6266 feet (1910 m). The Brockway post office operated from 1901 to 1966. The name honors Nathaniel Brockway, uncle of the first postmaster. Brockway was one of the first places settled at Lake Tahoe by American immigrants to California after the first Trans-Continental Railroad, which passed 12 miles north of the lake, through Truckee. The first road built to transport tourists from the Truckee railstop to Lake Tahoe was over Brockway summit (Highway 267), and ended at the Brockway pier, where steamers could take visitors to other locations. Soon afterwards, a spur railroad was built to Tahoe City from Truckee, and it became the first real resort community at the lake. (The old railroad grade is now a bicycle path along the Truckee River.) Brockway has the only hot springs at Lake Tahoe, right at the shore. Old \\"grain grinding holes\\" (Washo: g√°mu≈ã ) are visible in massive talus boulders along the shore. A \\"commodious\\" hotel was constructed around 1869, shortly after the completion of the road over Brockway Summit. Brockway was once located in two different states as surveyors establishing the California-Nevada border (which makes its turn to the north in the middle of the lake) mistakenly placed the line a half mile west of its proper location, placing Brockway in Nevada. It was eventually corrected. The Brockway community grew and numerous homes were built in the 1920s and 30s. In the 1930s and 40s, Brockway attracted Hollywood celebrities.

Accessed 2009-08-18 Robert was the son of Robert E. Rawlins of Pierre, South Dakota, schools superintendent (after whom the town's Rawlins Municipal Library is named). An Edison Scholar in 1929, Bob was expelled from an engineering course at South Dakota State College for spending too much time playing bridge. He spent some time working for the local highway department, before studying physics at the University of South Dakota (USD), Vermillion. There he met music student Marjorie Townsley, daughter of John Boyd Townsley, editor of the Dakota Republican. Graduating in 1940, Bob went to work for Lockheed in California, and when Marge graduated in 1942, she decided not to take up the offer of a scholarship to the Eastman School of Music,Bonnie Hayes UCI's Patron Saint Gives Another $1 Million Los Angeles Times (1996-11-15) and married Bob. At Lockheed, Bob rose through the ranks into management, finally heading their Electronic Systems Analysis and DevelopmentJeff Rawlins, HP mag in 1956. lab in Burbank. In 1956, he was hired by Hewlett Packard to run their new subsidiary, Dynac (soon renamed Dymec for legal reasons), and the couple moved to Palo Alto with their children Pam and Jeff.Andr√© P. Larson, \\"The Witten-Rawlins Collection\\" Journal of the Violin Society of America, vol 12 (1992) pp. 13‚Äì21 Bob was the first general manager, building the company up very rapidly from a small team in a single large room to a major business occupying several buildings. The core purpose of Dymec was to provide customized electronic measuring equipment, which necessitated considerable creativity, and Bob's name appears on a number of patents, including one for the backup transmitter for the first generation of US space satellites. In 1959, HP took the subsidiary into full ownership, and Bob left once the administrative transition was settled to take the post of Assistant to the President of HP, David Packard.The First Ten Years of DYMEC Palo Alto CA, Hewlett Packard (1966) Marge, in addition to bringing up the children, became involved with several local singing ensembles. In 1966 she founded the University Women's Chorus (which she soon opened to non-graduates; for many years it has been called the Peninsula Women's Chorus), stressing the value of discipline and learning by insisting that performers worked from memory, even when singing in foreign languages. Both Marge and Bob, in their respective spheres, placed as much emphasis on enjoyment and sociability as on achievement, and the Chorus still maintains a tradition of parties each spring.Origins of PWC Peninsula Women's Chorus newsletter (Fall 2006) After leaving HP in 1962, Bob became a venture capitalist and scored numerous successes in the electronic technology industry. The couple shared a philosophy that the best status symbols were successes in which they had invested, and applied this even to ventures in which success was not measured by financial returns. When Marge learned of a new museum in her hometown, the Shrine to Music, which was opened at USD in 1975, she investigated it and became a life member. This led to a long succession of donations over many years, both for acquisitions and for improvements, such as the courtyard, with Mike Tuma's 1987 sculpture \\"Generations\\".Museum courtyard webpage University of South DakotaInventories of American Painting and Sculpture Smithsonian American Art Museum. Many of these donations were in the form of stocks in which Bob had invested, the most notable being the transfer of shares worth $3 million to buy the Witten collection of early stringed instruments in 1984. The following year, Bob put up $550,000 to buy the museum the Harrison Stradivarius violin, as a birthday tribute to Marge, and many other donations followed, the total approaching $6 million by 1991. Having now amassed the world's greatest collection, the Shrine has become the National Music Museum. In the late 1970s, the Rawlins decided to return to Southern California to retire, and acquired the last unbuilt bayfront plot on Balboa Island, Newport Beach. Having lived for two decades in a modernist \\"Eichler\\" house, they chose architect John Lautner to realise Joseph Eichler's notion of \\"bringing the outside in\\" on a waterfront plot 30 feet wide and 70 feet deep, hemmed in by other houses. The result was a very individual, open-plan building of wood and concrete, with all of its curved seaward end filled by glass panels that could slide aside at the touch of a button. Initially resistant to Lautner's insistence on providing the two-story house with an elevator, they were later glad that this allowed them to spend the rest of their lives there.Janet Eastman The rebel of the block Los Angeles Times (2003-11-06) After the move, Bob and Marge began to involve themselves with music and culture at the local University of California, Irvine (UCI), but they also gave much support to the University of South Dakota. In 1987 they arranged for the creation of a piano and string trio, the members of which were to teach within USD's music department; the founder members chose to call themselves the Rawlins Piano Trio.Rawlins Piano Trio webpage University of South Dakota In 1991 they gave a record $1.7 million endowment to USD for scholarships to the valedictorians of 14 South Dakota high schools.New Scholarship Endowment is USD's Largest, University of South Dakota, Farber Fund Newsletter (1991-07-16) Bob died in September 1993.

Against the backdrop of the Mexican Revolution, which lasted a decade from 1910 through 1920, she worked for a series of newspapers, using her writing to work towards making a meaningful and effective change. She began her career in journalism at La Cr√≥nica, her father's newspaper in Laredo, Texas, her hometown. While working as a journalist, she became the president of the newly-established League of Mexican Women‚ÄîLa Liga Femenil Mexicanista‚Äîin October 1911, an organization with a focus on offering free education to Mexican children in Laredo. She was also active in the Primer Congreso Mexicanista, an organization that brought Mexican-Americans together to discuss issues such as their lack of access to adequate education and economic resources.  Early life Jovita Idar was born in Laredo, Texas, in 1885. She was one of eight children of Jovita and Nicasio Idar who strove to advance the civil rights of Mexican-Americans. The Idar family were part of the gente decente, who had better access to good education and opportunities than many m√©xico-tejano families had. All eight Idar children grew up in an atmosphere where rights and responsibilities and the underprivileged circumstances of the Chicano community were consistently discussed. In the book Marching to a Different Drummer, Robin Kadison Berson explains that \\"Growing up, Jovita was an imaginative, spirited girl; eager student, she won prizes for her poetry and enjoyed reciting before an audience.\\" Education and teaching Idar earned her teaching certificate in 1903 from the Holding Institute in Laredo. She taught in a school in Los Ojuelos, located approximately 40 miles east of Laredo. The reality of her first years teaching was frustrating, \\"There were never enough textbooks for her pupils or enough paper, pens or pencils; if all her students came to class, there were not enough chairs or desks for them.\\" The schooling for Chicano students was inadequate. Chicanos paid taxes to support decent schooling for their children yet they were denied entry to schools. Idar realized that her teaching efforts were making little impact on student lives due to the ill-equipped segregated schools. Advocacy for social issues Against the backdrop of the Mexican Revolution, which lasted a decade from 1910 through 1920, Idar turned from teaching to journalism as a means of working towards making a meaningful and effective change. She returned to Laredo, Texas, where she began to work alongside two of her brothers, Eduardo and Bobby Brown, for her father's newspaper, La Cr√≥nica (\\"The Chronicle\\"). Their father, Nicasio Idar, was a strong and proud man, who advocated for civil rights and social justice for Mexican-Americans. He edited and published La Cr√≥nica, which became a major voice for Mexican and Tejano rights. Jovita wrote articles under a pseudonym, exposing the poor living- conditions of Mexican-American workers and supported the Revolution. In 1910 La Cr√≥nica included articles on news, current events, biographical and historical essays that concerned Mexican Americans, literary essays and poetry, and commentary. It focused attention on the serious social and economic inequities experienced by Mexican Americans in Texas, in particular, and in the U.S., in general. It featured \\"stories on educational and social discrimination against Mexican Americans, poor economic conditions, decreasing use of the Spanish language, the loss of Mexican culture and the lynching of Hispanics.\\" In 1911, La Cr√≥nica established a \\"fraternal order\\", the Orden Caballeros de Honor to \\"discuss the troubling social issues at the time\\". and held the First Mexican Congress‚Äîthe Primer Congreso Mexicano‚Äîdedicated to fighting inequality and racism, and to unite Mexicans on issues that affected them, including lack of access to adequate education and economic resources. While working at La Cr√≥nica, Idar also served as the first president of La Liga Femenil Mexicanista, the League of Mexican Women, an \\"offshoot\\" of the Congress that was founded in October 1911 in Laredo to offer free education to Mexican children. In her 2018 book based on her PhD dissertation, Redeeming La Raza: Transborder Modernity, Race, Respectability, and Rights, Gabriela Gonz√°lez wrote that these organizations were established in response to the poverty and racism experienced by transborder Mexican communities. While working at La Cr√≥nica, Idar also served as the first president of the League of Mexican Women (La Liga Femenil Mexicanista), an organization founded in October 1911 in Laredo to offer free education to Mexican children. Additional goals of the organization were to \\"unify the Mexican intellectuals of Texas around the issues of protection of civil rights, bilingual education, the lynching of Mexicans, labor organizing and women's concerns.\\" The women within this league worked to transform these injustices into a plan of action and focused on relieving social problems through actively making changes within their communities. Women who participated in this organization were highly influential. \\"Some league members were trained educators and professionals, and the education of youth remained the organization's primary focus.\\" It developed into a social, political and charitable organization for women that, in part, provided food and clothes to those in need. Both the League of Mexican Women and the First Mexican Congress actively worked for the advancement of their members, \\"by holding studying and learning sessions, sessions where culture is acquired and talent is developed.\\" In March 1913, when Nuevo Laredo ‚Äî on the Mexican side of the border ‚Äî was attacked, Idar and other Laredo women crossed the Rio Grande River to volunteer to help with the wounded. While at the border, Idar later joined the La Cruz Blanca ‚Äî the White Cross, an organization that provided relief similar to the Red Cross, that had been created and financed by Leonor Villegas de Magn√≥n, who was also from Laredo. In 1914, when she returned from her volunteer nursing work at the border, she began writing for El Progreso. An editorial published in El Progreso criticised President Woodrow Wilson's order to dispatch U.S military troops to the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border had offended the U.S Army and Texas Rangers. The Rangers attempted to close El Progreso, but Idar blocked the entrance to the newspaper's office. When she was not at the newspaper's office one day, the Rangers returned to ransack it and to destroy the printing- presses, effectively shutting down the newspaper. After her father's death in 1914, she became the editor and writer at La Cr√≥nica, where she continued to expose the conditions that Mexican-Americans and Mexican immigrants were living under at the time. In November 1916, Idar founded the weekly paper Evoluci√≥n which remained in operation until 1920. Idar moved to San Antonio in 1921 where she founded a free kindergarten and also volunteered in a hospital as an interpreter. In 1940 she co-edited the journal El Heraldo Cristiano.  Personal life  In May 1917, Idar married Bartolo Ju√°rez, who worked as a plumber and tinsmith. They lived together in San Antonio until her death, on June 15, 1946, which was reported to have been caused by a pulmonary hemorrhage. She had been suffering from advanced tuberculosis. Legacy In 2018, Gabriela Gonz√°lez published her book Redeeming La Raza: Transborder Modernity, Race, Respectability, and Rights, which was based on her PhD dissertation in which she provided the historical, political, and socio- economic dimensions of la raza during Jovita Idar's lifetime, including an in- depth description of the role Idar's family played over several generations. Profiles of Idar have been included in the National Women's History Museum, the Women in Texas History series, the 2005 edition of The Oxford Encyclopedia of Latinos and Latinas in the United States, and in the series Texas Originals. Her story was included in Laura Gutierrez-Witt's chapter, \\"Cultural Continuity in the Face of Change: Hispanic Printers in Texas\\", in the 1996 publication, Recovering the U.S. Hispanic Literary Heritage. In the chapter entitled \\"Jovita Idar: The Ideological Origins of a Transnational Advocate\\" for La Raza in the 2015 publication, Texas Women: Their Histories, Their Lives, the authors wrote that Idar promoted the values of the \\"gente decente,\\" self-identified decent, honest and respectable people, as the solution to the social problems faced by marginalized communities, \\"Idar promoted the idea that education elevated women and by extension men.\\" She reflected an ideal of feminism that was not completely against Victorian concepts, but she did challenge ideas and break boundaries of the patriarchal society of her time. The New York Times included Idar in a series of obituaries called Overlooked, about people whose accomplishments in their lifetime deserved to be acknowledged in the media when they died but were not. In their August 2020 installment, the focus was on the centennial of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which was adopted in 1920. The 19th Amendment prohibits any American citizen from being denied the right to vote on the basis of sex. As part of Hispanic Heritage Month, the Google Doodle on September 21, 2020, paid homage to Idar by depicting her famous blockade of the offices of El Progreso against the Texas Rangers and commemorating via hover box her 135th birthday (two weeks after her actual birthday).

This section of SR 602 is a four-lane divided road that travels northward between subdivisions of single-family homes. Reston Parkway At the intersection where Lawyers Road turns east as SR 673, SR 602 continues north as Reston Parkway. This road serves as the Main Street of busy Reston. It first passes SR 5320, Sunrise Valley Drive, which, to the east, is the address of many office buildings. It then passes SR 267, the Dulles Airport Access and Toll Roads, which lead to Dulles Airport, Leesburg, and Washington, D.C. via Interstate 66.

Soundtrack Soundtrack cover art The film features an entirely original score comprising Brian Eno-inspired pop songs, as well as a few more ambient tracks. Written mostly by brothers Jordan and Eric Lehning under the moniker of The Non-Commissioned Officers, the soundtrack also features various Nashville-local artists such as The Glib, Tristen, Leah High, Vicki Mead, The Ostrich Boys, and Amanda Crawford. The writing of the soundtrack actually began before the writing of the script. In the Spring of 2004, around the same time that work on the actual screenplay began, Jordan and Eric Lehning got together to begin work on the soundtrack to the film. The two met in Boston where Jordan was attending Berklee College of Music, and created a few songs for the movie, with the idea that the musical themes would help sculpt the story of the film itself. Many of the songs created during this time made it onto the final soundtrack when it was released 5 years later, including \\"No Means No,\\" \\"Sweet Eleanor,\\" and \\"Flour.\\" The 2-disc, 44-song soundtrack was independently released in March 2009, coinciding with the film's showings at the 2009 South by Southwest Film Festival. It can currently only be purchased online through the film's Web site for $15 or in a small amount of independent music stores across the country.

Reavis.Kaiser, p. 161 The Rejected was the first documentary program on homosexuality broadcast on American television.Alwood, p. 41 It was first shown on KQED on September 11, 1961, and was later syndicated to National Educational Television (NET) stations across the United States. The Rejected received positive critical reviews. Production Reavis, an independent producer who was apparently unconnected to the homophile movement, wrote up his idea for The Rejected in 1960.Capsuto, p. 39 Reavis originally titled the documentary The Gay Ones. He explained his goals for the program in his proposal: Thus, Reavis approached the topic from the standpoint of homosexuality being a social problem akin to alcoholism or prostitution. This echoed how many earlier programs, often produced as episodes of local talk shows, addressed homosexuality with shows bearing such titles as \\"Homosexuals and the Problems They Present\\" and \\"Homosexuality: A Psychological Approach\\". The Rejected focused exclusively on gay men, with no representation of lesbians.Casta√±eda and Campbell, p. 259 Reavis expressed his reluctance to include lesbians in his proposal: Commercial stations turned down the program, as did sponsors. KQED bought the project in early 1961 under the new title. The documentary was shot entirely in the KQED studio except for one segment on location at the Black Cat Bar, a San Francisco gay bar that had been fighting state and police harassment since 1948. Reavis and co-producer Irving Saraf filmed The Rejected on a budget of less than $100. Reavis and director Richard Christian utilized the talk show format, breaking down the subject matter into a series of smaller topics. Each segment included one or more subject matter experts discussing homosexuality from a different perspective. Within each segment, Reavis presented a stereotype about homosexuality and then challenged the validity of that stereotype through the expert interviews. His goal, as he noted in his original proposal, was to give the viewer \\"a feeling he is confused and that society as a whole is confused about homosexuality\\".Alwood, p. 42 Experts interviewed for the program included: * Margaret Mead speaking from an anthropological standpoint. Mead spoke of the positive roles that homosexuality had played in the cultures of Ancient Greece and the South Sea Islands and in Inuit and Native American societies. She noted that it is society and not the individual that determines how homosexuality and homosexual behaviour are viewed. * Psychiatrist Karl Bowman of the Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute,Sears, p. 501 who explained the Kinsey scale of human sexuality and who spoke against a punitive approach to treating homosexual patients. Medical doctor Erwin Braff also addressed medical issues. * Episcopal Bishop of San Francisco James Pike and rabbi Alvin Fine addressed religious topics. Each man espoused his belief that sodomy laws should be repealed because in his opinion homosexuality was a mental illness.Capsuto, pp. 39‚Äì40 Pike specifically compared homosexuality to chronic alcoholism, but called for homosexuals to be treated with \\"love and concern and interest\\" and for not condemning them as \\"evil\\". * The city's district attorney, Thomas C. Lynch, covered legal issues along with lawyers J. Albert Hutchinson, Al Bendich, and Morris Lowenthal (who had previously defended the Black Cat Bar during its 15-year legal battle against police and government harassment).Cain, p. 79 * Openly gay Mattachine Society president Hal Call, Mattachine executive secretary Donald Lucas and Mattachine treasurer Les Fisher spoke for gay men. The Rejected was unusual for its time in that it included actual gay people as opposed to only presenting ostensibly heterosexual experts.Witt, et al., p. 113 KQED station manager James Day opened the documentary by reading a statement from California's then-Attorney General Stanley Mosk: Critical and popular response The Rejected was critically and popularly well-received upon its initial airing. Variety described it as handling the topic in a \\"matter-of-fact down-the-middle manner, covering it quite thoroughly and, for the most part, interestingly\\". Terrence O'Flaherty, critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, concurred, praising KQED for its courage in addressing the subject matter,Tropiano, p. 6 as did the San Francisco Examiner, which said the program \\"handled [the topic] soberly, calmly and in great depth\\".quoted in Sears, p. 502 Of the letters KQED received, which numbered in the hundreds,Capsuto, p. 40 97% were positive and many of the writers encouraged the station to make more programs like it.Tropiano, p. 7 Dorian Book Service of San Francisco published a transcript of The Rejected,Stryker and Van Buskirk, p. 46 and close to 400 people ordered copies. KQED syndicated The Rejected to NET channels across the country; it aired on as many of 40 of the 55 NET stationsWitt, et al., p. 108 and was repeated on educational stations in 1963 and 1964.Capsuto, p. 46 Conservative members of the gay community were pleased with how the Mattachine members presented themselves as ordinary people, an image that differed from the perception held by many outside the community. Some more radical activists, including Frank Kameny and Randy Wicker, found the program wanting for the apologetic tone it took toward homosexuality.Capsuto, pp. 40‚Äì41 In 2002, the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation presented KQED with the first Pioneer Award, in recognition of its production of The Rejected as the beginning of a long history of LGBT-related programming. Availability KQED, after airing The Rejected, did not archive a hard copy of the documentary, and for many years, the full documentary was considered lost, with only transcripts available. Robert Chehoski, an archivist for KQED, and Alex Cherian, an archivist for the J. Paul Leonard Library at San Francisco State University, searched for any remaining hard copy for up to six years. Eventually, the two found that the film was owned by WNET, which funded the film, and a single 2-inch quad videotape was archived in the Library of Congress. The Library's Recording Laboratory had already remastered the film onto a digital format and provided the San Francisco Bay Area Television Archive with a copy, for the purpose of making it available online. The 60-minute film was released by the TV Archive online on May 22, 2015.Archivists Recover ‚ÄòLost‚Äô 1961 TV Documentary on Homosexuality The co- producer of the film, Irving Saraf, also alluded to 30 extra minutes of unaired footage, including content filmed in the Black Cat Bar. This extra footage has not been recovered. Production correspondence written from March to July 1961 between KQED's Program Manager Jonathan Rice and NET's Director of TV Programming Donley F. Feddersen refer to scenes featuring the bar and its owner Sol Stouman that had been shot but were probably going to be cut from the final edit.

Plot summary  A chance for revenge brings a hit man out of retirement in this crime drama directed by genre specialist Antonio Margheriti (aka Anthony M. Dawson). Sal Leonardi is a well-connected American Mafioso who, while vacationing in Naples, visits a racetrack and is persuaded by good natured tout Angelo (Massimo Raniei) to put his money on a long shot. While Angelo sometimes works around the odds at the track by putting front-running horses off their stride with a pellet gun, in this case Angelo's horse wins without outside interference and pays off big. But after Sal collects his winnings, he's spotted by Gennare Gallo (Giancarlo Sbragia), a local mob boss who holds a grudge against Sal's partners; guns are drawn, Sal and his bodyguards are killed, while Angelo, who is also a police informant, is stripped of his winnings. Back in New York, Leonardi's partners are eager to even the score against Gallo, and they approach Peter Marciani (Yul Brynner), a former hired killer who retired after the traumatic murder of his brother. Peter is persuaded to assassinate Gallo when he learns that the Italian mobster was behind the murder of his brother; Peter flies to Naples and finds an ally in Angelo, but he soon learns that there's more to this story than he's been led to believe.  Cast  *Yul Brynner as Peter Marciani *Barbara Bouchet as Anny *Martin Balsam as Commissario *Massimo Ranieri as Angelo *Giancarlo Sbragia as Gennaro Gallo *Sal Borgese as Vincent *Giacomo Furia as Brigadiere Cannavale *Loris Bazzocchi as Pasquale *Rosario Borelli as Gallo's henchman *Luigi Bonos as Peppiniello *Renzo Marignano as Doctor *Tommaso Palladino as Gallo's henchman Production Antonio Margheriti's two films Death Rage and The Rip- Off were both starring big name foreign actors, but while The Squeeze was set in the United States with English-speaking cast, Death Rage was set in Naples. The film was shot at Incir-De Paolis in Rome and on location in Naples. The action scenes in the film were shot by assistant director Ignazio Dolce. According to Margheriti's friend Giacomo Furia, the character actor playing the Commissioner's assistant in the film also co-scripted it. The original story from the film came from director Silvio Siano. The script was written quickly after Margheriti managed to cast Yul Brynner as the lead. As with other Italian genres film, it borrows from other popular films of the era, in this case The Mechanic. According to Barbara Bouchet, Brynner and herself did not get along on the set, stating that he treated the crew rudely. The film was Brynner's last screen role before he devoted himself to the stage. Brynner and Margheriti planned on making another film about game hunters in Africa set during World War I, but the film never entered production. Release Death Rage was distributed in Italy by Euro International Film. It was released on 22 October 1976 where it grossed a total of 630,234,524 Italian lire on its theatrical release. The film was released in the United Kingdom under the title Anger in His Eyes. Home video releases of the film in the 1980s remove the opening scene which is only available in its complete form on an Italian DVD.A blu-ray was released by Dark Force Entertainment in February 2020. Reception In a contemporary review, the Monthly Film Bulletin stated that the film was \\"short on plausibility\\" and \\"long on picturesque scene-setting and rhetorical optical effects.\\" The review found the film's plot to be \\"no subsittute for suspense or cogent plotting.\\" From retrospective reviews, AllMovie stated that the film \\"isn't afraid to play broad, and as a consequence it frequently feels more silly than suspenseful\\" and that \\"Margheriti has the good sense to keep the story moving forward at all times no matter what, and for all its faults it's an entertaining bit of European crime fare.\\" Notes Bibliography *  External links   Category:1976 films Category:Italian films Category:1970s crime thriller films Category:Italian-language films Category:Films directed by Antonio Margheriti Category:Poliziotteschi films Category:Films scored by Guido & Maurizio De Angelis Category:Films set in Naples Category:Films about contract killing ","title":"Death Rage"},{"id":"24036830","text":"Jamestown station is a historic train station located at Jamestown in Chautauqua County, New York. Although no longer an active railroad station due to a lack of passenger service in the area after a restoration done in 2011 the building currently serves as a bus transportation center and community space for Jamestown. The first train arrived at Jamestown on August 25, 1860 as part of the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad. The National Comedy Center is adjacent to the station. History The station was constructed in 1931-1932, for the Erie Railroad, as a replacement for a much older station. See also: It passed on to successor Erie Lackawanna in 1960 and continued to serve as a station for the railroad's long distance trains operating between Hoboken and Chicago. The last trains to use the station were the Atlantic Express/Pacific Express (discontinued, 1965) and the Lake Cities (discontinued, January 1970). On April 1, 1976 Erie Lackawanna became part of the Conrail system, which was taken over in turn by CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway on June 1, 1999. Local railroad offices continued to occupy the building. The station passed to private ownership and was slowly stripped of salvageable materials. In 2000, the city of Jamestown took ownership of the building and considered plans for its future use. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003 as the Erie Railroad Station. Senator Charles Schumer announced grant monies to help restore the station as a commercial and transit hub on August 23, 2010. Upon completion of the $12 million (2012 USD) restoration, the restored station was opened to the public on October 26, 2012. The Jamestown station and surrounding area is now part of the National Comedy Center, which was opened in 2018. Services The Chautauqua Area Regional Transit System (CARTS) and Coach USA use the facility. , the station provides no Amtrak or commuter rail service. However, it is a stop for Amtrak's Thruway Motorcoach buses at a Chautauqua Area Regional Transportation Service bus shelter taking commuters to Buffalo's Exchange Street Station.Jamestown, NY - Bus Stop (JMN); Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach Gallery File:PostcardErieRRStaJamestownNY1909.jpg|1909 postcard of older Erie Station Building.

It was the first of his pictures of single female figures, and established the style that was later to become a signature of his work. The model was Fanny Cornforth, the principal inspiration for Rossetti's sensuous figures. The title, meaning \\"mouth that has been kissed\\", refers to the sexual experience of the subject and is taken from the Italian proverb written on the back of the painting:Rossetti Archive, Bocca Baciata > Bocca baciata non perde ventura, anzi rinnova come fa la luna. > ‚ÄòThe mouth that has been kissed does not lose its good fortune: > rather, it renews itself just as the moon does.‚Äô Rossetti, an accomplished translator of early Italian literature,Giovanni Boccaccio, Decameron, tr. by Cormac √ì Cuillean√°in and John Payne (Ware, Herts: Wordsworth Editions, 2004), p. lix. probably knew the proverb from Boccaccio‚Äôs Decameron where it is used as the culmination of the tale of Alatiel: a beautiful Saracen princess who, despite having had sex on perhaps ten thousand occasions with eight separate lovers in the space of four years, successfully presents herself to the King of the Algarve as his virgin bride.Decameron, II.7.

The stop is only served by inbound trains; outbound trains stop further north at Day Street. The stop has no platforms; passengers wait on the sidewalk on Church Street. History Streetcars at 30th Street in 1981 The San Francisco and San Mateo Electric Railway (SF&SM;), later part of the Market Street Railway system, began operation on April 27, 1892. The line ran on 30th Street between Guerrero Street and Chenery Street, just east of Church Street. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the URR rerouted the San Mateo line to Mission Street; Embarcadero‚ÄìDaly City route 26 and Embarcadero‚ÄìSunnyside route 10 continued to operate on the ex-SF&SM; on Church Street. The San Francisco Municipal Railway opened its J Church line on August 11, 1917. The outer terminus of the line was at 30th Street, where a crossover was located to allow streetcars to reverse direction. Service on 30th Street over the former SF&SM; route ended on January 27, 1940, when route 10 was discontinued. In 1951-52, Muni acquired a fleet of new PCC streetcars - the first Muni streetcars with a cab at only one end. These single-ended cars required a loop or wye to turn around at terminals, as they could not simply reverse direction. A wye was constructed at Church and 30th Street; it was put in service on December 22, 1957, allowing PCC streetcars to enter J Church service. J Church and N Judah trains began using the extension of the J Church line along 30th Street and San Jose Avenue for carhouse moves on August 31, 1991. Although these trips were open to passengers, the extension and its stops did not open for full-time service until June 19, 1993, at which time 30th Street ceased to be a terminal except for occasional short turns. Accessible platforms were built several years later at 29th Street and Day Street slightly to the north, as the tight turn at 30th Street would have limited the space available. In March 2014, Muni released details of the proposed implementation of their Transit Effectiveness Project (later rebranded MuniForward), which included a variety of stop changes for the J Church line. Under that plan, the stop at Church and 30th Street would be closed to reduce travel time on the line. A more limited preliminary project announced in November 2019 also included the stop closure. However, plans released in 2020 called for the inbound stop at 29th Street to be closed instead; the 30th Street stop would be moved around the corner onto 30th Street.

Life and career Born as Mathilde Lichtenegger in Zagreb, the daughter of composer and teacher Vatroslav Lichtenegger, she studied singing with at the Prague Conservatory and with in Vienna. While in Vienna she met Richard Wagner, who, after hearing her sing, recommended her to the Munich Hofoper. The opera house engaged her upon his recommendation and she made her professional opera debut there in 1866 in the title role of Vincenzo Bellini's Norma. She spent the next three years performing at that house, singing primarily Wagner roles like Elsa in Lohengrin and Elisabeth in Tannh√§user. She created the role of Eva in the world premiere of Richard Wagner's Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg on 21 June 1868. Mallinger left Munich to join the roster of principal artists at the Berlin State Opera in 1869. She sang at that house through 1882. She notably sang in the Berlin premieres of Lohengrin (Elsa, 1869), Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg (1870) and Giuseppe Verdi's Aida (Aida, 1874). She also portrayed Ingeborg in the world premiere of Bernard Hopffner's Frithjof (11 April 1871) and sang in the premiere of Wilhelm Taubert's Cesario oder Was ihr wollt (13 November 1874). Other roles she sang in Berlin included Leonore in Fidelio, Agathe in Der Freisch√ºtz, Sieglinde in Die Walk√ºre, Valentine in Les Huguenots and several Mozart heroines, including Pamina, Donna Anna and Countess Almaviva. Mallinger had a notorious rivalry with the soprano Pauline Lucca while at the Berlin State Opera. The conflict between the two extended among their fans as well, with supporters of Mallinger and supporters of Lucca heckling one another. The tension came to a climax on 27 January 1872 in a performance of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro in which Mallinger sang the Countess and Lucca portrayed Cherubino. During the performance supporters of Mallinger booed Lucca so severely that she was prevented from singing her aria. So upset by this event, Lucca broke her contract with the opera house and left the German capital to perform elsewhere. Outside of Berlin, Mallinger made a number of guest appearances at the Vienna State Opera and the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg. Although she retired from the opera stage in 1882, she continued to perform as a concert singer up through 1895. She was married to Baron Otto Schimmelpfenig Oye (1838‚Äì1912), who, under the name Otto D√ºringsfeld, appeared as an actor and later ran the Berlin Palace Theater. Their daughter Marie Mallinger (1878‚Äì1959) was an opera singer who performed at the Theater of Elberfeld and at various Berlin theaters. Marie married Martin Zickel (1877‚Äì1932), a German actor and theater director active in Berlin. From 1890‚Äì1895, Mallinger worked as a celebrated singing teacher in Prague and then taught at the Eichelberg'schen Konservatorium in Berlin up until her death. Among her pupils were Lotte Lehmann, Johannes Bischoff, Emmy Neiendorff, Henny Trundt and Florence Wickham. She died in Berlin at the age of 73.

The term Pagophila is derived from the Ancient Greek pagos meaning \\"sea-ice\\", and philos meaning \\"-loving\\". Pagophilic animals, plants, etc. prefer to live in ice or perform certain activities in the ice. For example, a number of ice seals are described as pagophilic as they have adapted to breed and feed in association with their ice habitat. The preference for a frozen habitat has been observed in several mammalian, avian and invertebrate species.  The Evolutionary and Adaptive Basis of Pagophily  The dependence and preference for ice and snow is believed to have an evolutionary basis dating back to the last ice age, approximately 2.6 million years ago. In a period where the earth was covered in ice pans, the ancestors of pagophilic mammals developed the ability to hunt on and around ice out of necessity. Some researchers have argued that life originated in icy habitats, in the form of microorganisms that can survive in harsh conditions. Furthermore, the study of pagophilic organisms on earth has contributed to the belief that life is present on other extremely cold planets. Survival in extreme habitats such as ice habitats is possible due to behavioural and/ or physiological adaptations. These adaptations may include; hibernation, insulation in the form of fat or blubber, increase hair or feather growth, or the presence of an anti-freeze-like enzyme. Phagophily is beneficial for survival, and often critical. Pagophilic mammals can use ice as a platform to get closer to prey, or to get farther away from predators. Sea ice can also be used for breeding, nurturing young and other behaviours if there is less risk for predation on the ice than on land. For many animals their primary food supply may live near the ice as well or in the water under the ice.  Pagophily in Mammals   Phocidae  The family Phocidae is a family of pinnipeds, known as \\"true seals\\". A study by Stirling (1983) indicated that the formation of large amounts of ice on coastlines approximately 15 million to 5 million years ago forced many early phocine seals to adapt their breeding and feeding behaviour due to their ice habitats. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ice seals are found in the Arctic and Antarctic. Breeding behaviour, specifically, the nursing of pups has been researched extensively in ice-living seals. The evolution of feeding behaviours and diets of ice-dwelling seals in both the Arctic and the Antarctic has also been studied.  Ice-Breeding and Lactation Periods  270x270px Among phocid seals, there is some variation of how maternal and pup behaviour takes place during lactation. Variation is dependent on access to the water, risk of predation and access to food. There are two main strategies seen in seal breeding in ice habitats. The first strategy is observed in grey seals, hooded seals and harp seals. These animals display a short lactation period in which a large amount of energy is transferred from the mother to the pup. Pups are inactive during this time and have not yet entered the water. In bearded seals, less energy is transferred to pups over a longer period of time, pups enter the water and begin feeding independently while they are still receiving milk from their mother. Researchers argue that there is an adaptive basis of both behaviours. In a longer lactation period where relatively low amounts of energy are transferred to pups over a long period of time, pups stay closer to their mothers and are protected from predators. In a shorter lactation period, pups are weaned at a young age and as a result, become independent in feeding. In addition to early independence, milk given to pups during this brief period has a very high energy content. The evolution of brief lactation periods and high energy transfer is related to the habitat of the seals. Species that give birth to their pups on stable substrate, such as land or \\"fast-ice\\" (which is attached to land) have longer lactation periods and take longer to achieve feeding independence. Species that give birth on unstable ice pans have short and efficient lactation periods so that their young can achieve independence and develop adequate fat/blubber layers before the ice melts or moves. The development of short lactation periods in most phocid seals is an adaptation that has allowed them to succeed and thrive on ice. Pups receive high amounts of fat during their short lactation period and thus achieve independence at a young age.  Ice-Feeding  Research on ringed seals in the Arctic has shown that young seals mainly consume invertebrates while adult seals consume primarily Arctic cod. The dietary differences between younger and older ice- seals is likely due to differences in diving capabilities and foraging experience. The capture of invertebrates is easier for juvenile seals due to their lack of hunting experience. Adult ice-seals, however, prefer to consume fish due to their high energy-content. Diving behaviour is critical for hunting in adult seals. Seals pursue their prey, primarily fish, by diving under fast-ice. The ability to dive underneath the ice is important for catching prey. Research by Davis et al. has highlighted the importance of seals' vision. When diving deep below the ice, limited light poses a challenge to hunting. The adaptation of amphibious seal vision has contributed to the evolution of pagophilia in seals.  Ursus maritimus  300x300px Ursus Maritimus, commonly called polar bears, are dependent on sea ice for hunting and feeding. Seals are the primary food source for polar bears so the amount of time that they spend living on ice is largely dependent on ice-seal populations. Research by Mauritzen et al. has indicated that polar bear habitat selection (i.e. ice versus land) is determined by finding a balance between the benefits of abundance of prey on ice and the additional energy expenditure in ice habitats. Furthermore, polar bears that live on dynamic, constantly changing \\"open ice\\" have more access to prey than those that live on fast ice. Ursus Maritimus possess a number of adaptations to allow them to survive in harsh, cold environments. These thermoregulatory adaptations that allow for the pagophilic lifestyle of the bears include a thick layer of fur, a thick hide and a layer of fat, also called blubber.  Pagophily in Birds  Several species of marine birds live on ice caps in both the Arctic and Antarctic. G.L. Hunt of the University of California has researched the adaptive basis for marine birds dwelling in \\"ice-influenced environments\\". According his research, sea ice can both inhibit access to foraging opportunities and provide enhanced experiences for foraging. In both the Arctic and Antarctic oceans, large populations of zooplankton, algae and small fish live directly under sea ice. Access to enhanced foraging opportunities is a plausible explanation for pagophily in marine birds.  Genus Pagophila  Genus Pagophila is a genus of birds that consists of only one species: Pagophila eburnea, also known as the ivory gull. The ivory gull is found in the Arctic in the northernmost parts of Europe and North America. Ivory gulls feed on crustaceans, fish and rodents and are also considered opportunistic scavengers. The gulls often follow pagophilic mammals such as seals and polar bears and feed on the remains of their prey.  Pagophily in Invertebrates  300x300px Sea ice invertebrates serve as important food sources for many Pagophilic vertebrate species.  Gammarus wilkitzkii  Gammarus wilkitzkii is an amphipod species that lives below Arctic sea ice. This organism uses a relatively wide variety of food sources including detritus, sea algae and the remains of other crustaceans. As a result of its harsh under-ice habitat, Gammarus wilkitzkii has developed a broad range of sources for nutrients to compensate for temperature and spatial changes of the ice.  Edwardsiella andrillae  Edwardsiella andrillae is a recently discovered \\"ice-loving\\" sea anemone that was discovered in Antarctica. The white anemones were observed by scientists of the Antarctic Geological Drilling Program (ANDRILL). The organisms live burrowed in the ice, upside down with their tentacles \\"protruding out into the frigid water\\". This is the first species of sea anemone that has been observed to live in ice rather than on the ocean floor. Research regarding the diet and lifestyle of Edwardsiella andrillae is ongoing.  Climate Change and Pagophilic Animals  280x280px Climate change and the reduction of sea ice in polar regions has had significant impacts on organisms that prefer or depend on ice habitats. A \\"stochastic population projection\\" has shown that there will likely be drastic declines in the polar bear population by the end of the 21st century. Polar bears rely on seals and fish as their primary food source. While the bears can hunt land mammals such as caribou and fox, they can survive off of land prey for only approximately 6 months. Without the abundance of sea ice, polar bears cannot access seals and fish and, thus, can starve. These projections were important in the decision to list the polar bear as a threatened species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. In addition to threatening polar bear populations researchers also argue that seal populations will also be impacted by climate change. \\"The breeding-habitat loss in their traditional breeding areas [will impact] distributional changes and in all probability abundance reductions\\". Seals use ice to nurture their young and teach them to hunt; however, with the reduction of ice due to climate change, seals cannot teach their young to hunt before their lactation period is over. Climate change poses a significant threat to pagophilic animals.

As a townland it is relatively large (792 acres) but lightly populated (79 premises). The location of the townland is roughly contained within the R418 and R448 routes starting at its most northerly point, a crossroads known locally as Thompson's Cross. The townland continues south from this point as far as Harklow and is intersected in its north east corner by the M9 motorway at Abbeyaun. Old Kilcullen was formerly the site of a walled town, and before that of an ecclesiastical settlement dating from the 5th century. The original settlement gave its name to the substantial surrounding civil parish and barony. The urban centre of the area moved 2 km north-east to Kilcullen Bridge on the River Liffey, often now simply known as Kilcullen, following the construction of a bridge there in 1319. Old Kilcullen is just under 5 km from Newbridge and approximately 13 km from Naas. Old Kilcullen is the site of a round tower and a decorated High Cross. Another, much older, historic site, Dun Ailinne, is located approximately one kilometre away to the north at Knockaulin. Archaeological site location and access Location of Old Kilcullen and Kilcullen (Bridge), from 1752 map. The religious archaeological site of Old Kilcullen is situated on a hill around 2 kilometres from Kilcullen Bridge.Kildare eHistory posting The site can be reached from a number of minor roads to the north off the R418 (Kilcullen to Athy road) or to the east off the R448 (formerly the N9 Dublin to Waterford road). The R418 and R448 can be accessed from the M9 motorway at exit 2 which is approximately one kilometre from the archaeological site. At ground level today, the site appears to be confined to a churchyard with surviving stone features at the top of a gently sloping hill, but aerial and ground surveys have shown a far greater extent to the former settlement, including embankments on the slopes of the hill. The site has no immediate public transport access but Kilcullen Bridge is served by two long-distance bus services, operated by Bus √âireann Teo. and JJ Kavanagh Ltd. History Kilcullen began as a monastic settlement, in the period around 448, and is believed to have been assigned clergy by St. Patrick. The choice of location for the settlement was perhaps related to the nearby Dun Ailinne,Johnston, Susan; Wailes, Bernard (2007), D√∫n Ailinne: Excavations at an Irish Royal Site 1968‚Äì1975, Philadelphia: University Museum Publications\\", a ceremonial site related to the kings of Leinster, though Dun Ailinne long predates any known settlement at Old Kilcullen.

There was also some form of castle, which was by the time of Henry VIII held by the (Fitz-)Eustace family, who held for a time the title Baron of Kilcullen. Kilcullen Bridge The two Kilcullens on an early Irish roadmapThe new town officially known and mapped as Kilcullen Bridge began to develop after 1319 when a bridge across the River Liffey was constructed at that place by a canon, Maurice Jakis (or Jacquis or Jakes), of Kildare Cathedral. It took over, over succeeding centuries, from the old centre, though until the late 19th century, Old Kilcullen townland had a greater population than Kilcullen Bridge. Originally, as shown on maps even as recently as the late 18th century, the new settlement was wholly on the eastern bank of the River Liffey. Later years 1641 disturbances The fortification here was initially held by the parliamentary forces in 1641, but later taken by the Royalist army, and then recaptured and burned by the parliamentarians in 1647. 1798 rebellion Old Kilcullen was the site of the Battle of Kilcullen on 27th May 1798, the first phase of which was won by the rebels, before they were driven out, and back to Knockaulin (Dun Ailinne) by General Dundas. During the battle, the round tower was damaged, with, for example, the four windows mentioned in an account of 1782 being reduced to one.Kilcullen Round Tower at the official website of the Kildare Local Authorities It was subsequently stabilised in its current form. 19th century At some point, the settlement, now just a small village, lost the market, whose licence was by then in clerical hands, to Kilcullen Bridge, retaining a small twice-yearly fair. It retained a small church, by then Church of Ireland, until some time in the 19th century (after 1836), and revenue from this went to support two canons of Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin. Activity was also lost as the main road from Dublin to Carlow (via Athy) diverted away from the hill. The round tower was taken under State care in the late 19th century. Gordon Bennett Road Race of 1903 One of the earliest international motor races, the Gordon Bennett Road Race, had its third running in Ireland, in 1903, and started in the district of Old Kilcullen, with the Grand Stand at Ballyshannon Crossroads. It was won by a German, followed by a Frenchman. At this race Old Kilcullen marked the birthplace of what is now known as British Racing Green. Britain had to choose a different colour to its usual national colours, red, white and blue, because those colours had already been taken by Italy, Germany and France respectively. As a mark of respect for their Irish hosts the English Napier cars were painted shamrock green. In keeping with these Irish/Napier roots, many of the earliest greens used on British racing cars were of a lighter olive, moss or emerald green. Later, darker shades became more common.Kildare(?), Ireland: The Leinster Leader, Saturday 4 July 1903 (final edition), p.5Kildare(?), Ireland: The Leinster Leader, Saturday 4 July 1903 (final edition), p.4 ‚Äì Editorial comment Current situation Little now remains visible of the original town site beyond the low-walled churchyard, which contains the damaged round tower, the remnants of a church, two Irish High Crosses, the base of another large cross, and many graves. However, further traces of structures can be seen in aerial photography. In addition to the historic area, the townland of Old Kilcullen includes homes, farms, a public house, and a Kildare County Council reservoir. A section of the M9 motorway, opened in December 2009, passes through the north east corner of Old Kilcullen. Round Tower The round tower is now just over 10m high at the lowest point of its uneven top remaining course, stabilised after damage during the Battle of Kilcullen. One window, of at least four large windows seen in earlier illustrations and mentioned in descriptions, remains. The round-headed doorway, which is about 1.7m high at maximum, is about 2m above ground level. Beside the door is a plaque declaring the tower's protected status. High Crosses High cross There are two distinct Irish High Crosses, and what may be the base of a third, at different locations within the churchyard. The \\"decorated high cross\\" has four illustrated faces, with a range of panels. It did not survive intact ‚Äì it is known that it was leaning by 1862, and later lay on the ground for some years, and when it was remounted in the late 19th century, parts of at least one panel were lost, and parts of the panel which had been facing upwards had been badly eroded. The \\"plain high cross\\" may have had the beginnings of decoration, but has no finished ornamentation. Church The remains of the church now extend only slightly above ground level.

Marco Almera Biography Growing up in Orange County, Marco Almera's artistic career emerged from the Southern California surfing, skateboarding and rock 'n' roll subculture of the late 1980s. A Southern California native, Almera was inspired by the do-it- yourself style of this subculture, and began by creating his own graphics and fine art. The artist has many influences and references that show up in his work: the surfing and beach subculture, skateboarding, rock 'n' roll and underground music; the iconic \\"California Girl\\", hot rods, iconography and the timeless coastal lifestyle. Having studied at University of California, Santa Cruz, Almera has spent his career working independently creating t-shirt designs, album covers, rock music posters, commercial graphics and commissioned paintings. Over the years, he has enjoyed much success with his art and hand-printed serigraphs in Japan, Germany, England, The Netherlands and all over the United States. Currently, Almera is pursuing a degree in Art: Emphasis in Graphic Design at San Diego State University. His most popular work recently has been his ongoing series of men's t-shirt designs for Harley- Davidson. Exhibitions and collections The artist began showing his fine art in galleries in 1999,Otto Von Stroheim, Robert Williams, Tiki Art Now: a volcanic eruption of art, Last Gasp, 2004, p72. and has since participated in many solo and group shows, mostly on the West Coast. Galleries that have shown his work include The Copro Gallery and La Luz de Jesus Gallery in Los Angeles, The Laguna Beach Art Museum, the Track 16 Gallery Santa in Monica, 111 Minna Gallery and the Shooting Gallery in San Francisco, the Huntington Beach Surf Museum, the Huntington Beach Art Museum, the Santa Barbara Maritime Museum, the Art Institute of California San Diego and Roq La Rue Gallery in Seattle. In 2000, 2001 and 2002 the artist had a series of gallery and local art shows in Antwerp, London, Hamburg, Berlin, Munich, Frankfurt and Amsterdam. Recently, Almera's black velvet paintings of several rock 'n' roll artists have become featured in Alex's Bar, a dive bar and music club in Long Beach, California. Media coverage The artist has been interviewed and featured in several art and surfing magazines in the U.S., Europe and Japan; most notably, Surfer Magazine, Skateboarding (Germany), and Juxtapoz Magazine. He has also been interviewed and featured in a few hardcover books. The Art of Modern Rock, published in 2004, included both an interview and a series of Almera's rock posters.Paul Grushkin, Dennis King, Art of Modern Rock: the poster explosion, Chronicle Books, 2004. The artist also had some of his rock posters included in the book Rockin' Down the Highway, by the same author, Paul Grushkin. Kustom Graphics 2, following up the book Kustom Graphics, published by Korero Books, also features Almera and showcases some of his newer work. In 2011, the artist was included in La Luz de Jesus Gallery's 25th Anniversary Group Show and the accompanying hardcover book, as well as Surf Graphics, released by Korero Books (U.K.) in 2012. Almera's art has also been featured in numerous television and cinema productions. ABC's Wife Swap, the 2013 movie Old School, and the Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino films Grindhouse and Machete have all cleared and used Almera originals, serigraphs and lithographs for set dressings. In Summer 2012, the Robert Rodriguez production studio again contacted the artist and cleared 7 additional pieces to be used in their production, Machete Kills. That same year, three Almera rock posters were used as set dressing in a political promotion video featuring Samuel L. Jackson. The 2017 movie The Long Way Back: the story of Sublime and Todd Zalkins, included the artist's Long Beach Dub Allstars rock poster as set dressing. Almera lists Metallica frontman James Hetfield and comedian David Cross among his collectors. Most recently, Almera has been included in Robb Havassy‚Äôs Surf Story Volume 2, as well as the Rockabilly/Psychobilly Anthology published by Schiffer Publishing.

After attending St. John's High School and Holy Cross College, he studied at the Coll√®ge de Montr√©al in Quebec and at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. While in Rome, Marshall was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Martin John O'Connor on December 19, 1953.

He received his episcopal consecration on January 25, 1972, from Bishop Robert Francis Joyce, with Bishop Bernard Joseph Flanagan and James Aloysius Hickey serving as co-consecrators. His tenure in Burlington was marked by a decline in both vocations and church attendance, but still founded Our Lady of the Mountains Parish at Sherburne in 1979. He completed the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in 1977, after an arsonist had destroyed the original cathedral in 1972. From 1984 to 1990, he headed an apostolic visitation into the doctrinal orthodoxy of American seminaries.

Early life and education Brekhovskikh was born to a peasant family in Strunkino, a small village in Vologda Governorate (now Arkhangelsk Oblast), Russia. He graduated from Perm State University in 1939, from which he received his university degree, and studied under Igor E. Tamm at the Lebedev Physical Institute (FIAN). There, he received his candidate of sciences degree (PhD) in Physics in 1941 for his thesis on X-ray crystallography. After his PhD, he joined FIAN's acoustical laboratories and worked on a naval defence project to develop protection against acoustically triggered mines. He later developed a theory of the propagation of acoustical waves in layered media, for which he received his DSc in Physics and Mathematics from FIAN in 1947.  Research work  During 1946, his research in the Sea of Japan led him to the discovery of the deep sound channel, a concept which would eventually lead to the foundation of modern acoustical oceanography. This was discovered independently by Maurice Ewing and Lamar Worzel in the US almost at the same time. In 1953, Brekhovskikh left FIAN and founded the Andreev Acoustics Institute in Moscow, which he directed until 1961 (he remained a department head there until his leaving, in 1980). At the Acoustics Institute, he participated in the construction and design of two acoustical research ships, the Sergey Vavilov and the Pyotr Lebedev, which participated in the Polygon experiment along with four other ships. These ships observed the mesocale eddies for the first time, confirming the predictions made by Henry Stommel in the mid 1960s. From 1953 to 1966, he was a professor of physics and a head of department at the Moscow State University. From 1969 until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1992, he was a member of the presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences. He also taught physics and was a head of department at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology from 1975 to 1997. In 1980, Brekhovskikh left the Acoustic Institute for the Shirshov Institute of Oceanology, where he led the acoustics department until his death.

He was best known under the ring name La Parkita, having used the name in Asistencia Asesor√≠a y Administraci√≥n (AAA), the Mexican Independent circuit and Chikara in the United States. His older brother Mario and twin brother Alejandro also wrestled under the names Espectrito and Espectrito II respectively. On June 29, 2009 both twins were killed by prostitutes in Mexico City. Professional wrestling career After being trained by his older brother Mario, who wrestles as Espectrito, Alberto made his professional wrestling debut in 1990 as a Mini-Estrella named Gemelito Diablo. Working in the Mini division does not necessarily mean that Alberto is a dwarf as several short wrestlers work in the \\"Mini\\" division. Later on he wrestled as Voladorcito, a mini version of the wrestler Volador and even briefly wore the outfit of Octagoncito when the original Octagoncito was unable to wrestle. In 1992 Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre's (CMLL) head booker Antonio Pe√±a left the promotion to create his own promotion, Asistencia Asesor√≠a y Administraci√≥n (AAA). In CMLL Pe√±a had been instrumental in the creation of the Mini- Estrellas division and immediately started a Minis division in AAA as well, consisting of several CMLL Minis and a crew of new Minis signed on AAA's creation. One of these signees was Alberto P√©rez Jim√©nez, through the recommendation of his brother Mario P√©rez Jim√©nez who worked for AAA at the time. Jim√©nez was given the gimmick of La Parkita, a Mascota (Miniature version) of the popular wrestler La Parka, complete with a skeleton mask and body suit. Later on Alberto began doing double duty, working some nights as La Parkita and other nights as Payasito Amarillo, forming a trio with Payasito Rojo and Payasito Azul to form the trio Los Payasitos a mini version of the rudo (bad guy or heel) trio of clowns called Los Payasos. On June 10, La Parkita was one of the 13 Minis who participated in the main event of Tripleman√≠a III-A, a multi-man Luchas de Apuestas, or bet match, where each participant put their mask on the line. La Parkita managed to save his mask while Payasito Rojo was unmasked after the match. Eight days later La Parkita was on the losing side of an eight-mini match at Tripleman√≠a III-B; the match saw the team of Torerito, Super Mu√±equito, Octagoncito and Mascarita Sagrada defeat La Parkita, Espectrito I, Espectrito II and Fuercita Guerrera. A year later the Jim√©nez brothers lost to M√°scarita Sagr√°da, Jr., Super Mu√±equito and Mini Frisbee at Tripleman√≠a IV-C. Alberto left AAA, being fired for missing too many shows. Pe√±a gave the La Parkita to another wrestler but Alberto kept working as La Parkita on the Mexican Independent circuit, although he never regularly worked for one single promotion after leaving AAA. Personal life Alberto P√©rez Jim√©nez is the twin brother of Alejandro P√©rez Jim√©nez who was best known under the ring name Espectrito II or Espectro, Jr. Alberto and Alejandro's older brother Mario P√©rez Jim√©nez is also a wrestler known primarily as Espectrito. Death Alberto P√©rez Jim√©nez along with his twin brother Alejandro (also a professional midget wrestler under the name of Espectrito II), were found murdered on June 29, 2009. It was reported that the two brothers checked into a hotel after a Sunday night show. Allegedly, two female prostitutes approached the wrestlers and were invited back to their hotel room. There the two women spiked the men's drinks with what was believed to be eye drops mixed with alcohol. The drinks were intended to knock the men out, but they died instead, perhaps due to their small stature. The prostitutes were allegedly part of a group called La Filtracion. On July 22, 2009 it was reported that the Mexican police had arrested one of the two women suspected in the death of the P√©rez Jim√©nez twins. Police traced the whereabouts of the woman by tracking one of the P√©rez Jim√©nez' twins cell phones which she used. The woman admitted to going to the hotel room with the P√©rez Jim√©nez twins but denied being involved in their death. On August 12, 2009 Mexican police tracked down the second suspect in Hidalgo and arrested her. She admitted to being at the crime scene but maintained that it was her accomplice who administered the drugs that killed the P√©rez Jim√©nez twins. The two women were later found guilty and, on July 12, 2010, sentenced to 47 years in prison. The story of the Jim√©nez twins' murder was the subject of an episode of Tabloid with Jerry Springer that shows a dramatized version of the events including an interview with their mother Maria Elena Jim√©nez and brother Juan Jim√©nez. The episode revealed that Alberto was starting to become involved with local politics, but did not reveal any actual links between their death and Alberto's political aspirations. Not to be confused with While Alberto P√©rez Jim√©nez was the first wrestler to use the \\"La Parkita\\" ring character at least two other wrestlers have used the name in AAA after Alberto left the promotion. *La Parkita II ‚Äì The wrestler that took over after Jim√©nez, currently wrestles as the second version of Octagoncito *La Parkita III ‚Äì The current version of La Parkita, having played the part since 1997 See also * List of premature professional wrestling deaths References Category:2009 deaths Category:1975 births Category:Alcohol-related deaths Category:Deaths by poisoning Category:Male murder victims Category:Masked wrestlers Category:Mexican male professional wrestlers Category:Mexican murder victims Category:Midget professional wrestlers Category:Mini-Estrella wrestlers Category:Murdered sportspeople Category:Professional wrestlers from Tlaxcala Category:Twin people from Mexico Category:Twin sportspeople ","title":"La Parkita"},{"id":"24037442","text":"Meridiosaurus is an extinct genus of mesoeucrocodylian that is a possible member of the family Pholidosauridae.Page 135; Origins and evolution of the Antarctic biota By J.

Plot The player is in command of a B-17 crew during World War II, assigned various bombing missions over Europe. The player must avoid German fighter attacks, flak, and the rigors of oxygen or heat depletion at high altitudes, and successful missions garner advancements in rank and rating. The player starts the game by responding to the Base Commander's Headquarters, and is assigned a bombing run, and flies home after the mission. Personnel can be killed during a mission, and hazards include engine, heater, oxygen, and landing-gear hits; gun jams; cockpit fires; and a runaway prop. Upon successfully bombing 25 targets, the bomber returns home to the US and receives a medal. Gameplay The player controls the pilot, co-pilot, bombardier, navigator, and gunners for the plane. As the bombardier, the player uses the included Photo Recon booklet (which is also the game's copy protection) to aim the bombsight over the landscape to find the target identified in the photo, pressing the salvo button. When attacked by fighters, the player operates as a gunner, tracking enemy fighters through one of the B-17's six gun positions, and uses twin 50-caliber machine guns that carry 2,000 rounds each. Development Bomber was developed by Inline Design using HyperCard as a software environment. Darryl Peck had started Inline Design with an old friend, intending the company to be a furniture and yacht design firm. When he found out that a friend of his partner was finishing Bomber and intended to post it as sharewere, Peck says \\"I convinced him to let me publish it by saying that if we sold 5,000 copies we would have about $100,000 in return. He bought the proposal and off we went. Rather than start a new company, I used the Inline Design name we had already registered.\\" In a short time, Inline Design had sold over 10,000 copies of Bomber.Interview with Darryl Peck Reception The Macintosh IIx (B&W;) version of the game was reviewed in 1990 in Dragon #158 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. They stated that \\"Inline Design proves that HyperCard ... can be used as a software environment for commercially viable entertainment.\\" They commented that Bomber combines digitized sound with realistic graphics, and \\"has the look and feel of real bomber missions. The Lessers concluded by stating: \\"Bomber is extremely enjoyable and is recommended for all Macintosh gamers.\\" Markus Dahlberg reviewed Bomber for Swedish magazine Datormagazin in 1994. Dahlberg felt that the game did not fulfill any sort of demand a player could expect from a modern game at that time, stating that he had never seen such a lousy game before. He commented that the graphics looked like they were made on a lunch break, and the cockpit looked like a miserable jumble where it would be hard to find which buttons to push. He noted that the game included headphones which hinted at the importance of sound in the game, but that the game's sound was completely inaudible. He ultimately lamented that no one should ever have to play such a miserable game, and felt bad for everyone who happened to own it.

Published in London in 1916 by Chappell & Co, it was one of the most famous songs of the First World War and has been recorded frequently up to the present day. Background The lyricist Fred Weatherly had become impressed with beauty of the voice of the soprano Elsie Griffin, who later became a leading artiste with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.Stone, David. \\"Elsie Griffin\\". Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 27 August 2001, accessed 3 July 2013 Her singing of his compositions resulted in his writing two of the most popular hits of the 20th- century \\"Danny Boy\\" (1910) and \\"Roses of Picardy\\". The composer Haydn Wood wrote the music for over 200 ballads, of which \\"Roses of Picardy\\" became his most popular. Wood related that, as he was going home one night on the top of a London bus, the melody came to him. He jumped off the bus and wrote down the refrain on an old envelope while standing under a street lamp. The exact story that lies behind the words of the song is unclear, but in his 1926 memoirs, Weatherly suggested that it concerned a love affair of one of his close friends. Weatherly travelled in France visiting the Rhone valley and Chamonix. Picardy was a historical province of France which stretched from north of Noyon to Calais via the whole of the Somme department and the north of the Aisne department. This area contained the Somme battlefields ‚Äì the scene of some of the fiercest fighting during the First World War. The song quickly became popular throughout Britain, with British soldiers singing it when they enlisted for the Front in France and Flanders. During the First World War, the song sold at a rate of 50,000 copies of the sheet music per month, earning Haydn Wood approximately ¬£10,000 in total (¬£ in adjusted for inflation). Following the war, the singing of the song helped soldiers who were suffering from shell shock to regain their powers of speech. Lyric Postcard with the words from verse 1. c. 1916 The following lyric is taken from the sheet music published in 1916: Verse 1: :She is watching by the poplars, Colinette with the sea-blue eyes, :She is watching and longing and waiting Where the long white roadway lies. :And a song stirs in the silence, As the wind in the boughs above, :She listens and starts and trembles, 'Tis the first little song of love: Refrain :Roses are shining in Picardy, in the hush of the silver dew, :Roses are flowering in Picardy, but there's never a rose like you! :And the roses will die with the summertime, and our roads may be far apart, :But there's one rose that dies not in Picardy! :'tis the rose that I keep in my heart! Verse 2: :And the years fly on for ever, Till the shadows veil their skies, :But he loves to hold her little hands, And look in her sea-blue eyes. :And she sees the road by the poplars, Where they met in the bygone years, :For the first little song of the roses Is the last little song she hears: There is also a French version of the song under the title of \\"Dansons la Rose\\". The following words for its refrain are taken from the recording by Yves Montand:\\"Live Dansons La RoseYves Montand\\" (01/01/1989) Jukebox.frOlympia 81: Extraits (7 April 1998) Philips audio CD :Dire que cet air nous semblait vieillot, :Aujourd'hui il me semble nouveau, :Et puis surtout c'√©tait toi et moi, :Ces deux mots ne vieillissent pas. :Souviens-toi √ßa parlait de la Picardie, :Et des roses qu'on trouve l√†-bas, :Tous les deux amoureux nous avons dans√© :Sur les roses de ce temps-l√†. Recordings Among the earliest commercial recordings were those by the tenors Lambert Murphy in 1917, Ernest Pike in 1918 and John McCormack in 1919. There are more than 150 recordings of the song sung in English and versions in Finnish, French, Spanish and German. There are also many instrumental versions, for example for piano, violin, string ensemble, jazz band and numerous different types of orchestra. After the Second World War, the American jazz artist Sidney Bechet, a long-time resident in France, popularised a Swing version, and it was also recorded by the French popular singer Yves Montand. Singer, Dorothy Squires recorded various versions of the song. In 1967 Vince Hill had a Top 20 hit with the song, and in 2011 the tenor Alfie Boe recorded it for the soundtrack of the British period drama television series Downton Abbey. In 2011 the Canadian tenor Ben Heppner recorded the song for BMG.

Personal life Feldman was born in Brooklyn, New York. He attended the University of Chicago as both an undergraduate and a master's student in Chinese studies, receiving his M.A. in 1954. While still a student in 1952, he married his first wife, Carolina (Carol) Borja Feldman, a classmate at the University of Chicago. Their marriage ended in divorce. After their divorce, she died in 1981. He married his second wife Laura Sherman in 1976. Career Feldman served in Hong Kong for eight years, Taiwan for six, and Japan for four years. As a member of the Policy Planning Staff of the State Department, he helped plan U.S. president Richard Nixon's first visit to China in 1972. He continued involvement with the process of relations with China when he became the Director of the Office of Republic of China Affairs in September 1977. In that capacity, he and Lee Marks began to draft the Taiwan Relations Act at the request of Richard Holbrooke; the act would be passed into law in 1979. He also created the American Institute in Taiwan which replaced the U.S. embassy in Taipei after relations were shifted to Beijing. On August 2, 1979, he was appointed to the position of U.S. ambassador to Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, resident in Port Moresby, the capital of PNG; he held that position until May 25, 1981. He later served as an alternative U.S. representative to the United Nations, an ambassadorial-rank position and his final role in the State Department. He retired in 1986. Retirement and death After his retirement, Feldman continued his involvement with China affairs. In 1989, he met with then-ROC president Lee Teng-hui and advised him on potential strategies for helping the ROC to regain membership in the United Nations. In 1994, he became a fellow in China Policy of The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. In 2007, he spoke out against remarks by United States National Security Council Senior Director for Asian Affairs Dennis Wilder stating that \\"Taiwan, or the Republic of China, is not at this point a state in the international community\\"; Feldman responded that U.S. government had no basis under law to oppose ROC membership in international bodies. Outside of his China-related activities, Feldman was also a board member of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs and a partner in consultancy firm Global Business Access. He died on February 24, 2009 at the age of 77 due to complications from aortic dissection. He was survived by two sons from his marriage to Carol Borja Feldman (Chris Feldman and Peter Feldman), as well as his second wife Laura Sherman and their son Alex Feldman, as well as a sister, three grandchildren, and two great-granddaughters.

LTP is commonly seen as the standard underlying convergence layer protocol for the Bundle Protocol (RFC 5050), supporting a wide selection of networks. LTP is named in honor of American computer scientist Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider. Design LTP is designed to run directly over a data link layer (e.g. the Advanced Orbiting Systems (AOS) Space Data Link Protocol). It can also run on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), e.g. if used in a sensor network, in a private network (where bandwidth contestation isn‚Äôt an issue), or for software debug purposes. Therefore, it does not address issues like routing or congestion control. It was originally designed to support ‚Äúlong- haul‚Äù transmission in an interplanetary network; its design is based on experiences with the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP). Developed for space communication, its features are: * Reliable data transport for important data (such as a file header) * Unreliable data transport for less important data (such as image pixels‚Äîa damaged pixel can be overcome) * No exchange of messages to perform negotiation. The protocol avoids this process to avoid delays due to high round trip times. It also avoids link underutilisation. * Energy efficiency, as it only transmits if a link is available and distinguishes between important and unimportant data. * Its timers work together with communication schedules and can be suspended whenever a scheduled link outage occurs. * It needs to be informed about link layer availability, round-trip time and communication schedules, basically requiring a management information base (MIB). LTP is highly stateful. * Unidirectional transmission sessions, circumvent high round-trip times or the inability of a peer communication node to transmit The application divides its data to send into two parts (either part may have a size of 0): * a red part: It contains data that has to be transported reliably, has to be acknowledged by the receiver, and has to be held available until acknowledged. This could, e.g., be a header that contains important information to decode the following data, and whose corruption would render all following data useless. * a green part. It contains data that does not require reliable transport. Since reception of this data is not acknowledged, it can be discarded after transmission. Protocol The LTP engine stores data in a queue, checks whether the link towards the destination is available and if so, starts the transmission. If the link is not available, the data remains in queue and transmission starts as soon as a so-called ‚Äúlink state cue‚Äù arrives, either from an underlying link layer or from a Management information base. Given red data to send, the last segment of the red data is marked with an ‚Äúend of red data‚Äù flag and a timer is started for that segment. Absent green data to send, the ‚Äúend of block‚Äù flag is set, otherwise the green data is transmitted and the last segment of this part gets marked with the ‚Äúend of block‚Äù flag. The receiver issues a report segment for the sender once it received the ‚Äúend of red data‚Äù segment and all data is complete. Once the report segment has been transmitted, a timer is started. Upon arrival of the report segment, the sender cancels its timer, queues a report-acknowledgement for the receiver and informs the application that all red data has been successfully transmitted. Once the receiver receives the report-acknowledgement it cancels its timer and the transmission of the red data is completed. The transmission is completed if the ‚Äúend of block‚Äù segment has arrived.

He was the Landesleiter of the party from 1935 to 1938 and the head of the Sturmabteilung in Austria.F. Parkinson, Conquering the Past: Austrian Nazism Yesterday and Today, 1989,p. 49 He belonged to the pro- independence tendency within Austrian Nazism and insisted that Adolf Hitler was only a spiritual leader rather than a future Austrian leader.David Wetzel, From the Berlin Museum to the Berlin Wall, 1996 ,p. 139 Early career Leopold was a native of the rural Waldviertel and, with little formal education, was expected to devote his life working his peasant father's small farm.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster, 1990, p. 229 Leopold however followed a military career, joining the 49th Infantry Regiment of the Austro-Hungarian Army on 7 October 1910. He left the army in 1913, having reached the rank of sergeant but returned following the outbreak of the First World War. Leopold saw action on the Eastern Front until 1915 when he was captured by the Russians. He was sent to Siberia as a prisoner of war and remained in a camp until February 1918 when he escaped, returning to Austria. Soon after this he saw service with the Volkswehr and following the reorganisation of the military after the establishment of the republic he was retained in the new Austrian Army as an instructor of new recruits. Leopold's initial involvement in politics came in December 1918 when he joined the Social Democratic Party of Austria. However, by the following year Leopold had switched sides to join Walter Riehl's and he became a convinced activist in the party after hearing Adolf Hitler speaking at Krems an der Donau in 1920. Leopold quickly rose through the ranks, so that by 1926 he was leader of the Sturmabteilung in Lower Austria as well as deputy Gauleiter of that region. With the support of Hitler he became full Gauleiter in 1927 and was soon the leading critic of Karl Schulz, whose faction of the Austrian Nazi Party was decidedly anti-Germany in outlook. Leopold led a faction within Austrian Nazism that was underground in nature and which frequently launched terrorist attacks.G√ºnter Bischof & Anton Pelinka, Austro- Corporatism: Past, Present, Future, 1996, p. 183 His position as an extremist who supported independence meant that he clashed with the pro-Greater Germany wing of Theodor Habicht and the constitutional pro-independence wing under Anton Reinthaller.Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right, p. 317 Following the banning of the Nazi Party in Austria in 1933 the fanatical Leopold was the only Gauleiter who refused to flee Austria. This resulted in his being interned in W√∂llersdorf concentration camp from January 1934 to February 1935, a fact which precluded any involvement in the failed July Putsch of 1934. Leadership of the Nazis Leopold became leader of the Austrian Nazi Party in December 1934 but was again interned in 1935 following the banning of the Nazi Party, although he was released the following year when Adolf Hitler concluded a friendship treaty with Kurt Schuschnigg.Parkinson, Conquering the Past, p. 59 Although still party leader officially, Leopold found that during his time in prison real power within the party passed to Friedrich Rainer and Odilo Globocnik who, on Hitler's express instructions, were seeking to build alliances with more conservative leaders such as Arthur Seyss-Inquart and even Kurt Schuschnigg.Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right, pp. 229-230 Later in 1936 he negotiated with Schuschnigg in an attempt to regain legal status for the Nazi Party. Leopold hoped through this to become part of a coalition government and to eventually form an independent Nazi government in Austria.Parkinson, Conquering the Past, p. 58 He then sought to work more closely with other nationalist groups in order to come closer to his ideal of a Nazi Austria and in this endeavour won the backing of cabinet ministers Edmund Glaise-Horstenau and Odo Neust√§dter- St√ºrmer.Parkinson, Conquering the Past, p. 60 Despite this the talks with Schuschnigg came to nothing and Leopold's desires to see the Nazis recognised and to establish a coalition known as the were left unfulfilled.Parkinson, Conquering the Past, p. 67 Indeed, Leopold came out of the negotiations badly as not only were his plans to reconstitute the Nazi Party as part of the Fatherland's Front made public but he also failed to secure an offer of a cabinet post as he had hoped.Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right, p. 230 His failures in the negotiations and his pro-independence stance meant that Hitler did not trust Leopold's power and so he sent Wilhelm Keppler to keep a watch on him in July 1937.Parkinson, Conquering the Past, p. 50 However Keppler was told by Leopold that he took orders from no one.Ernest R. May, Strange Victory: Hitler's Conquest of France, 2000, p. 57 Heinrich Himmler made him leader of the Austrian Schutzstaffel in 1937 but he soon grew tired of the quarrelsome Leopold, who also had clashes with Hermann G√∂ring, Rudolf Hess, Franz von Papen and his co-leader of the Austrian Nazis Hermann Neubacher. Whilst leading the Nazis in Vienna during 1938 Leopold boasted to British Union of Fascists representative Robert Gordon-Canning that he was about to lead an uprising with Hitler's aid. However the conversation was picked up by Schuschnigg who raided Leopold's office where documents relating to the coup plot were seized.S. Dorrill, Blackshirt, Penguin, 2007, p. 431 Hitler finally dismissed Leopold as Landesleiter in February 1938 on the pretext that he wanted Austrian Nazis to follow legality. Hitler, who had been due to hold talks with Schuschnigg, was especially annoyed that Leopold had launched a bombing campaign in the run-up to the meeting, and so moved for his dismissal. Under the Nazis Following the Anschluss Leopold was able to continue as a figure within the Nazi Party despite his earlier support for an independent Austria. He served as an SA inspector in Munich, where he also worked under Hess at the Nazi Party Chancellery, before entering the Wehrmacht in October 1939 as an Oberstleutnant. He was briefly considered for the role of Gauleiter of Lower Danube although this role went to Hugo Jury instead. He was Alfred Rosenberg's choice for the role of General Commissar for Crimea although he was killed in action just after the invasion of the Soviet Union and ultimately the role went to fellow Austrian Alfred Frauenfeld.Alex J.

He is the son of concert violinist Vincent Rossitto, who graduated from the Royal Conservatory of Bellini in Palermo, Sicily and performed on many of the great stages of Italy including Teatro Massimo. Musician Rossi attended Amityville Memorial High School in Amityville, New York and was elected \\"Class Musician\\". He first studied piano under Mary Findley Ades of Brightwaters, New York and later under James Ball, Professor of Piano Studies at Crane School of Music in Potsdam, New York. For years Rossi was piano accompanist and music director for Canadian recording artist Tommy Desmond, and later for Columbia Records artist Gene Stridel. He was on staff for Ultrasonic Recording Studios in New York where he played on several hit recordings including The Shangri-Las No. 1 Billboard hit ‚ÄúLeader of the Pack‚Äù. Throughout his 50-plus years as a musician, he's performed a wide variety of music throughout Canada, New York, and New England. In Florida he was the bandleader in the main dining room of the 5-star Boca Raton Hotel & Club for almost 4 years; and Resident Pianist at St. Paul of the Cross Catholic Church, Singer Island for 15 years. Roger Rossi is a Past President of Rotary International Club of Wellington, Florida where he received the Spirit of Rotary Award and Paul Harris Fellowship. Author In 2000, Roger Rossi authored From The Piano Bench: Memorable Moments With Mobsters, Moguls, Movie Stars and More. The book contains 70 very interesting short stories about his encounters with many famous and notorious people throughout his music career, including: Liberace, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Princess Diana, Perry Como, Tony Bennett, Vic Damone, Johnny Mathis, Joe Louis, Rocky Graziano, Rodney Dangerfield, Jack Nicklaus, Itzhak Perlman, Evel Knievel, and Shelley Winters. Composer In 2005, Roger Rossi composed his version of Ave Maria after it came to him in a dream. The piece follows the same concept as many other Ave Marias in that it's a Latin translation of the Hail Mary prayer calling for the intercession of Mary, the mother of Jesus. However, Rossi's version differs from most others because it includes additional lyrics to that prayer's text. In a world greatly troubled with wars, terrorism, immorality, greed and selfishness, Rossi felt compelled to ask for divine guidance. His addendum states, ‚ÄúSancta Maria, beata et casta, ora pro nobis; adiuva nos; egemus tua caritate.‚Äù In English it means: ‚ÄúHoly Mary, blessed and pure, pray for us; help us; we need your love.‚Äù In 2007, the Vero Beach Choral Society performed Hawley Ades‚Äô choral arrangement of Rossi's Ave Maria, with Dr. Marcos D.

The diesel-fueled vehicle may be used in direct competition with other vehicles, in a separate Diesel class in the same racing event, or in a diesel- only event. Diesel is not normally preferred for speed racing, due to the generally higher weight compared to a petrol-driven vehicle. However, diesel vehicles may in some events be classed independently of other competitors. In motorsports such as off-road trials or truck racing, diesel may be more predominant. In endurance racing, the broad power band, high torque and fuel economy can prove advantageous. History In 1931, Dave Evans drove his Cummins Diesel Special to a non-stop finish in the Indianapolis 500, the first time a car completed a race without a pit stop. That car and a later Cummins Diesel Special are on display at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum. In 1934 Cummins designed a second car to race at the Indianapolis 500 with a much improved fuel metering system.\\"The Triumph of Diesel\\" Popular Mechanics, July 1934, pp. 10-13 detailed article on the 1931 and 1934 Cummins Diesel 500 race cars The Delettrez brothers competed in the 1949 24 Hours of Le Mans in a 4.4L engined car, but did not finish. In the late 1970s, Mercedes-Benz drove a C111-III with a five-cylinder diesel engine to several new records at the Nard√≤ Ring, including driving at an average of 314 km/h (195 mph) for 12 hours and hitting a top speed of 325 km/h (201 mph). With turbocharged diesel cars getting stronger in the 1990s, they were entered in touring car racing, and BMW won the 24 Hours N√ºrburgring in 1998 with a 320d. After winning the 12 Hours of Sebring in 2006 with the diesel-powered R10 TDI LMP, Audi won the 24 Hours of Le Mans, too. This was the first time a diesel- fueled vehicle had won at Le Mans against cars powered with regular fuel or other alternative fuel like methanol or bio-ethanol. French automaker Peugeot, which has a strong Diesel tradition (as such similar to and in competition with Mercedes-Benz on the automotive market), entered the diesel powered Peugeot 908 HDi FAP LMP in the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans in response to the success of the Audi R10 TDI. But Audi won the race again and for the third consecutive time in 2008, until two 908 finally won the first places in 2009. In 2008 Audi used next generation 10% BTL biodiesel manufactured from biomass. Despite the success of the 908 in 2009, all four Peugeot involved in the Le Mans 2010 race experienced some issues. And in 2011, the new Audi R18 wins over four other Peugeot 908 (respectively, 1st and second to fifth place). In an effort to further demonstrate the potential of diesel power, California- based Gale Banks Engineering built and raced a Cummins-powered pickup at the Bonneville Salt Flats in October 2002. The truck set a top speed of 355 km/h (222 mph) and became the world‚Äôs fastest pickup, and the truck drove to the race towing its own support trailer. On 23 August 2006, the British-based earth moving machine manufacturer JCB raced the specially designed JCB Dieselmax car at 563.4 km/h (350.1 mph). The driver was Andy Green and the car was powered by two modified JCB 444 diesel engines. In 2007, SEAT - with the SEAT Le√≥n Mk2 at the Oschersleben Motorsport Arena in Germany - became the first manufacturer to win a round of the WTCC series in a diesel car, only a month after announcing it would enter the FIA World Touring Car Championship with the Leon TDI. SEAT's success with the Le√≥n TDI was continued and resulted in winning both 2009 FIA WTCC championship titles (for drivers as well as for manufacturers). In 2007, Wes Anderson drove the Gale Banks Engineering built 1250 horsepower Chevrolet S-10 diesel-powered Pro-Stock pick-up to a National Hot Rod Diesel Association record of 7.72 seconds at 179-mph for the quarter- mile.

He served as Bishop of Burlington from 1910 until his death in 1938. Biography Joseph Rice was born in Leicester, Massachusetts, to Henry and Catherine (n√©e Donnelly) Rice. After graduating from Leicester Academy in 1888, he then studied at Holy Cross College in Worcester (1888‚Äì1891) and at the Grand Seminary of Montreal in Canada (1891‚Äì1894). Returning to Massachusetts, he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Thomas Beaven on September 29, 1894. He earned a Doctor of Divinity from the College of the Propaganda at Rome in 1896. Following his return to the United States, Rice was assigned to Portland, Maine, where he did missionary work among the Native Americans. He then did pastoral work in Fitchburg, Pittsfield, and Oxford, Massachusetts. He served as professor of philosophy at St. John's Seminary in Brighton until 1903, when he was named pastor of St. Peter's Church in Northbridge. On January 8, 1910, Rice was appointed Bishop of Burlington, Vermont, by Pope Pius X. He received his episcopal consecration on the following April 14 from Bishop Thomas Beaven, with Bishops Matthew Harkins and Louis Sebastian Walsh serving as co- consecrators, at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. During his 28-year-long tenure, he placed De Goesbriand Memorial Hospital under the care of the Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph, and opened three high schools and Trinity College. He was also confronted with a case of anti-Catholicism; in November 1925, the Ku Klux Klan burned a cross on the steps of St. Augustine's Church at Montpelier. Rice later died at age 66.

The URR resumed service on the Ocean Avenue (12) line on May 6, 1906; the line was soon extended to Ocean Beach via Junipero Serra Boulevard and Sloat Boulevard. The city-owned Twin Peaks Tunnel was opened on February 3, 1918, with the K Ingleside line running through the tunnel and terminating at St. Francis Circle to avoid crossing the existing private tracks. In November 1918, the San Francisco Municipal Railway reached an agreement with the URR to allow the city's streetcars to use Market Street Railway trackage. The K Ingleside line was thus extended southwards from St. Francis Circle on Junipero Serra Boulevard and east on Ocean Avenue on February 21, 1919. M Ocean View service began on October 6, 1925; the new line split from the existing tracks in the circle and ran southwest on a private right-of-way.

The proposed location of the station is at Cleveland Street (SR 202) between 164th Ave NE and 166th Ave NE. However, this station may be moved northeast to a new location more towards central Downtown Redmond because it will not have a stop, as previously considered, at Redmond Transit Center. The station was originally included in the Sound Transit 2 ballot measure in 2008, but was left out of the East Link Extension after a funding shortfall stemming from the City of Bellevue's desire for a tunneled alignment under Downtown Bellevue. Sound Transit instead completed environmental reviews and selected a preferred alignment to Downtown Redmond, indefinitely deferring the final segment of East Link until a later date. The Sound Transit 3 ballot measure, passed in 2016, includes $1.1 billion in funding for the two stations in Downtown Redmond, which will open by 2024. Preliminary engineering on the Redmond extension was approved in February 2016, after being suspended in 2010. Cost performance The cost performance of the \\"Redmond Tech Center\\" (Microsoft campus) to Downtown Redmond station segment was independently analyzed by The Transport Politic, side by side with other ST3 proposals. It was found to require a subsidy of $15.33 per rider assuming a 30-year project amortization, more than five and a half times more expensive per rider than a proposed intra-Seattle Ballard extension. An expert review panel concluded the Redmond line would cost a comparable $17 per rider but $84 per new transit rider.

It is one of over 30 schools based on the Sudbury Model. The model has two basic tenets: educational freedom and democratic governance. It is a private school, attended by children from the ages of 5 to 19. The school was founded by Mark and Kim McCaig after learning about Sudbury Valley School in Framingham, Massachusetts.Vangelova, Luba. \\"How Students Lead the Learning Experience at Democratic Schools\\", KQED, October 10, 2014, accessed February 27, 2019. Fairhaven School practices a form of democratic education in which students individually decide what to do with their time, and learn as a by-product of ordinary experience rather than through classes or a standard curriculum. Students are given complete responsibility for their own education and the school is run by a direct democracy in which students and staff are equals.Anderson, Nick. \\"Learning on Their Own Terms\\", The Washington Post, April 24, 2006, accessed March 3, 2011. Fairhaven School enforces a flexible attendance policy, in which students must attend for 5 hours per day, but can come and go as they choose as long as they meet that minimum time requirement. Philosophy Fairhaven School is run on the concept that all students and staff members should have equal rights and voices in the running of the school. Students that attend Fairhaven are entirely responsible for their success in academics. Because the Fairhaven has no set curriculum or classes, students are allowed to request what classes they want to attend. School Meeting Every Wednesday the School holds a meeting in which major decisions such as electing staff and approving the budget are voted on. The School Meeting is run by a Chair and Secretary. This meeting serves as a place for students or staff to make announcements, and approve motions. All students and staff have the right to vote during these meetings. The School Meeting also acts as a court for Referrals and Not Guilty Trials. Judicial Committee There is a daily judicial committee which meets to address grievances and give consequences to students who break rules. Two clerks are elected every six weeks, along with the two alternate clerks. One staff member sits in on J.C. Every student in the school takes their turn on JC, and serves a two-week term. There is a yearly election for Law clerks who act as overseers to the smooth functioning of JC, and Not Guilty trials in School Meeting. Students may write up fellow students or staff members for breaking the rules in the law-book. A JC meeting unfolds as the following. First all available information is about the case is gathered, both the Defendant, and Plaintiff are given a chance to state their case. After a report has been approved the JC decides whether to charge any individuals with breaking school rules stated in the Law Book. If an individual is charged they have the right to plead either Guilty or Not Guilty. If the individual is found Guilty they are given a punishment, if they plead Not Guilty their case is sent to School Meeting for a final verdict. If a crime is considered to extreme to be handled by JC it is referred to School Meeting for further sentencing. Committees & Corporations Many aspects of the school are determined by groups of students who form various Committees and Corporations. Corporations such as Kitchen Corp, Computer Corp, and even Board Game corp, meet regularly to decide how best to allocate their funds. Whereas Committees such as Judicial Committee, Cleaning Committee, Public Relations Committee, work on governing different areas of the school and even maintaining it. A new corporation or committee may be chartered at any time, given there is enough student support and a favorable School Meeting vote. Graduation Process In order for a student to graduate from Fairhaven School, a student must write a thesis on how they have used the school's philosophy to become effective adults. This thesis is presented to tribunal of peers from other Sudbury schools, and thoroughly evaluated. During the process known as \\"Thesis Defense\\" the student is interviewed by the tribunal to ensure said student is ready to graduate. If the student passes both the \\"Thesis Defense\\" and the thesis review they are allowed to graduate, and provided with a high school diploma.

The city purchased the private company (renamed Market Street Railway in 1921) in 1944; route 12 service was removed from Ocean Avenue on April 8, 1945, leaving just the K Ingleside. On April 8, 1945, route 12 service was removed from Ocean Avenue, while every other K Ingleside car was extended on Ocean Avenue and Onondaga Street to Mission Street to provide a direction connection to route . In 1952, Muni constructed a loop for the K with a separate busway for the 12 (converted to bus in 1948) on city property north of Ocean Avenue and west of Phelan Avenue, adjacent to the then-new City College. The Brighton Avenue trackage was retired and replaced with the new Phelan Loop on May 18, 1952; the alternate service to Mission Street was cut back to the loop on October 10, 1952. In the 1970s, Muni rebuilt the non-revenue trackage for regular service so that K Ingleside service could be extended to the new Balboa Park station. The first revenue service to Balboa Park was on April 23, 1979, although service past Phelan Loop did not run at all times until March 17, 1981. Phelan Loop was then retired for streetcar service, replaced with platforms on Ocean Avenue at Lee Street. However, Muni buses continued using the bus loop because Balboa Park station did not include a bus terminal. By the early 2000s, the loop was part of a section of Ocean Avenue deemed \\"bleak and uninteresting\\", in contrast to the commercial district to the west. In 2001, as part of a planning process for the Balboa Park area, the city proposed to build a housing development and public open space on the loop parcel, with buses using a new loop behind an adjacent fire station closer to Phelan Avenue. The line was closed and replaced by buses from February 2001 to June 7, 2003 for the Ocean Avenue Reconstruction and Improvement Project, a major street repaving and utility replacement project. Muni boarding islands were reconstructed at the stations along Ocean Avenue, with new accessible platforms built at Ocean and Lee. In July 2010, Muni received a $6.8 million federal grant to fund the loop relocation. The new loop opened on May 6, 2013 as the terminal for the / and routes, which enter the loop from Ocean Avenue and exit onto Phelan Avenue. Housing was soon built on the old loop site; the new open space, Unity Plaza, opened next to the loop in October 2016.

The stop consists of two side platforms in the median of Ocean Avenue, with stairs to a concrete footbridge that connects the campus to Geneva Avenue. It opened in 1979 with the extension of the line to Balboa Park station; it was previously served by the United Railroads 12 line from 1895 to 1945, and the K from 1945 to 1952. History The private Market Street Railway opened a branch - built in just six days - of its Mission Street line along Ocean Avenue to Victoria Street on December 4, 1895 to serve the new Ingleside Racetrack. The line was extended to the Ingleside House (where Ocean Avenue now meets Junipero Serra Boulevard) shortly thereafter. The 1906 earthquake damaged many cable car and streetcar lines; the URR resumed service on the Ocean Avenue (12) line on May 6, 1906. On November 25, 1918, the city and the struggling URR signed the \\"Parkside Agreements\\", which allowed Muni streetcars to use URR trackage on Junipero Serra Boulevard, Ocean Avenue, and Taraval Street, in exchange for a cash payment and shared maintenance costs. The K Ingleside line was extended south on Junipero Serra Boulevard and east on Ocean to Ocean and Miramar on February 21, 1919. It was extended to its own terminal at Brighton and Grafton three months later; only the 12 ran east of Brighton Avenue on Ocean Avenue. The city purchased the private company (renamed Market Street Railway in 1921) in 1944. On April 8, 1945, route 12 service was removed from Ocean Avenue, while the K Ingleside was extended on Ocean Avenue and Onondaga Street to Mission Street to provide a direction connection to route . Service was cut back to Phelan Loop to the west on October 10, 1952, although trackage as far as San Jose Avenue was kept for non-revenue moves to the carhouse. accessible In the 1970s, Muni rebuilt the non-revenue trackage for regular service so that K Ingleside service could be extended to the new Balboa Park station. The extension included a new intermediate stop just east of Geneva Avenue, serving the San Francisco City College campus. After two students from the nearby Lick-Wilmerding High School were injured by a speeding car that decade while trying to cross Ocean Avenue, a pedestrian bridge was constructed over Ocean Avenue. Designed by the city's Department of Public Works, the reinforced concrete bridge built in 1978 is long and wide, with staircases on both sides leading to each Muni platform. The first revenue service to the station was on April 23, 1979, although service past Phelan Loop did not run at all times until March 17, 1981. In late 2016, the terminus of the K Ingleside line was temporarily relocated to Ocean and Phelan from Balboa Park while station improvements were being implemented at Balboa Park. The pedestrian bridge is unpopular with the community because it is poorly maintained, not accessible, and removes pedestrian activity from the street. Since an Ocean Avenue entrance to Balboa Park station was opened in 2011, the bridge is less important to passengers taking BART to City College, and the presence of the platform causes a dangerous traffic merge. The 2012 Balboa Park Station Capacity and Conceptual Engineering Study Final Report proposed to move the stop one block east to Howth Street; the staircases would be removed from the bridge, but it would still be usable to cross Ocean Avenue. A 2015 city report considered removing the whole bridge, removing the stair risers but keeping the bridge, or renovating the bridge to be better lit and accessible. In 2016, a local civic group supported the stop move to Howth Street, where it would provide better access to CCSF and Lick-Wilmerding High School, as well as allowing improvements to the Ocean/Geneva intersection.

Rensselaerswyck was the only successful patroonshipVan Rensselaer Bowier Manuscripts, pp. 32 within the colony of New Netherland, settled by the Dutch West India Company at the behest of the States-General of the United Netherlands. The map is believed to be the first ever commissioned or created of Rensselaerswyck. Background and description The map is a manuscript map on parchment, 22¬Ω by 70 inches in size, and represents the land along the Hudson River from Barren Island, just south of Coeymans, to the mouth of the Mohawk River. Lithographic copies of the map have been published in Moulton's History of New York, O'Callaghan's History of New Netherland and in Munsell's Annals of Albany. History of New NetherlandsAnnals of Albany The map is without date or maker's name. On the strength of an entry of the payment by Kiliaen van Rensselaer of six rixdollars to \\"Gillis van Schendel, for one map on parchment and four ditto on paper, of the islands and other tillable lands situated in my colony,\\" occurring under date of February 8, 1630, in a copy of an account among the Rensselaerswyck manuscripts, the map is commonly ascribed to Gillis van Schendel and to the year 1630, but as an inscription on the map refers to the purchase of land from Beeren Island to Smacks Island, which took place in 1631, it is evident that the entry of the payment must either have been placed under the wrong date or else refer to another map. Statements by Kiliaen van Rensselaer in a letter to Johannes de Laet, June 27, 1632, in a memorandum to Wouter van Twiller, July 20, 1632, and in a letter of same date to Dirck Cornelisz Duyster indicate that the map was probably executed in Holland, shortly after July 20, 1632, from rough drafts and surveys of different parts of the colony furnished at various times by Philips Jansz van Haerlem, Crijn Fredericksz and Albert Dieterinck. Of these men very little is known. Philips Jansz van Haerlem is mentioned by David Pietersz de Vries, in his Korte Historiael, as a young man whom he engaged in June 1635 to pilot his vessel from Sandy Hook to New Amsterdam and who formerly had been in his service in the East Indies. Crijn Fredericksz is mentioned in Nicolaes van Wassenaer, Historisch Verhael, under date of November 1626, as an engineer who staked out the fort at New Amsterdam. Albert Dieterinck appears to have been commissary at Fort Orange.Van Rensselaer Bowier Manuscripts, pp. 33-34 A few features of the map call for special mention. The scale to which the map purports to be drawn is 16‚Öû inches to the Dutch mile, or 3‚Öù inches to the English mile. This makes the distance from Beeren Island to Moenemin's Castle, which on the original map is equal to 67¬Ω inches, exactly 4 Dutch miles, or the extent of territory allowed on one side of a navigable river by the fifth article of the Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions. As a matter of fact, however, the distance between these two points is not 4 Dutch miles, or 18.44 English miles, but about 22¬Ω miles, so that the actual scale of the map is only 3 inches to the mile. The central and lower portions of the river are fairly accurately drawn, but the upper part is wrong. Especially puzzling is the wide creek designated as Renselaers Kill, which would seem to represent the Mohawk River but does not occupy the right position. Perhaps the most plausible explanation of this error is that the compiler, at about that point, joined two separate maps and, from his unfamiliarity with the topography of the locality, failed to connect the south branch of the Mohawk, indicated on the one map at the falls, with the outlet marked on the other map, and then, from some statement regarding the direction of the river, continued this outlet straight into the country. It will be noticed that of most creeks only the mouths are indicated and that of others, which are traced for some distance into the country, the direction bears as a rule no relation to the configuration of the ground, which was probably sketched in from some high point after the survey of the shore line and the islands had been completed. Up to 1636, but three farms existed in the colony. The castles faintly shown near the names of Godijns Burg, Renselaers Burg, De Laets Burg, etc. represent therefore no actual settlements, but merely indicate the places where the patroon intended that farms should be established. At the time the map was drawn, the land bought for the colony of Rensselaerswyck was almost entirely limited to that on the west side of the river; all that was owned on the east side was a small tract opposite Fort Orange. Curiously enough, the name Rensselaerswyck has been so placed as to cover exactly this territory belonging to the colony.Van Rensselaer Bowier Manuscripts, pp. 34 Inscriptions The inscriptions at the top of the map are as follows: Left shield Left shield Van Rensselaer Bowier Manuscripts, pp. 34-35 Van Rensselaer Bowier Manuscripts, pp. 35 Left scroll Left scroll Central scroll, under the van Rensselaer arms Center shield and scroll Right scroll Right scroll Van Rensselaer Bowier Manuscripts, pp. 35-36 Right shield Right shield Van Rensselaer Bowier Manuscripts, pp. 36 Anno 1630, the 8th of April, Killiaen van Renselaer caused further to be bought from Paep Sickene, Komptas, Noucoutamhat and Sickonosen their lands called Sanckhagag, stretching two days' journey inland, from Beeren Island to Smackx Island. Naming conventions The names Bijlaers Dael, Weelijs Dael, Twillers Dael and Pafraets Dael, given to the respective districts on both sides of the river, above and below Fort Orange, commemorate the names of Kiliaen van Rensselaer's first wife, Hillegonda van Bijlaer; of his second wife, Anna van Wely; of his only sister Maria, wife of Rijckaert van Twiller and mother of Wouter van Twiller; and of his mother, Maria Pafraet.

It was located 9.4 kilometers east-northeast of Foggia, in the Province of Foggia. The airfield was abandoned and dismantled after the end of the war in 1945. History Tortorella Airfield was a temporary wartime facility built by the US Army Corps of Engineers. Construction was initiated shortly after Allied forces seized control of the Tavoliere plain around Foggia, Apulia, Italy.Abandoned & Little-Known Airfields: Italy, Apulia Foggia The major tenant of the airfield was the 99th Bombardment Group, which arrived from Oudna Airfield, Tunisia on 11 December 1943. It was equipped with Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. 521p. . Tortorella was shared with 231 Wing (37 and 70 Squadrons) of 205 Group, Royal Air Force. It was equipped with Vickers Wellington Mk.X, Consolidated LB-30 Liberators, Short Stirlings and Avro Lancaster bombers. Tortorella was one of the few stations that the RAF was in a tenant status to the US Army Air Forces. The 99th Bomb Group consisted of four squadrons: * 346th Bombardment Squadron * 347th Bombardment Squadron * 348th Bombardment Squadron * 416th Bombardment Squadron General map of airfield The airfield had a single, 6,700' x 100' asphalt runway laid over pierced steel planking, oriented 16/34. A second (unfinished) runway east of the main runway was used as a crash strip. There were two perimeter tracks, and several other loop taxiways each containing about 50 aircraft parking hardstands. The 99th used the west side of the field, and the RAF the east. There may have been some temporary hangars and buildings; however, it appears that personnel were quartered primarily in tents, and most aircraft maintenance took place in the open on hardstands. It also had a steel control tower. Headquarters for the 99th Bomb Group was located in the town of Tavernola, about 3 km east of the airfield. Both the RAF and the 99th departed after the end of the war, the 99th moving to Marcianise Airfield in late October 1945, where its B-17s were placed into storage Sometime after that departure, the engineers moved in and dismantled the facility. Today Tortorella Airfield has been returned to agriculture; however, some scarring of the landscape remains, with evidence of the main runway visible in aerial photos.

Because the B and T Plants could process sufficient plutonium, it became a training facility. The bismuth-phosphate process was used to extract plutonium from irradiated uranium taken from nuclear reactors. It was developed during World War II by Stanley G. Thompson, a chemist working for the Manhattan Project at the University of California, Berkeley. This process was used to produce plutonium at the Hanford Site. Plutonium was used in the atomic bomb that was used in the atomic bombing of Nagasaki in August 1945. The process was superseded in the 1950s by the REDOX and PUREX processes. Background During World War II, the Allied Manhattan Project attempted to develop the first atomic bombs. One method was to make a bomb using plutonium, which was first produced by deuteron bombardment of uranium in the cyclotron at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. It was isolated on 14 December 1940 and chemically identified on 23 February 1941, by Glenn T. Seaborg, Edwin McMillan, Joseph W. Kennedy and Arthur Wahl. It was thought that plutonium-239 would be fissile like uranium-235 and suitable for use in an atomic bomb. Plutonium could be produced through the irradiation of uranium-238 in a nuclear reactor, although no one had yet built one. This was not the Manhattan Project's chemists' problem; theirs was to develop a large-scale process for separating fission products, some of which were dangerously radioactive; uranium, the chemistry of which little was known; and plutonium, the chemistry of which almost nothing at all was known and which at first was only available in microscopic quantities. Four methods of separation were pursued. Seaborg performed the first successful separation of a weighable quantity of plutonium in August 1942, using a process involving lanthanum fluoride. Isadore Perlman and William J. Knox, Jr., looked into peroxide separation because most elements form soluble peroxides in neutral or acid solution. They soon discovered that plutonium was an exception. After a good deal of experimentation, they found that they could precipitate it by adding hydrogen peroxide to a dilute uranyl nitrate solution. They were then able to get the process to work but it produced tons of precipitate, where the lanthanum fluoride process would produce kilograms. John E. Willard tried an alternative approach, based on the fact that some silicates absorbed plutonium more readily than other elements; this was found to work but with low efficiency. Theodore T. Magel and Daniel K. Koshland, Jr., researched a solvent-extraction processes and Harrison Brown and Orville F. Hill experimented with separation using volatility reactions, based on how uranium could be readily volatilized by fluorine. They and other chemists at the Manhattan Project's Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago and Ames Laboratory at Iowa State College, explored plutonium chemistry. A crucial discovery was that plutonium had two oxidation states, a tetravalent (+4) state and hexavalent (+6) state. with different chemical properties. The lanthanum fluoride process became the preferred method for use in the Manhattan Project's plutonium separation semiworks at the Clinton Engineer Works and the production facilities at the Hanford Site but further work with the process revealed difficulties. It required large amounts of hydrogen fluoride, which corroded the equipment and Charles M. Cooper from DuPont, who would be responsible for the design and construction of the facilities, began experiencing problems with stabilizing the plutonium in its hexavalent state in the fluoride solution. There were also difficulties with recovering the precipitate through filtration or centrifugation. While the chemical engineers worked on these problems, Seaborg asked Stanley G. Thompson, a colleague at Berkeley, to have a look at the possibility of a phosphate process. It was known that the phosphates of many heavy metals were insoluble in an acid solutions. Thompson tried phosphates of thorium, uranium, cerium, niobium and zirconium without success. He did not expect bismuth phosphate () to work any better but when he tried it on 19 December 1942, he was surprised to find that it carried 98 percent of the plutonium in solution. Bismuth phosphate was similar in its crystalline structure to plutonium phosphate and this became known as the bismuth phosphate process. Cooper and Burris B. Cunningham were able to replicate Thompson's results and the bismuth phosphate process was adopted as a fallback in case lanthanum fluoride could not be made to work. The processes were similar and the equipment used for lanthanum fluoride could be adapted for use with Thompson's bismuth phosphate process. In May 1943, the DuPont engineers decided to adopt the bismuth phosphate process for use in the Clinton semiworks and the Hanford production site. Process The T Plant was the first plutonium separation plant. It was nicknamed the ‚ÄúQueen Mary‚Äù for its resemblance to the ocean liner. The bismuth phosphate process involved taking the irradiated uranium fuel slugs and removing their aluminium cladding. Because there were highly radioactive fission products inside, this had to be done remotely behind a thick concrete barrier. This was done in the \\"Canyons\\" (B and T buildings) at Hanford. The slugs were dumped into boiling sodium hydroxide to which sodium nitrate was added. With the aluminium jackets removed, a dissolver was charged with about three tons of unclad slugs. Nitric acid was added to dissolve about one ton at a time. The second step was to separate the plutonium from the uranium and the fission products. Bismuth nitrate and phosphoric acid were added, producing bismuth phosphate, which was precipitated carrying the plutonium with it. This was very similar to the lanthanum fluoride process, in which lanthanum fluoride was used as the carrier. The precipitate was removed from the solution with a centrifuge and the liquid discharged as waste. Getting rid of the fission products reduced the gamma radiation by 90 percent. The precipitate was a plutonium-containing cake which was placed in another tank and dissolved in nitric acid. Sodium bismuthate or potassium permanganate was added to oxidize the plutonium. Plutonium would be carried by the bismuth phosphate in the tetravalent state but not in the hexavalent state. The bismuth phosphate would then be precipitated as a by product, leaving the plutonium behind in solution. This step was then repeated in the third step. The plutonium was reduced again by adding ferrous ammonium sulfate. Bismuth nitrate and phosphoric acid were added and bismuth phosphate precipitated. It was dissolved in nitric acid and the bismuth phosphate was precipitated. This step resulted in reducing the gamma radiation by four more orders of magnitude, so the plutonium-bearing solution now had 100,000-th of the original gamma radiation. The plutonium solution was transferred from the 224 buildings to the 221 buildings, through underground pipes. In the fourth step, phosphoric acid was added and the bismuth phosphate precipitated and removed; potassium permanganate was added to oxidize the plutonium. In the \\"crossover\\" step, the lanthanum fluoride process was used. Lanthanum salts and hydrogen fluoride were added again and lanthanum fluoride was precipitated, while hexavalent plutonium was left in solution. This removed lanthanides like cerium, strontium and lanthanum, that bismuth phosphate could not. The plutonium was again reduced with oxalic acid and the lanthanum fluoride process was repeated. This time potassium hydroxide was added to metathesize the solution. Liquid was removed with a centrifuge and the solid dissolved in nitric acid to form plutonium nitrate. At this point, a batch sent would have been concentrated to . The final step was carried out at the 231-Z building, where hydrogen peroxide, sulfates and ammonium nitrate were added to the solution and the hexavalent plutonium was precipitated as plutonium peroxide. This was dissolved in nitric acid and put into shipping cans, which were boiled in hot air to produce a plutonium nitrate paste. Each can weighed about 1 kg and was shipped to the Los Alamos Laboratory. Shipments were made in a truck carrying twenty cans and the first arrived at Los Alamos on 2 February 1945. The plutonium was used in the Fat Man bomb design tested in the Trinity nuclear test on 16 July 1945, and in the bombing of Nagasaki on 9 August 1945. Decommissioning In 1947, experiments began at Hanford on a new REDOX process, which was more efficient. Construction of a new REDOX plant commenced in 1949 and operations began in January 1952, the B plant closing that year. Improvements to the T plant resulted in a 30 percent increase in productivity and improvements were made to the B plant. There were plans to reactivate the B plant but the new PUREX plant that opened in January 1956 was so efficient that the T plant was closed in March 1956 and plans to reactivate the B plant were abandoned. By 1960, the PUREX plant's output had surpassed the combined output of the B and T plants and the REDOX plant.

On July 30, 1938, Brady was appointed the fourth Bishop of Burlington, Vermont, by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 26 from Archbishop Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, with Bishops Maurice F. McAuliffe and Joseph Edward McCarthy serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. He organized branches of the Boy Scouts and the Catholic Youth, and erected about a dozen new parishes in such places as Fairfax, Gilman, North Troy, Orleans, and South Burlington. Brady was named the fifth Bishop of Manchester, New Hampshire, by Pope Pius XII on November 11, 1944. He presided over a period of unprecedented growth in the Manchester Diocese, founding 27 parishes in 11 years and authorizing the construction of nearly 50 churches and numerous schools, convents, and other facilities. He also increased the number of Catholics by 50,000, and the number of priests and religious from around 650 to over 1,600. For all these accomplishments he was nicknamed \\"Brady the Builder.\\" Brady later died at age 66. Bishop Brady High School in Concord as well as Brady Hall, a residential dormitory on the campus of Saint Anselm College are named in his honor.

Seagull, turkey and eagle feathers are among the feathers commonly used. Kuisi bunsi and kuisi sigi Los Gaiteros de San Jacinto (2012) There are male and female versions of the kuisi (or gaita, the Spanish for pipe). The female kuisi bunsi (also rendered kuisi abundj√≠ in Spanish) is also commonly known as a gaita hembra in Spanish, and has 5 holes; the male kuisi sigi (or kuisi azig√≠) is called a gaita macho in Spanish and has two holes. Players often use wax to close fingerholes and alter the sound of the flute, blocking one or other tone hole on the kuisi sigi, and on the kuisi bunzi either the upper or lower fingerhole so that only four holes are in use at any one time. The change of wax from one fingerhole to another alters the fundamental tone and series of overtones that can be produced. A photograph of the paired flutes of the Cuna Indians of Panama shows that their hembra has only four fingerholes. Construction Modern Kuisis are between 70 and 80 centimetres long, a length traditionally defined by the arm length of the luthier. Kogi built kuisis are reported to be up to two feet, or 60 centimetres, long. and constructed from cane (carrizo) by the flautist himself (never a woman). The length being measured as 3 times the span between extended thumb and little finger plus the span between extended thumb and index finger. The holes are then located with a distance between them measured by the width of two fingers plus half the width of the thumb. They are constructed from a cactus (Selenicereus grandiflorus) which is bored and whose thorns are cut. The center is removed, first moistening and then boring with an iron stick. The cactus stem is thicker at one of its ends, this will go upside and coupled with the bee wax head which carries the feather mouth piece. Though the instrument is slightly conic on the outside, its perforation is cylindrical. The kuisi bunsi has five tone holes, but only four of them are used when performing: the lower tone hole is rarely used, but when used, the upper tone hole is closed with wax. The lower tone hole of the kuisi sigi is rarely used. The instrument's head, called a fotuto in Spanish, is made with bee wax mixed with charcoal powder to prevent the wax melting in high temperatures, which also gives the head it a characteristic black color. The mouth piece, a quill made from a large bird feather, is encrusted in this bee wax-charcoal head, with an angle and a distance to the edge of the air column which varies from instrument to instrument. Since construction is not serial, the only instrument which matches the tuning of a particular kuisi bunsi (female) is the kuisi sigi (male) constructed to accompany it. Their lengths correspond and the position of the two tone holes of the kuisi sigi matches the position of the lower tone holes of the kuisi bunsi. Origins and traditional use The earliest known use of kuisis is among Koguis and Ika of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. Similar flutes are also played in matched pairs by the Kuna (people) (or Cuna) who live around the Darien Gulf in both Colombia and Panama. The male and female kuisi are traditionally played as a pair in counterpoint to one another; the kuisi sigi usually marking the beat and the kuisi bunsi playing the melody. They are usually accompanied by drums and the maraca. The player of the kuisi sigi often holds that in one hand and a maraca in the other, playing both simultaneously. Modern use in Colombian music In lower slopes of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, for example the Spanish-speaking village of At√°nquez, similar flutes are called carrizos from the name of the cane from which they are made, and the ensemble is thus named conjunto de carrizos. This conjunto accompanies the dance chicote, a circle dance in which men and women alternate, placing their arms on each other's shoulders. On the coastal plain, for example the town of San Jacinto, Bol√≠var, an ensemble known as the conjunto de gaitas commonly provides the music for the cumbia, porro, and other folk styles such as vallenato. This ensemble consists of two duct flutes (gaitas), a maraca, and two hand-beaten drums of African descent. A Colombian historian writing in 1865 (Joaqu√≠n Posada Guti√©rrez, Memorias hist√≥rico-politicas, Bogot√°: Imprenta Nacional, 1929) has been cited (by Aquiles Escalante, El negro en Colombia, Monograflas sociologicas no. 18, Bogota: Universidad Nacional de Colombia, 1964, 149.) on the fusion of Native American, African and European instruments and music cultures: > ...in the early part of the nineteenth century there were great festivities > in honor of the patron saint of Cartagena, which at that time was the > principal city of the region. At this festival the inhabitants of some > wealth and position danced in a pavilion to the accompaniment of a > regimental band. Those of the lower classes participated in one of two > dances held in the open air. The dancers in one were blacks and pardos > (individuals of mixed racial inheritance) and in the second Indians. The > blacks and pardos participated in a circle dance of couples, much like the > popular cumbia of this century. The dance of the Indians, on the other hand, > was a closed circle in which men and women alternated and joined hands, a > dance similar to the closed circle of the chicote as danced in At√°nquez. The > dance of the blacks was accompanied by two or three hand-beaten drums and a > chorus of women who clapped. The dance of the Indians was accompanied by > gaitas. By 1865 these two castes had lost their mutual antagonism and > combined to dance what was then known as the mapal√©. Players of gaitas and > players of drums joined together to accompany this dance. This merging was > apparently the origin of the conjunto de gaitas. Notable contemporary Colombian performers playing kuisi flutes (or gaitas) include Los Gaiteros de San Jacinto. Emigrant Colombian groups in North American and Europe also perform with kuisis. The New York-based La Cumbiamba eNeY√© perform with gaitas constructed by band member Mart√≠n Vejarano with mouthpieces made from the feathers of Canada geese sourced in a park in the Bronx. Spanish based Lumbal√∫, researching and updating of the different traditional coastal Colombian rhythms under the direction of kuisi bunsi player Hernando Mu√±oz S√°nchez, mixing both traditional kuisis with modern instruments and musical styles. Modern use in world music French archaic flautist Pierre Hamon, of the Alla Francesca ensemble, has also performed on the kuisi bunsi in Ritual1, Ritual 2 and Omaggio Kogui on the Hypnos album (2009).

Arriving broke and hungry in a large metropolis, he seeks food and shelter at the Newsboys' Home, where the kids force him to fight an amateur bout with the champ, Danny Shay (Elisha Cook, Jr.), before he can eat. When Rifle knocks Danny out, the country boy is accepted into the gang of newsies. He goes to work selling the Globe, which is published by Howard Price Dutton (Samuel S.

Globe reporter Perry Warner (Edmund Lowe) is in love with Gwen, but they quarrel over her ideas about turning the Globe into a highbrow paper. Perry warns Gwen that she will ruin the paper, but she is stubborn and refuses to listen. Meanwhile, Tom Davenport (Irving Pichel), a crooked politician, buys the opposition paper, the Star, in order to swing the election for his candidates, and tries to bribe Perry to work for him. After Perry refuses, Davenport starts a ruthless circulation war, and Globe sales begin to fall off dramatically.

An estimated 4,000 people fought with police on the streets of Newcastle, New South Wales on the night of 19 September 1979.  History  The Star Hotel was originally built in the West End district of Newcastle, Australia near the corner of present-day Devonshire street by Ewen Cameron who was born in Scotland and arrived in Sydney, Australia in 1838. He purchased the land and erected the building in 1855 from money made at the Rockhampton gold rush. The Star Hotel was originally known as the Star Inn or Cameron's Inn. After the death of Ewen in 1890 his son Hugh Cameron purchased the Star and in 1910 demolished the original inn. A brand new two-storey brick hotel was built in its place. In 1920 Hugh's eldest daughter Lena Campbell purchased the star from her father. Lena decided to lease the premises to Tooth and Co. who then subleased the hotel to publicans. Additional renovation work was carried out on the building in the 1920s. The Star was in the Cameron family for nearly 80 years when in 1934 Lena Campbell agreed to sell it to Tooth and Company Limited. For many years the Star was frequented by visiting seamen to the city of Newcastle. In the late 1960s the King street bar which was known as the Star's back bar, was opened to gay and lesbian patrons. The drag shows and all male revues performed at the Star were so popular that it lead to a bigger stage being built. This became known as the middle bar. In the 1970s the Star became a popular pub for young people, university students and for the performing of live music. Don Graham took over as the licensee in December 1973 and decided to introduce live rock and roll bands six nights a week. Only local bands were employed to play. The Star quickly became the place to visit with many famous bands playing at the hotel with Benny and the Jets being closely associated with the establishment. In 1979 Don Graham chose to ban homosexuals from entering the Star which lead to the gay and lesbian community picketing outside protesting the ban. The owners, Tooth and Co. closed the bar with one week's notice. On 12 September 1979, George Spencer Tooth's commercial manager announced that the Star would close on the night of Wednesday, 19 September 1979. The hotel had been in disrepair and Tooth and Co. claimed it was financially better to demolish the building rather than upgrade it to the standards required by the licensing authorities. This inspired a protest campaign and patrons were able to arrange a petition that gained 10,000 signatures but this was not enough to stop the closure of the hotel.  Riot  On the day of 19 September 1979 live music started from 12 midday. The pub had 3 levels. The front bar was called the Seamans bar, the middle bar was for gay and transgender people and the back bar was on King street where the rock bands played. The back bar was small so on the night most of the people were outside. It is estimated that there were between 2000 and 5000 people present near the Star Hotel that night. At 10 pm police cars, paddy wagons and the big prison van drove through the crowd on King street and stopped outside the bar. General duties officers had to sort out the traffic problems caused by the larger than normal crowd numbers and enforce the hotel's 10 pm closing time. Police who first attended the Hotel made their way through the crowd and into the back bar, where one officer signalled to the band to stop playing. The band the Heroes were on their last song of the night when 2 police officers entered and jumped the bar. One of the police officers grabbed the microphone stand and shook it several times hitting lead singer Pete de Jong in the mouth. Pete de Jong was later arrested for calling the police pigs. The Heroes band members included Pete de Jong (vocals/guitar), Mark Tinson (guitar/vocals), Jim Porteus (bass/vocals), Phil Screen (Drums). As a result of stopping the Heroes from playing the crowd turned against the police. Windows in the hotel's King street and Devonshire Lane bars were smashed and streamers torn down. People left the back bar and joined the huge crowd in King Street, where even more numbers were increased by spectators from the nearby Newcastle Workers Club, who came out in hundreds to see what was going on. People started throwing bottles and cans at the police and their vehicles. The police began arresting people and placed them in the paddy wagon and the prison van. At about 10:30 pm police started to retreat to their vehicles and withdrew along King street to Union street. They were followed by a crowd of hundreds of people continuing to throw cans and bottles. The police stopped at the Union street intersection with the strong crowd advancing upon them. The crowd forced the police along King street to Auckland street. The police regrouped outside the City Hall as the rioters went back to the Star Hotel. During the riot 2 men from the crowd opened the door of the prison van and released 1 of the arrested people. The person ran into the crowd but was intercepted by 4 policemen who returned him to the prison van. The doors of the van were once again opened later as police tried to stop people from the crowd helping those arrested. As the riot continued a group of people over turned a white police car at 11 pm. Petrol started coming out of the car and spilled onto the road. The petrol was set on fire causing the white car and the police paddy wagon near the tipped over white car to also catch on fire. Police officer Paul Baker checked that no-one was in the paddy wagon. Paul received a bravery award for risking his safety. The fire department were called to put out the fire. These 14 firemen included (10 from Cooks Hill and 4 from Hamilton). Firemen were pelted with rocks and masonry as they tried to put out the fires and were forced to use hoses on the rioters to protect themselves. When the car fires were extinguished the police at 11:30 pm were able to use a hose on the rioters, forcing them back. Enough police were then able to form a line and force the rioters back. The riot ran for over 2 hours. Footage of the riot was captured by the NBN television station night crew. The reporter Robyn Wade and the cameraman Barry Nancarrow won a TV Logie award for \\"Best News Report Star Hotel Riot - NBN 3 Newcastle\\". The footage shot by NBN was used by the police to identify rioters. After the riot 14 policemen and 8 civilians were injured. A total of 28 people were charged with 100 offences. Charges included riotous behavior, assaulting police, resisting arrest, malicious injury to property and offensive behavior. Police vehicles worth $40,000 were burnt out. Keith Campbell the superintendent of the Hunter District Ambulance Service reported that 22 people were taken to the Royal Newcastle Hospital with no serious injuries, only cuts and bruises.  Popular culture  The Star Hotel closure was the subject of a song by Australian band Cold Chisel. On the night the Heroes prophetically played the song \\"Star and the Slaughter\\". The song was written by a previous bass player in the band Allan Cook in 1978 a year before the riot. The song had nothing to do with the riot.

Early life Clench was born in Brooklyn, but was largely raised in Massachusetts. In 1913 he entered the Huntington School in Boston. While there he often engaged in bug collecting, and would show his collections to Charles Johnson at the Boston Society of Natural History. Johnson introduced Clench to such men as William F. Clapp, who was the curator of mollusks at the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ). Education Clench received his undergraduate education at Michigan State College (now Michigan State University), graduating in 1921. He spent the summer studying mollusks on Sanibel Island and then began study at Harvard under William Morton Wheeler. He received his master's degree in entomology in 1923. He then went on to pursue his PhD at the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, in mollusk study, with a Hinsdale Fellowship. Personal life In 1924 Clench married Julia Helmich, a resident of East Lansing, Michigan whom he had met while attending Michigan Agricultural College. Their eldest son, Harry Kendon Clench (1925‚Äì1979), would become a well-known lepidopterist at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh. Career Clench left Ann Arbor in 1925, to take a position at the Kent Scientific Museum. In 1926 he joined the Museum of Comparative Zoology, where he remained until 1966. He did not actually finish work on his PhD until 1953. Much of Clench's work was done with Ruth D. Turner.

She was built in Siberia from components shipped from European Russia. She saw no action during the war and served into the Cold War. She was renamed Lazar Kaganovich in 1945 to distinguish her from Lazar's disgraced brother Mikhail Kaganovich. Her post-war career was generally uneventful, although her superstructure was badly damaged by a Force 12 typhoon in 1957. She was renamed Petropavlovsk () in 1957. Sources disagree on her fate; some say that she was converted into a floating barracks in 1960 and later sold for scrap while another says that she was simply sold for scrap in 1960. Description Kaganovich was long at the waterline, and long overall. She had a beam of and had a draft between . Kaganovich displaced at standard load and at full load.Yakubov and Worth, p. 84 Her geared steam turbines produced a total of on trials, but she fell somewhat short of her designed speed of 37 knots, only reaching , on trials, because she was over overweight. She normally carried of fuel oil, at full load and at overload. This gave her an endurance of at with overload fuel.Yakubov and Worth, p. 90 Kaganovich carried nine 57-caliber B-1-P guns in three electrically powered MK-3-180 triple turrets. The turrets were very small; they were designed to fit into the limited hull space available and were so cramped that their rate of fire was much lower than designed--only two rounds per minute instead of six. The guns were mounted in a single cradle to minimize space and were so close together that their shot dispersion was very high because the muzzle blast from adjacent barrels affected each gun. Unlike her half-sisters built in European Russia, her secondary armament initially consisted of eight single 90-K dual-purpose anti-aircraft guns. Kaganovichs initial light AA armament is unknown, although her sister ship Kalinins initially consisted of six semi- automatic 21-K AA guns with 600 rounds per gun, ten fully automatic 70-K AA guns with a thousand rounds per gun, and six DK machine guns with 12,500 rounds per gun. During the 1950s her light anti-aircraft armament was replaced by nine powered 37 mm V-11 mounts.Yakubov and Worth, pp. 84, 91 Six 39-Yu torpedo tubes were fitted in two triple mountings, one on each side. She received the Lend-Lease ASDIC-132 sonar system, which the Soviets called Drakon-132, as well as the experimental Soviet Mars-72 system.Yakubov and Worth, p. 88 Kaganovichs radar suite is unknown, but it is likely she was equipped with a mix of Soviet and British and American Lend-Lease radars. At some point during the 1950s her radars were replaced by modern Soviet-built radars; Gyuys for air search, Rif for surface search, Zalp for main-armament gunnery and Yakor for anti-aircraft gunnery.Yakubov and Worth, p. 91 Service Kaganovich was one of the Project 26bis2 cruisers, the third pair of the s. She was larger and had a more powerful anti-aircraft armament than her half-sisters. She was assembled at Shipyard 199, Komsomolsk-on-Amur, from components built at the Shipyard 198 (Marti South) in Nikolayev. She was laid down on 12 August 1938, launched from drydock on 7 May 1944 and was officially accepted into the Pacific Fleet on 6 December 1944 after being towed down the Amur River to Vladivostok. She was still incomplete on this date and the official report of all work completed was not signed until 29 January 1947. Her construction was prolonged by late deliveries from western factories. For example, her propellers had to be shipped from Leningrad after it had been surrounded by the Germans in September 1941 and her propeller shafts had to be removed from the Barrikada factory in Stalingrad before it was destroyed by the Germans in 1942. Another problem was the collapse of nine girders supporting the roof of Dock 8 onto the ship in early December 1942.Wright, p. 311 She was renamed Lazar Kaganovich in 1945 to disassociate her from Lazar's disgraced brother Mikhail Kaganovich. She remained inactive during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945. She spent the post-war period on routine training missions. She was renamed Petropavlovsk on 3 August 1957 after Lazar Kaganovich was purged from the government after an unsuccessful coup against Nikita Khrushchev that same year. Her superstructure was badly damaged by a Force 12 typhoon on 19 September 1957.Yakubov and Worth, p. 95 Sources disagree on her fate; one says that she was converted into a floating barracks on 6 February 1960 and later sold for scrap while another says that she was simply sold for scrap on 6 February 1960.

Some formations known by this name only appear to be balancing, but are in fact firmly connected to a base rock by a pedestal or stem. No single scientific definition of the term exists, and it has been applied to a variety of rock features that fall into one of four general categories: * A glacial erratic is a boulder that was transported and deposited by glaciers or ice rafts to a resting place on soil, on bedrock, or on other boulders. It usually has a different lithology from the other rocks around it. Not all glacial erractics are balancing rocks; some are firmly seated on the ground. Some balancing erractics have come to be known as rocking stones, also known as logan rocks, logan stones, or logans, because they are so finely balanced that the application of just a small force may cause them to rock or sway. A good example of a rocking stone is the Logan Rock in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom; another is the Trembling Rock in Brittany, France. * A perched block, also known as a perched boulder or perched rock, is a large, detached rock fragment that most commonly was transported and deposited by a glacier to a resting place on glacial till, often on the side of a hill or slope. Some perched blocks were not produced by glacial action, but were the aftermath of a rock fall, landslide, or avalanche. * An erosional remnant is a persisting rock formation that remains after extensive wind, water, and/or chemical erosion. To the untrained eye, it may appear to be visually like a glacial erratic, but instead of being transported and deposited, it was carved from the local bedrock. Many good examples of erosional remnants are seen in Karlu Karlu/Devils Marbles Conservation Reserve in the Northern Territory of Australia. * A pedestal rock, also known as a rock pedestal or mushroom rock, is not a true balancing rock, but is a single continuous rock form with a very small base leading up to a much larger crown. Some of these formations are called balancing rocks because of their appearance. The undercut base was attributed for many years to simple wind abrasion, but is now believed to result from a combination of wind and enhanced chemical weathering at the base where moisture would be retained longest. Some pedestal rocks sitting on taller spire formations are known as hoodoos.

All parts of the country have some outflow. All surface water gravitates towards its southern centre, and from there, is united in the Danube, which flows into the Black Sea. The whole of Hungary lies within the Danube drainage basin. The total length of all the irrigation systems and inland waterways in the country is about . The annual water balance of the country shows a surplus. Yearly about of water leaves the country towards the Black Sea. From that, precipitation amounts for only 10%, the rest being provided by the incoming rivers of surrounding countries. Rivers Hydrographically Hungary can be divided into two roughly equal parts: the drainage basins of the Danube and the Tisza. The present network of Hungary's rivers began to take shape at the end of the Tertiary and the beginning of the Quaternary periods when the Pannonian Sea retreated from the basin. The rivers in Hungary reach their lowest level at the end of the summer, the beginning of the autumn, or sometimes in the winter. Both the Danube and the Tisza have two regular floods each year, the early spring \\"icy flood\\" and the early summer \\"green flood\\". The \\"icy flood\\" is the result of the thaw in the mountains surrounding the Carpathian Basin, when the rivers in the plain are usually still frozen. Before the river flows were controlled, the piled-up ice sheets of the river could form tremendous barriers, which in turn could cause devastating floods. This phenomenon can still be a real danger after cold winters, and a small fleet of icebreakers is used on the two rivers to fight against ice barrages. The \\"green\\" flood in the early summer carries a much larger amount of water, not only the torrents from the Alps, but also the surface runoff water from the May and June rains. Danube The Danube runs through several countries, and in Hungary is known as the . History The primaeval Danube first silted up the basin of the Pannonian Sea which now forms the Eastern Slovak Lowland on the left bank of the river and the Little Hungarian Plain on the right bank. It flowed towards the south into Transdanubia and then followed the present-day course of the Drava into an interior lake system in the south of the present Great Plain. Later the Danube was diverted to the east by tectonic uplift, finding an outlet through the Visegr√°d gap. During the Quaternary the Great Plain continued to sink, meanwhile the B√∂rzs√∂ny and the Visegr√°d mountains were rising. The result was the gorge, or a deep terraced valley cut through the mountains by the Danube at what is now the Danube Bend at Visegr√°d, between Esztergom and V√°c. Once through the gorge, the Danube fanned out into the Great Hungarian Plain, depositing alluvial cones. The present north-south course was formed by the river in the late Pleistocene. Geography The Danube is the second longest river in Europe, after the Volga. Its upper flow is outside of Hungary, but its middle section starts at Dev√≠n, close to the Hungarian border. This section of the river stretches until the Iron Gate, between Serbia and Romania. The lower section of the river crosses the Romanian Plain and flows into the Black Sea through a delta. The Hungarian section of the river is long, from which forms the border between Hungary and Slovakia, from Rusovce to the mouth of the Ipeƒæ (). Navigation The Danube is navigable for the whole of its course through Hungary with a minimum depth. Flow and flooding The Danube has been mostly controlled since the 19th century. There is about of flood-protected area along the banks of the Danube in Hungary, with about of dykes. No stretch of land along the river is left open to the floods. The Danube has a rate of flow of at its fastest, and at its slowest, in the region of Budapest. The difference between water levels can be as high as . The present flood prevention possibilities are enough to cope with rises up to about above the low-water mark, but there are from time to time very dangerous floods. Tributaries The right-hand tributaries of the Danube inside Hungary do not add greatly to its volume. The largest are the Lajta, the R√°ba, the R√°bca and the Marcal. The S√°rv√≠z is joined by the Si√≥ which drains Lake Balaton. The Si√≥ is also fed by the river Kapos. The only right-hand tributary of any considerable volume is the Drava, which forms also on a large stretch the Hungarian-Croatian border, but joins the Danube already inside Croatia. Tisza History The present course of the Tisza was established relatively recently in geological time. Until the end of the Pleistocene it flowed along the southern border of the Ny√≠rs√©g area in north- eastern Hungary, but later it changed its flow forming a right-angled bend to the north of the Ny√≠rs√©g. The Tisza and its tributaries built up very large, but flat alluvial cones along the edges of the Great Plain. Geography The drainage basin of the Tisza is in the eastern part of the Carpathian Basin. of this is in Hungary, mostly lowland. Before its control in the 19th century its full length was , of which were within the present boundaries of Hungary. Its control shortened these lengths to and respectively. In spite of regulation, the Tisza still has a characteristically wide meanders through the flood plain with sand dunes, wide forests and oxbow lakes, some cut off artificially, some naturally. In Hungary the Tisza is a sluggish river with a very gentle gradient. Before it was brought under control it regularly flooded an area of . The volume of water in the Tisza fluctuates even more than that in the Danube because the catchment area is mostly medium-height mountains, and not by high mountains with permanent snow. Flow and flooding The Tisza has three floods yearly, the early spring flood from the snow thaw, then the early summer \\"green flood\\", brought on by the summer rain, and then a minor flood in the autumn. Its lowest level is in winter. The rate of flow varies at Szolnok between and Before the extensive controls, when the spring floods of the Danube and the Tisza happened to coincide, the Danube could not absorb the water of the Tisza and the resulting flood could cause immense damage throughout the Great Plain. The length of the Tisza dykes now exceeds . Navigation The Tisza is navigable for smaller vessels right up to Dombr√°d near the north-eastern frontier of the country. In the Trans-Tisza Region (east of the river) extensive areas are irrigated by its water. Tributaries The last and largest tributary of the Tisza within Hungary is the Maros. Among the tributaries of the Tisza the most important on the right side is the Bodrog, which flows into the Tisza at Tokaj. Their confluence has often changed, as is graphically illustrated by the extensive oxbow lakes and belts of shallows in the vicinity of Tokaj. The next right- hand tributary of the Tisza is the Horn√°d, which receives earlier also the waters of the B√≥dva and the Saj√≥. Below Tiszaf√ºred the river takes up the Eger river and at Szolnok the Zagyva which already collected the waters of Galga and T√°pi√≥. To the south from this point no more streams run into the Tisza from the ridge which separates it from the Danube. The eastern slope of this ridge is only broken by dried-out valleys. The more significant left-hand tributes of the Tisza include the Szamos with the Kraszna, the K√∂r√∂s, which is usually called Treble K√∂r√∂s, because it gathers up the water of several minor rivers, (White K√∂r√∂s, Black K√∂r√∂s, Rapid K√∂r√∂s, Beretty√≥ and the Hortob√°gy river). Before the great river controls of the 19th century this region was an almost endless stretch of marshlands and fens. Today there is a system of irrigation canals in the area. Canals The river is spelt Tisa in other languages. In Hungarian the spelling is Tisza, but it is not assonated. In the late 19th century, during the large-scale controls, canal systems were also created partly as artificial waterways, partly to help the agricultural use of land, and partly to conduct away superfluous inland water. The most important canal of Transdanubia is the Si√≥ connecting Lake Balaton and the Danube. The Hans√°g Canal goes across a boggy land between the Lake Fert≈ë and the Danube. The long Main Eastern Canal, which was only finished after 1945, crosses the drier parts of the Great Hungarian Plain to the east of the Tisza. Lakes Lake Balaton in ancient times Hungary is not very rich in lakes, and their basins are no older than the late Pleistocene. There is no really deep lake in the country. The shallower waters warm up quickly in summer, and water temperatures of are quite common, which makes them very pleasant for bathing. Lake Balaton is the biggest in Central Europe. It covers , being long and up to wide. It lies above mean sea level and has an average depth of , with its deepest point being at Tihany, at . Evaporation from the lake is greater than the inflow from small rivers and streams. The deficit is compensated by rainwater and underground sources. The occasional surplus water leaves the lake through the canalised Si√≥. During the Pleistocene the lake was much larger, and deep. The southern shore of Lake Balaton is extremely shallow, the average depth only being reached at a distance of from the shore. There is a long beach ridge, covered by sand, on the southern shore, built up by the waves underneath the dominant north-westerly wind. The northern shore is more varied, with the Tihany Peninsula, and it has steeper beach shelves. At the lake the summertime is long, beginning in May and lingering to the end of September. The air temperature may be in the region of to , the water temperature to . The water temperature does not sink below to in the summer even if there is a cold front. This enormous body of water creates a very pleasant mesoclimate on the shores of the lake. Sudden storms can whip up dangerous, steep waves on the surface of the lake. Their average height is , and their average length is . A prevailing north-easterly or south-westerly wind can push the water from the eastern basin of the lake (to the east of the Tihany Peninsula) into the western basin or on the contrary, resulting in water levels differing by from normal, which creates strong currents. The lake freezes almost every winter, the thickness of the ice can reach , which creates good opportunities for sport. Neusiedler/Fert≈ë Lake - satellite image The second largest lake of Hungary is Lake Fert≈ë () on the border with Austria. Its water level and shore line have been changed over time very widely. The lake is very shallow, with an average water level of . The greater part of its surface is covered with reeds, huge quantities of which are used industrially. A quarter of the lake's area of lies in Hungary, with the other three-quarters in Austria. The adjacent marshy Hans√°g was drained by the Hans√°g Canal. The third largest lake in Hungary, Lake Velence is a steppe lake in an advanced stage of alluviation. Its surface area is , but only is open water, the rest being covered by reeds. It is a popular holiday resort, being close to Budapest. Swamps and marshes The Little Balaton was originally a part of the larger lake, but now it is mostly a swamp and marsh area at the south-western corner of the Balaton with a highly characteristic wildlife. It is a protected natural reserve. Before the extensive controls of the 19th century there were a lot of marshes and swamps in the country like the S√°rr√©t of Transdanubia or the Ecsed Moorland close to the north-eastern corner of the country. They have been drained, reclaimed and transformed into land fit for farming. Spring-water lakes are a special class of natural lakes in Hungary. They are fed mostly by warm springs, but karstic ones also occur (Lake H√©v√≠z, the Malom Pool in Budapest, Tapolca). The alkaline Lake Feh√©r near Szeged has no outlet. It is a famous nature reserve in K√∂r√∂s-Maros National Park. Underground water Scheme of geological strata in a basin with an Artesian well. Underground water is very important in Hungary, especially on the Great Plain. Stratum water is abundant because Hungary is in the middle of the Carpathian Basin. These water resources are between two impermeable strata underlying the first impervious stratum beneath the underground water. They are predominantly of rainfall origin, mostly not from Hungary, but from the surrounding higher-lying parts of the Carpathian Basin. This water, when brought to the surface from great depths, is rich in various mineral solutions and may be very hot. Deep boring for stratum water has been carried out throughout the country. There are about twenty-eight thousand artesian wells in the Great Plain alone, out of a total of thirty-five thousand for the whole country. Their depth varies from . In the hilly and mountainous regions of Mesozoic limestone, karstic water is also important.  Budapest dam  It is understood that a large earth dam was built upstream of Budapest, downstream of Vienna in the latter part of the 20th century, amassing a considerable quantity of water into an artificial lake, and should this earth bank break, similarly to what happened at Kolontaar, 2010, and Vajont 1963 Budapest would be flooded uncontrollably. It is a matter of historical record that the building of this Danube Dam was banned in the Diplomatic District of London in advance by a march and a Note Verbale handed in to the Austrian Embassy, and colour photographs being taken of the principal participants in the action.

It is a brick house in the Second Empire style built around 1870. In 2001 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) along with the similar nearby Boice House. It has a three-story three-by-three-bay main block on a stone and brick foundation with a slightly recessed north wing. On top is a concave mansard roof shingled in patterned slate, pierced by round-arched dormers with decorative trim. At the roofline is an ornate overhanging eave. See also: A front porch, rounded at the two southern bays, in the Classical Revival style covers all three bays of the main block and two in the north wing at the first story. Its posts are supported on stone piers. Behind it the main entrance leads into a narrow vestibule and then a wide side hallway with detailed ceiling moldings. Similar detail is evident in the carved balusters and newel on the main staircase. The two parlors to the south have modillioned ceilings and fireplaces with finely crafted architraves and surrounds. The north rooms are similarly treated. Behind the house is its original carriage house, now used for storage. It is intact and thus considered a contributing resource to the NRHP listing. It was built around 1870. The minimal records from that time, when it was one of the city's most affluent residential neighborhoods, show that it was home to a \\"Mrs. Chichester\\".

While the details of the origin of the church building have been lost in the mist of history, architectural analysis indicates that the Romanesque church tower was most likely built in the tenth or eleventh century. The remains of a hearth on the second floor have led to the conclusion that the tower was originally a Wohnturm (a residential tower) of a titled family, probably the Herren von Ellershausen, which lived there at the time.Eckhard Kupke, Ursula Huck: Denkmale, Brunnen und Natur in Gro√ü Ellershausen.

Carlson et al., ‚ÄúBeth Huzaye ‚Äî ‹ü‹ò‹ô‹£‹¨‹ê‹¢ ‚Äù in The Syriac Gazetteer last modified December 9, 2016, http://syriaca.org/place/34. was an East Syriac metropolitan province of the Church of the East, between the fifth and fourteenth centuries. The metropolitans of Beth Huzaye sat at Beth Lapat (Jundishapur). The metropolitan province of Beth Huzaye had a number of suffragan dioceses at different periods in its history, including Karka d‚ÄôLedan, Hormizd Ardashir, Shushter, Susa, Ispahan, Mihraganqadaq and Ram Hormizd. The diocese of Shahpur Khwast may also have been a suffragan diocese of the province of Beth Huzaye.  Background  The bishop of Beth Lapat was recognised as metropolitan of Beth Huzaye in Canon XXI of the synod of Isaac in 410. The metropolitan of Beth Huzaye ranked above the metropolitans of the other four metropolitan provinces established in 410 (Nisibis, Maishan, Adiabene and Beth Garma√Ø), and was responsible for the suffragan dioceses of Karka d‚ÄôLedan, Hormizd Ardashir, Shushter and Susa.Chabot, 272‚Äì3  Ecclesiastical history  The metropolitan of Beth Huzaye (Ilam or Elam), who resided in the town of Beth Lapat (Veh az Andiokh Shapur), enjoyed the right of consecrating a new patriarch. In 410 it was not possible to appoint a metropolitan for Beth Huzaye, as several bishops of Beth Lapat were competing for precedence and the synod declined to choose between them. Instead, it merely laid down that once it became possible to appoint a metropolitan, he would have jurisdiction over the dioceses of Karka d'Ledan, Hormizd Ardashir, Shushter and Susa.Chabot, 272‚Äì3 These dioceses were all founded at least a century earlier, and their bishops were present at most of the synods of the fifth and sixth centuries. A bishop of Ispahan was present at the synod of Dadisho in 424, and by 576 there were also dioceses for Mihraganqadaq (probably the 'Beth Mihraqaye' included in the title of the diocese of Ispahan in 497) and Ram Hormizd (Ramiz). Only four of these seven dioceses were still in existence at the end of the ninth century. The diocese of Ram Hormizd seems to have lapsed, and the dioceses of Karka d'Ledan and Mihrganqadaq had been combined with the dioceses of Susa and Ispahan respectively. In 893 Eliya of Damascus listed four suffragan dioceses in the 'eparchy of Jundishapur', in the following order: Karkh Ladan and al-Sus (Susa and Karka d'Ledan), al-Ahwaz (Hormizd Ardashir), Tesr (Shushter) and Mihrganqadaq (Ispahan and Mihraganqadaq).Assemani, BO, ii. 485‚Äì9 Shahpur Khwast may also have briefly been a diocese in the province of Beth Huzaye. It is doubtful whether any of these dioceses survived into the fourteenth century. The diocese of Shushter is last mentioned in 1007/8, Hormizd Ardashir in 1012, Ispahan in 1111 and Susa in 1281. Only the metropolitan diocese of Jundishapur certainly survived into the fourteenth century, and with additional prestige. Ilam had for centuries ranked first among the metropolitan provinces of the Church of the East, and its metropolitan enjoyed the privilege of consecrating a new patriarch and sitting on his right hand at synods. By 1222, in consequence of the demise of the diocese of Kashkar in the province of the patriarch, he had also acquired the privilege of guarding the vacant patriarchal throne.  The diocese of Beth Lapat (Jundishapur)  The bishop Gadyahb (or Gadhimhab) of Beth Lapat was one of several East Syriac bishops who opposed the claim to precedence put forward by the bishop Papa of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in 315.Chronicle of Seert, i. 26 In 410 there were several rival bishops of Beth Lapat, and Canon XXI of the synod of Isaac merely recorded that 'for the metropolis of Beth Lapat there is not yet a bishop whose name we can inscribe among his fellow-metropolitans, since the town has two or three bishops not recognised by the synod'.Chabot, 272 The bishops Yazdaidad, Agapit, Miles, Bar Shabtha, Mari and Shila were among the thirty- eight signatories of the synod's acts, and from their position in the list were probably the bishops concerned.Chabot, 274 The bishop Agapit of Beth Lapat was among the signatories of the acts of the synods of Yahballaha I in 420 and Dadisho in 424.Chabot, 283 and 285 The bishop Papa, 'bishop of Beth Lapat, metropolitan of Beth Huzaye', was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Acacius in 486.Chabot, 306 The deacon Pusa√Ø was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Baba√Ø in 497, on behalf of the metropolitan Marwa√Ø of Beth Huzaye.Chabot, 315 The metropolitan Paul of Beth Huzaye, who had earlier been bishop of Hormizd Ardashir, was elected patriarch in 539.Mari, 49 (Arabic), 43 (Latin) The metropolitan Paul of Beth Huzaye was among the bishops who rallied to the patriarch Aba I in 540 and signed his Pragmatic.Chabot, 330‚Äì1 The bishop Shemon, 'bishop, metropolitan of Beth Huzaye', was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Joseph in 554.Chabot, 366 The bishop Dala√Ø, 'bishop, metropolitan of Beth Huzaye', was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Ezekiel in 576.Chabot, 368 The bishop Baraz, 'metropolitan of Beth Huzaye', was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Ishoyahb I in 585.Chabot, 423 The patriarch Maremmeh (646‚Äì50), formerly bishop of Nineveh, was consecrated metropolitan of Ilam by the patriarch Ishoyahb II (628‚Äì46).Chronicle of Seert, ii. 309‚Äì10 The metropolitan Yaqob of Ilam was elected patriarch after the degradation of the patriarch Surin, and was consecrated in 751/2.Elijah of Nisibis, Chronography, i. 32 The patriarch Giwargis II (828‚Äì31), formerly superior of the monastery of Beth Abe, was consecrated metropolitan of Ilam by Timothy I c.807 at the request of the caliph Harun al-Rashid's powerful court physician Gabriel ibn Bokhtisho.

The church is the largest United Methodist Church in Boise, Idaho, the largest in the Oregon-Idaho Conference of the United Methodist denomination, and was the first Methodist church in Boise, founded in 1872. The present building was constructed 1958-1960 under the leadership of the Rev. Dr. Herbert E. Richards, and covers an entire city block. The stained glass is a notable and unique feature, depicting Biblical history as well as themes of the history of Christianity and aspects of American history including local references to Idaho and the city of Boise. The church is popular as a visitor destination, and attracts worshipers from all over America and the world. This is the third building to be used by the congregation. The original 1872 church was located at 8th and Bannock streets, site of the present Hoff Building (old Hotel Boise), near the Idaho State Capitol building. In about 1903‚Äì05, a new church was constructed at 10th and State streets (where the YMCA building is now located). The new Cathedral of the Rockies structure was consecrated in December 1960, with a series of impressive ceremonies. During the year 2010, a number of church events are being held to commemorate the opening of the new church. In 2002 the structure was extensively expanded under the leadership of the Rev. Dr. Steve Tollefson. The new Emmaus Center was designed for contemporary worship and other social events; and more classroom and office space was also added, considerably enhancing the facilities. In 1984, the cathedral served as the location for Senator Frank Church's funeral. In June 2020, the church announced that it would remove its stained-glass window featuring Confederate general Robert E. Lee. The image had been under discussion since 2015 and a decision was made following the killing of George Floyd. The ministries of the Cathedral of the Rockies are extensive, involving many services to the surrounding community. Educational ministries are available to children, youth, and adults. A full-time children's center and pre-school operates year- round. Many small groups are offered, and ministries are offered to the homeless and needy.

He was the son of his father's second wife, Yolande. By marriage he also became Count of Chartres and Lord of Amboise. He was well-connected with the trouv√®res: his younger brother Raoul was one and he received the dedication of a song by Pierrekin de la Coupele. He was also a cousin by marriage of the historian Jean de Joinville. He is not to be confused with John II of Nesle, the burggrave of Bruges. John's first marriage was to Mary (died c. 1241),She is last known alive on 20 March 1241. the heiress of Roger du Thour et de Chimay and his wife Agnes. John and Mary confirmed donations to the Teutonic Knights in May 1234, where he signed as \\"John of Soissons, knight, firstborn of the count of Soissons, lord of Thour and Chimay\\".Latin: Johannes Suessionensis miles, primogenitus comitis Suessionensis, dominus de Turno et Cisinaco She left him a son, John III, who would succeed him. John's second wife was Matilda (died 12 May 1256), the daughter and eldest surviving child of Sulpice III of Amboise and Isabella, who had inherited the county of Chartres from her father, Theobald VI, Count of Blois. Matilda was the widow of Richard II, the viscount of Beaumont-sur-Sarthe. On Isabella's death in 1246, Chartres thus passed to Matilda, John, and the house of Nesle. John and his first wife, Mary, had six children: * John III, Count of Soissons * Raoul de Nesle (died 1271 in Tunis) * Ad√®le de Nesle (died before 1252), married to Jan van Oudenarde, son of Arnoud IV, lord of Oudenaarde, and his wife Alix de Roso * Yolande de Nesle (died 1242), married to Hugues II, lord of Rumigny * El√©onore de Nesle (died after 1280), married to Renaud, viscount of Thouars * Isabelle de Nesle, married to Nicolas II, lord of Barban√ßon By his geographical proximity to Paris, John was a close member of the royal circle. In 1230 he supported Blanche of Castile as regent for the young Louis IX, in opposition to Peter I, Duke of Brittany. In 1231 he began a controversy over property with the clerical leadership of Soissons. After imprisoning several ecclesiastics, Louis IX and the Archbishop of Reims, Henry of Dreux, intervened to obtain an agreement between the feuding parties. In 1242 John supported Louis against the rebellious Hugh X of Lusignan and the invading Henry III of England in a conflict that became known as the \\"Saintonge War\\". John also joined the Seventh Crusade in 1248. On the day of the Battle of Mansurah (8 February 1250) he commented to Jean de Joinville that \\"we'll speak about this day again, you and me, in the ladies' chamber\\".Vie de Sain Louis, par 242, quoted in Caroline Smith (2006), Crusading in the Age of Joinville (Ashgate), 9. He was captured by the Mamelukes in April 1250, but was soon freed, after which he returned home. In 1265 John joined the army of Charles of Anjou that was heading to Italy to conquer the Kingdom of Sicily. He was in charge of the escort of Charles' wife, Beatrice of Provence, until they arrived at Rome. In 1266 he fought in the Battle of Benevento on the winning side. In 1270 John joined the Eighth Crusade in Tunisia and died shortly after his return. Notes External links *Nobility of the Paris region: Chapter 9. Comtes de Soissons, Part C.

He was the eldest son of Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de Traba and Elvira Rodr√≠guez. He was the alf√©rez of the realm from April 1159 until at least 31 July 1160. He was recognised as a count (Latin comes), the highest noble rank in the kingdom, by 13 January 1160 in Galicia, but the royal chancery did not so style him until 13 February 1161. He held the tenencias which his father had held: Aranga (1160‚Äì61), Traba (1160‚Äì61), Monterroso (1160‚Äì63), and Trast√°mara (1161‚Äì65), even holding all four simultaneously (at least from 2 June to 20 September 1161). He supported with donations the Cistercian monasteries of Sobrado (1162) and Monfero (1163). Fernando signed his last known charter on 26 December 1165.

Fernando Fern√°ndez or Fern√°n Fern√°ndiz de Carri√≥n (fl. 1107‚Äì1125) was a count in the Kingdom of Le√≥n during the reign of Queen Urraca.He is first recorded with the title of count in a document of 26 September 1119. He appears in documents between 8 May 1107 and 20 June 1124. Cf. Simon Barton (1997), The Aristocracy in Twelfth-century Le√≥n and Castile (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), 236‚Äì37, which contain a brief curriculum vitae. Bernard F. Reilly (1982) The Kingdom of Le√≥n-Castilla under Queen Urraca, 1109-1126 (Princeton: Princeton University Press), 219, states that though Fernando was \\"a person of considerable influence in the realm, [he] seems not to have been a regular member of the court. Only nine of the queen's charters bear his confirmation.\\" Fernando's origins are obscure. Though his patronymic indicates that his father was also named Fernando, his father has not been identified. He may have been related to Pedro Ans√∫rez.Jos√© M. Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n (1984), \\"Don Pedro Fern√°ndez, primer maestre de la Orden Militar de Santiago: su familia, su vida\\", Anuario de estudios medievales, 14, 47‚Äì48. He probably hailed from the region of Le√≥n, where he is known to have held properties and where he appears in some local documents.The arras he granted to his first wife, Elvira, were located in Le√≥n, as was a property which he granted to a supporter in 1121, cf. Reilly, 218‚Äì19. Fernando married into the royal family when he wed a certain Elvira Alfonso, a daughter of Alfonso VI. Alfonso had two daughters of this name and records are not explicit regarding which one was Fernando's wife. One Elvira was the daughter of a concubine, Jimena Mu√±oz, and the sister of Theresa of Portugal and had married count Raymond IV of Toulouse. Following his 1105 death, she either returned immediately to Le√≥n,Charles Julian Bishko (1965), \\"The Cluniac Priories of Galicia and Portugal: Their Acquisition and Administration, 1075‚Äìc. 1230\\", Studia Monastica, 7, 324‚Äì25. or she remained in Toulouse until after Urraca's death in 1126, which would have rendered her unavailable to marry Fernando.Reilly, 218‚Äì19. The other Elvira was a legitimate daughter, born to Queen Isabel, whom Alfonso wed in 1100. This Elvira married by 1120 to Roger II of Sicily, and had children by him through the mid-1130s. Since the wife of Fernando was still in Castile as late as 1133, most historians have concluded that she must have been the former Countess of Toulouse, the illegitimate daughter of Alfonso by Jimena.Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n, \\"La Infanta Dona Elvira\\"; Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n, \\"El Conde Osorio Martinez\\"; Quintana Prieto, [which gives the husband the incorrect patronymic]; Salazar y Acha; Barton Whichever Elvira was Fernando's wife had married by 8 July 1117, when together the couple made a private donation of the monastery of San Salvador de Ferreira to the abbey of Cluny.According to Barton, 236‚Äì37, and Reilly, 218‚Äì19, who speculates that they were married early in Urraca's reign. As this was in Galicia it probably represented a portion of his wife's inheritance. The marriage does not appear to have been a happy one. On 17 December 1120 Elvira sold the estate at Fuentes de los Oteros which she had received as arras (a bridal gift). The couple had separated by 1121, when Fernando married again, to Sancha Gonz√°lez.He granted arras to his second wife on 16 April 1121, cf. Barton, 236‚Äì37. His children by Elvira were Diego, Garc√≠a, and Teresa. Elvira was still living as late as 16 April 1157. Fernando was in the service of Henry, Count of Portugal, from 1108 until Henry's death in 1112. From 1111 he ruled Lamego. After Count Henry he no longer appears in Portuguese documents. Outside of Portugal at different times he held the tenencias of Salnellas (1113), Toro (1116‚Äì17), Bola√±os (1117), and Tierra de Campos (1119). He held the tenencia of Malgrat (Malgrado), modern Benavente, from 1117 to 1124.He is referred to as consul Malgratense in a suspect document from Astorga dated 1130. The 1140 charter of Alfonso VII that refers to a Fernando comite tenente Maiorica et Ualadolid (\\"Ferdinand, count holding Mayorga and Valladolid\\") is probably a forgery. Cf. Barton, 236‚Äì37. The spurious acta of a synod supposed to have taken place in Oviedo in 1115 record the presence of Fernando, calling him ex campi Zamorae, et campi Tauri (\\"out of the field of Zamora and the field of Toro\\", that is, coming from those tenencias).Quoted in Barton, 237n. A similar description of territories occurs in a document of 1117: in tauro et in camorus mandante (\\"in Toro and in Zamora commanding\\").In this case the name of the ruler is given as Fernandus Melendiz (Fernando Mel√©ndez or Men√©ndez), but Reilly, 297‚Äì98, believes it may be an error for Fernando Fern√°ndez. In 1121, when the royal court wintered in Le√≥n, Fernando was in attendance. He had two documents drawn up by royal notaries Pedro Vic√©ntez and Juan Rodr√≠guez, both dated to the joint reign of Urraca and her son, the future Alfonso VII.Reilly, 154‚Äì55. The following spring Urraca campaigned in Galicia, perhaps with Fernando accompanying. Fernando's death probably occurred towards the end of Urraca's reign, as he does not appear in any charters of Alfonso VII and the Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris does not list him among the nobles who did homage to the new king in 1126.Barton, 236n. He was buried in San Zoilo de Carri√≥n and the inscription on his tomb was recorded by Prudencio de Sandoval: PULVIS IN HAC FOSSA PARITER TUMULANTUR ET OSSA CONSULIS ILLUSTRIS FERDIANDI MALGRATENSIS (\\"[There is] dust in this tomb and likewise are buried the bones / of the illustrious consul Ferdinand of Malgrado\\") Notes Further reading *Jos√© M.

Baseball is by far the most popular; other popular sports and pastimes include boxing (Cuba is a dominant force in amateur boxing, consistently achieving high medal tallies in international competitions), volleyball, wrestling, basketball, sailing and trekking.Sports in Cuba , CubaCuban.com. Retrieved 21 Sep 2016. Cuba's Sport History Post Revolutionary Cuba prides itself on its success in sports. Fidel Castro expressed that sports should be ‚Äúthe right of the people,‚Äù not the right of the wealthy.Pickering, R. J. (1978) ‚ÄúCuba‚Äù in Sport Under Communism Ed. James Riordan. London: C Hurst & Co. pp. 142‚Äì174. He compared Pre-Revolutionary and Post-Revolutionary Cuba by explaining that while before only the wealthy could enjoy sports, now everyone can enjoy sports. He also explains that talent in sport comes from hard work, and a strong will. These are not traits the naturally wealthy have; rather these are traits that working-class people have. In modern Cuban society, sport and physical education begin when a child is only 45 days old. The mothers are taught to exercise their children's limbs and massage their muscles to keep them healthy. Children are taught at a later age to play games that resemble physical exercise. These ideas were the basis for the modern sports program in Cuba, and clearly it is working. Considering that Cuba's population is only around 11.49 million, Cuba has a demanding 0.96 to 0.05 lead against China (1.379 billion) in the number of 2016 Olympic medals won per million occupants. In 1961, two years after the triumph of the Revolution, The National Institute of Sport, Physical Education, and Recreation (INDER) was created.Wagner, Eric A. (1988) ‚ÄúSport in Revolutionary Societies: Cuba and Nicaragua‚Äù in Sport and Society in Latin America. Ed. Joseph L. Arbena. Westport: Greenwood. pp. 113‚Äì136. This was the governing branch of all sport and recreation in Cuba. It developed all of the current sports and education programs in place today, including the EIDE, which is the program that finds the naturally talented young adults and gets them into sports oriented secondary schools. All first and secondary schools in Cuba teach sport and physical education as a compulsory subject. There are five sports taught in all standard secondary schools: track and field, basketball, baseball, gymnastics, and volleyball. The students who excel at a certain sport usually find themselves competing in the Cuban summer Junior Olympics which is where the EIDE sees their talent and recruits them to a specialized school that caters to just their sport. Most of these specialized schools are located on the Isle of Youth. This is a 2,200 square kilometer island to the south of Cuba which has more than 27 of these schools, each having about 600 children who attend. The majority of them are semi-boarding schools where the students get on a boat to the island every Sunday evening and return every Friday evening. The schools are spread out across the island and have citrus groves in between them. Being consistent with the ideals of the Revolution, all of the students are required to put in 3 hours of work a day picking or canning fruit. Every school in Cuba participates in the Junior Olympic Program established in 1963. However many of the standard secondary schools only compete in the sports for which they have teams, for instance most of them do not have pools. The competition usually commences in July. The games have a traditional ladder system where first local schools compete, then the district winners will compete and finally the regional winners will compete. However, for team sports, the winning teams will move on, but the best players from all of the losing teams will form a new team and also move on. This way no single great player will be tossed out because of a bad team. As of 1978 the Cuban Junior Olympics involved 20 sports: Chess, Weightlifting, Athletics, Tennis, Football, Table Tennis, Basketball, Modern Gymnastics, Gymnastics, Synchronized Swimming, Swimming, Diving, Volleyball, Water Polo, Cycling, Fencing, Judo, Roller derby, Roller hockey, Pistol Shooting, Baseball and Wrestling. INDER has many programs, including the National Institute for Sports Medicine, the National Coaches program, and the National Physical Education Institute. All of these were developed during the relatively strong economic period of 1960‚Äì1990. The Special Period of the 1990s‚Äì2000s created many special challenges for INDER, including budget cutbacks and a limited amount of electricity causing blackouts. In the early 1990s, many of the night sporting events were canceled to preserve electricity. Cuba's new sports program also began to pay for itself when many of the best players were allowed to retire early and take up position on teams in other countries. These other countries wanted to hire them because of Cuba's fantastic success in training winning athletes. These players would earn a large salary, and about 80% of it would go directly to the Cuban government. The players would then pocket the other 20%, which was more than what the average Cuban in Cuba was earning. It is worthy to note that Castro abolished professional sport in Cuba in the beginning of the Revolution. What this meant was that all leagues and teams are considered amateur. This concept was imbedded in the stated ideals of the revolution, that everyone should be equal. However this outflow of the best athletes and trainers began to take its toll. In 1997 Cuba ended its 10-year, 152-game, winning-streak at the baseball International Cup by losing to Japan 11 to 2.Price, S. L. (2000) Pitching Around Fidel, New York: HarperCollins. To fix this problem, Cuba began to offer material incentives like houses and cars to the good players to keep them from playing for other countries. These offerings weren't to completely prevent talented Cuban's from leaving the country instead they were there to keep the system balanced. By the year 2007 there were 50 nations around the world who employed several hundred Cuban sports trainers and coaches.Baxter, Kevin and Kraul, Chris (28 July 2007) ‚ÄúCuba‚Äôs Biggest Export is Sports‚Äù . Los Angeles Times Athletics Baseball Baseball is the most popular sport in Cuba and 62% play it. Baseball is the official sport of Cuba. Basketball Basketball is one of the top sports in Cuba. Yet, it is not as popular as baseball and boxing. The Cuban national basketball team was particularly successful at the 1972 Summer Olympics when it won the bronze medal after defeating Italy in its last match. Boxing Aside from the traditional cockfighting and other gambling sports, along with baseball, boxing was one of the most popular sports in pre- Revolutionary sports Cuba.

Cricket Cricket is a relatively small, but growing, sport in Cuba. Ex- President Fidel Castro believed that young people on the island were becoming too Americanized and wanted Cuba to feel more affinity with the Caribbean. UK Sport, the body responsible for promoting and supporting sport across Britain, answered a request from Cuba's sports chiefs and provided money for a fact- finding mission which it is hoped will lead to a four-year plan to develop Cuban cricket Wrestling Cuba had by far the strongest Greco-Roman wrestling team in the Western hemisphere and one of the strongest teams in the world. The team captured team championship title numerous times at the Pan American Wrestling Championships, Pan American Games, Central American and Caribbean Games.

Biography Max Sandreczky was born on Syros, to missionary Carl Sandreczki. In the early 1860s he worked in Munich as the assistant of another pioneering German pediatrician, Heinrich von Ranke. He developed an understanding of the importance of psychological factors for the well-being of sick children; the nature of leprosy; and the role of bacteria and fungi in causing infections. Some of his progressive methods were the use of occupational therapy for children, and allowing for mothers to live in the hospital during their children's stay there. Marienstift Children's Hospital, Street of the Prophets, Jerusalem In failing health, Sandreczky killed himself on June 22, 1899, at the age of 60, haunted by fears that he would become a burden to his family and not be able to continue helping sick children. Shortly after his death the hospital closed down. Sandreczky's grave is preserved in the Protestant Mount Zion Cemetery, Jerusalem. Marienstift children's hospital Sandreczky's hospital was named \\"Marienstift Kinderhospital\\", or \\"Children's Hospital of the Marie Foundation\\", after Princess Marie of Schwarzburg- Rudolstadt, third wife of Grand Duke Frederick Francis II of Mecklenburg- Schwerin who provided initial financial support until his death in 1883.The makings of history: An unsung medical hero, Ha'aretzThe hospital operated from 1872-1899. Sandreczky was the sole physician. The staff included his wife and three of his daughters, who worked as nurses, and a young Jewish pharmacist. The hospital was known for its humanistic approach and served sick children from all religions: Muslim, Christian and Jewish.Nissim Levi, \\"The History of Medicine in the Holy Land: 1799-1948\\" As Sandreczky did not proselytize the children in his care, he could not obtain funding from church institutions, as did all hospitals in Jerusalem at the time. In 1979, the building was purchased by an investment company which planned to build a commercial center there. The blueprints included restoration of the building and the establishment of a small historic exhibit. The Society for the Preservation of Israel Heritage Sites took the case to court and blocked the plan.\\"Firm blocked from converting J'lem landmark into mall,\\" Haaretz, 10/09/2008 Awards and recognition During the 1898 visit of Kaiser Wilhelm II to Jerusalem, Sandreczky was awarded the Order of the Red Eagle.

His resignation came one day after The Springfield Republican confronted him with accusations of sexual abuse from two men who had known Dupr√© when he was a parish priest and they were altar boys. Dupre was also accused by local clergy of covering up abuse charges against other priests, including Richard R. Lavigne. Grand jury indictment On September 24, 2004, bishop Dupr√© was indicted by a Hampden County grand jury on two counts of child molestation.

The courthouse standing is the third for the county and is built over the foundations of the second. History Clark County was established in 1818 and was carved from lands from Champaign, Greene, and Madison counties. The court met in various locations in Springfield but no budget allowed for the construction of a courthouse. In 1819, the commissioners were approached by a group of citizens who pledged $2,215 to the construction of a permanent courthouse. This first courthouse began construction and was due to be completed in 1820, but dragged on until 1828 and was designed by the architectural firm of Ambler & Fisher. The building was based on the first capitol for Ohio at Chillicothe. The square building was built as a two-story red brick structure with three shuttered windows on both sides with white trim. The windows were recessed and set in an arch. Four large chimneys on each side protruded from the high hipped roof, which was mounted by a central cupola. The cupola consisted of a square base supporting an octagonal drum with a dome capped by a spire. This courthouse served for 50 years until the demands of the county proved the courthouse too small. The old courthouse was sold in 1878 for $50.00 and was demolished so the new courthouse could be built on the site. Thomas J. Tolan & Son, Architects, of Fort Wayne Indiana, designed the new courthouse and Nathaniel Cregar, whose father, Charles Cregar, was studying with Tolan, was named as supervising contractor. The new building was designed in the popular Second Empire style. The square building was constructed of limestone, with a rusticated foundation and smooth stone blocks above. The two story building is capped by a mansard roof with mansard towers at each corner with projecting dormers. The building's focus was on Columbia Street with large tower capped by a large spire and a four sided clock. An arched portico framed the entrance, which was reached by a flight of stairs. The courthouse caught fire about 1 o'clock on the morning of March 12, 1918, and destroyed the interior and most of the exterior.https://www.flickr.com/photos/24929333@N02/3242920285/ The court records were saved, as the county had implemented a policy of storing the records in a separate location. Exterior The courthouse standing today is a mix of old and new, and was rebuilt from 1918-1924 by architect William K. Schilling. Parts of the exterior walls were saved from the 1918 fire and were reconstructed.http://www.cardcow.com/124870/clark-county-court-house- springfield-ohio-springfield/ The ground floor is still rusticated with smooth blocks on the first and second floors. The basement windows are small arched openings grouped in pairs. The first floor windows are large arched openings and are separated by Doric pilasters. The third floors contains long rectangular windows with no decoration and simple solid pilasters. Decorative panels and friezes separate the first and second floor windows. The building lost its large front tower, stairs and mansard roof from the fire. The entrance has been changed to face Limestone Street and is now reached on the ground level; large pedestals on each side of the entrances support large Doric columns supporting a projected roof. An entablature runs along the building with the words \\"Clark County Court House\\" engraved above the entrance. A solid balustrade rests upon this entablature and contains decorative friezes above the entrance and a single clock face. A low dome rests in the center of the roof and is partially hidden by the entablature.

It was written and directed by Marc Fratto and produced by New York production company Insane-o-rama productions.  Plot synopsis  An unexplained zombie plague breaks out, causing the recently deceased to continue walking the earth. Despite being undead, the zombies retain all of their senses and wits, including the ability to speak and think rationally. The only way to kill a zombie is to completely destroy the brain, preferably with shotgun or explosives. An international crisis develops and the world breaks up into several camps, including anti-zombie militants, and zombie sympathizers. On the first night of the outbreak, a young woman named Angela (Gina Ramsden) is shot in the head by her jealous boyfriend Josh (Joshua Nelson), turning her into one of the walking dead. A few months later, as the world poorly adjusts to this new reality, Angela finds herself alone, depressed and suppressing a deep urge to eat human flesh. She is attacked on the street by zombie hating strangers; fired from her job by her boss (Sally Pressman) after a co-worker complains about her smell and appearance; she even begins to cover herself in a special brand of make-up for zombies called \\"Look-Alive\\". She finds comfort in a passive zombie support group called \\"Hugs for the Mortally Challenged\\" where she confesses her shame in being a zombie. Meanwhile, Josh and his friends, Richie (J. Scott Green), Peter \\"Gooch\\" Guccione (Gaetano Iacono) and Malcolm (Constantine Josiah Taylor) join a radical zombie hate group, run by a ruthless army brat known only as The Commandant (Christa McNamee) where they commit several violent acts against zombies. Josh, who still has feelings for Angela, hesitates in telling the Commandant, or his friends, about his undead ex-girlfriend. Josh and Angela have several run-ins while he calls her, stalks her, and openly expresses his love for her, much to her horror. Angela, in the meantime, finds herself being courted by one of the more outspoken members of her support group, Louis (Kevin Collins). Louis ultimately brings Angela into a new, far more radical cult of zombies who advocate zombie pride and practice the eating of human flesh. This cult is led by a zombie flower child named The Good Mother Solstice (Mary Jo Verruto), and appears to be responsible for acts of domestic terrorism. An early clash between the cult and the Commandant's army leaves several zombies as well as Richie dead. Angela survives the assault by hiding, but, in a moment of weakness, she devours the entrails of a disemboweled girl before she flees. Ultimately, Josh breaks down and leads the Commandant to Angela's \\"Hugs for the Mortally Challenged\\" group, and most of them are taken out to the woods and beheaded. Angela is rescued by the Good Mother Solstice and her army of undead terrorists. Most of the Commandant's army is killed in the ensuing battle, although the Commandant and Malcolm escape unharmed. Josh escapes, only to realize he has been shot and is now one of the walking dead. Angela awakens to find herself in Solstice's compound, where she is tied to the floor, drugged with a euphoria-inducing concoction of liquified human flesh, and nearly brainwashed by Solstice and her chanting zombies. At the same time, the Commandant, distraught at losing her army, finds Josh and Malcolm, asking for their help in seeking revenge. When Malcolm refuses, he is shot dead. Josh agrees and calls Angela, luring the Good Mother Solstice and her army to his house. The Commandant, who appears to be suffering from a nervous breakdown, disguises herself by chopping off her hair and dying it blonde. She shoots herself in the head, turning herself into one of the undead and poses as a victim of her own anti-zombie group. She is eventually taken into Solstice's compound where she wreaks havoc. Josh follows her there and sets off to kill Angela. As the Commandant fights her way through Solstice's zombie army, and Josh struggles to fight his way into the compound, Angela escapes from her bonds and battles with the Good Mother Solstice eventually injecting her with a full dose of her liquid flesh concoction, causing an overdose with messy results. Commandant ultimately kills most of Solstice's army, but not before being disemboweled and left partially paralyzed. Josh and Angela battle, and Angela blows Josh's leg off with a shotgun and castrates him. Angela leaves, with Josh still professing his love for her. The Commandant turns up and blows Josh's head off with her shotgun, and then turns the gun on herself. Angela returns to her home, finds her LookAlive makeup has run off, leaving her pale zombie flesh exposed. She discards the rest of her LookAlive makeup and smiles.

She is the founder of Apne Aap, a non-governmental organisation that works for women's rights and the eradication of sex trafficking.  Journalism and UN career  Gupta began her career as a journalist, working for The Telegraph Newspaper (Kolkata, India), The Sunday Observer (Kolkata, India), Business India Magazine (Delhi, India), and British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) South Asia (Delhi, India). During her journalism career, she extensively covered women's rights, armed struggles in the north-east of India, caste conflict, and minority issues. She continues to write extensively on sex trafficking and women's rights issues for Open Democracy, Pass Blue, CNN, Times of India, The Hindu, The Guardian, among others. She then moved on to the United Nations, where she worked with the governments of Iran, Nepal, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar, Indonesia, Kosovo, and the Philippines. She supported some of these countries to develop National Action Plans and laws against human trafficking. She has written two manuals on combating trafficking for law enforcement and prosecutors, supported by UNODC and UNIFEM. Gupta also served as a UNICEF contact in October 2000 for the first-ever gathering of Messengers of Peace and Goodwill Ambassadors. Her publications on trafficking include: * Trafficking Responses in Thailand, Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia: Needs, Capacity assessment and Recommendations * Trafficking in the Asia and Near East region: Problem analysis and Proposed framework for response; Kosovo plan of action to counter trafficking in persons * Manual for law-enforcement officers to confront Demand for Human trafficking * Training Manual for Prosecutors - On Confronting Human Trafficking  Activism career  After completing her documentary, The Selling of Innocents, Ruchira founded Apne Aap Women Worldwide, where she has served as President since 2002. Through her work at Apne Aap, Gupta has given voice to the voiceless by organizing victims and survivors from denotified tribes (labeled criminal tribes by the British), who are trapped in inter- generational prostitution, into Self-empowerment groups. Through these groups, women and girls access education, livelihood training, legal protection and safe housing; and also campaign for changes in the Indian Law. Gupta's leadership in organizing women to campaign for legal change resulted in trafficking being made a penal offense for the first time in Indian history, through the Criminal Law Amendment Act. Her work in organizing denotified tribes has resulted in two red-light areas in Forbesgunge, Bihar shrinking from 72 brothels to 15 brothels, and 17 to one. Gupta continues to ensure women are able to transform their places of exploitation into safe spaces for education, job training, loan access and legal protection. Along with staff from Apne Aap, Gupta petitioned on behalf of survivors of trafficking to the Patna High Court to take action against traffickers and protect victims. On 10 March 2013, a notice was issued by the court to the Bihar government to report back on actions taken against trafficking. Apne Aap has also challenged police corruption and is campaigning for police reform after a staff member from the Nat Denotified Tribe was wrongfully arrested after exposing a trafficking ring.

Football career McKenzie was born in Glasgow and trained as an upholsterer, playing amateur football for various clubs in the northern half of the city before moving to England in September 1896 to join Burton Swifts of the Football League Second Division. At Burton he had a successful season, missing only four league matches, scoring five goals, as the Swifts finished the 1896‚Äì97 season in eleventh place. He then returned to Glasgow to spend a season with Clyde, at the end of which they finished at the foot of the table. In the summer of 1898, he was persuaded to move to southern England to join the Southern League champions, Southampton. The \\"Saints\\" were about to embark on their first season in their new stadium and McKenzie made his debut for Southampton in the opening match at The Dell, against Brighton United on 3 September 1898. After Watty Keay had opened the scoring, McKenzie (playing at outside-left) missed some good chances as the Saints put pressure on the Brighton goal. As half-time approached, McKenzie made a \\"smart run up the left\\" and crossed for Abe Hartley to score the second goal. McKenzie then added a third in the second half, and although Brighton pulled one back through Roddy McLeod, Tom Smith wrapped the match up with the fourth goal. The appreciative Saints fans dubbed McKenzie \\"little Joe Turner\\", but after only six appearances the lightweight, diminutive winger lost his place to George Seeley. Following a serious leg injury in reserve team match, he returned to Scotland, rejoining Clyde once he had recovered.

Toba Tek Singh (Punjabi(Shahmukhi)/) is a city and tehsil of Toba Tek Singh District in the Pakistani province of Punjab. History and operations It was founded in July 1967 in Toba Tek Singh in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Faisalabad, Pakistan. The bishop endorsed the request of the community to found a Catholic school, and with community participation a primary school was begun in the Christian colony Toba Tek Singh. The school was started in a small old chapel. Fr. Bonnie Mendes and some other diocesan educational staff inaugurated the school. Diocesan priests from the Gojra parish ran the school as there was no parish house in Toba Tek Singh. In 1982, a new parish was established called the Immaculate Conception Parish, Toba Tek Singh. The Oblates of Mary Immaculate (OMI) took over the responsibility of the new parish and constructed a building. When OMI priests moved on to other parishes, Fr. Bonnie Mendes was transferred from Sacred Heart Parish, Jhang, to Immaculate Conception Parish, Toba Tek Singh. Fr. Mendes was alarmed at the drop-out rate of Christian students after they completed their primary education. Only about fifteen percent graduated from high school. The community up-graded the school from primary to secondary level, and, in 1994, the first batch of St. Peter's students appeared in the Secondary School certificate exams. Misereor, a German organization, donated funds to build the first floor of the new high school building with six classrooms, principal's office, staff room, store room, and a toilet block. Added to this were playgrounds, a science laboratory, library, and classrooms. The new high school building opened at Mubarkabad Colony, Toba Tek Singh, in September 1999. In 2000‚Äì2001, two rooms were built on the first floor and, in 2004, a large hall was added. Three classrooms and a toilet block were constructed in January 2006 under a government/community participation scheme. From 2002 to 2005, the school's staff and faculty enhanced their professional skills through distance-learning programs and skill-based classes. Mrs. Bimbla Rustam joined the school in 1970 and served as principal till 1988. Mr. Yaqub Hameed joined the school in 1988 as principal and continued until 2002. In 2002, Mr. Ashfaq Fateh was promoted to principal.,Asia News 27 April 2013 Mr. Fateh served until 2010 when Miss Tahira Saleem became the school's head teacher.

The only NCI-designated cancer center in Western Pennsylvania, Hillman is composed of collaborative academic and research efforts between the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), and Carnegie Mellon University. Hillman provides clinical cancer care to some 74,000 patients treated at its facilities at both the flagship Hillman Cancer Center location in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh and at dozens of UPMC-affiliated sites throughout Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, and a growing list of overseas locations. Founded in 1984, Hillman became the youngest cancer center in history to achieve NCI-designation, and as of 2007 received nearly $200 million in funding from the National Cancer Institute ranking it in the top ten of all cancer research institutes. Cancer Institute The Pittsburgh Cancer Institute was founded in 1984 under the direction of Ronald B. Herberman, MD. Hillman Cancer Center was formed from a partnership with Pittsburgh Cancer Institute and private physicians in 2002. Hillman remains the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in Western Pennsylvania, and today is composed of 625 research faculty members specializing in disciplines ranging from cancer prevention and early detection to novel therapeutic discovery, survivorship, and end of life care. Most Hillman faculty maintain academic appointments at the University of Pittsburgh and physician-scientists have their clinical appointments through UPMC hospitals. However, some Hillman members are affiliated with the neighboring Carnegie Mellon University. Four target research areas of molecular and medical oncology at the institute include 1) the biological basis of cancer development and progression; 2) identification of new biomarkers for improved cancer detection and diagnosis; 3) the development of novel therapeutics for successful and comprehensive cancer treatment; and 4) establish and implement effect cancer prevention measures. Over the last five years, Hillman's 350 faculty members have published more than 4,500 publications in peer-reviewed journals. Hillman is ranked 12th in funding from the National Cancer Institute. It has increased its federal research funding to a total of nearly $174 million in 2011; up from totals of $154 million in 2007, $149 million in 2004, and $120 million in 2001. These totals include three competitive Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) grants focusing on head and neck, lung, and skin cancers. Hillman works in tandem with UPMC Cancer Centers Network to translate the latest research advances to clinical application for patients. Hillman also offers a variety of education, training programs and fellowships, in conjunction with related schools within the University of Pittsburgh, for both new cancer researchers to experienced investigators. The current director of the UPCI and UPMC Cancer Centers is Robert L. Ferris. Cancer center network UPMC Hillman Cancer Center offers the latest advances in cancer prevention, detection, diagnosis, and treatment to patients at UPMC-affiliated locations throughout the Pittsburgh region and abroad. The centers combine to create a network of more than 2,300 physicians, scientists, administrative staff, and other health care professionals that provide the latest care, technology, and treatments, as well as clinical trials, to over 36,000 patients each year. UPMC CancerCenter encompass 13 areas of expertise, each focusing on a specific type or treatment of cancer. These include programs devoted to melanoma, brain cancers, breast cancer, colon and gastrointestinal cancers, head and neck cancers, leukemias and lymphomas, liver cancer, lung cancer, gynecologic cancers, prostate and urologic cancers, and stem cell transplantation. Pediatric cancers are treated by specialists at the UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Locations The network works as a hub-and-satellite system of cancer care services at locations that are tied to the central hub and the flagship facility of the UPMC cancer center network, the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh. The UPMC network covers a geographic area of more than around greater Pittsburgh, comprising 180 affiliated oncologists at over 30 locations throughout Western Pennsylvania and Ohio and includes a growing list of international locations starting in Dublin and Waterford, Ireland and a radiotherapy center in Rome. In November, 2008, UPMC announced a partnership with GE Healthcare to open 25 additional cancer treatment centers across Europe and the Middle East over the next ten years.

The $130 million, 350,000-square-foot, 5-story facility, designed by Pittsburgh architectural firm IKM, opened in 2002 in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh. It is located directly across Centre Avenue from, and connected via a pedestrian bridge to, UPMC Shadyside hospital where cancer surgery and Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) are conducted. The Hillman Cancer Center building houses both a research pavilion and a clinical pavilion connected by a three-story atrium. The facility brings together 400 full-time researchers and clinicians and 185 physicians practicing in the UPMC Cancer Centers network. The clinical pavilion offers cancer prevention, risk assessment, detection, treatment, and stress and symptom management services including radiology services such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET). It also includes waiting rooms equipped with televisions and play areas for children and access to a kitchen stocked with beverages and light refreshments. The outpatient clinic, known as The William Cooper Pavilion, honoring the oncologist who led the campaign for philanthropic support of the center, was designed by architectural firm Radelet McCarthy. The Hillman Cancer Center also offers other amenities for patients including valet parking, a patient and family education and information center, a garden and meditation with a granite fountain, a caf√©, gift shop and a salon where patients can receive salon services and purchase wigs, hats, skin care products and prostheses. In 2012, the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center opened the Mario Lemieux Center for Blood Cancers on the fourth floor of the building.

Such recombination often results in dramatic chromosomal rearrangement, which is generally harmful to the organism.Montgomery, E., B. Charlesworth, and C. H. Langley. 1987. A test for the role of natural selection in the stabilization of transposable element copy number in a population of Drosophila melanogaster. Genet. Res. 49:31‚Äì41 Some research, however, has suggested that ectopic recombination can result in mutated chromosomes that benefit the organism.Bush, G.L., S.M. Case, A.C. Wilson and J.L. Patton. 1977. Rapid speciation and chromosomal evolution in mammals. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74: 3942-3946 Ectopic recombination can occur during both meiosis and mitosis, although it is more likely occur during meiosis.Montgomery, E., S.M. Huang, C.H. Langley, and B.H. Judd. 1991. Chromosome rearrangement by ectopic recombination in drosophila melanogaster: genome structure and evolution. Genetics 129: 1085-1098 It occurs relatively frequently‚Äîin at least one yeast species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) the frequency of ectopic recombination is roughly on par with that of allelic (or traditional) recombination.Licthen, M, R.H. Borts, and J.E. Haber. 1986. Meiotic gene conversion and crossing over between dispersed homologous sequences occurs frequently in saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genetics 115: 233-246 If the alleles at two loci are heterozygous, then ectopic recombination is relatively likely to occur, whereas if the alleles are homozygous, they will almost certainly undergo allelic recombination. Ectopic recombination does not require loci involved to be close to one another; it can occur between loci that are widely separated on a single chromosome, and has even been known to occur across chromosomes.Harris, S, K.S. Rudnicki, and J.E. Haber. 1993. Gene conversions and crossing over during homologous and homeologous ectopic recombination in saccharomyces cerevisae. Genetics 135: 5-16 Neither does it require high levels of homology between sequences‚Äîthe lower limit required for it to occur has been estimated at as low as 2.2 kb of homologous stretches of DNA nucleotides. The role of transposable elements in ectopic recombination is an area of active inquiry. Transposable elements‚Äîrepetitious sequences of DNA that can insert themselves into any part of the genome‚Äîcan encourage ectopic recombination at repeated homologous sequences of nucleotides. However, according to one proposed model, ectopic recombination might serve as an inhibitor of high transposable element copy numbers. The frequency of ectopic recombination of transposable elements has been linked to both higher copy numbers of transposable elements and the longer lengths of those elements.Petrov, D.A, Y.T. Aminetzach, J.C. Davis, D. Bensasson, and A.E. Hirsh. 2003. Size matters: non-LTR retrotransposable elements and ectopic recombination in drosophila. Mol Bio Evol 20: 880-892 Since ectopic recombination is generally deleterious, anything that increases its odds of occurring is selected against, including the aforementioned higher copy numbers and longer lengths. This model, however, can only be applied to single families of transposable elements in the genome, as the probability of ectopic recombination occurring in one TE family is independent of it occurring in another. It follows that transposable elements that are shorter, transpose themselves less often, and have mutation rates high enough to disrupt the homology between transposable element sequences sufficiently to prevent ectopic recombination from occurring are selected for.

The series tells a coming-of-age story of high school students in the early 21st century training to participate in one of Japan's first human spaceflight missions. It centers around the lead character Asumi Kamogawa, whose decision to become an astronaut is influenced by a family tragedy and a mentor figure from her past. Prior to writing Twin Spica, Yaginuma had written several short stories depicting Asumi's childhood, beginning with . These stories were serialized by Media Factory from the July 2000 issue (released June 5, 2000) of the seinen manga magazine Comic Flapper until June 5, 2002. The Asumi story arc sets the stage for Twin Spica by introducing figures from her childhood that will affect her growth at the fictional Tokyo Space Academy. The main story arc at the space academy was first serialized in the October 2001 issue (released September 5, 2001) of Comic Flapper. It continued until the publication of the 89th chapter on August 5, 2009. Both story arcs have been compiled into 16 bound volumes, with chapters of the Asumi story arc interspersed among several volumes. The series is licensed by Tong Li Publishing for Chinese-language release in Taiwan under the title Dream of Spica (). Following a three-week contract negotiation, New York City-based Vertical Inc announced on September 25, 2009, that it had acquired the license to publish Twin Spica in English. Vertical marketing director Ed Chavez explained that the motivation to acquire Twin Spica came about from the company's desire to license works from Japanese publishers that have yet to form a partnership with major American publishers. Chavez proposed that Vertical continued its previous partnership with Media Factory, a smaller publishing company from which Vertical licensed the Guin Saga manga in 2007. In assessing the series for possible licensing, Chavez, a fan of science fiction, found Twin Spica's story \\"technically sound\\" and noted it as \\"possibly one of the most heartfelt series I've read in ages\\". Vertical expected that the series would help broaden its reader base. Twin Spica would also introduce science fiction to readers in anticipation of future Vertical licenses of works by Osamu Tezuka and the Year 24 Group. While the series was originally published in a seinen magazine, Chavez expected that it would also appeal to fans of sh≈çjo manga. Beginning with the seventh volume of the manga, the American publisher Vertical Inc started including more chapters in each volume compared to their Japanese counterparts. Volume 12, released in March 2012 is the final English volume, collecting together volumes 15 and 16 of the Japanese release.

Although the name Hadyab normally connoted the region around Erbil and Mosul in present-day Iraq, the boundaries of the East Syriac metropolitan province went well beyond the Erbil and Mosul districts. Its known suffragan dioceses included Beth Bgash (the Hakkari region of eastern Turkey) and Adarbaigan (the Ganzak district, to the southeast of Lake Urmi), well to the east of Adiabene proper.  Ecclesiastical history  Adiabene and its environsThe bishop of Erbil, present-day Iraqi Kurdistan, became metropolitan of Adiabene in 410, responsible also for the six suffragan dioceses of Beth Nuhadra (), Beth Bgash, Beth Dasen, Ramonin, Beth Mahqart and Dabarin.Chabot, 272‚Äì3 Bishops of the dioceses of Beth Nuhadra, Beth Bgash and Beth Dasen, which covered the modern  øAmadiya and Hakkari regions, were present at most of the early synods, and these three dioceses continued without interruption into the 13th century. The other three dioceses are not mentioned again, and have been tentatively identified with three dioceses better known under other names: Ramonin with Shenna d'Beth Ramman in Beth Aramaye, on the Tigris near its junction with the Great Zab; Beth Mahrqart with Beth Qardu in the Nisibis region, across the Tigris from the district of Beth Zabda√Ø; and Dabarin with Tirhan, a district of Beth Aramaye which lay between the Tigris and the Jabal Hamrin, to the southwest of Beth Garma√Ø. By the middle of the 6th century there were also dioceses in the province of Adiabene for Ma øaltha () or Ma øalthaya (), a town in the Hnitha () or Zibar district to the east of  øAqra, and for Nineveh. The diocese of Ma øaltha is first mentioned in 497, and the diocese of Nineveh in 554, and bishops of both dioceses attended most of the later synods.Fiey, POCN, 106 and 115‚Äì16 Erbil, the chief town of Adiabene, lost much of its former importance with the growth of the city of Mosul, and during the reign of the patriarch Timothy I (780‚Äì823) the seat of the metropolitans of Adiabene was moved to Mosul. The dioceses of Adiabene were governed by a 'metropolitan of Mosul and Erbil' for the next four and a half centuries. Around 1200, Mosul and Erbil became separate metropolitan provinces. The last known metropolitan of Mosul and Erbil was Tittos, who was appointed by Eliya III (1175‚Äì89). Thereafter separate metropolitan bishops for Mosul and for Erbil are recorded in a fairly complete series from 1210 to 1318. Five new dioceses in the province of Mosul and Erbil were established during the Umayyad and  øAbbasid periods: Marga, Salakh (), Haditha, Taimana and Hebton. The dioceses of Marga and Salakh, covering the districts around  øAmadiya and  øAqra, are first mentioned in the 8th century but may have been created earlier, perhaps in response to West Syriac competition in the Mosul region in the 7th century. The diocese of Marga persisted into the 14th century, but the diocese of Salakh is last mentioned in the 9th century. By the 8th century there was also an East Syriac diocese for the town of Hdatta (Haditha) on the Tigris, which persisted into the 14th century. The diocese of Taimana, which embraced the district south of the Tigris in the vicinity of Mosul and included the monastery of Mar Mikha'il, is attested between the eighth and 10th centuries, but does not seem to have persisted into the 13th century.Fiey, AC, ii. 336‚Äì7; and POCN, 137 A number of East Syriac bishops are attested between the eighth and 13th centuries for the diocese of Hebton, a region of northwest Adiabene to the south of the Great Zab, adjacent to the district of Marga. It is not clear when the diocese was created, but it is first mentioned under the name 'Hnitha and Hebton' in 790. Hnitha was another name for the diocese of Ma øaltha, and the patriarch Timothy I is said to have united the dioceses of Hebton and Hnitha in order to punish the presumption of the bishop Rustam of Hnitha, who had opposed his election. The union was not permanent, and by the 11th century Hebton and Ma øaltha were again separate dioceses.Fiey, POCN, 89‚Äì90 Bishops of Adarbaigan, a diocese centred on the town of Ganzak and bounded on the west by the Salmas and Urmi plains and on the east by the Caspian Sea, were present at most of the 5th-century synods, but Adarbaigan was not among the dioceses assigned to a metropolitan province in 410. By the 8th century it was part of the metropolitan province of Adiabene. At the beginning of the 13th century there were at least eight suffragan dioceses in the provinces of Mosul and Erbil: Haditha, Ma øaltha, Hebton, Beth Bgash, Dasen, Beth Nuhadra, Marga and Urmi. The diocese of Hebton is last mentioned in 1257, when its bishop Gabriel attended the consecration of the patriarch Makkikha II.Fiey, POCN, 89‚Äì90 The diocese of Dasen definitely persisted into the 14th century, as did the diocese of Marga, though it was renamed Tella and Barbelli in the second half of the 13th century. It is possible that the dioceses of Beth Nuhadra, Beth Bgash and Haditha also survived into the 14th century. Haditha, indeed, is mentioned as a diocese at the beginning of the 14th century by  øAbdisho ø of Nisibis.Fiey, POCN, 86‚Äì7 Urmi too, although none of its bishops are known, may also have persisted as a diocese into the 16th century, when it again appears as the seat of an East Syriac bishop.Fiey, POCN, 141‚Äì2 The diocese of Ma øaltha is last mentioned in 1281, but probably persisted into the 14th century under the name Hnitha. The bishop  øAbdisho ø 'of Hnitha', attested in 1310 and 1318, was almost certainly a bishop of the diocese formerly known as Ma øaltha.Fiey, POCN, 91‚Äì2 and 106  Dioceses in the Erbil region   The diocese of Erbil  According to the Chronicle of Erbil, a history of Christianity in Adiabene under the Parthians and Sassanians purportedly written by the 6th-century East Syriac author Mshiha-zkha, a diocese was established for Erbil at the beginning of the 2nd century. The Chronicle describes the careers of twenty bishops of Erbil between the second and 6th centuries and provides precise reign dates for each of them. According to the Chronicle, the early bishops of Erbil were Paqida (104‚Äì14), Samson (120‚Äì3), Isaac (135‚Äì48), Abraham (148‚Äì63), Nuh (168‚Äì79), Habel (183‚Äì90),  øAbd-mshiha (190‚Äì225), Hiran (225‚Äì58), Shahlupha (258‚Äì73), Ahadabui (273‚Äì91), Sri øa (291‚Äì317), Yohannan (317‚Äì46), Abraham (346‚Äì7), Maran- zkha (347‚Äì76), Shubhalisho ø (376‚Äì407), Daniel (407‚Äì31), Rima (431‚Äì50),  øAbbushta (450‚Äì99), Joseph (499‚Äì511) and Hnana (from 511). The authenticity of the Chronicle of Erbil has been questioned, and scholars remain divided on how much credence to place in its evidence. Some of the bishops mentioned in the Chronicle of Erbil, particularly those from the 4th century onwards, are attested in other sources, but the early bishops are probably legendary. The metropolitan Daniel of Adiabene was present at the synod of Isaac in 410 and subscribed to its acts. He was also among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Dadisho ø in 424.Chabot, 274 and 285 Towards the end of the 5th century Adiabene had two metropolitans. The bishop Joseph, 'bishop of Erbil, metropolitan of Adiabene', was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Babai in 497, and the secretary Sidura signed the acts of the same synod on behalf of the bishop  øAbbushta, 'metropolitan of Adiabene'.Chabot, 315 and 317 The metropolitan Hnana of Adiabene was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Aba I in 544.Chabot, 344‚Äì5 and 350-1 The metropolitan Mshabbha of Adiabene was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Joseph in 554.Chabot, 366 The metropolitan Hnana of Adiabene was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Ezekiel in 576.Chabot, 368 The priest and archdeacon Bar Aba was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Isho øyahb I in 585, on behalf of the metropolitan Hnana, 'metropolitan of the Athoraye', probably the same man.Chabot, 423 The metropolitan Yonadab of Adiabene was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Gregory in 605.Chabot, 478 The patriarch Isho øyahb III of Adiabene (649‚Äì59) was metropolitan of Adiabene from 637 to 649. The metropolitan Yohannan of Adiabene flourished in the first half of the 8th century. The nephew of the celebrated East Syriac writers Hnanisho ø and Isho øyahb of Beth  øAbe, Yohannan was formerly a monk of the monastery of Beth  øAbe, later its superior, and later still bishop of Beth Bgash. He was consecrated metropolitan of Adiabene by the patriarch Sliba-zkha (714‚Äì28), and died during the reign of the patriarch Mar Aba II (742‚Äì52).Wallis Budge, Book of Governors, ii. 236, 253 and 265‚Äì6 The metropolitan Ahha of Adiabene flourished around the middle of the 8th century. Originally a monk of the monastery of Beth  øAbe, he later became its superior. He was appointed metropolitan of Adiabene by the patriarch Aba II (742‚Äì52) on the death of the metropolitan Yohannan.Wallis Budge, Book of Governors, 256‚Äì8 During his metropolitanate he consecrated the bishops Sargis of Ma øaltha and Hnitha and Maran øammeh of Salakh.Wallis Budge, Book of Governors, ii. 265‚Äì6 and 281‚Äì2 The metropolitan Maran øammeh of Adiabene flourished during the third quarter of the 8th century. An ascetic from the town of Htara in the Tirhan district, he studied in his youth under Rabban Babai in Gbilta and later opened a school in the Erbil village of Kfar  øUzail, where he taught for many years. In his late middle age, during the reign of the patriarch Aba II (742‚Äì52), he was consecrated bishop of Salakh by the metropolitan Ahha of Adiabene. He was appointed metropolitan of Adiabene by the patriarch Ya øqob II (754‚Äì73) on Ahha's death. He died of sickness and extreme old age shortly after the accession of Timothy I in 780 in the village of Beth Rewai, and his body was buried in the village's church. Thomas of Marga devoted the entire third book of his Book of Governors to Maran øammeh's life and work.Wallis Budge, Book of Governors, ii. 304‚Äì75 The metropolitan Isho øyahb of Adiabene was consecrated by the patriarch Timothy I shortly after his election in 780, on the death of the metropolitan Maran øammeh. Isho øyahb, the elderly superior of the monastery of Beth  øAbe, had originally intended to contest the 780 patriarchal election and was widely expected to win it. His rival Timothy, then bishop of Beth Bgash, persuaded him to withdraw his candidacy on the grounds of old age, and promised to appoint him metropolitan of Adiabene if he became patriarch himself.Wallis Budge, Book of Governors, ii. 383 Erbil, the chief town of Adiabene, lost much of its former importance with the growth of the city of Mosul, and during the reign of the patriarch Timothy I (780‚Äì823) the seat of the metropolitans of Adiabene was moved to Mosul. The dioceses of Adiabene were governed by a 'metropolitan of Mosul and Erbil' for the next four and a half centuries. Around 1200, Mosul and Erbil became separate metropolitan provinces. The last known metropolitan of Mosul and Erbil was Tittos, who was appointed by Eliya III (1175‚Äì89). Thereafter separate metropolitan bishops for Mosul and for Erbil are recorded in a fairly complete series from 1210 to 1318. The metropolitan Sabrisho ø Ibn Qayyoma 'of Hazza and Erbil' was present at the consecration of the patriarch Sabrisho ø IV in 1222.Sliba, 116 (Arabic) The metropolitan Denha of Erbil (the future patriarch Denha I, 1265‚Äì81), was present at the consecration of the patriarch Makkikha II in 1257.Sliba, 120 (Arabic) The metropolitan Mushe of Erbil was present at the consecration of the patriarch Yahballaha III in 1281.Sliba, 124 (Arabic) The metropolitan Joseph of Erbil became patriarch in 1318, taking the name Timothy II. According to  øAbdisho ø of Nisibis, he was originally metropolitan of Mosul, and was transferred to the diocese of Erbil upon the death of its metropolitan Abraham.  The diocese of Ramonin  The bishop  øAqballaha of Ramonin was confirmed as a suffragan bishop of the metropolitan Daniel of Adiabene in Canon XXI of the synod of Isaac in 410.Chabot, 273  The diocese of Dabarin  The bishop Nuh (Noah) of 'the fortress of Dabarin', was confirmed as a suffragan bishop of the metropolitan Daniel of Adiabene in Canon XXI of the synod of Isaac in 410.  The diocese of Ma øaltha and Hnitha  The bishop Yohannan of Ma øaltha was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Baba√Ø in 497.Chabot, 310‚Äì11 and 316 The bishop Shem øon of Ma øaltha was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Mar Aba I in 544.Chabot, 344‚Äì5 and 350‚Äì1 The bishop Yazdpanah of Ma øaltha was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Joseph in 554. The bishop Bar Shabtha of Ma øaltha was among the signatories of the acts of the synods of Ezekiel in 576 and Isho øyahb I in 585.Chabot, 368 and 423 The bishop Klilisho ø of Ma øaltha was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Gregory in 605.Chabot, 479 The bishop Dindowai of 'Ma øaltha and Hnitha', formerly a monk of the monastery of Beth  øAbe, was appointed by the metropolitan Yohannan of Adiabene at an unknown date in the first half of the 8th century. After his death he was buried in the monastery of Beth  øAbe.Wallis Budge, Book of Governors, ii. 238‚Äì9 The bishop Sargis of 'Ma øaltha and Hnitha', formerly a monk of the monastery of Beth  øAbe, was appointed around the middle of the 8th century by the metropolitan Ahha of Adiabene after the death of Dindowai. Sargis abandoned his diocese in the wake of a raid on the Hnitha district by the Dailomaye and took refuge in the monastery of Beth  øAbe, where he remained until his death. Like his predecessor, he was buried in the monastery. Thomas of Marga considered his flight from his diocese discreditable, and remarked that he had 'failed to live up to the hopes that had been placed in him'.Wallis Budge, Book of Governors, ii. 281‚Äì2 The bishop Yohannan Ibn Bokhtisho ø of Ma øaltha was appointed metropolitan of Mosul by the patriarch Yohannan III immediately after his consecration on 15 July 893.Bar Hebraeus, Chronicon Ecclesiasticum, ii. 220; Sliba, 80 (Arabic) The bishop Yohannan of Ma øaltha ('in the province of Mosul') was present at the consecration of the patriarch  øAbdisho ø II in 1074.Mari, 130 (Arabic), 114 (Latin) The bishop Quriaqos of Ma øaltha was present at the consecration of the patriarch Makkikha I in 1092.Mari, 138 (Arabic), 118 (Latin) The bishop  øAbdisho ø of Ma øaltha was present at the consecration of the patriarch Denha I in 1265.Sliba, 121‚Äì2 (Arabic) The bishop Giwargis 'of Ma øaltha' was present at the consecration of the patriarch Yahballaha III in 1281.

The future patriarch Enosh (877‚Äì84) was appointed metropolitan of Mosul by the patriarch Sargis (860‚Äì72).Sliba, 73 (Arabic) The bishop Yohannan Ibn Bokhtisho ø of Ma øaltha was appointed metropolitan of Mosul by the patriarch Yohannan III immediately after his consecration on 15 July 893.Sliba, 80 (Arabic) He was present at the consecration of the patriarch Yohannan IV in 900.MS Paris BN Syr 354, folio 147 The metropolitan Luke of Mosul was one of only two metropolitans present at the consecration of the patriarch Emmanuel I on 23 February 938, because 'many metropolitans objected'.Elijah of Nisibis, Chronography, i. 100 The metropolitan Giwargis bar Tobi was appointed by the patriarch Emmanuel I (937‚Äì60), and was an unsuccessful candidate in the patriarchal elections of 960, 963 and 987.Mari, 99, 100 and 105 (Arabic), 88, 89 and 94 (Latin); and Sliba, 92 and 94 (Arabic) He was also one of three metropolitans who were present at the consecration of the patriarch Israel in 961.Mari, 99 (Arabic), 88 (Latin) According to Amr and Sliba, he was also present at the consecration of the patriarch Mari on 10 April 987. According to Mari, however, the diocese of Mosul was vacant at the end of the reign of the patriarch  øAbdisho ø I (968‚Äì86).Mari, 102 (Arabic), 91 (Latin) The bishop Isho øyahb of Haditha was appointed metropolitan of Mosul during the reign of the patriarch Mari (987‚Äì99). The bishop Gabriel of Arzun was consecrated metropolitan 'of Erbil and Athor' by the patriarch Yohannan VI (1012‚Äì16) on 19 November 1012, the day of his own consecration as patriarch.Elijah of Nisibis, Chronography, i. 35 and 111 The metropolitan Eliya, metropolitan of Mosul (Athor) when Elijah of Nisibis completed his Chronography in 1018/19, was originally bishop of Piroz Shabur and later metropolitan of Damascus. He fled from Damascus to Baghdad because of a persecution directed against the 'western Christians', and was subsequently elected metropolitan of Mosul.Elijah of Nisibis, Chronography, i. 35 The bishop Yahballaha Ibn Abu Darah of Beth Nuhadra was consecrated metropolitan of Mosul by the patriarch Sabrisho ø III shortly after his consecration in 1064, following the death of the metropolitan Gabriel of Mosul.Mari, 125 (Arabic), 110 (Latin) He was present as 'metropolitan of Hazza and Mosul' at the consecration of the patriarch  øAbdisho ø II (1074‚Äì90) in 1074. He died in 1085, and was replaced as metropolitan of Mosul by the future patriarch Makkikha Ibn Sulaiman, bishop of Tirhan. The Assyrian village of Tel Isqof, Mosul district The metropolitan Yohannan Ibn al-Haddad of Mosul was present at the consecration of the patriarchs Bar Sawma in 1134 and  øAbdisho ø III in 1139.Mari, 158 (Arabic), 131 and 133 (Latin) The metropolitan Joseph 'of Athor and Nineveh' is mentioned together with the patriarch Yahballaha II (the start of whose reign has conventionally been placed in 1190) in the colophon of an East Syriac manuscript of August 1189.MS Mosul (Magdasi) 1 The metropolitan Joseph of Mosul was present at the consecration of the patriarch Sabrisho ø IV in 1222.

The metropolitan Gabriel of Mosul was present at the consecration of the patriarch Yahballaha III in 1281. The metropolitan Shem øon of Mosul was present at the consecration of the patriarch Timothy II in 1318.  The diocese of Taimana  The bishop Mushe of Taimana was among the bishops who witnessed a retraction of the Messallian heresy made by the priest Nestorius of the monastery of Mar Yozadaq in 790 before his consecration as bishop of Beth Nuhadra.  The diocese of Nineveh  The bishop Ahudemmeh of Nineveh was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Joseph in 554. The bishop Yazdpanah of Nineveh was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Ezekiel in 576. The bishop Mar Aba of Nineveh was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Isho øyahb I in 585. The patriarch Maremmeh (646‚Äì50) was bishop of Nineveh during the reign of the patriarch Isho øyahb II (628‚Äì46), who consecrated him metropolitan of  øIlam.Chronicle of Seert, ii. 309‚Äì10 The patriarch Isho øyahb III of Adiabene (649‚Äì59) appears to have succeeded Maremmeh as bishop of Nineveh, perhaps around 630. In 637 he was appointed metropolitan of Erbil. The bishop Mushe of Nineveh was among the bishops present at the deathbed of the patriarch Isho øyahb III in 659.Sliba, 56‚Äì7 (Arabic) The monk Quriaqos of Awakh, of the monastery of Beth  øAbe, became bishop of Nineveh at an unknown date in the second half of the 8th century or the first half of the 9th century.Wallis Budge, Book of Governors, ii. 449  Dioceses in the  øAmadiya and  øAqra regions  Rabban Hormizd, Alqosh There were three main concentrations of East Syriac villages in the  øAmadiya region: in the Sapna valley to the west of  øAmadiya, in the Tigris plain around Dohuk, and in the Shemkan district, around the valley of the Gomel river. Before the 14th century the apna valley was part of the diocese of Dasen and Beth Ture ('the mountains'), which lay to the north of Marga and also covered the Berwari region and the Zibar and Lower Tiyari districts. The villages in the Dohuk district were included in the East Syriac diocese of Beth Nuhadra, whose bishops resided in the small town of Tel Hesh near Alqosh, and those in the Gomel valley in the diocese of Marga, centred on the  øAqra region. The last-known bishops of Beth Nuhadra and Dasen, Malkisho ø and Mattai, were present at the consecrations of Denha I in 1265 and Yahballaha III in 1281 respectively, and it is unclear when either diocese came to an end.  The diocese of Beth Nuhadra  The bishop Isaac of Beth Nuhadra was confirmed as a suffragan bishop of the metropolitan Daniel of Adiabene in Canon XXI of the synod of Isaac in 410. The bishop Shlemun 'of Nuhadra' was one of eleven named bishops listed in the acts of the synod of Dadisho ø in 424 as having been reproved at the synods of Isaac in 410 and Yahballaha I in 420.Chabot, 287 The bishop Samuel of Beth Nuhadra was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Baba√Ø in 497.Chabot, 315 The bishop Gawsisho ø of Beth Nuhadra was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Isho øyahb I in 585. The bishop Yohannan of Beth Nuhadra was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Gregory in 605. The bishop Ephrem of Beth Nuhadra is mentioned together with the patriarch Ya øqob in the colophon of an East Syriac manuscript of 759/760.MS New York Pierpont Morgan 236 The priest Nestorius of the monastery of Mar Yozadaq was consecrated bishop of Beth Nuhadra in 790 after retracting the Messallian heresy in the presence of the metropolitans of Nisibis and Mosul and several other bishops. The bishop Brikhisho ø of Beth Nuhadra was present at the consecration of the patriarch Yohannan IV in 900. Elijah, Elias, or Eliya of Nisibis was consecrated bishop of Beth Nuhadra by the patriarch Yohannan V on Sunday 15 February 1002. He became archbishop of Nisibis on Sunday 26 December 1008, in which office he wrote his famed Chronology.Elijah of Nisibis, Chronography, i. 112 The bishop Yahballaha Ibn Abu Darah of Beth Nuhadra was consecrated metropolitan of Mosul by the patriarch Sabrisho ø III shortly after his consecration in 1064. The bishop Mushe of Beth Nuhadra was present at the consecration of the patriarch Eliya II in 1111.Mari, 152 (Arabic), 129 (Latin) An unnamed bishop of Beth Nuhadra was present at the consecration of the patriarch Bar Sawma in 1134.Mari, 131 (Latin) The bishop Sabrisho ø of Beth Nuhadra is mentioned together with the patriarch 'Yahballaha of Athor' (Yahballaha II) in the dating formula of an East Syriac manuscript of 1208 copied in the monastery of Rabban Hormizd.MS Harvard Syr 141 The bishop Isho øyahb of Beth Nuhadra was present at the consecration of the patriarch Makkikha II in 1257. The bishop Malkisho ø of Beth Nuhadra was present at the consecration of the patriarch Denha I in 1265.  The diocese of Beth Dasen  The bishop Ahadabui of Beth Dasen was confirmed as a suffragan bishop of the metropolitan Daniel of Adiabene in Canon XXI of the synod of Isaac in 410. The bishop Qiris of Dasen was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Dadisho ø in 424.Chabot, 285 The bishop Mareh-rahmeh of Beth Dasen was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Baba√Ø in 497.Chabot, 316 The bishop Qamisho ø of Beth Dasen was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Ezekiel in 576. The bishop Burzmihr of Beth Dasen was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Gregory in 605. The bishop Stephen of Dasen was a contemporary of the metropolitan Maran øammeh of Adiabene, who was appointed by Ya øqob II (754‚Äì73) and died shortly after the accession of Timothy I in 780. During Stephen's episcopate Maran øammeh adjusted the boundaries of the dioceses of Dasen and Marga, transferring the districts of Nahla and Talana from Marga to Dasen and also assigning the Great Monastery to the diocese of Dasen.Wallis Budge, Book of Governors, ii. 316 The bishop Mattai of Dasen was present at the consecrations of the patriarchs Denha I in 1265 and Yahballaha III in 1281.  The diocese of Marga (Tella and Barbelli)  The diocese of Marga, attested between the eighth and 14th centuries and frequently mentioned in Thomas of Marga's Book of Governors, included a large number of villages and monasteries around  øAqra. In the middle of the 8th century the diocese is known to have included the districts of Sapsapa (the Navkur plain south of  øAqra, on the east bank of the Khazir river), Talana and Nahla d'Malka (two valleys around the upper course of the Khazir river) and Beth Rustaqa (the Gomel valley), and it probably also included several villages in the Zibar district. The metropolitan Maran øammeh of Adiabene, who flourished in the third quarter of the 8th century, adjusted the boundaries of the dioceses of Dasen and Marga, transferring the districts of Nahla and Talana from Marga to Dasen and also assigning the Great Monastery to the diocese of Dasen. The diocese of Marga is first mentioned in the 8th century (the region was probably in the diocese of Beth Nuhadra previously), and several of its bishops are mentioned between the 8th century and the first half of the 13th century. By the second half of the 13th century the names of two villages in the Gomel valley, Tella and Barbelli (Billan), were also included in the title of the diocese. The last-known bishop of Tella and Barbelli, Isho øyahb, was present at the consecration of the patriarch Timothy II in 1318. The diocese is not mentioned thereafter, and no other bishops are known from the  øAqra region until the 19th century.  The diocese of Salakh  The diocese of Salakh (), which covered the mountainous region to the east of Rawanduz, does not feature in the classical lists of the dioceses of Adiabene, but several 8th-century bishops of Salakh are mentioned in Thomas of Marga's Book of Governors (written c.840). The History of Mar Sabrisho ø of Beth Qoqa also mentions a 9th-century bishop of Salakh. It is not clear when the diocese came to an end.Fiey, POCN, 126‚Äì7  Dioceses in the Hakkari and Urmi regions   The diocese of Beth Bgash  The bishop Barinos of Beth Bgash was confirmed as a suffragan bishop of the metropolitan Daniel of Adiabene in Canon XXI of the synod of Isaac in 410. The bishop Mari of Beth Bgash was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Dadisho ø in 424. The bishop Aphrahat of Beth Bgash was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Acacius in 486, and his secretary Hawah signed the acts of the synod of Baba√Ø in 497 on his behalf.Chabot, 307 and 316 The bishop Mushe of Beth Bgash was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Mar Aba I in 544. The bishop Timothy of Beth Bgash was among the signatories of the acts of the synods of Isho øyahb I in 585 and Gregory in 605.Chabot, 423 and 478 The 8th-century metropolitan Yohannan of Adiabene, nephew of the celebrated East Syriac writers Hnanisho ø and Isho øyahb of Beth  øAbe, was originally a monk of the monastery of Beth  øAbe, later its superior, and later still bishop of Beth Bgash. He was consecrated metropolitan of Adiabene between 714 and 728 by the patriarch Sliba-zkha.Wallis Budge, Book of Governors, ii. 236 and 253 The bishop Shem øon of Beth Bgash, who flourished around the middle of the 8th century, is mentioned on several occasions by Thomas of Marga. He was consecrated bishop of Beth Bgash by the metropolitan Maran øammeh of Adiabene (754‚Äì73), built a church in the village of Shalmath (modern Sharmen) near  øAqra, was bishop of Beth Bgash for only three years, and after his death was buried in the church of Bai.Wallis Budge, Book of Governors, ii. 264‚Äì5 and 654 The elderly bishop Giwargis, uncle of the patriarch Timothy I, was bishop of Beth Bgash c.765, and may well have been Shem øon's immediate successor. The future patriarch Timothy I became bishop of Beth Bgash c.770, upon the retirement of his uncle Giwargis, and remained in the diocese until his election as patriarch in 780. The monks Diodorus and  øAbdisho ø of the monastery of Beth  øAbe were 'elected bishops of Beth Bgash, one after the other' at unknown dates in the second half of the 8th century or the first half of the 9th century. The bishop Mark of Beth Bgash was appointed metropolitan of Rai by the patriarch Yohannan III immediately after his consecration on 15 July 893. The bishop Shlemun of Beth Bgash was present at the consecration of the patriarch Yohannan IV in 900. The monk Sabrisho of the monastery of Mar Mikha'il near Mosul was consecrated bishop of Beth Bgash by the patriarch Eliya II (1111‚Äì32).Mari, 153 (Arabic), 130 (Latin); Amrus, 104 (Arabic) The bishop Isho øzkha of Beth Bgash was present at the consecration of the patriarch Denha I in 1265.  The diocese of Adarbaigan  The diocese of Adarbaigan appears to have covered the territory included within the Sassanian province of Atropatene. It was bounded on the west by the Salmas and Urmi plains to the west of Lake Urmi, and on the south by the diocese of Salakh, which included the districts around the modern town of Rawanduz. Its centre seems to have been the town of Ganzak. Adarbaigan was not among the dioceses assigned to a metropolitan province in 410, but by the 8th century it was part of the metropolitan province of Adiabene. The metropolitan Maran øammeh of Adiabene, who flourished during the third quarter of the 8th century, adjusted the boundaries of the dioceses of Salakh and Adarbaigan, transferring the district of Daibur from Salakh to Adarbaigan and the district of Inner Salakh from Adarbaigan to Salakh. These boundary changes probably affected Christian communities living in the upper valley of the Lesser Zab river.Wallis Budge, Book of Governors, ii. 315‚Äì16 A separate East Syriac metropolitan province was created for Adarbaigan in the second half of the 13th century, possibly centred on Tabriz. Raiding and brigandage were rife in Mesopotamia at this period, and the creation of a new East Syriac metropolitan province reflected a migration of Christians from the Tigris plains to the relative safety of Adarbaigan, where there was a strong Mongol military presence. By the 16th century the title 'Adarbaigan' had been assumed by the East Syriac bishops of Salmas, doubtless reflecting a memory that the Salmas district had once been part of the diocese of Adarbaigan.

(Bold dates - fatal accidents)  1950s  * On 9 April 1952, Mokusei, Japan Airlines Flight 301 operated by a Martin 2-0-2 leased from Northwest Orient Airlines, crashed into a mountain near Mount Mihara while en route from Tokyo to Fukuoka. The crash killed all 37 occupants on board the aircraft, including 4 crew members and 33 passengers. * On 30 September 1957, Unzen, a Japan Airlines Douglas DC-4 caught fire in its number one engine after takeoff from Osaka International Airport, at an altitude of . The aircraft was forced to land in a rice field and was damaged beyond repair.  1960s  * On 25 April 1961, Hakone, a Japan Airlines Douglas DC-8 from San Francisco to Tokyo, touched down and ran off the end of the wet runway at Tokyo International Airport. The aircraft stopped after the main gear entered a ditch wide and deep, located beyond the end of the runway. The aircraft was shipped back and repaired by Douglas Aircraft Company at Long Beach, CA, United States, and returned to service as a Series 53 with a new registration (JA8008) in early 1963 and was renamed Matsushima. * On 10 April 1962, Haruna, a Japan Airlines Douglas C-54 from Fukuoka to Tokyo, made a wheels-up landing at Osaka. There were no casualties, however, the aircraft was damaged beyond repair and was written off. * On 27 February 1965, Kaede, a Japan Airlines Convair 880 was performing a low pass training near Iki Airport when, at , descended fast and struck the runway. The aircraft slid and caught fire. * On 25 December 1965, Kamakura, Japan Airlines Flight 813 operated by a Douglas DC-8 took off from San Francisco International Airport at 13:08 and suffered an uncontained engine failure on number one engine while climbing through . A fire erupted in the area of the number one engine, but was quickly extinguished. The aircraft made a safe emergency landing at Oakland International Airport, CA. The probable cause was \\"a disintegrating engine failure and in-flight fire caused by the failure of maintenance personnel to properly secure the low pressure compressor section torque ring during engine overhaul\\". * On 26 August 1966, Ginza, a Japan Airlines Convair 880 (leased from Japan Domestic Airlines) yawed left for unknown reasons after the nose lifted up during a training flight at Haneda Airport. Some into takeoff, the number one engine struck the runway. The aircraft left the runway and the nose pitched down again. All four engines separated as well as the nose and left landing gear; the aircraft caught fire and burned out. All five crew died. * On 22 November 1968, Shiga, Japan Airlines Flight 2 operated by a Douglas DC-8 accidentally landed in San Francisco Bay approx. short of San Francisco International Airport. The aircraft was recovered after being in the water for 55 hours. There were no injuries to the crew or to any passengers. The probable cause was \\"the improper application of the prescribed procedures to execute an automatic- coupled ILS approach. This deviation from the prescribed procedures was, in part, due to a lack of familiarization and infrequent operation of the installed flight director and autopilot system\\". The aircraft was repaired by United Airlines at San Francisco International Airport and returned to JAL in March 1969. Pilot Kohhei Asoh said that he mistakenly believed that he was landing on the runway when in fact the plane hit the water several hundred yards away. * On 24 June 1969, Kikyo, Japan Airlines Flight 90 operated by a Convair 880 was taking off from runway 32R at Moses Lake Grant County International Airport. The power was reduced on the number four engine during take-off, however, the aircraft continued to yaw to the right until the number four engine struck and slid off the runway. It burst into flames, killing three of the five crew members on board. The probable cause was a \\"delayed corrective action during a simulated critical-engine-out takeoff maneuver resulting in an excessive sideslip from which full recovery could not be effected\\".  1970s   1970-1974  * On 31 March 1970, Yodo, Japan Airlines Flight 351 operated by a Boeing 727 was hijacked by the Japanese Red Army (JRA) while en route from Tokyo to Fukuoka. The nine hijackers released all 122 passengers and seven crew members at Fukuoka Airport and Seoul's Gimpo International Airport, before proceeding to Pyongyang Sunan International Airport, where they surrendered themselves to the North Korean authority. * On 14 June 1972, Akan, Japan Airlines Flight 471 operated by a Douglas DC-8 struck the banks of River Yamuna, about east of New Delhi's Palam International Airport. The crash killed 10 out of 11 crew members, 72 out of 76 passengers on board and 3 people on the ground died, including a famous Brazilian actress Leila Diniz at age 27. With 16 of the dead were Americans. Japanese investigators claimed a false glide path signal was responsible for the descent into terrain, while Indian investigators claimed it was caused by the JAL crew's disregard of laid down procedures and the abandonment of all instrument indications without properly ensuring sighting of the runway. * On 24 September 1972, Haruna, Japan Airlines Flight 472 operated by a Douglas DC-8 en route to Bombay landed at Juhu Airport runway 08, instead of Bombay Airport runway 09. The aircraft overran the runway through a ditch. The visibility at the time was , decreasing to . There were no injuries reported, but the aircraft was written off. * On 6 November 1972, a Japan Airlines Boeing 727 was hijacked at Tokyo International Airport, the hijacker demanded money and to be taken to Cuba. The aircraft was stormed and the hijacker was arrested. * On 28 November 1972, Hida, Japan Airlines Flight 446 operated by a Douglas DC-8 from Tokyo to Moscow, climbed to with a supercritical angle of attack. The aircraft lost height, hit the ground and burst into flames. Nine of the 14 crew members and 52 of the 62 passengers died in the accident. The probable cause was \\"the supercritical angle of attack was caused by either an inadvertent spoiler-extension in flight, or a loss of control following a number one or two engine failure (due to icing)\\". * On 23 July 1973, Japan Air Lines Flight 404 operated by a Boeing 747-200B was hijacked by 4 men and a woman, shortly after leaving Amsterdam. An accidental explosion of the explosive device the woman hijacker was carrying occurred and she was killed. The aircraft was destined for Anchorage but was landed at Dubai and later took off for Damascus and Benghazi. Eventually, all the passengers and crew members were released and the aircraft blown up. * On 12 March 1974, a Japan Airlines Boeing 747 was hijacked at Naha Airport. The hijacker demanded money, but the aircraft was stormed and the hijacker was arrested.  1975-1979  * In February 1975, a Japan Airlines flight from Tokyo to Paris, making fuel stops in Anchorage and Copenhagen, had 196 passengers and one stewardess, out of 343 on board, fall ill with food poisoning, 143 of whom were seriously ill enough to need hospitalising when the plane reached Copenhagen, 30 of those critically ill. The source of the food poisoning was ham contaminated with Staphylococci from the infected cuts on the fingers of a cook in Anchorage. The ham was used in omelettes which were stored at a high temperature on the plane instead of being chilled, allowing time for the bacteria to multiply and produce an exotoxin that is not destroyed by cooking. The head of Japan Airlines catering service in Anchorage committed suicide shortly afterwards and was the only fatality of the incident. It was only luck that the pilots did not eat the omelettes (their body clocks were not in the right time zone for breakfast) and become incapacitated, leading some airlines to forbid pilots eating certain foods on the passenger menu.Barbara A. Munce, \\"Inflight gastroenteritis significance for air crew\\", Cabin Crew Safety, vol. 24, no. 6, p. 2, Flight Safety Foundation, November/December 1989.Lawrence K.

The hijacker demanded money, the aircraft was subsequently stormed and the hijacker was arrested. * On 16 December 1975, Japan Airlines Flight 422 operated by a Boeing 747-200B () slid off the north side of the east-west taxiway at Anchorage International Airport during taxi for a takeoff on runway 06R. The aircraft weathercocked about 70 degrees to the left and slid backward down a snow-covered embankment with an average slope of -13 degrees. The aircraft came to a stop on a heading of 150 degrees on a service road about from, and below, the taxiway surface. * On 5 January 1976, Japan Airlines Flight 768 operated by a Douglas DC-8 was hijacked at Manila Airport. There were two hijackers and they surrendered. * On 13 January 1977, JAL Cargo Flight 8054, a Douglas DC-8 freighter stalled after lift off from Anchorage International Airport and crashed past the runway. The aircraft was on a non-scheduled operation and all five occupants on board, including three crew members and two passengers, were killed. The aircraft began takeoff at the wrong position on the runway and his decision was not questioned by his fellow crew members. The captain's initial blood alcohol level was ; was the legal intoxication limit for the state of Alaska. The probable cause was \\"a stall that resulted from the pilot's control inputs aggravated by airframe icing while the pilot was under the influence of alcohol. Contributing to the cause of this accident was the failure of the other flightcrew members to prevent the captain from attempting the flight\\". * On 27 September 1977, Japan Airlines Flight 715 operated by a Douglas DC-8 from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur struck a hill on approach during a thunderstorm, short of the runway, while on a VOR approach to runway 15. The fatalities for the accident include 8 crew members and 26 passengers. * On 28 September 1977, Japan Airlines Flight 472 operated by a Douglas DC-8 was hijacked by the JRA. The aircraft was en route from Paris to Tokyo with 156 people on board, made a scheduled stop in Bombay. Shortly after taking off from Bombay, five armed JRA members hijacked the aircraft and ordered to be flown to Dacca, Bangladesh. At Dacca (now Dhaka), the hijackers took the passengers and crew hostage, demanding $6 million and the release of nine imprisoned JRA members. A chartered JAL flight carried the money and six of the nine imprisoned JRA members to Dacca, where the exchange took place on October 2. The hijackers released 118 passengers and crew members, and all remaining hostages were freed later. * On 2 June 1978, Japan Airlines Flight 115 operated by a Boeing 747SR suffered a tailstrike while landing at Osaka; two passengers were seriously injured and another 23 suffered minor injuries. Although the aircraft was repaired in June and July 1978, it was lost in 1985 in the crash of Flight 123. * On 23 November 1979, a Japan Airlines McDonnell Douglas DC-10 was hijacked at Osaka International Airport. The hijacker demanded to be taken to the USSR, but was later arrested.  1980s  * On 9 February 1982, Japan Airlines Flight 350 operated by a McDonnell Douglas DC-8 was on scheduled passenger flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo. The aircraft crashed on approach into the shallow water of Tokyo Bay, short of the runway 33R threshold. The nose and the right hand wing separated from the fuselage. Among the 166 passengers and 8 crew, 24 passengers were killed. The report shows that the captain had experienced some form of a mental aberration. He was prosecuted, but he was found not guilty by reason of insanity.https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/03/26/world/history-plane- crashes-pilots.html?_r=0 * On 17 September 1982, Japan Airlines Flight 792 operated by a McDonnell Douglas DC-8 took off from Shanghai at 13:57. Nine minutes later, the crew heard a noise coming from the lower middle part of the aircraft. This was immediately followed by a hydraulic low level warning; a hydraulic reservoir air low pressure warning; a complete loss of hydraulic system pressure; abnormal flap position indications; and a complete loss of air brake pressure. The flight crew decided to return to Shanghai for an emergency landing on runway 36. The aircraft overran the runway and came to a rest in a drainage ditch. * On 12 August 1985, Japan Airlines Flight 123 operated by a Boeing 747SR (the same aircraft aforementioned involved in a tailstrike incident) bound for Osaka, lost all its hydraulic flight control systems shortly after takeoff from Tokyo International Airport and, after attempting to limp back to Tokyo, crashed into Mount Takamagahara near Gunma Prefecture. It was the deadliest single-aircraft disaster in history (and the third deadliest air disaster in history, after the September 11 attacks and the Tenerife airport disaster); 520 out of 524 people on board died, including the famous singer Kyu Sakamoto.  1990s  * On 2 October 1991, a Japan Airlines Boeing 747-200B was climbing through FL165 when the force from a hot liquid released from a burst pipe in the pressurization system, blew a hole in the fuselage beneath the port wing. The captain dumped fuel and returned safely to Tokyo. * On 31 March 1993, Japan Airlines Cargo Flight 46E, a Boeing 747-100 operated by Evergreen International Airlines experienced severe turbulence at an altitude of about after departure about 12:24 local time, resulted in dynamic multi-axis lateral loadings that exceeded the ultimate lateral load-carrying of the number two engine pylon. This caused the number two engine to separate from the aircraft; the number one engine was maintained at emergency/maximum power and the aircraft landed safely back at Anchorage International Airport at 12:45. * On 8 June 1997, Etupirka, Japan Airlines Flight 706 operated by a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 from Hong Kong to Nagoya. As the aircraft was descending through approx. over the Shima Peninsula for an approach to Nagoya, it experienced abrupt and abnormal altitude changes, which injured five passengers and seven crew members. The captain was indicted for an alleged error in piloting the MD-11 aircraft, blamed for the death of a cabin crew member 20 months after the incident. The Nagoya District Court later acquitted the 54-year-old captain, Koichi Takamoto, on 31 July 2004.  2000s  * On 31 January 2001, in the Japan Airlines mid-air incident, Japan Airlines Flight 907 operated by a Boeing 747-400D and Japan Airlines Flight 958 operated by a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 had a near miss incident near Yaizu, Shizuoka. * On 12 November 2001, Japan Airlines Flight 47, operated by a Boeing 747-400 en route to Tokyo from JFK in New York City, produced the wake turbulence that was the initiating factor in the loss of American Airlines Flight 587; this was neither the fault of nor had any effect on the Japan Airlines flight.  2010s  * On 28 October 2018, Japan Airlines pilot Katsutoshi Jitsukawa, 42, was arrested at Heathrow Airport for being under the influence after failing a breath test. He pled guilty to exceeding the alcohol limit on 1 November.

Biography Wybrand de Geest was born and died at Leeuwarden. He learned painting from his father, Simon Juckesz, a stained glass worker. He studied later with Abraham Bloemaert. From 1614 to 1618 he travelled in France and Italy on a Grand Tour. In 1616 he met up with Leonard Bramer in Aix-en-Provence. While in Rome he became a member of the painters' circle known as the Bentvueghels. He earned the nickname 'De Friesche Adelaar', or \\"the Frisian Eagle\\". De Geest married Hendrickje Fransdr Uylenburgh in 1622, a niece of Saskia van Uylenburgh, the wife of Rembrandt. In 1634, just before his own marriage, Rembrandt visited De Geest's studio. In 1636 the Frenchman Charles Ogier, secretary to Cardinal Richelieu visited De Geest, to view his large collection of curiosities and coins. Portraits De Geest was the most important portrait painter of Friesland and painted numerous portraits of the well-to-do citizens of his day, many of which survive in the Fries Museum. Perhaps the most intimate portraits he painted were those of his direct family: File:Wybrand de Geest - Adam Joseph Pynacker.jpg|Adam Pynacker, his son-in-law File:Wybrand de Geest - Eva de Geest.jpg|Eva de Geest, his daughter De Geest influenced Jacob Adriaensz Backer, and his students were Jan Jansz. de Stomme, and Jacob Potma. His sons Julius and Frank also became painters. His grandson Wybrand wrote plays, a travel guide to Rome, and published \\"Het Kabinet der Statuen\\" (1702).

The campaign sought to pass smoking bans in public places as well as ban cigarettes themselves.  History  The group was founded in 1899 by Lucy Page Gaston, a teacher, writer, lecturer and member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Gaston maintained that cigarette smoking was a \\"dangerous new habit, particularly threatening to the young and thus likely to lead to the use of alcohol and narcotics, so prevalent in the 1890s.\\" Gaston's mission attracted the attention and the patronage of like-minded progressives and members of the WCTU. By 1901 the organization claimed a membership of 300,000, with a paid staff overseeing chapters throughout the United States and Canada. Physician Daniel H. Kress was vice-president of the Anti-Cigarette League. Between 1890 and 1930, 15 states enacted laws banning the sale, manufacture, possession, or use of cigarettes, and 22 other states considered such legislation. Even the legislature of the tobacco-producing state of North Carolina considered cigarette prohibition laws in 1897, 1901, 1903, 1905, 1911, 1913, and again in 1917. Eventually, all the states repealed their cigarette prohibition laws and associated smoking bans in most public places. Kansas was the last to do so, in 1927.

However, its provenance is uncertain,Gonz√°lez de Alba, Luis. \\"El penacho de un pobre diablo\\", en el peri√≥dico La Jornada, versi√≥n electr√≥nica. and even its identity as a headdress has been questioned.Rodr√≠guez, Ana M√≥nica. \\"El penacho de Moctezuma es una capa de sacerdote, afirma un investigador\\", La Jornada, versi√≥n electr√≥nica It is made of quetzal and other feathers with sewn-on gold detailing. It is now in the Museum of Ethnology, Vienna, and is a source of dispute between Austria and Mexico, as no similar pieces remain in Mexico. Restoration efforts reignited this dispute in 2012. Description The feathers of the piece have deteriorated over the centuries. It is high and across and has the form of concentric layers of different colored feathers arranged in a semicircle. The smallest is made from blue feathers of the Cotinga amabilis (xiuht≈çt≈çtl) with small plates of gold in the shapes of half moons. Behind this is a layer of Roseate spoonbill (tlƒÅuhquech≈çlli) feathers, then small quetzal feathers, then a layer of white-tipped red-brown feathers of the squirrel cuckoo, Piaya cayana, with three bands of small gold plates, and finally two of 400 closely spaced quetzal tail feathers, some long. The quetzal feathers in the center of the headdress are raised relative to the sides. Leather straps attach the crown to the head of the wearer. History Although attributed to Moctezuma and the Spanish conquest, the provenance of the piece is unattested, and it does not match Aztec illustrations of the headdress of their nobility. It became an object of interest to European researchers such as Ferdinand von Hochstetter and Eduard Seler at the end of the 19th century, and its identification as a quetzalapanecayotl is attributed to American anthropologist Zelia Nuttall.Zelia Nuttall:Sur le quetzal- apanecaiotl ou coiffure Mexicaine en plumes conserv√©e √† Vienne. En: Congr√®s International des Am√©ricanistes, Paris 1890. Paris 1892. S. 453-459 It was restored in 1878, while still thought to be a mantle rather than a headdress. It is attested since 1575 in the collections of Archduke Ferdinand in Ambras near Innsbruck, Austria. At the beginning of the 19th century it was deposited in the Museum of Ethnology (inventory number 10402VO) in Vienna along with other liturgical artifacts of Quetzalcoatl and Ehecatl.

Henrique (1394-1460) during the Portuguese period of discovery. Following his exploration into the western Atlantic in the area of Newfoundland, in 1452 he discovered the western islands of the archipelago of the Azores: for his efforts he was appointed Donatary for the islands of Flores and Corvo. Donat√°rio On 1 January 1451, he disembarked on the island of Terceira in the Azores from which he made his base. He realized two voyages of exploration to the west of the archipelago (which then only included the Central and Eastern Groups). In 1452, at the end of his second voyage, he discovered the islands of Flores and Corvo, which he initially believed were a new archipelago, naming them the Ilhas Floreira (or literally, the Flowered Islands), due to the abundance of flowering plants.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.30 On 5 December 1452, for his discovery, he was given a concession in the sugar cane industry on the island of Madeira by Infante D. Henrique. Some historians claim that he was responsible for the disappearance of the first Captain-Major of the Captaincy of Flores, although unproven. Later life By 1472, he had settled in Ribeira Brava, and along with his son (Jo√£o de Teive) maintained the donatary rights to the islands until 1474, when D. Fern√£o Teles de Meneses (married to D. Maria de Vilhena) bought those rights over the islands. The Teive family and their descendants have had an important history in the community of Ribeira Brava, including: Gaspar de Teive (16th Century), D.

The lake, which was once a drinking water source for the neighbourhood, now has water for most part of the year and is a haven for birds. According to Care Earth Trust, a city-based biodiversity research organisation, about 40 different species of birds have been sighted in the lake along with the Ambattur and Korattur lakes. Among them are the common tailorbird, the purple-rumped sunbird and the Asian openbill stork, a migratory bird. The lake, which was in a state of neglect for several decades, gets inflows from Red Hills reservoir and Korattur lake.

Biography Jan van Bijlert was born in Utrecht, the son of the stained glass worker Herman Beernts van Bijlert. He may have had some training by his father. Subsequently, he became a student of Abraham Bloemaert. Like other painters from Utrecht, he travelled in France and Italy. In 1621 he was, along with Cornelis van Poelenburch and Willem Molijn, a founding member of the circle of Dutch and Flemish artists in Rome known as the Bentvueghels. It was the custom among the Bentvueghels to adopt a nickname. Van Bijlert's nickname was \\"Aeneas\\". By 1625, he had returned to Utrecht, where he married and joined the schutterij. In 1630, he became a member of the Utrecht Guild of St. Luke and the Reformed church. During the years 1632-1637 he was active as deacon of the guild, and in 1634 he was appointed regent of the Sint-Jobsgasthuis. In 1639, he helped form a painter's school, the \\"Schilders-College\\", where he served as regent. He died in Utrecht.Jan van Bijlert at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Work Courtesan The Concert (1630s) Jan van Bijlert was a very prolific painter who left some 200 pictures. Upon his return from Rome he, like other Utrecht artists who had come under the influence of Caravaggio's work, painted in a style derived from that of Caravaggio. These Utrecht artists are referred to as the Utrecht Caravaggisti. The Caravaggesque style of van Bijlert's early paintings shows itself in the use of strong chiaroscuro, the cutting off of the picture plane to create a close-up image and the realism of the representation. Van Bijlert continued to paint in this style throughout the 1620s.Paul Huys Janssen. \\"Bijlert, Jan van.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 13 Jul. 2014. Around 1630, van Bijlert turned to a more classicising style, possibly under the influence of Cornelis van Poelenburgh. His colours became lighter and his subject matter became more elevated such as religious scenes. In the 1630s he also painted compositions with small figures, usually representing genre scenes of brothels or musical gatherings. These works were similar to those of the Utrecht painter Jacob Duck. Van Bijlert also painted the portraits of eminent citizens of Utrecht such as burgomasters and nobles. His pupils included Bartram de Fouchier, Ludolf Leendertsz de Jongh, Johannes de Veer, Mattheus Wijtmans and Abraham Willaerts. Gallery File:Caspar by Jan van Bijlert.jpg|Caspar.

The third game in the Fable series, the story focuses on the player character's struggle to overthrow the King of Albion, the player character's brother, by forming alliances and building support for a revolution. After a successful revolt, the player becomes the monarch and is tasked with attempting to defend Albion from a great evil. The game includes voice acting by Ben Kingsley (Sabine), Stephen Fry (Reaver), Simon Pegg (Ben Finn), Naomie Harris (Page), Michael Fassbender (Logan), Zo√´ Wanamaker (Theresa), Bernard Hill (Sir Walter Beck), Nicholas Hoult (Elliot), John Cleese (Jasper), Johnathan Ross (Barry Hatch), Kellie Bright (Hero of Brightwall female), and Louis Tamone (Hero of Brightwall male). The game was released on 29 October 2010 for Xbox 360 and on 20 May 2011 for PC via both Games for Windows and Steam. The PC version includes a Hardcore mode and 3D functionality not found in the Xbox 360 version. Gameplay The player controls the Royal Hero on their adventure to usurp the current monarch and to then manage the kingdom. While progressing along the main story, the player will have to make impactful decisions that will reflect their standing among their subjects, and which will also have consequences in the future that the player must address. A morality system divides most actions as either \\"good\\" or \\"evil,\\" with good-aligned actions generally expressing generosity, kindness, and forgiveness, whereas evil-aligned actions represent selfishness, greed, and cruelty. Most moral decisions are prompted by dialogue branches, but the player's standing will also be influenced by side quests and how frequently they commit crimes, such as robbery or murder. Combat encounters are frequent. The Royal Hero has three main methods of attack: a melee attack, a ranged attack, and magic. The player can customize each of these attacks with different weapons, such as choosing between a sword or hammer as a melee weapon, or the capability of combining two types of spells. Attacks can be held and charged in order to unleash powerful flourishes, at the cost of making the player stationary. Critical hits will put the player and their target into a unique kill animation based on the weapon used and the enemy type being attacked. Over the course of the game, the player will increase their weapons' capabilities. Weapons also change shape and design based on the actions of the player. The Royal Hero is joined by a pet dog that can be named by the player. The dog will travel alongside the Royal Hero and can be played with, pet, and talked down to. While exploring, the dog can guide the player to treasure chests or point out buried secrets, and they will growl if enemies are ahead. The dog will also assist in combat, primarily in ripping out the throats of downed enemies, but additional tricks can be learned to improve the dog's capabilities. Instead of a conventional pause menu, Fable III brings the player to the Sanctuary, a hub location that the Royal Hero physically walks through. While in the Sanctuary, the player is safe from combat and can access their weapons, costumes, achievements, save files, and system settings. A map is also available, allowing the player to fast travel across the world, view available quests, and manage their properties. Gold is an important aspect of the game, especially in the second half of the story where the player is expected to raise around 6.5 million gold before war begins. Money can be earned in many methods. Items and treasures can be pawned at pawnshops, and as prices fluctuate, it's possible to earn a profit on items by buying low and selling high. Virtually every shop and home can be bought by the player, which will then earn the player passive income every five minutes (home properties must be rented out to tenants in order to receive rent). These properties can be repaired, and furniture found through the game can be used to decorate homes. The player can also partake in jobs which play out as basic mini-games, earning multiples more money for extended win streaks. Relationships can also be explored if the player so chooses. If an NPC is in friendly relations with the Royal Hero, the player can choose to develop a romantic relationship, if the NPC's sexuality is compatible. The player can marry and have children, as well as divorce and end relationships. Synopsis Setting Fable III takes place on the fictional continent of Albion, 50 years after the events of Fable II. The player character of the previous game, the \\"Hero of Bowerstone\\", became ruler of Albion and forged a new kingdom with Bowerstone as its capital. As a result, the kingdom has begun entering an industrial age, where large-scale resource gathering and factories have become commonplace. Alongside Albion, the game also includes the foreign land of Aurora, a desert region that is struggling to rebuild after a devastating event. Plot Following the death of their father, the youngest child of the Hero of Bowerstone (the Royal Hero) lives within the capital's palace alongside their love interest and their older brother Logan, the new king of Albion. While attending to chores, the young sibling overhears rumours that Logan has changed over the last four years of his rule, becoming excessively tyrannical, to the point that they recently executed a citizen of Albion for a minor crime. Upon seeing their love interest trying to prevent Logan killing a group of citizens that had come to protest his rule, the Royal Hero is left with the choice of sacrificing either the group or their love interest against their will. That night, after their decision, the Royal Hero is advised by their mentor, Sir Walter Beck, to escape with him and plot the downfall of Logan due to his actions. Joined by their butler Jasper, the Royal Hero flees from the castle. While escaping into an hidden passage, the group find themselves entering the former king's hidden dimension and decide to make use of it, with Jasper remaining to aid the hero from within it. During this time, the Royal Hero encounters Theresa, the enigmatic Seeress of the Spire alongside their distant and ancient relative, who foresees them becoming the new ruler and saving Albion from a terrible fate. Guided by her, alongside Walter, the young hero begins seeking out allies across Albion and gains help from several people they meet: Sabine, leader of the mountain nomadic community known as the \\"Dwellers\\", a nomadic community that lives in the mountains; Major Swift and Ben Finn, soldiers from the Royal Army; and Page, leader of the \\"Bowerstone Resistance\\". Just as the group seem ready to make moves for a revolution, Logan catches wind of his sibling's actions and captures Swift, promptly executing him for treason. Branded as traitors, the Royal Hero and his allies go into exile. At Walter's suggestion, the group travel to Aurora, a desert region across the ocean, and form an alliance with Kalin, the leader of Aurora. While attempting to gain Kalin's support, the group learn about a creature called the Crawler which led the forces of the Darkness into devastating the desert land, and discover that Logan's actions were due to his discovery of this information and the fact that the creature will soon attempt to attack the Kingdom of Albion and exterminate all life. Theresa confirms that the threat is real, but points out that Logan is not capable enough of confronting it, making clear that the Royal Hero must intervene and remove him from the throne. With Kalin's full support, the group launch their revolution against Logan, successfully overthrowing him and appointing the Royal Hero as the next monarch. In their first rule, the Royal Hero is left the choice of executing Logan for his crimes, or pardoning him for acting in Albion's defense against the Crawler. By this point, the Royal Hero learns that they have a year to raise around 6.5 million gold in order to finance an army to defend Albion against the Crawler and its forces. As ruler, they soon face several challenges to determine how to raise the money needed, leading to tough decisions on whether to do the right thing and improve people's lives, fulfill promises to allies, or exploit resources and turn their back on those that supported them in order to focus on raising funds, with the Royal Hero able to invest their own personal funds to the kingdom's treasury. Eventually, after a year has passed, the Royal Hero finds themselves leading what forces they have managed to amass in defending Albion, by holding back against the Crawler's forces. However, the battle leads to Walter being possessed, forcing the Royal Hero to kill him in order to defeat the Crawler. The main story concludes with the Royal Hero left in charge of Albion, and dealing with the consequences of their decisions as monarch and any casualties caused during the battle. Development At the beginning of the Gamescon announcement of Fable III, Molyneux stated that the game was taking a different theme compared to the others as he believes the third game in a series to be hard to do correctly. \\"If all the rules have been established and all you offer is a new story and a handful of locations, people will start to lose interest.\\" In an interview with OXM UK, Molyneux spoke about how Fable was at risk of becoming a generic game where the player started off underpowered and weak but slowly got more powerful after they met the bad guy. After the player killed the bad guy, the credits would roll. Believing that is the formula that applies to many games, he asked why games \\"end at potentially the most exciting bit?\\" It was this that formed the basis of Fable III, where the player can overthrow the tyrant before becoming ruler themselves. He stated that it was when the player was ruler that the consequences of \\"who you are going to be, are you going to be good or evil, cruel or kind\\" stopped applying only to the player, but affected the entire country. Molyneux hinted that there may be drawbacks to leaving a player's castle too often to investigate crimes or fight wars, asking: Talking about the inspiration for Fable III, Molyneux said \\"if in Fable I the inspiration was folklore and in Fable II the inspiration was King Arthur and Robin Hood, then Fable III is definitely the rebels and monarchs ‚Äì both modern-day and historic.\\" There are also new takes on traditional Fable concepts such as morphing, where the player's weapon changes depending on what they do, and their alignment. If the Hero kills large numbers of skeletons their weapon will appear to be made of bones, whereas if they go around killing innocent people their weapon will begin to drip with blood. The weapon would also level throughout the game, making it sharper and more deadly. Another example is the \\"Extreme Emote\\" system. For example, if someone angers the Hero, they can show them their true nature, with either demonic or angelic wings sprouting out of their back. Lionhead Studios associate sound producer Georg Backer announced that Fable III would contain over 47 hours of recorded speech. This rises from 36 hours of recorded speech in Fable II. Backer said that the AI is the \\"biggest chunk of dialogue\\". Backer also said that the over 47 hours include \\"gossip lines\\" in which the \\"AI talk to you about what is happening in the game.\\" The \\"30 or 40\\" different types of AI characters each have \\"about 2,000 lines\\". Three writers wrote the 460,000 recorded words in the game and it took more than 80 actors to voice them. Many lines are the ones that previously appeared in Fable II, so how many hours of vocal track are original recordings is unknown. Marketing Shortly before Gamescom 2009, images of famous revolutionaries and quotations appeared on Lionhead's website, causing discussion about what the next game Lionhead was developing. During the press conference of Gamescom, where Fable III was announced by Peter Molyneux, Lionhead had decorated the walls with medieval shields and banners. Lionhead announced in August 2010 that there would be a companion game to Fable III. Peter Molyneux was quick to say that it would not be like Pub Games for Fable 2 and hinted that it would utilise a mobile phone. The official reveal was made on 28 September 2010 for a smartphone application titled \\"Kingmaker\\". The game consists of players marking real-world locations for the two factions in the game, the Royals or the Rebels. The game earns players power-ups and gold to use in Fable III. The game was announced for use in the United Kingdom and Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden. Various downloadable content has been announced by Microsoft, ranging from dyes and extra hairstyles to new quests. Retail editions The Xbox 360 standard and limited edition was released on 29 October 2010, with the PC version released in May 2011. Xbox games that were preordered (both standard and limited editions) in participating stores, were given a code for a special weapon, a code for tattoos, and a code to transfer the villager created from the Villager Maker to the game on the release date. * Xbox 360 - The Standard Edition available on Xbox 360 contains the standard game disk, a game manual and standard plastic casing. Lionhead Studios' Peter Molyneux announced as well, that Fable III would also (like Fable II) be released in episodes on Xbox Live Marketplace, some time after the retail version hit the market. The first episode was available free of charge. * PC Both a retail version and a downloadable release (via Games for Windows Live) were available. * Xbox 360 - The \\"Limited Collector's Edition\\" contains a standard game disk, a game manual, a new in-game quest, limited edition Fable III playing cards, a \\"Guild Seal Coin\\" with good and evil sides to aid the player in making moral decisions, a new \\"Boxer\\" dog breed and two new outfits; one for male, one female, a faux book and a new region with a family and a new weapon. * PC - All Standard Editions of Fable III on PC have contents of the Limited Collector's Edition included for free in the game. Controller Lionhead also released a Fable III limited edition wireless controller for Xbox 360 on 5 October 2010. The controller came with a code to unlock a unique tattoo for the game. Fable: Coin Golf A mini-game called Fable: Coin Golf developed by Ideaworks Game Studio, in close conjunction with Lionhead, was released for Windows Phone 7 on 30 March 2011. Played from an overhead perspective, the quest is to rid the land of evil and conquer each area by getting the Hero Puck into the Pillar of Light in as few shots as possible. Gold earned on the phone can be transferred to Fable III on Xbox 360 or PC and completion of each of the three chapters unlocks a unique weapon in Fable III. Books Three books titled Fable: The Balverine Order, Fable: Edge of the World, and Fable: Blood Ties were released in North America and Europe in October 2010 and October 2011 respectively. The books came with DLC codes. The Balverine Order had a code for a unique weapon called the Shardborne sword while Blood Ties had a code for an exclusive Dye Pack. Both of these items were for Fable III. Reception Fable III received a generally positive critical reception. IGN gave the Xbox 360 version an 8.5/10, praising the final segment of the game involving the player's role as a monarch, but criticising its slow beginning and a lack of innovation. GameSpot gave the game a 7.5/10, saying \\"This gorgeous world is brimming with humor and personality\\" but felt \\"a bevy of technical problems and oversimplified gameplay distract from the fun.\\" Official Xbox Magazine said \\"Fable III is most memorable not because it makes you laugh, but because it also makes you care. If a spouse gets carved up in your absence, you'll feel pangs of guilt. When your dog saves your bacon during a fight, you'll feel pride.\\" The PC version of Fable III received more mixed reviews. IGN' gave Fable III a 6/10, calling it \\"a royal disappointment\\" with \\"interface not well tailored to the PC platform\\", \\"uneven story and pacing\\", \\"dull combat\\" and \\"repetitive quests\\". GameSpot gave it a score of 7/10, saying \\"It lands on the PC with graphical enhancements and tougher combat\\" but criticised the \\"simplified gameplay\\" which \\"still distract from the fun.\\" References External links * Category:2010 video games Category:Action role-playing video games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Fable (video game series) Category:Games for Windows certified games Category:Lionhead Studios games Category:Microsoft games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Video games featuring protagonists of selectable gender Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games with alternate endings Category:Video games with stereoscopic 3D graphics Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox One X enhanced games Category:Xbox One games ","title":"Fable III"}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:T}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},B={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your ETHü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",B,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),b(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(x,[["render",I]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/12.md","filePath":"people/12.md"}'),P={name:"people/12.md"},L=Object.assign(P,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[A(R)]))}});export{D as __pageData,L as default};
