The former is slightly bigger with roughly 100 inhabitants, whereas about 80 people call Lammersdorf home.Information from Hierzuland  History  In 1301, Dohm had its first documentary mention when the knight Fridericus von Daun (or Dohm) was enfeoffed by the Archbishopric of Trier with Castle Manderscheid, where he was to perform services. In the earlier half of the 13th century, one of his forebears, Heinrich von Daun, who had been a marshal in Count of Luxembourg, Duke Walram von Limburg‚Äôs service, had acquired the Luxembourgish lordship over Densborn, which included Dohm and Lammersdorf, right up until the time of French rule, as a Luxembourgish lower lordship. Of the castle itself, little remains but a 4 m-high and 20 m-long quarrystone wall, although written reports from the time say that there were still castle ruins in 1758. It is believed that in 1528, Pr√ºm Abbey drew tithes from Dohm and Lammersdorf through its holding of Densborn. The Lords of Densborn (and then beginning in 1654, the Electoral-Trier chancellor Johann von Anethan and his heirs) held the high, middle and low jurisdiction here as well as the hunting and fishing rights. The Trier Cathedral Capitulary, Baron Johann Sigismund Otto von Quadt called himself ‚Äúa lord of Dohm and Lammersdorf‚Äù in an inscription under a coat of arms in a M√ºrlenbach church window in 1720. It is unknown how he was related to the lordly family. The lordly landholdings in Dohm and Lammersdorf were divided in 1758 among four leaseholders, who in return were obliged each year ‚Äúto deliver 2 Malter 1 Sester of rye, 4 Malter 6 Sester of oats, 4 Malter 6 Sester of spelt and 3 pounds of flax as rent‚Äù. Furthermore, they were also ‚Äúbound to various statute labours and performances‚Äù. The Luxembourgish lordship over Densborn also meant that the Catholic faith was maintained in Dohm and Lammersdorf in the late 14th and early 15th centuries, whereas the rest of the Parish of Gerolstein turned from the Church.Article by Professor Matthias Weber  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat  Culture and sightseeing   Buildings  * Saint Remigius‚Äôs Catholic Church (branch church), Hauptstra√üe 3, aisleless church, 18th century, tower partly Romanesque, upper parts 1862, sandstone shaft cross from 1846, about 15 grave crosses from the 17th to 19th centuries. * Hauptstra√üe ‚Äì remnants of a castle site. * Hauptstra√üe/corner of Tannenweg ‚Äì wayside cross in a niche, 16th century. * Wayside cross ‚Äì just north of the village on the road to Hillesheim, shaft cross from 1777. * Wayside cross ‚Äì southwest of the village on the road to Gerolstein, Baroque sandstone shaft cross, latter half of 18th or early 19th century. * Saint Luke‚Äôs Catholic Church (branch church), Kapellenweg, quire tower from the Late Middle Ages, monaxial aisleless church, 1795, Lammersdorf.Directory of Cultural Monuments in Vulkaneifel district * Parish hall All sites listed above are in Dohm, unless otherwise noted.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Daun, whose seat is in the like-named town.  Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. The village centre in Dreis sits at an elevation of 477 m above sea level, while Br√ºck's elevation, also at the village centre, is 520 m above sea level. The municipality stretches over 1 818 ha all together, 820 ha of which is wooded. Several peaks surround the dale in which the municipality's two centres lie, which is also crossed by six streams.  Constituent communities  Dreis- Br√ºck's Ortsteile are, as its hyphenated name implies, Dreis and Br√ºck.  History  The time in which Dreis was founded is shrouded in darkness. Its beginnings would seem to stretch back to Carolingian times. In 1143, Dreis had its first documentary mention. The placename ‚ÄúDreis‚Äù is obviously derived from the Old High German word triusan (‚Äúbubble‚Äù, ‚Äúgush‚Äù). The name underwent many changes over the centuries. In the 16th century, besides Dreis, also Dreys and Dreyss were to be found. In the 17th century, alongside Drey√ü, the forms Drei√ü and Driest also cropped up, the last of which even appeared once as Dryesd in the 18th century. Spellings such as Dress, Dreyss or Dreys also are to be found. Br√ºck had its first documentary mention only in the 14th century. The two then separate municipalities once belonged to the Counts of Manderscheid, who held the County of Kerpen, and eventually ended up with the Duchy of Arenberg after an hereditary division of holdings. On 23 August 1945, shortly after the Second World War had ended, the war claimed three more victims locally. Three youths, Helmut Keul, Ernst Josef Probst and Werner Ullrich, went to the Dreis munitions depot to undertake the disarming of the weapons there, left over from the war. Their efforts resulted in a tremendous explosion that killed all three of them. A memorial cross now stands near the site. In a written announcement from 28 August 1968, the Daun Amt and town administration stated ‚Äúthe proposal for a fourth law about administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate presented at the Landtag and already consulted in First Reading provides for the local area the amalgamation of, among others, the localities of ‚Ä¶ Dockweiler, Dreis and possibly also Br√ºck‚Äù. The Dockweiler municipal administration was quite strongly interested in a merger of the municipalities of Dockweiler and Dreis, and possibly also Br√ºck and Betteldorf, and its official plan reflected as much. The plan eventually failed after consensus could not be forged. On 20 April 1969 the Mainz Ministry of the Interior published a decree about the formation of Verbandsgemeinden in the Regierungsbezirke of Koblenz and Trier. The Daun district administrator's office took the decree further within the district of Daun (since 1 January 2007 the district of Vulkaneifel) with the plan, among others, to assign the municipality of Br√ºck to the Verbandsgemeinde of Kelberg. This move was rejected by both the citizenry and the municipal council. On 19 May 1970, the Dreis municipal council decided between the two alternatives: * to dissolve both municipalities and form a new municipality out of what had been until then the municipalities of Dreis and Br√ºck * to amalgamate the municipality of Br√ºck into the municipality of Dreis. The citizens of Br√ºck decided, with 99.33% in favour, to amalgamate themselves with Dreis, as long as the name Br√ºck was retained. On 20 December 1973 came the dissolution of the municipality of Br√ºck, whereupon it was amalgamated with the municipality of Dreis with effect from 16 March 1974. In February 1974 the municipalities‚Äô two councils had concluded a settlement and had decided on a merger. On 15 August 1977, the Trier Regierungsbezirk administration granted the municipality of Dreis the new name Dreis-Br√ºck. The name change came into force on 1 September 1977.  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Municipal election ‚Äúresults‚Äù  Coat of arms  The municipality's arms might be described thus: Argent a fountain issuant from whose top two streams, one each to dexter and sinister and each splitting into three, all azure, issuant from base a bridge arched of three sable, in a chief gules three roses Or seeded of the fourth. The arms were designed by Friedbert Wi√ükirchen (Daun Verbandsgemeinde administration). The chief refers to the two centres‚Äô history. They were held by the Counts of Manderscheid, who held the County of Kerpen, and eventually ended up with the Duchy of Arenberg after an hereditary division of holdings. The Dukes of Arenberg bore three roses in their seal. The tinctures Or and gules (gold and red) are those once borne by the Counts of Manderscheid. The arched bridge in base is a canting charge and stands for the name Br√ºck, which closely resembles the German word for ‚Äúbridge‚Äù: Br√ºcke. The fountain also refers to part of the name ‚Äì Drees ‚Äì from the Old High German (although it hardly resembles the modern German word for ‚Äúfountain‚Äù: Brunnen). Moreover, the fountain also refers to the municipality's status as the site of a state-recognized health spring, the ‚ÄúVulkania Quelle‚Äù in Dreis. The Trier Regierungsbezirk administration granted the municipality approval to bear arms in 1986.  Culture and sightseeing   Old house names  Many older houses in Dreis-Br√ºck have names that have nothing to do with the owners who live in them today. The names come partly from former owners‚Äô names or occupations, but some also draw their names from former uses to which each building was put. Further names also come from various events.

The pair of antlers (‚Äúattires‚Äù) surrounding the cross is one of Saint Hubert‚Äôs attributes, thus making it a reference to the patron saint of the village and of its church. The wavy line of partition symbolizes the many streams found in the area.Description and explanation of Duppach‚Äôs arms  Culture and sightseeing   Buildings  The current graveyard chapel dates back to the year 1330 and is one of the Eifel‚Äôs oldest churches. In 1926, the larger Baroque Revival Saint Hubert Church (St. Hubertus-Kirche) was built, as the older building was no longer large enough to suit the needs of the parish. Since its destruction in the Second World War, all that is left of the 14th-century church today is the chancel which is used as a graveyard chapel. In the 1950s, the AEG electrical company had a retirement home built in the Duppacher Wald (forest around Duppach) for Konrad Adenauer, who was Chancellor of Germany at the time. However, once the press heard of this corruption and reported it, work on the house was stopped. The half-finished house still stands in the woods and has been falling to ruins ever since.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Daun, whose seat is in the like-named town.  Geography   Location  Ellscheid lies on the Pulvermaar (\\"Powder Maar\\") in the middle of the Volcanic Eifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. The M√ºrmes nature conservation area is a well known outing destination. The M√ºrmes is a wetland area between Ellscheid, Saxler and Mehren.  History  Clear signs of what might have been the first permanent settlement of the area are the Celtic barrows around Ellscheid (Starkenbruch, Rothreiser, Jungholz‚Äö H√ºgelchen). These graves come from the early Iron Age, Hallstatt times in the 7th century BC. The best known Celtic remnant, though, is the ringwall on the Steineberger Ley some 4 km away. Beginning about 400 BC, the Celts migrated away from the region, leaving the land to the Treveri, and then about 20 BC, the Romans came. The Eifel belonged to the province of Gallia Belgica. The Romans were followed in the 5th century by a Germanic tribe, the Franks, who moved into the Eifel using the Romans‚Äô own roads. Roman rule ended. The population did not become much denser until about 900, during which time Hedelscheit (now Ellscheid) came into being. The name Ellscheid points to a founding sometime in the second wave of Frankish settlement between 800 and 1200, as the villages that arose in the first wave generally have names ending in ‚Äîfeld or ‚Äîrath. The Franks liked to settle on sheltered slopes near water. Ellscheid might have arisen in the rural area now known as Struthsuhr, where wall remnants have been found. According to the Ellscheid school chronicle, the village there, at the foot of the Seidenklopp, was sacked and destroyed by the French in the Thirty Years' War. The slope sheltered it from the cold north wind and the site had water from the nearby Laubach. After the village was destroyed by the French, the villagers fled to the area known as Hunzestall, which lies off to the side in a side valley of the M√ºrmes. In two deep trenches that can still be seen today, the villagers and their livestock are said to have lived through this hard time. Thereafter, the village was built anew, this time on the spot where it still stands now. Its focal point was apparently the estate (the former Saxlerhaus), about which the new houses gathered. The name itself refers to the location. Hedelscheit was mentioned in the Urkundenbuch zur Geschichte der jetzt die preu√üischen Regierungsbezirke Coblenz und Trier bildenden mittelrheinischen Territorien (‚ÄúDocument Book about the History of the Middle-Rhenish Territories Now Forming the Prussian Governmental Regions of Coblenz and Trier‚Äù) by Heinrich Beyer, in which Beyer stated that Hedelscheit had belonged in 1136 to the holdings of the Foundation of ‚ÄúOur Lady at Pr√ºm‚Äù. This Hedelscheit is apparently the origin of the modern-day Ellscheid. Hedelscheit is made up of two words. Hedel means ‚Äúalder‚Äù and Scheit comes from the old Celtic word keito-n, meaning ‚Äúwood‚Äù or ‚Äúforest‚Äù (cf. Welsh coedwig and Breton koadeg). Therefore, freely translated, the name Hedelscheit means ‚ÄúAlderwood‚Äù (or Erlenwald as it would commonly be expressed in German). On the wet valley floodplain, there might quite possibly once have been a natural alder wood, at whose edge the first Ellscheiders might have settled. When this might have happened, though, is hardly traceable.Ellscheid‚Äôs history  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per bend sinister argent a cross tau, hanging from each arm a bell, gules, and azure three fish fesswise in bend sinister of the first. The T-shaped cross is Saint Anthony‚Äôs attribute, and is thus a reference to the village‚Äôs and the church‚Äôs patron saint. It is shown here with two bells, a bell also being one of Saint Anthony‚Äôs attributes. The three fish stand for the three Electoral fishing ponds within Ellscheid‚Äôs limits (M√ºrmesweiher, Finkenweiher and Mittelweiher). The villagers were once obliged to do compulsory labour for the Elector by catching fish and cleaning the ponds.Description and explanation of Ellscheid‚Äôs arms  Culture and sightseeing   Archaeology  In Ellscheid, the foundations of a Roman villa rustica have been unearthed. Many barrows are to be found around Ellscheid. The biggest, cone-shaped tumuli lie in the ‚ÄúStarkenbruch‚Äù. These Celtic gravesites stand about two metres high and have a circumference of some 30 m. They might have been Celtic princes‚Äô graves, as they stand at one of the highest points in the area. They can easily be spotted in the woods. The barrows in the ‚ÄúRothreisern‚Äù are not quite as mighty. These graves come from the early Iron Age, Hallstatt times in the 6th century BC.

Feusdorf's area is 442 ha all together, of which cropfields and open water make up 78 ha, greenbelt and heath 203 ha, private property 26 ha, woods 105 ha, public roadways 26 ha and other lands 4 ha. Flurbereinigung was undertaken in 1968.‚ÄúFigures‚ÄîDates‚ÄîFacts‚Äù Feusdorf lies at an elevation of 450 to 565 m above sea level.Feusdorf‚Äôs elevation  History  The municipality's name has been written several ways over the centuries: Feu√üdorf (1373), Freuhsdorp (1555), Freu√üdorff (1558), Feurstorf (1658), Feustorf (1704), Feustorff (1720), Feurstorp (1729), Feu√üdorf (1775) and finally Feusdorf (1822). In 1373 Feusdorf had its first documentary mention as Feu√üdorf. This comes from a seal, now in the Koblenz State Archive, used by Clais (Nikolaus) von Feu√üdorf, who was the Burgmann at Junckeroide (J√ºnkerath). In 1477 Wilhelm von Mirbach was enfeoffed with an estate at Feusdorf by the Duke of J√ºlich and Berk. In 1491, Count Johann von Manderscheid enfeoffed Nikolaus Gyse von Mertloch with several castle houses at Gerolstein and with half a house at Feusdorf. In 1543, in connection with the clergyman Johann Schnyder's introduction into Esch, the Servatiuskapelle (‚ÄúSaint Servatius‚Äôs Chapel‚Äù) in Feusdorf was mentioned for the first time. In 1604, Philipp Roist von Weers was enfeoffed with holdings at Feusdorf by Count Arnold von Manderscheid. In 1631 Threin (Katharina) Heunen, a woman from Feusdorf, was burnt alive in Esch as a witch. In 1809 some brave men from the Mayoralty of Lissendorf opposed Napoleon's call to serve in his army. One of these men, named Linck, was from Feusdorf. After his house was searched, turning up four rifles, he was arrested, and shortly thereafter, along with four others, he was sentenced to death by shooting. The sentence was carried out on 23 January 1810 in Pr√ºm. In 1843 Feusdorf and H√ºtte J√ºnkerath together had 21 houses and 175 inhabitants. In 1848, three houses and the chapel all burnt down, but were built again on the same sites. In 1866, many villagers came down with typhus, and the sickness claimed seven lives. For its part, the district council (Kreistag) granted the municipality 25 Thaler for those who suffered typhus. In 1876 the first school building was opened on Escher Stra√üe, coming complete with a teacher's dwelling. In 1880, there were 40 houses in Feusdorf. Two years later, in 1882, came a year of catastrophe. The harvest was so scant that without the state's and the province's help, a famine emergency would have had to be declared. In 1888, 54 children were attending school, 26 boys and 28 girls, although 10 of these children came from J√ºnkerath. Within a year, though, a new school also opened there, and these ten thereafter went there for their schooling. In 1893 half-day schooling was introduced so that children could help with farmwork. The craftsmen's association was founded. This body's goal was to actively support members who were left without a livelihood by illness or accidents. Support was to begin with the onset of an illness and was set at two marks weekly. In 1889 a heavy storm on 18 and 19 January damaged many roofs in Feusdorf, even leaving one house's roof on a neighbour's dungheap. In late February 1900 diphtheria broke out among the schoolchildren. Two of them, Gotthard May, 7, and Margareta Leyendecker, 9, quickly succumbed to this illness. The school was closed forthwith and lessons did not begin again for a fortnight. Another disaster befell the local steelworks that same year. On 10 May, a pan full of molten steel tipped over, spilling its contents over 25 moulders who were on the job that evening. Six of them died of their injuries, although none of these was from Feusdorf. On 10 February 1923 Feusdorf was connected to the electricity network. It was the first village in the Daun district (now called the Vulkaneifel district) to have electrical service. In 1925, a census yielded a population figure of 346 for Feusdorf. On 27 February 1930 the Prussian Ministry of State in Berlin released a law allowing for the creation of the municipality of J√ºnkerath, whereby Feusdorf was obliged to yield a certain amount of its municipal area to this new entity. Not only did it lose land area, but also about 70 of its inhabitants, who suddenly found their homes within the new municipality of J√ºnkerath. Feusdorf's population had now fallen to 260. In 1935, during excavation work for a new hunting lodge at the edge of the woods towards Esch, an urn grave with ashes and bone remnants was unearthed, showing that human habitation in Feusdorf must go back quite a long way. In November 1939 a great fuel storage facility was established above the village in the Esch municipal forest. This was, of course, related to the German war effort. In 1940 Feusdorf was granted permission to develop a water supply system. However, owing to the ongoing war, this would have to wait. Indeed, on 1 September 1944, owing to the critical wartime situation, the school was temporarily closed. On 29 December that same year, there came an air raid, which damaged many buildings, but rather amazingly, nobody was killed. In late September 1945 after the fighting had ended, school began again after an interruption of more than a year when the French occupying authorities granted leave for lessons to resume. The old schoolbooks were reused, but only after all material pertaining to the Third Reich and Nazi ideology had been torn out. There were 55 pupils, 27 boys and 28 girls. On 26 February 1946 the 32-man French occupying force was withdrawn from the village. At this time, the municipal boundary between Feusdorf and Alendorf also happened to be the boundary between the French and British zones of occupation. The checkpoint between these was set up at Hauptstra√üe 6. After some measure of democracy was restored, Anton Brang became Feusdorf's first postwar mayor after an election held on 15 September 1946. On Repentance and Prayer Day in November 1958, the new Warriors‚Äô Memorial was dedicated in a ceremony for the victims of both World Wars. Of the 7,500 DM that it cost to build the memorial, 5,000 DM was covered by donations from Feusdorf citizens. At the end of the 1968-1969 school year, the one-room school was dissolved. Also, the old chapel was torn down, leaving only the quire standing. This was incorporated into the new church, which was consecrated on 12 April 1970. In 1969, the municipality of Feusdorf won in the contest Unser Dorf soll sch√∂ner werden (‚ÄúOur village should become lovelier‚Äù). In 1985 the municipality laid out the building development area Am Seewinkel, filling the building gap between the village and another development area, Auf R√ºtt. Work on this new area began that same year and was completed in 1989. A new village square was also built in 1985. On 28 February 1990 ‚ÄúHurricane Wiebke‚Äù struck Germany, laying great swathes of the country waste. Feusdorf was not spared, and several hundred cubic metres of wood were ‚Äúmown around‚Äù.Feusdorf‚Äôs history  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

History  From 1357, Gefell was secularly under the lordship of the Electorate of Trier, but ecclesiastically it was an affiliate of the Parish of Beinhausen (Hilgerath) within the Archbishopric of Cologne. The village gets its name from the former Electoral-Trier road toll (known in German as a Gef√§lle or Gevelle). Gefell had a chapel as early as 1683 that by 1719 was rich in holdings, namely 19 Morgen, 19 Ruten and two Schuh in choice meadowlands, as measured in Trier units (this works out to almost 7 ha). Moreover, it held capital to a total of 439 Gulden while the tithes yielded for each of the chapel and the pastor two Malter of oats. In this same year, the mill (Gefeller M√ºhle) was still in operation and was paying 3 Albus each year in rent. Five families who were liable to taxation were living in Gefell at the time, who, among other things, also had to pay the Simple tax, levied on assessed net earnings from cropland, newly cleared land, newly burnt land, meadows, forest use, proceeds from livestock and so on.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth.  Geology  Near a basalt mountain at Gelenberg, an amygdaloidal layer was found in the greywacke.  History  Gelenberg was settled very early on as witnessed by a group of prehistoric barrows. There are at least 17 of them, mostly untouched. As early as 1683, Gelenberg had an oratory, as shown on a 1683 map of the Electoral-Trier Amt of Daun. It was consecrated to Saint Roch, patron saint of Plague victims. It was replaced in 1717 by a new chapel, this one consecrated to Saint Wendelin. However, by 1834, the chapel was in such a state of disrepair that services could no longer be held there. In 1848, a new one was built. According to the 1817 local directory, the municipality had 88 inhabitants. In 1840, Gelenberg had 21 houses and 93 inhabitants. After the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 and 1871, the population had fallen to 80, reaching its lowest ever level ‚Äì which it later reached once again ‚Äì of 73 in 1905. This had risen back up to 83 by the time the Second World War broke out, only to fall down to 73 again by 1950. By 1964, this had risen to 87 and at the end of 1967, the population had reached 95, its all-time peak thus far.  Religion  Roughly 90% of Gelenbergers are Roman Catholic.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Daun, whose seat is in the like-named town.  Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. There is a volcanic lake in Gillenfeld, the Pulvermaar, and the Maare-Moselle Cycleway runs through the municipality on the old railway trackbed from Wittlich to Daun.  History  In 1016, Gillenfeld was first documented when Emperor Henry II granted Saint Florian's Foundation in Koblenz market, minting and toll rights at Gilliveld. From 1016 to 1795, the Foundation and the House of Arenberg exercised lordship in Gillenfeld. The French Revolution, which broke out in 1789, made of Gillenfelders free citizens of the French Republic, which at first did nothing to change their lives. This, though, shortly thereafter changed when war broke out between the allied powers of Austria and Prussia on the one hand and France on the other and Gillenfeld began suffering the attendant troop movements. Beginning in 1804, Gillenfelders were for ten years citizens of the French Empire and lay under French hegemony. In 1814 and 1815 came the cession of the whole Eifel to Prussia, and the official language reverted from French to German once again. Between 1836 and 1884, there was a great wave of emigration from Gillenfeld to America and to French-conquered Algeria in which 126 people left their home village. In 1876 and 1887, the village was devastated by great fires. The first struck the Lower Village and the next the Upper Village. The founding of the volunteer fire brigade in 1880 may have been to thank for the 1887 fire's failure to reach the same proportions as the 1876 fire. Even as a parish seat, Gillenfeld can look back on a long tradition. As early as 1220, the village appeared as a parish and acquired archiepiscopal rights. Belonging to today's Parish of Gillenfeld are the municipalities of Ellscheid, Saxler and Winkel. The parish church is the St.-Andreas-Kirche (‚ÄúSaint Andrew‚Äôs Church‚Äù), built in 1898 next to the old church, of which only the west tower still remained. The events and the time of the Third Reich came to an end in Gillenfeld with the occupation by United States troops on 10 March 1945, and there came a new beginning. In 1968, the new Hauptschule was built, and the village was expanded by the heavy demand for new building land. Then, the 1970s brought administrative reform, which led to the dissolution of the Mayoralty of Gillenfeld and the village's assignment to the Verbandsgemeinde of Daun. On 22 March 1988, the abandonment of the railway line between Daun and Wittlich led to the closure of Gillenfeld railway station.  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 16 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairwoman.

The Emperor's crown above the line of partition refers to Gillenfeld's first documentary mention in 1016, which was in a document from Holy Roman Emperor Heinrich II, who would have worn such a crown. The wavy line of partition and the tincture azure below refer to Gillenfeld's maars ‚Äì lakes that form in volcanic craters ‚Äì which characterize the local geography. The wine jug below the line of partition refers to Saint Florian, who here stands for the monastic foundation that held rights at Gillenfeld for centuries.

Culture and sightseeing   Gillenfeld Maars  The Pulvermaar, a lake that has formed in a volcanic crater, lies not far from Gillenfeld, and is, after Lake Constance and the lakes in the foothills of the Alps, Germany's deepest lake. In the summer, there is a great deal of bathing here. Together with the Holzmaar, it forms the Gillenfeld Maars.  Dry maars ‚Äì D√ºrres Maar and Hitsche Maar  West of the Alf valley lie three maars in a group of volcanoes side by side: the Holzmaar, the D√ºrres Maar and the Hitsche Maar. They arose one after the other along the geological fault: first, in the northwest, the Hitsche Maar, then the D√ºrres Maar and then last the Holzmaar in the southeast, meaning that volcanic activity shifted from northwest to southeast. The Hitsche Maar is therefore the oldest maar and the Holzmaar the newest in this group. These three maars came into being during the Weichselian glaciation and are believed to be more than 20,000 years old. The lakes‚Äô age sequence was revealed in the layering of tuffs, with the Hitsche Maar's tuffs buried under the D√ºrres Maar's, which in turn were buried under the Holzmaar's tuffs, which were the last to be cast up in the time of greater volcanic activity.

In the course of municipal reform in 1970, Gunderath passed together with the other municipalities in the Amt of Kelberg to the Daun district, now known as the Vulkaneifel district.Gunderath‚Äôs history ‚Äì Click on Allgemeines.

Three kilometres away to the west runs the Belgian border. The municipal area borders in the west, north and east on North Rhine-Westphalia.  History  Parish church In 1322, Hallschlag had its first documentary mention. Hallschlag belonged then to the Lordship of Kronenburg. In the 15th century, the village found its way into Manderscheid-Schleiden hands. Towards the end of the 17th century, Hallschlag belonged, along with Kronenburg, to the Blankenheim line of the County of Manderscheid-Blankenheim. The village was raised to parish in the early 19th century. In the Second World War, 80% of Hallschlag was destroyed.

Former Espagit munitions factory  Within Hallschlag‚Äôs municipal limits, near Kehr, screened off from the outside, are the lands of the Espagit poison gas and munitions plant. Between 1915 and 1920, roughly two thousand people were employed here, until eventually, in May 1920, the factory exploded. As Franz Albert Heinen, local editor of the K√∂lner Stadtanzeiger, showed in his book (see Further reading, below), the former factory lands stand even today as an immense environmental danger, because undiscovered explosive devices and gas grenades, along with assorted other poisons, are still lurking in the ground. In the early 1990s, the Ministry of the Interior in Mainz, which is responsible for munitions removal, decided on the concept of only superficially clearing munitions from the factory‚Äôs highly contaminated former production area of about 13 hectares. Afterwards, the lands were covered in landfill and secured behind a chainlink fence to ensure the long-term prevention of contact between the affected ground and human beings. The contaminated leachate is gathered in the drainage system and then handled at a water decontamination facility.Die Espagit wurde zum Millionengrab. K√∂lner Stadtanzeiger, 3. Juli 2008.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Daun, whose seat is in the like-named town.  Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth.  History  Although Hinterweiler has never had the importance of some other centres, it can look back on a long history. Finds in the area called Im Gemeindewinkel (‚ÄúIn the Municipality‚Äôs Corner‚Äù) show that there must have been a Celtic settlement there. Traces of settlement from Roman times found to the north of the village at the foot of the Ernstberg and about 500 m west of the village bear witness to the Ernstberg's having been used as a place of worship in those days. The unearthing of a Frankish grave in Hinterweiler furthermore shows that the Franks, who came after Rome's downfall, settled Hinterweiler in the latter half of the first millennium AD. It can also be concluded from the name of a rural cadastral area that there was once a monastery within Hinterweiler's current municipal limits. Witnessed in documents is Hinterweiler's early name before the year 349, which was simply Whyler, which meant ‚Äúplace‚Äù (its Modern High German descendant, Weiler, means ‚Äúhamlet‚Äù), and it was also certain that the neighbouring place was also called Whyler. Whether the modern name Hinterweiler was derived from hinter Whyler (‚Äúbehind Whyler‚Äù) is unknown. This is presumed, but there is no proof. Within the Roman ruin site ‚ÄúIm Kloster‚Äù (‚ÄúIn the Monastery‚Äù), it has also been confirmed that there is a drystone-masonry grave, although with no grave goods, which could be from Merovingian times. In feudal times the village belonged to the Amt of Daun in the Archbishopric of Trier. In Prussian times, Hinterweiler was a municipality in the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Rockeskyll.

At 0% of the German Weather Service's weather stations, lower figures are recorded. The driest month is April. The most rainfall comes in November. In that month, precipitation is 1.4 times what it is in April. Precipitation varies only slightly. At none of the weather stations are lower seasonal swings recorded.  History  barrows and the remnants of a Roman farm lead to the conclusion that people settled the area as early as the 2nd century. H√∂chstberg's first documentary mention, though, only goes back as far as 1389. The document's content is merely a lease in which Tilgin von Daun leased the estate in Husen bei Uersfeld to the Burgmann and administrator Peter von N√ºrburg. The occasion for the documentary mention in 1620 was a sensational murder trial: local peasants were accused of having assassinated Spanish riders who were travelling through the area and having robbed them. The peasants were later either hanged or broken on the wheel. If the documents from that time are being read correctly, it is clear that the peasants were simply victims of a show trial: What may have been the justifiable killing of Spaniards in view of the times stood in connection with the Thirty Years' War as a political scandal, and the peasants who were sentenced to death were proverbial ‚Äúpawns‚Äù in the game of ensuring the political intrigues in the Empire. Within the framework of the French Revolution, the Rhineland became the ‚ÄúFrankish Republic‚Äù, and encamped in the Kelberg area in 1794 was a French corps (roughly 10,000 men) for whose supplies the surrounding municipalities had to pay. H√∂chstberg at this time was home to 69 inhabitants. French influence ebbed in 1815 with the Congress of Vienna: The Rhineland became Prussian. In connection with the building of the Eifelquerbahn (‚ÄúCross-Eifel Railway‚Äù) from Mayen to Gerolstein and baryte mining, there was an economic upswing in the early 20th century. In 1934, H√∂chstberg was given its current name. The old name, Hausen, could have been confused with another place named Hausen, one of Mayen's outlying centres.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. Hohenfels-Essingen lies in the Hangelsbach valley framed by the Feuerberg (588 m), the Alter Vo√ü (588 m, with ‚ÄúLiberation Beech‚Äù) and the M√ºhlenberg (585 m, with its well-known millstone quarries).  History  As witnessed by archaeological finds, Hohenfels was already settled in Roman and Frankish times and in 948, it had its first documentary mention. Essingen was first mentioned in a document in 1193 as an estate belonging to the Sankt Thomas Monastery.  Romans and Franks  In the late 2nd century, the Romans came into the west Eifel. Roman troops found natives who worked at cropraising, but who were so small in number that they only occupied a relatively small area. With the systematic opening of the land with military roads and the attendant onset of regional and even national trade opportunities, land clearing was begun in these lands, which were particularly good for cropraising. The land each side of the roads was overlaid with a network of estates that were run both as state and private enterprises. Some of the most important Roman roads ran over the northern heights of Hohenfels and through the Kyll valley north of Trier. In the district Im Keller (‚ÄúIn the Cellar‚Äù) in Hohenfels, the remnants of a portico villa were found during building excavations in 1957. Only about 200 metres away in 1914 in the rural cadastral area Auf Grafenfeld in Hohenfels, two Roman graves were unearthed and salvaged for the Rheinisches Landesmuseum Trier. The great Germanic taking of the land between 400 and 600 destroyed Roman culture and brought the area into the ‚Äúarmy kings‚Äô‚Äù (Heerk√∂nige) hands. The people who had lived here until now ‚Äì Romanized Celts and Romans ‚Äì either fled or were subdued. The Frankish kings dealt the formerly Roman estates out to their warriors. In Hohenfels, an old settlement founded by the Franks can be found right near the Roman portico villa. In Auf Grafenfeld, a great burying ground from Frankish times was unearthed and explored in 1912: 125 Frankish graves from the 4th to 8th centuries.  15th to 17th centuries  Even before the Thirty Years' War, the M√ºhlenberg was riven with galleries in which millstones were being produced. As protection, in particular against Swedish troops, these galleries and caves were expanded and then used to shelter livestock. For a water supply, great basins were hewn in lava blocks, which could hold up to 300 litres of water. Water was to be had from a spring outlet on the mountain‚Äôs south slope. After the Thirty Years‚Äô War, the land had been laid waste and the people impoverished. Moreover, there were sicknesses like the Plague and cholera. From this time come seven wayside crosses hewn from basalt in the vicinity of Hohenfels. Each Sunday, the whole village would make a pilgrimage by the crosses, asking for an end to the Plague. In the 1960s, the crosses were put up by the municipality along the way to the grotto on the M√ºhlberg. Further destruction was brought in 1688 by the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pf√§lzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession), in which castles, churches and monasteries were destroyed.  18th and 19th centuries  As a result of the French Revolution, the French came into the Eifel. Hohenfels was then owned by the Count of Metternich, who was stripped of his holdings in 1808. The Hohenfels mill, which also belonged to the Count, was sold for 1,200 francs (then equivalent to 380 Taler). Likewise, each one of the Count's landholdings was auctioned off one by one. In November 1817, the Eifel was annexed to the state of Prussia and thenceforth belonged to the newly founded Rhine Province with its seat in D√ºsseldorf. In the 19th century, an average of 140 people lived in Hohenfels. The main livelihood was smallholdings. There were also family businesses in curbstone and millstone making, and in making roadbuilding materials. These products were shipped out over the Eifel by teams of horses and sold. Some of the millstones were shipped to Belgium and thence throughout the world. These family businesses ceased during the First World War. In 1860, the Eifel's biggest lava deposit ‚Äì the Feuerberg in Hohenfels ‚Äì was leased by the municipality for lava mining. The lava was used for road and railway building.  20th century to present  Basalt quarry After the First World War, in November 1918, American troops were in the village. Later on came French occupational troops as part of the Allied occupation of the Rhineland. In the 1920s, basalt mining began beneath the M√ºhlenberg. In the area around Hohenfels, a firm from Mayen was making runner stones and shipping them worldwide. In 1928 above the cadastral area of ‚ÄúWahlend‚Äù, a gravelworks was built, remaining in operation until 1974. For a time, more than 100 people were employed here. In the course of administrative reform, the two self-administering municipalities of Hohenfels and Essingen were merged on 1 January 1968 into a single municipality.  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat  Coat of arms  The German blazon reads: In Silber ein schr√§glinkes, rotes Schwert, begleitet oben von einer blauen Urne, unten von einem gr√ºnen M√ºhlstein.

The blue urn refers to the great Frankish burying ground with 125 graves and the important finds therefrom.

West of the village runs the newly built stretch of the Autobahn A 1 from Trier to Cologne. In 1982, H√∂rscheid was the regional winner in the contest Unser Dorf soll sch√∂ner werden (‚ÄúOur village should become lovelier‚Äù).  History  The area was settled as early as the New Stone Age, with Celtic stone hatchets having been found in the settlement area. The rural cadastral area Runkelhof shows traces of Roman settlement. A stone villa from the 2nd to 4th century once stood here on the Roman road from Trier to Cologne. The Romans had diverted and channelled one of the Alf's lesser sources. The aqueduct lay 1.3 m underground and ran to the neighbouring village of Darscheid, ending at a fountain, which is no longer extant. The village's name is believed to have been derived from the Celtic word for ‚Äúmountain forest‚Äù or ‚Äúdeer forest‚Äù, although this is uncertain. The ending ‚Äîscheid points to forest clearing in the Early Middle Ages. In 1465, H√∂rscheid had its first documentary mention, according to which the village already existed in 1398. In the 16th century, the settlement consisted of five hearths. The village was from Frankish times part of the Amt of Daun, which as of 1354 belonged to the Electorate of Trier. Ecclesiastically, however, the whole Amt of Daun belonged to the Electorate of Cologne. The area is mainly Roman Catholic, and H√∂rscheid has belonged to the Parish of Darscheid since 1803. The bell at Saint Brigid's Catholic Chapel was poured in 1678, meaning that there must also have been a chapel as early as that. It was renovated in 1850. The Evangelical parish belongs to the Deaconry of Adenau. Heiligenh√§uschen from the 1960s In 1787, there was a ‚Äúwinter school‚Äù (Winterschule ‚Äì a kind of agricultural school that grew up in response to the Industrial Revolution) in H√∂rscheid. The teacher at the time was Johann Peter Stoll. Later, schoolchildren went to a one-room primary school in Darscheid, which was closed in 1975. Ever since, H√∂rscheid schoolchildren have been attending the two-stream primary school in Mehren. A kindergarten is also available in Darscheid. Life for Eifel dwellers was often hard owing to the rough climate and the poor soils. Owing to the great neediness in the early 19th century, 31 persons all together emigrated from H√∂rscheid to North America. Only beginning in 1860 could the food supply for the people be lastingly ensured by reforestation of the sparse heath and improved agricultural methods. In 1912 came the merging of fields that through inheritance had become splintered. In 1931, a central water supply was built. In 1933, a great deal of the heathland was cultivated.  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.7 June 2009 municipal election results  Mayors  H√∂rscheid's mayor is Hans Schuh. He was elected in the mayoral contest on 7 September 2009 and succeeded Walter Steinebach.  Coat of arms  The German blazon reads: In Silber ein blauer Wellenstab, vorn ein durchgehendes rotes Balkenkreuz, hinten √ºber einem gr√ºnen Eichenblatt eine rote Flamme. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Argent a pallet wavy azure, dexter a cross gules and sinister in base an oakleaf bendwise sinister proper and in chief fire of the third. The red cross on the silver field refers to the municipality's centuries-long history with the Electoral-Trier Amt of Daun. The wavy blue pallet (narrow vertical stripe) symbolizes the source of the river Alf. The green oakleaf refers to the interpretation of the placename as meaning ‚Äúmountain forest‚Äù, and also to the harvest of oak bark for tanning in the rural cadastral area Gebrannter Berg that was once undertaken. The red flame is Saint Brigid's attribute, thus representing the municipality's patron saint. The arms have been borne since 7 May 1991.  Culture and sightseeing  Piet√† in the Heiligenh√§uschen Besides a chapel consecrated to Saint Brigid of Kildare that was newly built in 1850 with a Baroque altar from 1738, there is also within municipal limits a picturesque Heiligenh√§uschen (a small, shrinelike structure consecrated to a saint or saints) that was built in the 1960s with a Piet√† made of reddish basalt. Centrally located are, besides the chapel, the fountain square built in 1980, a playground renovated in 2006 with citizens‚Äô personal contributions and a community centre with a fire station.

Today the school is part of the Berlin University of the Arts.  History  It was founded in 1850 as the Berliner Musikschule by Julius Stern, Theodor Kullak and Adolf Bernhard Marx. Kullak withdrew from the conservatory in 1855 in order to create a new academy of sculpture and three-dimensional art. With Marx's withdrawal in 1856, the conservatory came exclusively under the Stern family and adopted its name. In 1894 it was taken over by Gustav Hollaender (the uncle of film composer Friedrich Hollaender), who moved the school's location to the Berlin Philharmonic concert hall on Bernburger Strasse in Berlin-Kreuzberg. In the course of the Gleichschaltung process, the Stern Academy in 1936 was renamed Konservatorium der Reichshauptstadt Berlin controlled by the Nazi regime. Gustav Hollaender's heirs were disseized, but for a few years they were able to run a \\"Jewish Private Music School Hollaender\\" until they were deported and murdered in 1941. After the end of the Second World War in 1945, the school was again renamed as the St√§dtisches Konservatorium (City Conservatory) in what was to become West Berlin. In 1966 it was merged with the public Akademische Hochschule f√ºr Musik into the Staatliche Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Darstellende Kunst (Berlin State School of Music and the Performing Arts), since 2001 the Berlin University of the Arts.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Kelberg, whose seat is in the like-named municipality.  Geography   Location  H√∂rschhausen lies in the middle of the Eifel, in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. H√∂rschhausen lies on Bundesstra√üe 257 which leads to the nearest major centres, such as Kelberg and Ulmen. Nearby is the Hochkelberg (674 m above sea level).  Neighbouring municipalities  H√∂rschhausen‚Äôs neighbours are Katzwinkel, Ue√ü, Horperath, Berenbach and Utzerath.  History  In 1494, H√∂rschhausen had its first documentary mention. In 1762, the chapel, which still stands today, was built and consecrated to Saint Apollinaris. It was built on a spot that is prone to flooding, with the Ue√übach and the G√§√übach flowing by right nearby, but it is unknown why this was done. It is believed that perhaps the chapel was built in time of drought, leading builders to overlook any danger of flooding. In 1794, H√∂rschhausen counted 85 inhabitants. In 1825, a fire destroyed four houses. On 21 January 1847 came the first meeting of the municipal council. In 1851 a trove of roughly 1,800 coins, some made of silver and some of ore, from Roman times was unearthed about 565 m from H√∂rschhausen, under a heap of rubble while the linking road to Berenbach and on to Ulmen was being built. The coins are one of several archaeological finds made in H√∂rschhausen, one of the richest archaeological sites in the Verbandsgemeinde of Kelberg, in the Landesmuseum Trier. In 1852, the remains of a Roman settlement were found. In 1895, H√∂rschhausen was linked to the Eifelquerbahn (Cross Eifel Railway) network through the neighbouring village of Utzerath. In 1920, the bakehouse was built on what is now M√ºhlenweg (street). In 1939, an old relic from a bygone age, the tithe barn, burnt down. Ten years later, in 1949, the volunteer fire brigade was founded. In 1952, the water supply was ensured. In 1988, a new parish hall was built. In 1989, H√∂rschhausen became the finishing place in a stage of the campaign Eine wandernde Flagge f√ºr Europa (‚ÄúA roaming flag for Europe‚Äù). In 1996, the bakehouse was torn down.H√∂rschhausen‚Äôs history  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

Coat of arms  The German blazon reads: The municipality‚Äôs arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess argent a cross sable and sable an H-shaped wall brace Or. In the early 1950s, the Amt of Daun put forth a proposal to the Koblenz-Ehrenbreitstein State Archive for a few municipalities, among them H√∂rschhausen, for designs for coats of arms. Since no older seals or coats of arms were known, the designs were authorized. Nevertheless, it was not until 1980 that approval was granted for H√∂rschhausen to bear arms, and it had not been until 1979 that the application had even been submitted to the Regierungsbezirk administration in Trier. Until the end of feudal times, H√∂rschhausen was an Electoral-Cologne holding, and the Cross of Cologne in the upper half of the escutcheon recalls this time. The gold H-shaped wall brace stands for both the municipality‚Äôs name, and the placename ending ‚Äîhausen.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Daun, whose seat is in the like-named town.  Geography   Location  Immerath The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. Immerath lies 20 km southeast of the district seat of Daun and some 22 km west of Cochem on the Moselle. On Immerath's outskirts runs Bundesstra√üe 421, and in Mehren near Daun is an interchange on the Autobahn A 1 (Koblenz ‚Äì Trier). Near Immerath lies the Immerather Maar, a lake that has formed in a volcanic crater; only 2 km to the east is another, the Pulvermaar. One kilometre to the east is the √ú√übach valley.  Neighbouring municipalities  Immerath's neighbours are Gillenfeld, Strotzb√ºsch and Lutzerath.  History  Digs and finds in the 1930s on the eastern slope of the hollow in which Immerath lies ‚Äì actually a volcanic crater ‚Äì led to the conclusion that sometime about the 3rd century, a stately villa arose here. A wealthy Roman, it is believed, had a whole complex of buildings built here with a main house, stabling and servants‚Äô lodging. The main house alone measured some thirty metres along the front and had 15 rooms. In 1143, Immerath had its first documentary mention as Emgramenrode in letters patent from King Konrad II for the Springiersbach Monastery. A donation document from Count Palatine Wilhelm in 1144 verifies that Emgramenrode had been transferred to the Springiersbach Monastery's ownership in 1136. The name's form has changed several time over the ages, appearing in an ecclesiastical protocol at a chapel in 1475 as Ymgerait, and somewhat less than a century later (1569) in a visitation protocol as Imeraidt, which comes close to the name's modern form, which itself first appeared about 1650. According to Adam Wrede in his book ‚ÄúEifeler Volkskunde‚Äù, places with names ending in ‚Äîrat indicate that the place was founded by clearing the forest.Immerath‚Äôs history  Population development  In 1557, Immerath counted seventeen inhabitants; by 1563, this had grown to eighteen (with three at the Heckenhof ‚Äì ‚ÄúHedge Farm‚Äù or ‚ÄúHedge Estate‚Äù), and then to 20 by 1587. In 1624, this had become 17 hearths (or houses). Assuming an average occupancy of five people to each house, this yields a population estimate of 85. Indeed, between 1557 and 1625, the number of inhabitants swung between 85 and 105. In 1625, 15 of the village's 17 families earned their livelihood through farming, one was a herdsman's family, and the last was a single person without any identifiable occupation. A year earlier, the village boasted 26 horses, 99 sheep and 4 beehives. On the 1733 taxation rolls, 18 longtime residents, 4 widows, 9 persons without full municipal rights, 31 households and 58 persons subject to taxation were counted. In 1816 the population was 187 and in 1850 there were 36 houses and 203 inhabitants in Immerath. At the Heckenhof lived two families with ten family members, and at the Immerath mill, the miller likewise had ten mouths to feed. In 1970, the village had 297 inhabitants, and in 1985 it had 265. At 30 May 2000, the number was 274.Immerath‚Äôs population development  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Tierced in mantle dexter argent a cross gules, sinister argent an urn azure and in base vert a chapel of the first with roof and windows sable, the tower to sinister. The red cross refers to the village's former allegiance to the Electorate of Trier and its former status as part of the Electoral-Trier Amt of Daun. The urn refers to the remnants of a Roman villa found nearby, while the urn's tincture, azure (blue), refers to the nearby water ‚Äì the Immerather Maar.

Geologically, J√ºnkerath is part of the Kalkeifel (‚ÄúLimestone Eifel‚Äù).  History  J√ºnkerath is among the Eifel's oldest places. The name is derived from Icorigium, a station on the Trier-Cologne Roman road, which was marked as early as the 4th century on the Tabula Peutingeriana. As a result of the Treaty of Lun√©ville, J√ºnkerath passed along with the rest of the lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank to France in 1801, and then in 1815 came the cession to Prussia. Count Sternberg-Manderscheid acquired in the 1803 Reichsdeputationshauptschluss as the landholder, among other things, the holdings formerly belonging to the monasteries at Weissenau and Schussenried in Upper Swabia to offset his loss of Blankenheim, J√ºnkerath, Gerolstein and Dollendorf.

Coat of arms  The German blazon reads: Ein blauer Schild darin ein silberner L√∂we mit goldener Krone, umgeben von 6 goldenen Lilien. Der L√∂we tr√§gt einen f√ºnfzackigen roten Turnierkragen. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Azure sem√©e of fleurs-de-lis Or a lion rampant argent armed and langued gules and crowned of the second surmounted at the shoulder by a label of five points of the fourth. Curiously, the German blazon does not match the coat of arms shown at the municipality's website. The blazon stipulates six lilies, but only five are shown, the lion's attitude, rampant, is not mentioned, nor does anything in the blazon deal with the tongue's or the claws‚Äô tincture (‚Äúarmed and langued gules‚Äù). J√ºnkerath's arms go back to the old arms borne by the Lords of J√ºnkerath and to the time when J√ºnkerath belonged to the lordship at Schleiden. The noblemen of J√ºnkerath possessed, like almost all Eifel noble families, their own coat of arms. The J√ºnkerath arms can also be found in the arms of the County of Blankenheim, which is quarterly. On 28 September 1934, the municipality appointed Schulze Grady to request of the Reich Minister of the Interior that J√ºnkerath be allowed to bear its own arms. Approval came early the next spring. The arms have been borne since 28 March 1935.Description and explanation of J√ºnkerath‚Äôs arms  Culture and sightseeing   Museums  The Eisenmuseum (‚ÄúIron Museum‚Äù) in J√ºnkerath documents the Eifel iron industry's history since the 15th century.

The three ears of wheat are, in a roundabout way, canting for the name ‚ÄúScheuern‚Äù. Scheuern was, along with other neighbouring places, subject to tithing by Pr√ºm Abbey, and indeed, the Abbey‚Äôs tithe barn stood in Scheuern, which drew its name from the building: Scheuer is Eifel dialect for what in High German is called a Scheune ‚Äì a barn.

Neighbouring municipalities  Kaperich‚Äôs neighbours are Lirstal, H√∂chstberg and Uersfeld.  Constituent communities  Kaperich has an outlying hamlet called K√∂lnische H√∂fe, which is home to roughly 25 people. This hamlet is sometimes also called ‚ÄúPochtener H√∂fe‚Äù.  History  In feudal times, Kaperich belonged until 1794 to the Electoral-Cologne Amt of N√ºrburg. Under Prussian administration, Kaperich became a municipality in the Adenau district and the Amt of Kelberg, until 1932. After administrative reform in 1970, the municipality, along with others in the Amt of Kelberg, passed to what was then known as the Daun district; the same district is now called the Vulkaneifel district.  K√∂lnische H√∂fe  K√∂lnische H√∂fe, sometimes also called Pochtener H√∂fe, was built sometime about 1500. In 1741, the Uersfeld church books listed two estates there. The name ‚ÄúK√∂lnische H√∂fe‚Äù goes back to the former Electorate of Cologne landholdings there (‚ÄúCologne‚Äù is K√∂ln in German), and the popular name ‚ÄúPochtener H√∂fe‚Äù comes from the hamlet‚Äôs location in the Pochtener Wald (forest), which had its first documentary mention as Puthena in 1050. It is worth noting that, except in instances such as road signs and titles in documents, the name almost never takes the form ‚ÄúK√∂lnische H√∂fe‚Äù owing to the niceties of German grammar, for ‚ÄúK√∂lnische H√∂fe‚Äù is the form unprejudiced by an article. However, in common usage, the name always takes a definite article. Furthermore, it also inflects for case. Thus it is die K√∂lnischen H√∂fe in the nominative and accusative, den K√∂lnischen H√∂fen in the dative and der K√∂lnischen H√∂fe in the genitive. The name is also plural, meaning that the verb must take the third-person plural form if the name is the subject. The communal bakehouse (Backhaus, or more popularly Backes in German) standing at the entrance to the hamlet is under monumental protection, and as such is the only building in the municipality with this distinction (see Culture and sightseeing ‚Äì Buildings below).

The village‚Äôs population is roughly 180 and its elevation ranges from 460 to 490 m above sea level; however, if areas outside the village but still within municipal limits are considered, the local mountain, the Staudchen, northeast of the village, reaches a height of 524 m above sea level. At the Afelskreuz (see Culture and sightseeing below), the 600 m above sea level mark is almost reached. The area within municipal limits measures 385 ha, and one third of it is wooded.Location  History  Stone Age finds brought to light here confirm prehistoric settlement in the area around Katzwinkel. The first documentary mention from 1143 shows that the Springiersbach Monastery had holdings in Katzwinkel. Katzwinkel later belonged to the County of N√ºrburg and the Amt of N√ºrburg, and thereby also to the Electorate of Cologne. In the time of French occupation under Napoleon, Katzwinkel was assigned to the Mairie (\\"Mayoralty\\") of Sarmersbach in the canton of Daun. After this arrangement was abolished in 1815, the village remained with the B√ºrgermeisterei (also \\"Mayoralty\\") of Sarmersbach until 1931. Until 1970, the municipality belonged to the Verbandsgemeinde of Daun, when it, along with Beinhausen, Boxberg, Br√ºck, H√∂rschhausen and Neichen, was annexed to the Verbandsgemeinde of Kelberg.

The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Argent a cross sable between four cronels vert. The black cross on a silver field is the arms formerly borne by the village's feudal overlord, the Electorate of Cologne, to which, of the formerly 98 municipalities in the district, only Katzwinkel and H√∂rschhausen belonged. The cross has what is described in the German blazon as \\"green, three-spiked crowns\\" (‚Ä¶gr√ºnen dreizackigen Kronen), although they more closely resemble a charge known as a cronel,James Parker on cronels. set in each of its angles. The cronels are a clever kind of canting. In German heraldry, the term for the arrangement of four like charges around a cross in this fashion is bewinkelt, thus suggesting part of the name Katzwinkel (the name ending actually means \\"corner\\", \\"angle\\" or, as in this case, \\"place framed by hills and mountains\\").Description and explanation of Katzwinkel‚Äôs arms  Culture and sightseeing   Buildings  Worth seeing in Katzwinkel is the Afelskreuz (cross) with its chapel. The name may come from Ablasskreuz (\\"Indulgence Cross\\"), although it is also possible, given the very similar pronunciation, that it came from Eifelkreuz (\\"Eifel Cross\\"). The more than 3 m-tall cross that stands here now was put up on the same spot as an older, rotten one in 1931. The year carved into the cross, 1231, refers to pilgrimages made at that time.Das Afelskreuz bei Katzwinkel Two other buildings are listed as part of the municipality's cultural heritage: * Saint Catherine's Catholic Church (branch church; Filialkirche St. Katharina), Baumschulstra√üe 4, triaxial aisleless church, 1810, altered about 1950-1960. * Heiligenh√§uschen (a small, shrinelike structure consecrated to a saint or saints), east of the village on the road to Ue√ü.Directory of Cultural Monuments in Vulkaneifel district  Natural monuments  The Teufelsstein (\\"Devil‚Äôs Stone\\") with a diameter of 2 m is a listed natural monument made of solidified lava.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth.  Constituent communities  Kerpen's Ortsteile are Loogh and Kerpen.  History  Archaeological finds bear witness to human habitation in the Hillesheim limestone hollow between 600 and 400 BC. About 225 BC, the Treveri, a people of mixed Celtic and Germanic stock, from whom the Latin name for the city of Trier, Augusta Treverorum, is also derived, built a defensive structure on the Weinberg (mountain) near Kerpen. Beginning in 55 BC, Roman roads and villas began appearing in the Kerpen area. Sometime between AD 600 and 700, the Franks had a village near what is now Kerpen, called ‚ÄúStilsdorf‚Äù. Frankish graves have been found in and around Kerpen. In 1136, Kerpen had its first documentary mention when ‚ÄúSigibertus von Kerpen‚Äù, who is believed to have been the first to build a castle on the H√∂henberg, was named in a document. Settlers from Stilsdorf settled at the foot of the castle. Sometime before 1197, the brothers Dietrich, Alexander and Albero von Kerpen endowed a convent in Niederehe. In 1201, Dietrich I von Kerpen was mentioned as the lord of the Manderscheid Lower Castle. At about this same time came Heinrich II von Kerpen, who is considered the ‚Äúforefather of the Manderscheids‚Äù. Between 1200 and 1208, Otto von Kerpen was the second Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights. In 1218, the outlying centre of Loogh had its first documentary mention in a donation of two homesteads, the Keulen-H√§user, by the Lords of Kerpen to the convent in Niederehe. In 1265, Dietrich II von Kerpen enfeoffed Archbishop Engelbert of Cologne with Castle Kerpen. It is believed that Dietrich III von Kerpen took part in the Battle of Worringen in 1288. After 1300, Dietrich III's sons founded the lines of Linster, M√∂rsdorf and Warsberg. Between 1308 and 1324, there was a dispute between the Lords of Kerpen and Archbishop Heinrich of Cologne over patronage rights in the Parish of Wevelinghoven near Neuss. In 1327, Konrad and Dietrich von Kerpen divided the village of Gillenfeld. Between 1334 and 1345, the Archbishops of Trier and Cologne were granted the right to use Castle Kerpen as a military stronghold. In 1351, Archbishop Willhelm refused to compensate Lords Johann and Dietrich von Kerpen for their losses in the Westphalian War. The same year, Dietrich von Kerpen- Warsburg was enfeoffed with Illingen. Between 1354 and 1397, Dietrich von Kerpen-M√∂rsdorf was the abbot at Pr√ºm Abbey, while Willhelm von Kerpen- Warsburg was the abbot at the Abbey of Echternach between 1359 and 1372. In 1360, Dietrich von Kerpen-Warsburg was Schenk (a high official at court, responsible for the wine cellar and vineyards, among other things) to the Archbishop of Cologne. Sometime before 1400, Willhelm von Sombreff wed Magarete von Kerpen, Johann the Elder's daughter. Their son, also named Willhelm von Sombreff, was beginning in 1450 the sole owner of Castle Kerpen, and was, together with his own son, Friedrich, and one hundred armed men, in the service of Duke Arnold of Geldern and J√ºlich in 1459. The next year began the dispute over the wardship of the mad Friedrich von Saffenberg. In 1471, Friedrich I von Sombreff wed Elisabeth von Neuenahr. Two years later, Friedrich found himself a Manderscheid confederate in the struggle against the Duke of J√ºlich. This seems to have unleashed a sequence of rather unfortunate events, for later in 1473, the family found itself at odds with the Manderscheids instead, in a dispute that lasted until 1478, during which time, in 1475, infighting broke out within the family Sombreff itself. Friedrich I von Sombreff died in 1483, as did Dietrich IV in 1551, with the latter's son and successor, Dietrich V, following his father to the grave only nine years later, in 1560. The years from 1560 to 1593 were those of Dietrich VI von Manderscheid's reign and he saw to it that the Reformation was spread throughout his holdings. After he died in Kerpen in 1593, his brother-in-law Philipp von der Marck seized, among other Manderscheid holdings, Castle Kerpen. In 1608, the Manderscheids tried to recover their castle by storming it, but they were held off. After Philipp's death in 1613, his son Ernst succeeded him. The Thirty Years' War and its aftermath took their toll on Kerpen and Niederehe in the years between 1635 and 1652. In 1653, Ernst von der Marck died, and there followed disputes over his inheritance. Beginning in 1674, the Arenbergs were lords of the castle. Only four years later came the French. They destroyed the castle in 1682. The next year, a great fire destroyed two thirds of the village. In 1689, the French further destroyed the castle again, and this time the village, too. In 1788, the first schools arose in the Lordship of Kerpen. In 1792, Kerpen's town gates were sold off into private ownership. In 1794 began French rule, under which the Duke's and the convent's holdings were seized and sold off in 1804 and 1805. In 1814 or 1815, Kerpen was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. Later in the 19th century, in 1850, came the beginnings of a regulated postal system. In 1858, the Kerpen dealers‚Äô and livestock market, once held every year before Whitsun, was abolished. In 1895, Castle Kerpen was sold to Johann Dh√ºn, and it was acquired by Fritz von Wille in 1911. In 1912, the first train arrived in Kerpen.Kerpen‚Äôs history The current municipality of Kerpen was founded on 7 June 1969 out of the dissolved municipalities of Kerpen and Loogh.

Coat of arms  The German blazon reads: In Silber auf goldenem Dreiberg ein schwarzer Zinnenturm, belegt mit silbernem Schildchen, darin ein roter Zickzackbalken. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Argent in base a mount of three Or upon which a tower embattled of five sable charged with an inescutcheon of the field with a fess dancetty of three gules. The black, crenellated (‚Äúembattled‚Äù, that is, with battlements) tower is a representation of the 23 m-tall keep, the dominant feature of Castle Kerpen and the seat of the Imperial Lordship of Kerpen (first documentary mention in 1136). On the keep's wall is an inescutcheon bearing the arms once borne by the Counts of Kerpen (1136‚Äì1400), heraldically ‚ÄúArgent a fess dancetty of three gules‚Äù (that is, a silver field upon which a horizontal zigzag red stripe with three peaks). The ‚Äúmount of three‚Äù stands for the local mountains. This charge is called a Dreiberg in German heraldry, which literally means ‚Äúthree-mountain‚Äù, and the local mountains do indeed number three: the Weinberg (553 m), the H√∂henberg (505 m) and the Ko-Berg (482 m). The arms have been borne since 14 October 1950.Description and explanation of Kerpen‚Äôs arms  Culture and sightseeing   Buildings   Kerpen  * Castle Kerpen (Burg Kerpen; monumental zone), remnants of a mediaeval castle, since 1682 a ruin, complex rising in several terraces, 12th to 16th century, Romanesque Bergfried (German-style keep), Kerpen's foremost landmark. * Saint Sebastian‚Äôs Catholic Church (branch church; Filialkirche St. Sebastian), Im Kapelleneck 12, former castle chapel, inner weightbearing columns, 16th century; wayside cross from 1716. * Adenauer Stra√üe 1 ‚Äì Quereinhaus (a combination residential and commercial house divided for these two purposes down the middle, perpendicularly to the street), roof with half-hipped gables from 1826. * Bachstra√üe 2 ‚Äì post-Baroque building with roof with half-hipped gables from 1807, more recent commercial building; whole complex. * Across the street from Bachstra√üe 12 ‚Äì remnants of the village fortifications, mentioned in 1475. * Bachstra√üe 16/18 ‚Äì former Quereinhaus, apparently from 1870. * Eulersteierstra√üe 6 ‚Äì estate along street, building with roof with half-hipped gables from 1841, possibly essentially older; commercial building, quarrystone, timber-frame gable. * Fritz-von-Wille-Stra√üe 12/13 ‚Äì former courthouse, no.13 timber-frame, partly solid, 15th/16th century, no. 12 from after 1917 on top of solid ground floor built with salvaged timber-framing jetties, from 1830 and 1848. * Im Kapelleneck 2 ‚Äì house, possibly essentially 17th century. * Irrweg 1 ‚Äì five-axis plaster building from 1821. * Kapelleneck 3 ‚Äì former Burgmann‚Äôs seat, house with spiral stairway and gateway with coat of arms from [16?]23 * Niedereher Stra√üe/corner of Irrweg ‚Äì wayside cross, basalt beam cross from 1693. * So-called Rotes Kreuz (‚ÄúRed Cross‚Äù) northeast of the village on the road to Niederehe, near municipal limits, sandstone shaft cross from 1793. * Wayside chapel, east of the village on the way into Castle Kerpen, quarrystone building, about 1900? * Wayside cross, northeast of the village on the road to Niederehe, sandstone shaft cross from 1710. * Wayside cross, east of the village next to the wayside chapel, sandstone shaft cross from 1793. * Wayside cross, northeast of the village at the side of the road to Niederehe, basalt beam cross from 1716.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Gerolstein, whose seat is in the municipality of Gerolstein.  Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. Kerschenbach sits at an elevation of 550 m above sea level, and has an area of 691 ha. In the north, it borders on the state of North Rhine- Westphalia.  History  When Kerschenbach came into being is lost in the mists of time. The placename ending ‚Äîbach points to beginnings in the time of the clearings in the Eifel, putting them in the 12th century. The name ‚ÄúKerschenbach‚Äù is closely tied to the like-named brook. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the village was called Kirschembach. The determinative Kerschen‚Äî goes back to the Old High German word kar, meaning ‚Äúdale‚Äù or ‚Äúhollow‚Äù. Kerschenbach therefore means ‚ÄúDalebrook‚Äù Unlike what has been unearthed in other, nearby municipalities, no traces of Roman occupation have come to light in Kerschenbach. There was some excitement when building works at the new village square brought up some ceramic piping that was thought might be Roman. However, the discovery turned into a disappointment when it became clear that the old pipes were actually the ones that had once been used to feed the old village drinking trough, and were not nearly old enough to be called ancient. Furthermore, they came not from Rome, but rather from the Kannenb√§ckerland (‚ÄúJug Bakers‚Äô Land‚Äù, a small region still known for its ceramics industry) in the Westerwaldkreis, also in Rhineland-Palatinate. In 1327, Kerschenbach had its first documentary mention when the knight Friedrich I von Kronenburg was enfeoffed with the dynastic castle along with a few surrounding villages, among which was Kerschenbach. From another document from 1345, one gathers that Counts Arnold I and Gerhard V, as Counts of Blankenheim, transferred, among other villages, Kerschenbach to King John of Bohemia, who was also Count in right of Luxembourg. For 2,000 Schildgulden, the comital brothers got the area back, but under the terms of the deal, they were obliged to help the Count of Luxembourg in times of war. In accordance with this document, Kerschenbach belonged under the Blankenheim lordship in the estate of Stadtkyll. In the end, almost the whole Eifel area passed to the Counts of Manderscheid. As of 1468, the Counties of Blankenheim and Gerolstein found themselves among this house's holdings and hence, so did Kerschenbach. In this time, Kerschenbach must have had a high court. In the 1488 agreement between Counts Cuno and Johann von Manderscheid dealing with the division of their inheritance, it comes to light that Count Cuno was awarded one half of all taxes, while his brother Count Johann was awarded not only the other half of this, but also the ‚Äúhigh court at Kerschenbach‚Äù. After the Thirty Years' War, only three families were left in Kerschenbach, headed by Thei√ü Webers, Gotthard Ebertz and Richard Holtz. The witch hunts that were being undertaken at this same time did not spare Kerschenbach women. As early as 1581, a woman named Katharina (Threin) Schligers had been put to death as a witch. This burning was one of the earliest in the High Eifel area. In 1633, another woman, Margarethe Heinen, fell victim to this madness. The Plague brought not only hardship and misery to the area in the 17th century, but also it created a border oddity that persisted for quite a long time. Three families who had been living in a Kronenburg-held area moved to Kerschenbach as a result of the Plague outbreak, and although they now lived in Blankenheim-Gerolstein territory (estate of Stadtkyll), they remained Kronenburg-Luxembourgish subjects. In 1796, under French rule, these three families‚Äô houses passed along with the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Kronenburg to the Department of Ourthe, whereas the village of Kerschenbach belonged to the Mairie of Stadtkyll in the Department of Sarre. Even ecclesiastically, these three houses went their separate way, passing in 1801 along with Kronenburg to the Diocese of Li√®ge and in 1821 to the Archdiocese of Cologne. The Cologne Vicariate called Kerschenbach ‚Äúpart Spanish ‚Äì part Gerolstein territory‚Äù. The two priests, one each from Stadtkyll and Kronenburg, got together on this matter and decided that they would both go about spiritual duties in Kerschenbach, of whichever of them it was asked, or whichever of them happened to be in Kerschenbach at any particular time. After the time of French rule, this situation did not straighten itself out instantly. Instead, the three houses passed first under terms issued at the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) along with Kronenburg to Meckenburg-Strelitz until 1819, when it became, again along with Kronenburg, part of Prussia‚Äôs Rhine Province, and more locally part of the Schleiden district in the Regierungsbezirk of Aachen. Kerschenbach, on the other hand, passed to the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Stadtkyll and thereby in 1816 to the newly formed Pr√ºm district. Owing to the many petitions, the whole village of Kerschenbach was eventually assigned to the B√ºrgermeisterei (later Amtsb√ºrgermeisterei) of Stadtkyll, thus ending the saga of the three houses. Since administrative reform in 1970, Kerschenbach has belonged to the Verbandsgemeinde of Obere Kyll in the Daun district, although this was renamed the Vulkaneifel district in 2007.Kerschenbach‚Äôs history  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Gules a pallet wavy argent between a sword palewise, the point to chief and an ear of wheat, both Or, in a chief of the third a fess dancetty of three of the first. The fess dancetty (horizontal zigzag) in the chief refers to Kerschenbach's mediaeval allegiance to the Lordship of Manderscheid-Blankenheim. The Counts of Manderscheid bore the red fess dancetty on a gold field in their arms. The silver wavy pallet (vertical wavy stripe) stands for the municipality's namesake brook. The chapel's and the municipality's patron saint is Saint Lucy, who died as a martyr by the dagger or sword. The gold sword, however, also refers to the mediaeval high court. Even today, the rural cadastral area named ‚ÄúAm Gericht‚Äù (‚ÄúAt the Court‚Äù) still recalls the former tribunal. The ear of wheat stands for what was for centuries the village's main livelihood: agriculture, and also for Kerschenbach's rural character.Description and explanation of Kerschenbach‚Äôs arms  Culture and sightseeing   Buildings  * Saint Lucy‚Äôs Catholic Church (branch church; Filialkirche St. Lucia), Ormonter Stra√üe 10, Late Gothic aisleless church, remodelled several times, among other times 1681, churchyard, grave crosses in churchyard wall, whole complex. * Ormonter Stra√üe 4 ‚Äì house, part of an estate complex from 1777. * Stadtkyller Stra√üe 1 ‚Äì timber-frame house, part of an estate complex, partly solid, roof with half- hipped gables, possibly from late 18th century. * Stadtkyller Stra√üe 6 ‚Äì plastered bungalow.Directory of Cultural Monuments in Vulkaneifel district  References   External links  * Kerschenbach in the collective municipality‚Äôs Web pages * Municipality‚Äôs official webpage Category:Municipalities in Rhineland-Palatinate Category:Vulkaneifel ","title":"Kerschenbach"},{"id":"13081248","text":"Kirchweiler is an Ortsgemeinde ‚Äì a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality ‚Äì in the Vulkaneifel district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.

Kirchweiler lies west of the Scharteberg with its Eifel Transmitter at an elevation of 540 m above sea level. Its area is 6.31 km¬≤.  History  In 1201, Kirchweiler had its first documentary mention when a nobleman from Berlingen, then held by Himmerod Abbey, bequeathed an estate near Kirchweiler. As of 1398, the undisputed overlord was the Electorate of Trier. In 1600, sixteen hearths (that is, households) were registered in the village, whose ownership had since passed to the Lordship of Daun and then to that of Kesselburg. The number fell in the wake of the Plague and the Thirty Years' War until in 1654, there were only six households left. In 1684, this had already risen back up to ten households, suggesting a population figure of roughly 50. At this time, the villagers in Kirchweiler earned their livelihood mainly through agriculture. In 1624, 11 of the 13 households worked in this field. As for the other two households, there were a craftsman and one villager who had no occupation. The population kept growing on into the 19th century. Kirchweiler passed to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. In 1862, there were 376 people living in Kirchweiler. Since 1947, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate.

In North Carolina, it is a major east‚Äìwest highway that runs from the Tennessee border to the Atlantic Ocean. From the Tennessee state line near Paint Rock to Asheville it follows the historic Dixie Highway, running concurrently with US 25\\\\. The highway connects several major cities including Asheville, High Point, Greensboro, Durham, Raleigh, Goldsboro, and New Bern. From Beaufort on east, US 70 shares part of the Outer Banks Scenic Byway, a National Scenic Byway, before ending in the community of Atlantic, located along Core Sound. US 70 is an original US Highway, signed on November 11, 1926, when the US Highway System was approved. Since then, the highway has been realigned in places. One of the larger extensions of US 70 came in 1931 when the highway was extended concurrently along NC 101 from Beaufort to Atlantic. While sections of US 70 have been converted to freeway standards, along most of the routing it is a four-lane highway. Several new projects beginning in the 2000s have placed US 70 on interstate grade freeways, such as the Clayton and Goldsboro Bypasses. On May 24, 2016, AASHTO assigned the Future I-42 designation to the majority of US 70's routing east of Garner.  Route description  US 70 travels through several diverse regions in North Carolina, including the Bald and Black Mountains of Western North Carolina, the rural Foothills, the urban Piedmont, the farmlands of the Inner Banks, and the coastal communities of the Crystal Coast. All of US 70 east of Durham, and smaller segments including Statesville to Salisbury and Lexington to Greensboro, are listed in the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. US 70 also overlaps two state scenic byways: the Appalachian Medley, from Hot Springs to Walnut, and the Clayton Bypass Scenic Byway, from I-40 to US 70 Bus.  Western Mountains and Foothills  US 70, in concurrency with US 25, enters from Tennessee as a two-lane mountain highway meandering through the Bald Mountains. In Hot Springs it crosses the French Broad River and the Appalachian Trail, then goes northeasterly through Tanyard Gap to Hurricane. Proceeding south, it goes through the Walnut Mountains and then joins NC 213 near Walnut. Continuing on a more southeasterly routing, it becomes the US 25 Bus./US 70 Bus. split-off towards downtown Marshall at Mashburn Gap. At the Hayes Run Road interchange, NC 213 splits and continues towards Mars Hill. Before US 25 Bus./US 70 Bus. rejoins at Ivy River Road, the highway widens to four lanes; afterwards, it follows along Ivy Creek before crossing the Madison/Buncombe county line. In Weaverville, US 25/US 70 joins Future I-26/US 19/US 23 (exit 19), then continues south on the Morris L. McGough Freeway to Asheville. US 25 separates at Merrimon Avenue (exit 23), continuing solo into downtown Asheville. At the Patton Avenue interchange, US 70 switches to an I-240/US 74A concurrency as it goes east along the Billy Graham Freeway. At Charlotte Avenue (exit 5B), US 70/US 74A splits from I-240 before it goes through the Beaucatcher Cut. At College Street, which changes into Tunnel Road, US 70/US 74A passes through Beaucatcher Tunnel (built in 1927). On the eastern side of Beaucatcher Mountain, US 70/US ;74A goes through a commercial corridor that leads to Asheville Mall, where US 74A splits and continues along South Tunnel Road and connects with I-240 at a unique three-level diamond interchange. In the East Asheville area is the historic Oteen Veterans Administration Hospital Historic District as well as the Blue Ridge Parkway. At Jones Mountain, US 70 leaves the Asheville city limits and begins its parallel north of I-40, as it goes through Swannanoa and Black Mountain. At Ridgecrest, US 70 merges with I-40 (exit 65). At Swannanoa Gap it crosses the Eastern Continental Divide (elevation ) and enters McDowell County. At the top of the gap, in addition to a reduced speed limit there is a truck information station that requires all trucks to go through before continuing. The following descent is a 6% grade along Youngs Ridge to Old Fort, along which are several reduce-speed warning lights and three runaway truck ramps. It is likely that, on both on the ascent and the descent, most trucks and some cars will be going slower than posted speed limits, and that, despite the fact that this section is six lanes wide, slower vehicles may be traveling in the passing lanes. At Old Fort, US 70 splits from I-40 (at exit 72) and travels through the downtown area and by the Mountain Gateway Museum and Heritage Center. East of Old Fort, US 70 travels northeasterly towards Marion and forms the southern boundary of the Pisgah National Forest. At Pleasant Gardens, it connects with NC 80, which travelers can follow towards Mount Mitchell, the highest peak east of the Mississippi River. Crossing the Catawba River and entering Marion, US 70 connects with US 221/NC 226 and then forms a short concurrency with US 221 Bus. along Main Street. East of Marion, US 70 connects with NC 126 in Nebo, where travelers can visit Lake James State Park. Entering Burke County near Bridgewater, US 70 passes through Glen Alpine and then enters Morganton, where it forms a brief concurrency with US 64 as it proceeds along Fleming Drive, while US 70 Bus. passes through the downtown area. Continuing east, it goes through the towns of Drexel, Valdese, Rutherford College, Connelly Springs and Hildebran before crossing into Catawba County at Long View. In Hickory, US 70 serves as the town's commercial corridor as US 321 Bus. begins its concurrency at the US 321 interchange. In Conover, US 321 Bus. turns at Northwest Boulevard towards Newton and then crosses NC 16\\\\. Continuing east through Claremont and Catawba, US 70 crosses the Catawba River for the second time and enters Iredell County.  Piedmont Triad and the Triangle  After passing through Celeste Hinkle and by the Statesville Regional Airport, US 70 enters the city limits of Statesville and connects with US 64/NC 90 at the intersection of Newton Drive and Garner Bagnal Boulevard. Passing south of the downtown area, it begins to parallel the Norfolk Southern Railway south to Salisbury. Crossing US 21 at Shelton Avenue and I-77 (exit 43A), it leaves Statesville and proceeds southeasterly along Statesville Boulevard, also known as the Jim Graham Highway, through an area of farmland and factories that are wedged between the four-lane highway and the railway. After crossing into Rowan County, US 70 goes through Cleveland and shares a short concurrency with NC 801 near Barber before entering Salisbury. On Jake Alexander Boulevard, US 70 shares a concurrency with US 601 until the Rowan Mills area, where it switches onto Main Street with US 29 and later NC 150\\\\. Traveling northeasterly through downtown Salisbury, it then goes by the North Carolina Transportation Museum before passing through Spencer. At the Yadkin River, the four-lane highway reduces to two-lanes as it crosses over into Davidson County. Adjacent to the bridge over which US 29/US 70/NC 150 travels are the Wil-Cox Bridge, a concrete arch pedestrian bridge, and two North Carolina Railroad (NCRR) Warren truss bridges. US 29/US 70/NC 150, along WilCox Way towards Spencer At from the Yadkin River, NC 150 splits towards Churchland while US 29/US 70 merges with I-85/US 52 (at exit 84). After a concurrency, I-85 splits off and continues towards Greensboro, and I-285 begins (at exit 87). Entering the Lexington city limits, additional route changes occur; I-285/US 52 departs (at exit 87) towards Winston-Salem, and US 64 merges from Mocksville. After skirting north of downtown Lexington, US 64 departs again towards Asheboro, and the highway continues northeasterly as a four-lane expressway. After passing through Thomasville, it then proceeds briefly through Randolph County and then into High Point and Guilford County. Staying south of the downtown area, it connects with I-74 with its second three-level diamond interchange. Near Groometown, the highway merges with I-85 for a brief concurrency (between exits 118 and 120A). To connect with I-73/US 421 (Greensboro Urban Loop), travelers must continue on I-85 or stay in the left travel lanes; this stretch of freeway features numerous sign gantries and surface markings to guide travelers. Continuing northeasterly along Preddy Boulevard into Greensboro, it connects with South US 220 (at exit 35), where travelers can connect to Interstate 85, or go northbound to reach I-40 west or the Greensboro Coliseum. Merging onto I-40/US 220/US 29 (at exit 219), the following stretch of freeway is known locally as \\"Death Valley\\", a nickname given because of the high number of deaths due to car crashes in this area, owed to having five routes attached to it. Separating from I-40/I-85 Bus. at the O'Henry Boulevard interchange (at exit 223), US 29/US 70/US 220 continue north, passing by the North Carolina A&T; campus to the Wendover Avenue interchange, where the 3 routes break up. With US 29 continuing north along the expressway towards Reidsville and Danville, Virginia, and US 220 North going west on Wendover Avenue to follow Battleground Road to Summerfield, US 70 again proceeds solo, east on Wendover Ave towards Burlington. At the eastern edge of Greensboro's city limit, US 70 connects with I-785/I-840 (Greensboro Urban Loop). Leaving Greensboro and entering McLeansville, US 70 takes on the name \\"Burlington Road\\" as well as the Charlotte Hawkins Brown Memorial Highway. Here it is a two lane road, and is also an important route that connects McLeansville with other small towns such as Sedalia and Gibsonville, as well as the Rock Creek and Stoney Creek centers in Whitsett; east of Whitsett, it enters Alamance County. Passing south of Elon, US 70 runs on Church St, a four lane retail corridor, as it enters Burlington's city limits. It connects with NC 87 and NC 100 as well as NC 62 as it enters downtown Burlington. Sharing a brief concurrency with NC 62 through the downtown area, it then proceeds southeasterly to Haw River. As it nears the town of Haw River, it then goes northeasterly again to bypass the town and crosses over the Haw River via Three Governors Bridge; heading easterly again, the highway drops back to two lanes after connecting with NC 49. At Mebane, US 70 crosses into Orange County. Passing through the communities of Miles and Efland, and parallels the NCRR railroad just to the north, US 70 makes a unique median divide in Duke Forest to merge with the I-85 Connector (SR 1239); constructed in the mid-1950s when US 70 was rerouted here onto what is now I-40/I-85. Crossing the Eno River, US 70 passes along the northern edge of Hillsborough, while US 70 Bus. goes through its downtown area. Crossing the Eno River again, it borders along the Eno River State Park, while traveling through another area of the Duke Forest. At Eno, US 70 merges onto I-85 (exit 170), while US 70 Bus. continues along its former alignment to Bennett Place. Entering both Durham and Durham County, I-85/US 70 maintains an east‚Äìwest routing north of the downtown area, along a stretch of highway dedicated to Dr. John H. Franklin. At exit 174A US 15/US 501 begins a concurrency; at exit 176B US 501 continues north along Duke Street. At exit 178 US 70 leaves I-85/US 15, which continues towards Oxford and Petersburg. Traveling on a southeasterly direction along four-lane freeway, it rejoins US 70 Bus. at Miami Boulevard and becomes an expressway. At Bethesda, Miami Boulevard (SR 1959) continues south into the Research Triangle Park, while US 70 enters Wake County along New Raleigh Highway. After crossing Raleigh city limits, US 70, here called Glenwood Avenue, makes a connection with I-540 (exit 292), which goes to the front entrance of RDU Airport; the following Lumley Road/Westgate Road interchange (at exit 293) goes to the North Cargo and General Aviation area of RDU Airport. Adjacent to the airport is William B. Umstead State Park. With NC 50 joining US 70 at Creedmoor Road, US 70 crosses under I-440/US 1 after passing by Crabtree Valley Mall. Inside the Raleigh Beltline, US 70/NC 50 travel through a residential area until Wade Avenue, where they join US 401 along Capital Boulevard. In the downtown area, Capital Boulevard splits into Dawson and McDowell Streets; various sites are adjacent or nearby, including the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and North Carolina Museum of History (via Jones Street), the North Carolina State Capitol (via Morgan Street), the Raleigh Convention Center, the Red Hat Amphitheater, and the Duke Energy Center for the Performing Arts (via South Street). Leaving the downtown area after the Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard/Western Boulevard interchange, Dawson-McDowell Streets merge and become Saunders Street, which promptly exits the Raleigh Beltline crossing under I-40/US 64\\\\. In Garner, US 401 departs along Fayetteville Street towards Fuquay-Varina, followed by NC 50 along Benson Road towards Benson. East of Garner, US 70 merges with I-40 (exit 306A), while US 70 Bus. head towards Clayton. At the Wake/Johnston county line, US 70 splits from I-40 for the last time (at exit 309) and onto the Clayton Bypass.  Coastal Plain and Down East  Oxeye daisies and Coreopsis lanceolata along the Clayton Bypass After along the Clayton Bypass, US 70 crosses US 70 Bus., from Clayton to Smithfiled, and changes from freeway to expressway. Continuing through Wilson's Mills and crossing the Neuse River, it enters Selma, where travelers have the choice to stay on mainline US 70, connecting with US 301/NC 39/NC 96, I-95, and US 70A, or take US 70 Bypass to avoid all that. Southeast of Selma, US 70 Bus. rejoins from Smithfield and near Princeton, US 70A rejoins from Pine Level. East of Princeton, it enters Wayne County. Northwest of Goldsboro, the US 70 Bypass spurs northeast towards I-795, while US 70 goes into Goldsboro. In Goldsboro, it also connects with I-795 and then joins a concurrency with US 13/US 117, passing north of the downtown area while US 70 Bus. goes through it via Grantham Street. After , US 117 separates and continues north; at Berkeley Boulevard, US 13 separates towards Snow Hill and also connects to Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. East of Goldsboro, US 70 Bus. reunites along Ash Street. Entering Lenoir County, near LaGrange, US 70 Bypass reconnects with US 70, where the highway continues east. US 70 connects with NC 148 at Falling Creek, which goes to the North Carolina Global TransPark. As it enters Kinston, it is joined by US 258, from Snow Hill, as they both bypass south of the downtown area, while US 70 Bus./US 258 Bus. go through the downtown area. Near Dupreeville, US 70 Bus./US 258 Bus. rejoin; they then separate, with US 258 continuing south to Richlands, while NC 58 shares a short concurrency before continuing towards Trenton. Bypassing south of Dover, in Jones County, US 70 travels through the Great Dover Swamp, most of which has been drained and converted to farmland. After it enters Craven County, south of Cove City. At Clarks Road (exit 409) is the Craven County Rest Area. At exit 410A US 17 joins in concurrency as the freeway enters New Bern. The freeway, designated the Richard Spaight Memorial Highway, passes southeast of the downtown area and enters James City after crossing the Trent River via the Freedom Memorial Bridges. Traveling southeast along the U.S. Marine Corp Highway, US 70 passes by the Coastal Carolina Regional Airport, and then enters the Croatan National Forest before reaching the Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, in Havelock. Going south, it crosses into Carteret County and then passes west of Newport as it leaves the Croatan National Forest and into Morehead City. After connecting with the eastern terminus of NC 24, which goes to Swansboro, US 70, along Arendell Street, is split in the middle by the NCRR railroad. Adjacent to the Carteret Community College is the Carteret County Visitor Center; the Atlantic Beach Bridge connects Morehead City with Bogue Banks, including Fort Macon State Park. Through the downtown area, it reaches the end of the peninsula and the Port of Morehead City. Crossing over the Newport River/Intracoastal Waterway, it travels along Radio Island and then crosses Beaufort Channel (Gallants Creek) via Grayden Paul Bridge into downtown Beaufort. Traveling along Cedar and Live Oak Streets, US 70 goes north out of Beaufort and then east, crossing over the North River and Ward Creek to Otway. Going southeast to Smyrna, it then turns northeasterly along the Core Sound. After crossing the Salter's Creek via Dan Taylor Memorial Bridge it connects with NC 12 continuing to Cedar Island and the Outer Banks. Through the Sea Level community and into Atlantic, where US 70 ends at School Drive, at , the road ends at Little Port Brook.  History  Established as an original U.S. Route (1926), US 70 was assigned along the Great Central Highway, in concurrency with NC 10, between Asheville and Beaufort; northwest of Asheville, US 70 shared concurrency with US 25/NC 20 (Dixie Highway) to the Tennessee state line. The original routing of US 70 connects the same cities as it does today through North Carolina, with interstate highways in parallel or in concurrency with it.  Early state routes  In 1916 the North Carolina State Highway Commission prepared a map for the Five Year Federal Aid Program. The general present-day routing of US 70 was a mix of both improved and unimproved highways. When the highways were signed, the majority of US 70's routing ran along NC 10 which was built from the Georgia state line south of Murphy to Beaufort. However, the routing north and west of Asheville comprised parts of NC 20 and NC 29\\\\. US 70 was established as an original U.S. route in 1926.  Original routing  US 70 was established as an original US highway running from US 66 near Holbrook, Arizona, to Beaufort, North Carolina. The highway entered the state at the Tennessee state line and followed along a topsoil road concurrently with NC 20\\\\. In Marshall, US 70 turned onto NC 20's former routing and followed it to the south. Upon reaching NC 29, US 70 turned to the south along the hard surface road and followed it to Asheville. North of Biltmore, US 70 turned left and followed along a hard surfaced road in concurrency with NC 10\\\\. Between Old Fort and Garden City the road switched to an oil-treated road and then briefly switched to a topsoil road between Garden City and Marion. As the road left Marion to the east, it again became a hard surface road. The highway continued east through Morganton and Hickory. In Conover, the highway turned due south until reaching Newton. In Newton, US 70/NC 10 turned to the left and followed a topsoil road to the southeast. The highway made several turns between the northeast and the southeast before reaching Statesville. The highway turned left in Statesville to follow along a hard-surfaced highway to Salisbury. Upon reaching Salisbury, US 70/NC 10 turned to the left and followed concurrently along US 170 to the northeast. In Greensboro, the route turned to the east through Burlington to Graham. The highway followed a brief concurrency with NC 62 between Graham and Mebane before again turning to the east. The route ran through Hillsborough and Durham before turning south through Brassfield and Nelson. In Cary, US 70/NC 10 met up with US 1/NC 50 and followed a brief concurrency between Cary and Raleigh. After passing through Raleigh, US 70 turned to the south to run through Garner before turning east to pass through Auburn and Clayton. Upon reaching Smithfield, the highway turned to the left and followed briefly along NC 22 to the northeast. Just before reaching Selma, US 70/NC 10 turned right to head to the southeast. The hard-surfaced highway passed through Goldsboro and La Grange before reaching Kinston. In Kinston, the highway turned to the northeast and ran briefly concurrent with NC 11 before running east toward Fort Barnwell. As the highway neared the Neuse River, it turned to the southeast to parallel the river to New Bern. Passing through New Bern, the highway continued to follow the Neuse until reaching Havelock where the river turns further to the east. Shortly after passing Havelock, the road turned toward the east. After intersecting NC 101 the road type changed to a topsoil road. The highway continued as a topsoil road until North Harlowe, where it became a graded road. Just before entering Beaufort the highway changed back to a hard surface road. US 70 and NC 10 both ended in Beaufort.  Early 20th century  In 1928 US 70/NC 10 was swapped with route NC 101 towards Beaufort. Around 1929 US 70 was placed on its modern routing between Marion and Nebo; its former routing becoming part of NC 105\\\\. North of Newton, US 70 was given a new primary routing in concurrency with NC 110\\\\. In Raleigh, US 70 was placed on a new primary routing along Western Boulevard, then north along Boylan Avenue to South Street, then Fayetteville Street to Lenoir Street, and finally East Street; the old alignment along Hillsborough Road and by the state capital remained part of US 1/NC 50. In 1930 US 70/NC 10 was swapped with NC 100 between Gibsonville and Burlington. Also around that time US 70/NC 10 was rerouted in downtown Salisbury via Innis Street to Main Street, leaving behind Fulton and Liberty streets. In 1931 US 70 was extended northeast from Beaufort to Atlantic, ending at Cedar Island Road (SR 1387). Around 1932 US 70 was rerouted in downtown Asheville from Biltmore Avenue onto Tunnel Road; the old alignment remained part of US 25. In 1934 both NC 10 and NC 20 were removed along US 70's route. By 1936, US 70 was placed on First Avenue through Hickory and was removed from Beaman Road near New Bern. In 1939 US 70 was removed from Hollins Road in Marshall.  Mid 20th century  In 1941 US 70 was swapped with NC 55 from Kinston to west of New Bern. Also around that same year, US 70 was given its modern routing between the Yadkin River and Lexington. By 1944, US 70 was removed from Old Highway 70 Loop (SR 1620) near Icard; in Havelock, US 70 was removed from Church Road, Miller Boulevard and Roosevelt Boulevard to its modern alignment. Around 1948, US 70 was swapped with US 70A in the Hickory-Conover area and with US 70A in Hillsborough. By 1949, US 70 was placed on its modern routing between Swannanoa and Black Mountain and between Lexington and Thomasville, swapped with US 70A in High Point, removed from Bennett Memorial Drive in Durham, and switched from Wilson Street to Kornegay Street in Dover. In 1952 US 70 was placed on new bypasses in Lexington, Thomasville, and Durham; all former alignments became individual or extensions of existing US 70A. By 1953, US 70 was rerouted back onto Fulton Street and Liberty Street in Salisbury, US 70 was split on one-way streets in downtown Greensboro, and US 70 was rerouted onto Eden and Front Streets in New Bern. In 1954 US 70 was rerouted onto Woodfin Street in Asheville; placed on its modern alignment between Black Mountain and Old Fort, leaving behind Mill Creek Road (SR 1407)/Old US 70 (SR 1400), placed on one-way streets in downtown Raleigh, and rerouted on a more direct route between Smithfield and Princeton along existing secondary roads, leaving behind US 70A through Selma. Around 1956 US 70 was placed on new bypass south of Morganton. By 1957, US 70 was split on one-way streets in downtown Marion, replaced US 70A in Salisbury, leaving the downtown area, and placed on its modern alignment in western Rowan County. It was placed on its modern alignment from Thomasville to Greensboro, then continued east on freeway to Efland, its old alignment becoming US 70A; it was placed on new bypass east of Durham, its former alignment along Avondale Drive, Greer Street, and Miami Boulevard becoming parts of NC 55, NC 98, and US 70A respectively. It was placed on bypass north Goldsboro, leaving behind US 70A through the downtown area, and placed on bypass south of Kinston, also leaving behind US 70A through its downtown area. Around 1958 US 70 was removed from Ann Street to its current routing along Cedar Street in Beaufort. In 1960 US 25/US 70 was placed on new bypass north of Marshall, leaving behind US 25 Bus./US 70 Bus. In 1961 US 70 was removed from Woodfin Street and onto the East‚ÄìWest Freeway in Asheville; in Salisbury, US 70 was rerouted following Innis Street south to I-85, then continued north in concurrency into Davidson County. In 1963 US 70 was rerouted back along its former alignment between Greensboro and Efland, replacing part of US 70A; the former freeway alignment remains part of I-85. Around 1964 US 70 was placed on new causeway over the Newport River/Intracoastal Waterway; bridges on the old alignment were removed, leaving Old Causeway Road (SR 1205) on Radio Island. Around 1965 US 70 was removed from I-85 in Rowan County, rerouted through downtown Salisbury on one-way streets, then north along Main Street in concurrency with US 29\\\\. In 1967 US 70 was rerouted onto O. Henry Boulevard to Wendover Avenue in Greensboro; its old alignment along Market Street was downgraded to secondary roads. In the same year, US 70 was adjusted at the Salisbury and Wilmington Street split. By 1968, US 70 was placed on a new bypass west of Newport, leaving behind Chatham Street (SR 1247). In 1969 US 70 was placed on a new bypass south of La Grange, leaving behind Washington Street (SR 1603). In 1970 US 70 eastbound was removed from Main Street and onto Logan Street in Marion. In the same year, US 70 was placed on a new bypass north of Princeton, leaving behind Dr. Donnie H. Jones Jr. Boulevard (SR 2556). Aerial photograph of US 70 bypassing the city of New Bern, crossing the Neuse and Trent Rivers  Late 20th century  In 1972 US 19/US 23/US 70 was removed from Merrimon Avenue, between Asheville and Woodfin, and placed on a new freeway; US 25 remains along the old alignment. In Raleigh, US 70/NC 50 were removed from Glenwood Avenue and placed on the Raleigh Beltline to North Boulevard/Downtown Boulevard. In Atlantic, US 70 was truncated to its current eastern terminus at School Drive; the former alignment was abandoned, with a bridge removed from the Atlantic Harbor of Refuge Channel. From 1978 to 1979, in phases, US 70 was placed on a new bypass south of Dover and New Bern; the former alignment became Old US Highway 70 (SR 1005). In 1981 US 70 was rerouted from Crosstown Expressway onto Charlotte, Poplar, and Pine Streets (the latter two removed for College Street) to Beaucatcher Tunnel; this replaced part of NC 694, while Crosstown Expressway was rerouted through Beaucatcher Cut. In Salisbury, US 70 was rerouted south along Jake Alexander Boulevard, in concurrency with US 601, to Main Street, where it joined US 29 through the city; the old alignment along Innis, Liberty, Fulton, and Lee Streets was downgraded to secondary roads. In Burlington, US 70/NC 62 was realigned along one-way streets along Church and Fisher Streets, eliminating the use of Davis and Hoke Streets. In 1982 US 25/US 70 was placed on a new alignment north of Marshall to Weaverville; the old alignment became an extension of existing business loops in Marshall and Weaverville, and some sections were downgraded to secondary roads around Woodfin. In the same year, upgrades between Black Mountain and Old Fort were completed, allowing the addition of I-40 alongside US 70. In 1987 US 25/US 70 was placed on a new bypass west of Walnut, leaving behind Walnut Drive (SR 1349). In 1989 US 70 was removed from downtown Raleigh and was completely rerouted onto the Raleigh Beltway going east, then south, continuing at I-40 southeasterly to exit 306; the former alignment through Raleigh and Garner became US 70 Bus., though unsigned inside the Raleigh Beltline. In 1990 US 70 was rerouted onto Industrial Boulevard and Monroe Street, from Newton Drive to east of I-77, in Statesville; the former alignment along Front Street and Salisbury Road was downgraded to secondary roads. In 1991 one-way streets along Logan, New, and Garden Streets were discontinued and reallocated to the city of Marion to maintain; US 70 reverted to two-way traffic along Main and Court Streets. In the same year, US 70 was removed from the Raleigh Beltline and rerouted along Gleenwood Avenue, Wade Avenue, Capital Boulevard, Dawson-McDowell Streets, and Saunders Street. South of the Raleigh Beltline, it continued along Saunders, then Wilmington Street, and through Garner to I-40; the reroute in Wake County replaced all of US 70 Bus. In 1993 US 70 was rerouted onto a new bypass north of Haw River, leaving Main Street (SR 1801) and a short concurrency with NC 49. In Orange and Durham counties, US 70's concurrency with I-85 was extended as part of a major reconfiguration of exits 172 and 173. The original configuration had Hillsborough Road weave in and out of I-85 between the two exits; the realignment of US 70 allowed NCDOT to remove the weave and re- purpose exit 172 as an interchange for NC 147 (completed in 2001). The former alignment became an extension of US 70 Bus., which for the remainder of the decade had a hidden concurrency with I-85/US 70, with the weave persisting during construction. In 1997 NCDOT established the oddity known as the four US 70s of Selma-Smithfield: US 70, US 70A, US 70 Bus. and US 70 Bypass. Before 1997, US 70 was routed through Smithfield while US 70A followed the pre-1954 route through Selma. The new configuration established US 70 following its former route east to Selma, with a short bypass route of I-95 (no interchange), then reconnecting to an existing section of US 70 east of I-95; US 70A was truncated near the I-95 interchange in Selma, while the former alignment through Smithfield became a business route.  21st century  On June 9, 2008, the Clayton Bypass opened, redirecting US 70 onto I-40 between exits 306 to 309 and then on a new four-lane freeway bypass south of Clayton. Planning for the bypass began in 1991, but construction did not start until 2005 because of several delays regarding the Dwarf wedgemussel, an endangered species, habitat in the area. Originally scheduled for completion in June 2009, a severe drought in 2007‚Äì2008 allowed construction to proceed more rapidly than anticipated. NCDOT was given the approval by AASHTO to officially designate US 70 along the bypass on May 6, 2008, with the former alignment becoming an extension of US 70 Bus. Compared to the former alignment through Clayton, the bypass is estimated to cut fifteen minutes of travel time for drivers traveling between Raleigh and eastern North Carolina. In 2010 US 70 was placed on Statesville Boulevard, a then new four-lane expressway running east of Statesville towards Salisbury; the former alignment was downgraded to a secondary road. In 2013 US 70 was placed on a new freeway, with an interchange with NC 148 at Falling Creek. Justification for the improvement was given as a need for better service to the Global TransPark; the old alignment was reduced from four to two lanes, becoming Sanderson Way (SR 2032). In December 2011 the first section of the Goldsboro Bypass was opened from I-795 to Wayne Memorial Drive. The section was temporarily numbered as NC 44, while the western and eastern sections were under construction. The western section of the bypass from US 70 west of Goldsboro to I-795 opened on October 17, 2015. The final section from Wayne Memorial Drive to US 70 was completed in May 2016. The route is currently listed as US 70 Bypass.  Future   Greensboro / High Point  Currently, the portion of US 70 going west of Greensboro runs concurrently with US 29 and US 220 (south), I-40 (west), and soon to be decommissioned I-85 Business (south), while the portion going east of Greensboro, remains on Wendover Avenue East leaving town towards Burlington. On, October 5, 2019, NCDOT submitted an application to AASHTO, and received approval, for the re-routing of US 70 in Greensboro, High Point, and a part of Thomasville. Under the state plan, it will continue west along Wendover Avenue through Greensboro to NC Highway 68 (Eastchester Drive) in High Point, and then onto NC 68, south-bound from High Point to the southern terminus of NC 68 in Thomasville. According to NCDOT, this will provide a more direct, continuous route through the cities of Greensboro and High Point, improve regional connectivity, and remove traffic from concurrent interstate routes (e.g. I-40's \\"Death Valley\\" interchange in Greensboro, and the I-85/US 29 interchange near Jamestown).  East End Connector  Located in Durham along Miami Boulevard, the East End Connector connects US 70 with NC 147 (the Durham Freeway). NCDOT has proposed I-885 for the Segments of US 70, the East End Connector, and NC 147 between I-85 and I-40. The justification for its construction is to address the fact that two major east‚Äìwest highways in Durham had no direct connection, causing motorists and truckers to use other streets to access either highway. Environmental studies were concluded in 2011 and property acquisition began in April 2012. At a cost of $142 million, construction began in February 2015 and is scheduled to be completed in January 2020. The project will also add or change interchanges at Miami Boulevard/Carr Road and NC 98 (Holloway Street).  Raleigh to Morehead City  A multi-county project, also known as the \\"US 70 Corridor\\" or \\"Super 70\\", is a collection of several projects along US 70 to improve passenger and freight movement eventually leading to the establishment of Interstate 42, which is the US Department of Transportation's High Priority Corridor #82.https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/Planning/national_highway_system/high_priority_corridors/hpcor.cfm The entire project has a budgeted cost (as of late 2018) of about $1.3 billion, and about 29 miles still without a budget. Some projects like the Clayton and Goldsboro bypasses are completed, while others still have yet to be scheduled. The project involves the counties of Wake, Johnston, Wayne, Lenoir, Jones, Craven, and Carteret.  Wilson's Mills improvements  A section of US 70 at Wilson's Mills, connecting to the Clayton Bypass in the west will be upgraded to a freeway for an estimated $31 million. Construction is planned to begin in 2020 and finish around 2022.http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/johnston- county/article59096488.html  Smithfield/Selma improvements  Improvements are in the planning stages for the segment of US 70 between Wilson's Mills and Princeton. Some of this section is already freeway, but will require improvements to bring it up to interstate standards and add an interchange with I-95. Adding the interchange will require shifting I-95 east to incorporate the new changes. This proposed project is not currently budgeted nor does it have a timeline for completion.  Princeton bypass  The existing Princeton bypass will be improved to interstate standards. The project is estimated to cost $170 million, with construction scheduled to begin in 2028.https://ncdot.publicinput.com/us70_goldsborotoprinceton  Kinston bypass  The Kinston Bypass is a project that has been in the planning stages since the 1990s. The project was put on hold until 2007 when NCDOT revitalized the project. While several northern bypasses were planned, in January 2014 the northern bypasses were removed in favor of a southern alternative. The project was de-funded in 2014 with the release of the 2015‚Äì2024 State Transportation Improvement Plan, and studies were suspended. With the Super 70/ Interstate 42 project, studies for the southern alternate began again in 2016 and right-of-way acquisition is scheduled for 2022 with construction tentatively scheduled to begin in 2024. The Kinston bypass will link to the Goldsboro Bypass and existing freeway around LaGrange in the west and the existing freeway section in Craven County to the east. The highway will be between 21 and 25 miles long, and is expected to cost $379 Million.https://www.ncdot.gov/projects/kinstonbypass/  James City freeway  In James City, a segment of the US 70 improvement project will upgrade the existing highway to freeway standards by elevating it over existing surface streets, improving the frontage roads, and building interchanges. It will connect to the existing US 70 freeway in New Bern. This project is estimated to cost $66 million. Construction is scheduled to begin in early 2020 and be complete in early 2024.  James City to Havelock  Between James City and Havelock, a section of US 70 will be converted to interstate standards for $132 million.https://connect.ncdot.gov/projects/planning/pages/state- transportation-improvement-program.aspx The money will come primarily from a $147 million federal grant the state received in 2018.https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article212607139.html With the release of the 2020 draft STIP, it was revealed that NCDOT is attempting to start construction in 2020.  Havelock bypass  The Havelock Bypass is a planned four-lane freeway intended to improve existing sections of US 70 and a bypass west of Havelock, through the Croatan National Forest. Draft and environmental studies began in September 2011 and were completed in January 2016. Property acquisition started in 2016, with construction to begin in February 2019. Estimated to cost $173 million, it is scheduled to be completed in 2022.  Gallants channel bridge  The Gallants Channel Bridge is a project to replace the Dan Taylor Memorial Bridge by rerouting US 70 over Gallants Channel with a fixed span bridge, widened to four-lanes with a median at a new location, and building a new bridge on Turner Street, for an estimated $66.4 million. Construction began on March 25, 2015, by Conti Enterprises, Inc., of Edison, New Jersey. All work but landscaping is scheduled to be completed by July 15, 2018, with final completion expected in January 2019. Once complete, the existing bascule bridge will be removed and US 70 will be routed out of downtown Beaufort.  Other corridor projects  Other projects, including improvements between James City and Morehead City, Slocum Gate and the Newport River Bridge are in various stages of planning and construction.  Future Interstate 42  The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act), signed by President Barack Obama on December 14, 2015, added the US 70 corridor between Garner and Morehead City to the Interstate system as a future Interstate. Justification for the designation included better connections with Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, the North Carolina Global Transpark, Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, and the Port of Morehead City with the rest of state and the eastern seaboard. With no specified number codified in the act, the Regional Transportation Alliance (RTA) expected this corridor to be called I-46 or another suitable designation, and the US Highway 70 Corridor Commission recommended I-50. On March 30, 2016, Governor Pat McCrory and various officials unveiled \\"Future Interstate\\" signage along the corridor. In the upcoming AASHTO Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbering, NCDOT proposed I-36 for this route. On May 24, 2016, AASHTO assigned Interstate 42 for the route.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth.  Constituent communities  The outlying village of Eigelbach on the bed of a dry maar, the Eigelbacher Maar, is an Ortsteil of Kopp.  History  In 1286, Kopp had its first documentary mention. It was then held by Pr√ºm Abbey. The first hints of settlers in the area, however, date from Roman times (the Roman road between Trier and Cologne was right nearby). The name Kopp is derived from the German word Kuppe (‚Äúknoll‚Äù). In 1576, Kopp passed to the Electorate of Trier. In 1794, after the French had beaten the Austrians, the local nobles found themselves stripped of their fiefs, hunting rights and other feudal privileges by French troops. At first, the French were welcomed as liberators, but public opinion soon shifted to hatred towards people now seen as occupiers. After Napoleon's defeats at Leipzig (1813) and Waterloo (1815), Kopp found itself in Prussian hands. In the time from the turn of the 20th century to the Second World War, the people led an impoverished life, which was typical for the Eifel. Only after the war did things get better. Today Kopp is a village characteristic of the Eifel, with agriculture, light tourism and weekend daytrippers.Kopp‚Äôs history  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat  Mayor  Kopp's mayor is Klaus Breuer.

The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per chevron abased argent an axe gules bendwise sinister and an oakleaf vert bendwise in fess, and vert a waterwheel spoked of four Or. The division of the field in Kopp's arms is canting for the municipality's name, which as already explained comes from a word that means ‚Äúknoll‚Äù. The green peak serves as a graphic representation of such a thing. The gold waterwheel recalls a time when there were important gristmills and sawmills in the Fischbach valley. The axe is Saint Matthew‚Äôs attribute, thus representing the municipality‚Äôs and the chapel‚Äôs patron saint, who was beheaded with an axe. The oakleaf refers not only to the two natural monuments in Kopp, the 300-year-old Stelzeneiche (‚ÄúStilt Oak‚Äù) in the main centre and the oak in the outlying centre of Eigelbach, but also to the richly wooded municipal area.Description and explanation of Kopp‚Äôs arms  Culture and sightseeing  Agriculture and tourism are the municipality's main income sources.

History  Lissendorf lies on the former Roman road between Trier and Cologne (Via Agrippa). Many sideroads favoured settlement in this area in Roman times. Roman graves that have been unearthed confirm this. Lissendorf had its first documentary mention in Pr√ºm Abbey‚Äôs directory of holdings, the Pr√ºmer Urbar, in 893. In the Middle Ages, a noble house named ‚Äúvon Lissendorf‚Äù was mentioned. This family never attained greatness outside this region, though. Beginning in the 14th century, the village found itself in the hands of the House of Manderscheid-Blankenheim. In the 16th century, the village belonged to the County of Gerolstein. In the time of French rule, Lissendorf became the seat of the cantonal administration. By the end of the 19th century, the local railway, the Eifelbahn between Trier and Cologne, had opened.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth.  History  The discovery of a graveyard in the woods known as ‚ÄúScheid‚Äù shows that the area has been settled since prehistoric times. The graveyard dates from Hallstatt times up to the time of the Roman presence in the region (roughly 700 BC to AD 353). Finds from Roman times have also been unearthed including ceramics and coins. Two Roman settlements are known to have existed in what is now Mannebach, one each in the rural cadastral areas of ‚ÄúKl√∂ppesch‚Äù and ‚ÄúLange Bahn‚Äù, which have yielded wall remnants, bricks and potsherds that have been dated to the 3rd and 4th centuries. They are believed to have been destroyed in 353 in the Germanic invasions. Libanius reported something of the invaders‚Äô behaviour at this time: ‚Äú‚Ä¶The Germanic people dragged all objects of value, women and children along with them; the prisoners followed the procession, their packs on their backs. Whoever was unsuitable as a slave, whoever did not put up with seeing wife or daughter raped, was strangled in his misery. All our belongings they took with them, and while the victors reaped our harvest, they had the prisoners work the fields of their own land.¬ªDer Raum Hochkelberg zur R√∂merzeit¬´ in: 100 Jahre Eifelverein, Ortsgruppe Kelberg, 1988, S. 82 ff‚Äù There was no further settlement here until the Middle Ages, when it began again in the 10th and 11th centuries. Ceramic finds have been brought to light from this time, as well. In 1336, Mannebach had its first documentary mention when the Count of Virneburg sold Archbishop Balduin of Trier his castle for 2,200 Gulden, only to have the Archbishop enfeoff him with the same, while exacting a yearly tribute of 220 Gulden from the Count, which the Count paid the Archbishop mostly in produce, which, of course, the Count in turn exacted from the peasants who worked his fief. Mannebach's contribution to this was 29 Malter ‚Äì roughly 2 700 kg ‚Äì of feed oats. Mannebach was an important place in the County of Virneburg. It belonged to the so-called Upper County and was a mayoral seat. This ‚Äúmayor‚Äù, however, bore the title Heimb√ºrger, which was given a man who had actually been chosen by the community, not by the Count. This one led not only Mannebach, but also Bereborn and Kolverath. It can therefore be inferred that the 29 Malter of feed oats that Mannebach owed the Count of Virneburg each year was actually drawn from all three villages, although this is unconfirmed. Mannebach's importance was matched by its great municipal area. Even today, it is still, at 734 ha, almost one and a half times as big as Bereborn (257 ha) and Kolverath (246 ha) put together. Its importance could also be seen in the important residents. Along with the Heimb√ºrger, Mannebach was also home to a Vogt who served the Count as an official, and to various Sch√∂ffen (roughly ‚Äúlay jurists‚Äù) for the parish of Retterath. The court Sch√∂ffe Stefan Schmitt from Mannebach (died 2 January 1770) was even chairman of the court at Retterath and Vogt at the same time. The stone cross beside the Heiligenh√§uschen (a small, shrinelike structure consecrated to a saint or saints) on the way out of the village towards Retterath is believed to have been put up in 1724 as a memorial to one of his kin. Legend has it that the angel on the cross has a Virneburg countess's facial features. The Virneburg coat of arms with its seven-lozenge charge can also be made out in the angel's ruff. The Thirty Years' War was a time of great hardship and wretchedness for the whole area. The County of Virneburg, which had embraced the Evangelical faith, had supplied the Swedes at Andernach and Sinzig with provisions. After the Spaniards drove them out, things went badly for the County. Spanish troops were billeted locally, and the peasants had to feed ‚Äì and pay for ‚Äì soldiers and horses. By 1640, there were only seven families still living in Mannebach, the others all having died. In August and September 1640, two companies of foreign mercenaries swept from village to village threshing all the grain in the fields. In the decades that followed came Louis XIV's wars of plunder, which drove a great many of the impoverished population to flight.Eifeler Auswanderung nach √ñsterreich-Ungarn 1685, Jahrbuch Daun 1990, 243 f, e.m.

The red cross refers to the village's former allegiance to the Bishopric of Trier. The seven lozenges, too, recall a former allegiance, this one to the County of Virneburg. This charge is drawn from the Counts‚Äô old arms. The palm frond and the arrow are Saint Sebastian‚Äôs attributes, with the palm frond symbolizing Sebastian‚Äôs survival of an execution by bow and arrow as a sign of victory, for according to legend, Sebastian was nursed back to health after he was believed to be dead. The blue bendlet sinister stands for the brook that runs through the village, also called the Mannebach; it is the municipality‚Äôs namesake.  Culture and sightseeing   Buildings  In the Mannebach municipal forest, prehistoric barrows and Roman graves have been found, bearing witness to earlier settlement here.

At 69% of the German Weather Service's weather stations, higher figures are recorded. The driest month is April. The most rainfall comes in December. In that month, precipitation is 1.5 times what it is in April. Precipitation varies hardly at all and is distributed evenly throughout the year. Only at 0% of the weather stations are lower seasonal swings recorded.  History  The Mehren area is known to have been settled as early as late Hallstatt times, about 700 BCE. Archaeologists have named the finds from ancient settlements, because they show such a uniformity among themselves, after the biggest centre in the area, calling the artifacts part of the ‚ÄúMehren culture‚Äù. The remains of a Roman settlement were believed to have been found on the M√ºrmes (a moorland), and others have been confirmed near Schalkenmehren railway station and in Weinfeld. The Frankish settlement that followed the Roman period shows up mainly in grave finds and even in the traditional structures still seen today in the old village layout. In 1282 and 1284, Mehren had its first documentary mentions in connection with donations to Pr√ºm Abbey. According to a legend, the village of Mehren arose ‚Äúout of several estates‚Äù, or in German, aus mehreren H√∂fen, the dative form of mehrere (‚Äúseveral‚Äù) in that phrase supposedly being where the village's name came from. While it is true that such noble estates existed, the name's origins are not quite as the legend says. Clearly, the name developed from the prehistoric term mer, for ‚Äúmarshy water‚Äù, through the Old High German derivative therefrom, meri, followed by Meren (14th century), Muren (1654) and Mem (1683) to today's form, Mehren (compare the English word ‚Äúmere‚ÄùEtymology of ‚Äúmere‚Äù, as a noun meaning a small body of water (lower entry).). The most important lordly estates were the Zolverhof, the one believed to have been near the M√ºrmes, and the one that formerly stood on the Hostert, the Demeklischer Hof, which until 1482 belonged to the Count of Manderscheid. In a church register from Archbishop Heinrich von Virneburg from 1316, the parish of Meren is already listed, whereafter it was to grow until 1803 into one of the biggest and most sprawling parochial regions in the so-called Eifel Deaconry. Belonging to this body, besides the parochial seat of Mehren, were the villages of Trittscheid, Tettscheid, Ellscheid, Steineberg, Steiningen, Allscheid, Darscheid and parts of Sch√∂nbach. The oldest part of Saint Matthias‚Äôs Parish Church ‚Äì the quire ‚Äì was built in 1534 under Archbishop of Trier Josef von Metzhausen. The churchtower with the curved cupola comes from 1825, but only in the early 20th century was it given the former Himmerod Abbey church's portal. Together with the rectory, built in 1730, and the school, today a community centre, built in 1838 and 1875, the parish church forms the dominant feature of the village's appearance. The village of Mehren has grown over the centuries to a considerable size in comparison with neighbouring places. While life under the Electoral overlords brought little else but a scant livelihood in farming for the overwhelming majority of the people in Mehren, in the 19th century, there was an economic upswing during which Mehren grew into a prosperous market centre with a brewery, a tannery, many inns, craft businesses and shops. For broad sectors of the population, though, the new wealth brought no relief from the great need for a livelihood, and thus, between the years 1842 and 1890, no fewer than 364 people from Mehren emigrated to the United States.Mehren‚Äôs history ‚Äì Click on Ort.

She is the first woman to ever hold the position. In 2007, after a 22-year career in the British Army, Cameron became one of the 35 resident Warders in the Tower of London, commonly known as the Beefeaters. Originally prison guards, the Yeoman Warder's position dates back to 1485. It is now a largely ceremonial role, with responsibility for conducting guided tours and generally looking after public visitors to the Tower, as well as conducting certain other duties both inside and outside the Tower. Career British Army Cameron joined the Women's Royal Army Corps (WRAC) in June 1985 at the age of 20. She was trained as a Data Telegraphist with the Royal Corps of Signals before transferring to the Royal Army Pay Corps (RAPC) in 1988 to train as a Military Accountant, and in 2000 Cameron was awarded her Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. In 1992, WRAC and RAPC were replaced by the Adjutant General's Corps, and Cameron worked her way through the ranks in its Staff and Personnel Support Branch, completing 22 years service in the army in June 2007. Having seen service in England, Northern Ireland and Cyprus, Cameron ended her Army career at the rank of Warrant Officer Class 2, holding the post of Superintendent Clerk in 145 (Home Counties) Brigade in Aldershot. Yeoman Warder Cameron officially became the first ever female Yeoman Warder in July 2007 but didn't get to wear her uniform until 3 September 2007. Cameron is one of 37 Yeoman Warders based in the Tower of London, a position which dates back to 1485. Styled as Yeoman Warder Cameron, her full and proper title is Yeoman Warder of Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress the Tower of London, and Members of the Sovereign's Body Guard of the Yeoman Guard in the Extraordinary. Camerons' duties are mostly connected to the Tower, but can involve some outside ceremonies. Within the Tower, Cameron's role is to take care of public visitors to the Tower and perform guided tours, guard the Crown Jewels, perform the Ceremony of the Keys and look after the Ravens of the Tower. Outside the Tower, Warders duties are to attend the Coronation of the Sovereign, lying-in-state, the Lord Mayor's Show, and other state and charity functions. As a Yeoman Warder, Cameron has two tailored to fit uniforms, the Scarlet ceremonial dress, and the 'undress' blue uniform for day-to-day duties. On 25 November 2009, two Yeoman Warders were dismissed after being found guilty of gross misconduct for bullying Cameron due to her gender. Three Warders had been suspended, and one was subsequently re-instated following the month-long investigation, with his role 'unproven'. One of the three also received a police caution for defacing Cameron's Wikipedia biography. First female Yeoman Warder The post of Yeoman Warder had never specifically been barred to women, although due to the rules governing women in the British Army, it was only in the modern era that women were able to have a career able to meet the entry requirements. To apply for the job, applicants had to be aged between 40 and 55, have completed at least 22 years' service in either the Army, Royal Air Force or Royal Marines reaching the rank of Warrant Officer or Senior Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO), and have been awarded the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. It was announced on 3 January 2007 that an unnamed female would be replacing a retiring Yeoman Warder in September 2007, with WO2 Cameron, still in the Army at the time, publicly named as this replacement eight days later. Cameron had long been interested in the job of Yeoman Warder, and applied to an advert placed in Soldier Magazine in Summer 2006. Cameron was not the first woman to apply for the job of Yeoman Warder, but she was the first to pass the interview process, beating five male candidates for the vacancy. Personal life Born in 1964, Cameron grew up in Furnace, Argyll on the west coast of Scotland, and joined the Army at the suggestion of her mother, who thought she 'needed to see the world'. As part of her job as a Yeoman Warder, she lives in the Tower of London in a subsidised apartment. In February 2011, Cameron was made a patron of The Kit Wilson Trust for Animal Welfare, an animal welfare charity based in East Sussex.http://kitwilsontrust.org.uk/cms/files/8813/0278/1632/KWT- Tails-2011-WEB.pdf See also * Tourism in London * Women in the military References External links * Historic Royal Palaces Category:1964 births Category:Women's Royal Army Corps soldiers Category:Royal Corps of Signals soldiers Category:Royal Army Pay Corps soldiers Category:Living people Category:Adjutant General's Corps soldiers Category:People from Furnace, Argyll and Bute ","title":"Moira Cameron"},{"id":"13081309","text":"M√ºrlenbach is an Ortsgemeinde ‚Äì a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality ‚Äì in the Vulkaneifel district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Gerolstein, whose seat is in the like-named town.  Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. M√ºrlenbach lies between the larger towns of Gerolstein and Bitburg on the river Kyll, which flows into the Moselle.  History  The castle, the Bertradaburg, is said to be one of Charlemagne‚Äôs possible birthplaces, although this cannot be confirmed. The castle's existence is only witnessed as far back as the 13th century; however, archaeological features suggest that there were forerunner buildings to the impressive, but undated, castle complex that still stands nowadays. In and around M√ºrlenbach, a series of Roman and mediaeval remnants has been found (lesser temple complexes, hoards of coins); these are catalogued in the Trier Rhenish State Museum‚Äôs archive. A clue to the village‚Äôs importance in late antiquity and the Early Middle Ages is its favourable location near the old Roman road from Trier to Cologne at the junction of a sideroad leading eastwards. These roads were in all likelihood still used at least until the High Middle Ages. Whether M√ºrlenbach belonged to Pr√ºm Abbey as long ago as the Early Middle Ages, which would have put it close to Carolingian royalty, is something that simply cannot be confirmed. Nonetheless, the village, and the castle, too, did indeed belong to Pr√ºm Abbey in the High Middle Ages, when the castle enjoyed importance both as a border fortification and a safe haven for the Abbey in times of retreat. When the Abbey was annexed to the Prince-Bishopric of Trier, the castle lost a great deal of its importance beginning in the 16th century, although at first it was further expanded and furnished with artillery bastions. After the Bishopric was secularized in the Napoleonic Wars, the castle, which by this time had already partly fallen into disrepair, was sold off to be used as a quarry. On 21 April 1824, a fire wrought heavy damage. Twenty-four houses, 25 barns and stables and the church were either destroyed or damaged. As late as the 20th century, both the parish and the municipality stood as a regional centre.  Religion  Most of M√ºrlenbach‚Äôs inhabitants are Christian, the overwhelming majority of whom are Roman Catholic. The village has a Catholic church, St. Luzia Kirche (‚ÄúSaint Lucy‚Äôs Church‚Äù). St. Luzia Kirche Bertradaburg Besides Christians, there were once also Jews living in M√ºrlenbach from the mid 19th century until the late 1930s. They numbered 12 in 1885, 8 in 1895, 9 in 1905 and 4 in 1930.  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. The municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat {border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"300\\" |- bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\" CDU |FWG |Total |- align=\\"center\\" 2009 |8 |4 |12 seats |- align=\\"center\\" 2004 |9 |3 |12 seats |}  Mayor  M√ºrlenbach's mayor is Christoph Hacken, and his deputies are Rainer Becker and Ewald Weidig.  Coat of arms  The German blazon reads: In Gr√ºn eine erh√∂hte, eingebogene, silberne Spitze, darin ein rotes Torhaus mit zwei T√ºrmen, einen blauen Wellenschildfu√ü teilweise √ºberdeckend. Vorne ein silbernes Lamm mit Fahne, darin ein rotes Kreuz, hinten ein links gewendeter silberner Dolch. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Tierced in mantle above fess point, dexter vert a lamb carrying a banner argent, the banner charged with a cross gules, sinister vert a dagger bendwise of the second, in base argent a base wavy azure surmounted by a gatehouse with two towers gules. The green field tincture in the upper divisions symbolizes the almost 80% share of the municipal area that is wooded and the charming, rustic location in the Kyll valley. The Bertradaburg, the local castle ‚Äì in the local lore held to be Charlemagne‚Äôs birthplace ‚Äì stands as the main charge in the arms, reflecting its position as the municipality‚Äôs landmark, one that for centuries has been an historically inseparable part of the village. In the 1997 Festschrift (a celebratory publication), it says: ‚ÄúThe castle and the village form together with the Kyll flowing through the valley a oneness.‚Äù Thus, the wavy base was included in the arms to symbolize the Kyll, the Godesbach and the Braunebach, and also to refer to the castle's history as a moated castle. The silver lamb refers to the village's and the castle's special relationship with Pr√ºm Abbey. The Abbots of Pr√ºm were, through Bertrada's endowment of the monastery, the lords at M√ºrlenbach and often lived at the castle, until the Electorate of Trier took over ownership. Pr√ºm Abbey bore the Easter Lamb in its arms. The village's and the church's patron saint is Saint Lucy. She was martyred for her beliefs by being stabbed with a dagger, explaining the charge in sinister chief.Description and explanation of M√ºrlenbach‚Äôs arms  Culture and sightseeing   Buildings  * Bertradaburg (castle) and castle wall (monumental zone), mediaeval hilltop castle with living quarters, gatehouse and horseshoe-shaped bastions; first mentioned in the 14th century, today a ruin; gatehouse still preserved with two flanking round towers, under the modern house is the cellar of a former hall, remnants of two bastions, about 1589. * Saint Lucy's Catholic Parish Church (Pfarrkirche St. Lucia), Birresborner Stra√üe, Baroque aisleless church integrated into a newer Baroque Revival, three-naved building, 1923‚Äì1924; shaft cross from 1756. * Alte Stra√üe 11 ‚Äì estate complex, plastered building possibly from early 19th century, commercial buildings, some built onto the main building, others freestanding, old cobbles in the yard. * Bahnhof - Site of the main train station and now defunct world-famous restaurant; Kathe Gobel's * Burgring 8 ‚Äì so-called Old Castle House (Altes Burghaus) on high basement, quarrystone, partly plastered. * Hardter Weg 2 ‚Äì three-floor house with narrow porch, from 1768, well pump from 1765. * Im M√ºhlenpesch 3 ‚Äì Baroque entrance with fanlight from 1746. * Meisburger Stra√üe 4 ‚Äì former rectory (?), representative Baroque house, apparently from 1762, side building, whole complex. * Sch√∂necker Stra√üe 1 ‚Äì Baroque building with windows with segmental arches, outwardly altered with additions, inside some features of the architectural period preserved. * Sch√∂necker Stra√üe 7 ‚Äì estate along street (former mill?), timber-frame building, partly solid, mid 19th century (?). * Sch√∂necker Stra√üe/corner of Am Remelsbach ‚Äì wayside cross, shaft cross from 1671, surmounting cross late 19th or early 20th century. * Grindelborn, southeast of the village on the road to Salm ‚Äì estate complex, country house style, about 1910 or 1920. * Wei√üenseifen 8 ‚Äì Quereinhaus (a combination residential and commercial house divided for these two purposes down the middle, perpendicularly to the street) from 1835, old cobbles in the yard. * Wayside cross, west of the village in the woods on the way to Wei√üenseifen, wooden beam cross from 1882. * Wayside cross, southeast of the village in the woods, sandstone beam cross from 1666 * Wayside cross, southeast of the village on the road to Salm, red sandstone shaft cross from 1671. * Wayside cross, northeast of the village on the way to Hardt, shaft cross from 1768. * Wayside cross, west of the village on the way to Wei√üenseifen, on the Pr√ºmer Berg (mountain), pedestal cross from 1843.Directory of Cultural Monuments in Vulkaneifel district  Sport and leisure  Recreation includes flyfishing and kayaking on the Kyll and cycling on a bicycle path along the Kyll.

Rather, Caplan contends that voters are irrational in the political sphere and have systematically biased ideas concerning economics. Summary Throughout the book, Caplan focuses on voters' opinion of economics since so many political decisions revolve around economic issues (immigration, trade, welfare, economic growth, and so forth). Using data from the Survey of Americans and Economists on the Economy (SAEE), Caplan categorizes the roots of economic errors into four biases: anti-market, anti-foreign, make-work, and pessimistic. Anti-market bias Caplan refers to the anti-market bias as a \\"tendency to underestimate the benefits of the market mechanism.\\" In Caplan's view, people tend to view themselves as victims of the market, rather than participants of it. He also categorises a few major misconceptions associated with this bias: (1) a view that market payments are transfers rather than incentives, (2) a belief in a monopoly theory of price, where firms impose prices on consumers without recourse. In the first, he describes that \\"people tend to see profits as a gift to the rich\\" and that \\"limiting profits\\" permits pity to the poor. However, profits are seen by economists as means to promote trade in those sectors. Moreover, the historical attacks on usury and windfalls see interest as robbing the creditor. Yet, interest is in fact two things: the creditor delaying his own consumption for compensation (known as liquidity preference) and compensation for the risk of borrower defaults. The second is where corporations, even small-scale suppliers, are seen as greedy monopolists that prey on the consumer. Caplan argues that all trade is a two- way street and that people like middlemen are not interposers attempting to fleece the people, but rather, making up for transportation, storage, and distribution costs. At a more broad level, cheating people is bad for business and the existence of multiple firms offering similar products implies competition, not monopoly power, which limits any firm's ability to increase prices. Anti-foreign bias Caplan refers to the anti-foreign bias as a \\"tendency to underestimate the economic benefits of interaction with foreigners.\\" People systematically see their country of origin as in competition with other nations and so oppose free trade with them. Foreigners are seen as the \\"enemy\\" even if the two governments are at a lasting peace. The principles of comparative advantage allow two countries to benefit a great deal from trade, even if one is worse than the other in every single way. The degree of benefit is rarely equalized, but it is always positive for both parties. Caplan also notes how the anti-foreign bias can be rooted in pseudo- racist attitudes. For Americans, trading with Japan and Mexico is more controversial than trading with Canada and England, which are more linguistically and ethnically similar to the United States. Make-work bias Caplan refers to the make-work bias as a \\"tendency to underestimate the economic benefits from conserving labor.\\"Bryan Caplan, The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies (Princeton University Press, 2007). Caplan claims that there is a tendency to equate economic growth with job creation. However, that is not necessarily true, since real economic growth is a product of increases in the productivity of labor. Dislocation and unemployment can be caused by productivity gains making certain jobs no longer necessary. All things being equal, economic rationality would require that these people make use of their talents elsewhere. Caplan makes special emphasis of the movement away from farming over the past 200 years, from nearly 95% of Americans as farmers in 1800 to just 3% in 1999, as an illustrative example.W. Michael Cox and Richard Alm, Myths of Rich and Poor (New York: Basic Books, 1999), p. 128. Cited in Bryan Caplan, The Myth of the Rational Voter, p. 42. As an economy industrialises, increased labor productivity in agriculture means less labor is needed to produce a given quantity of agricultural goods, freeing up labour (a scarce resource) to be employed in the production of manufactured goods and services. Pessimistic bias Caplan refers to the pessimistic bias as a \\"tendency to overestimate the severity of economic problems and underestimate the (recent) past, present, and future performance of the economy.\\" The public generally perceives economic conditions as declining or about to decline. Caplan alleges that there is often little or no evidence to back up such perceptions of imminent apocalypse. Among challengers Caplan cites is Julian Lincoln Simon and his book, The Ultimate Resource, which argues society continues to progress despite claims of environmental degradation and an increasing use of natural resources. Survey of Americans and Economists on the Economy The author pays special attention to the 1996 Survey of Americans and Economists on the Economy (SAEE), created by the Washington Post, the Kaiser Family Foundation, and Harvard University Survey Project. The SAEE asked 1,510 random members of the American public and 250 people with PhDs in economics the same questions concerning the economy. In addition to its 37 topical questions, the SAEE also inquired about the participant's income, income growth, education, and other demographic information. The answers to the questions are often different: the public often blames technology, outsourcing, high corporate profits, and downsizing as reasons for why growth is lower than it could be. Economists, on the other hand, barely pay any heed to such arguments. Some 74% of the public blame greedy oil companies for high gas prices, but only 11% of economists do. The public tends to believe real incomes are decreasing while economists take the opposite stance. Caplan notes that the chasm between economists and the general public might arguably be due to bias on the expert's part. Self-serving bias (economists are rich and so they believe whatever benefits them) and ideological assumptions (economists are a bunch of right-wing ideologues) are two challenges the author addresses. Caplan writes: \\"Both the self-serving bias and the ideological bias are, in principle, empirically testable. Economists' views are the product of their affluence? Then rich economists and rich noneconomists should agree. Economists are blinded by conservative ideology? Then conservative economists and conservative noneconomists should agree.\\" In turn, if self-serving bias is unavoidable, it would likewise skew the perceptions of the non-wealthy, causing them to believe both the \\"'ought' claim\\" that government should reduce inequality of wealth and the \\"'is' claims\\" that existing inequalities of outcome are severe and are perpetuated by corporate and governmental power structures. Using data from the SAEE (which includes measures for ideology, income, job security, and other measures), Caplan simulates what people would believe if they had the same circumstances as economists, a technique often used in political science called \\"enlightened preferences\\". If the ideological and self-serving biases are true, most of the difference between the \\"enlightened public\\" and economists should disappear. If, however, the enlightened public is not much closer to economists, then something else is going on, as those explanations have been neutralized. Caplan believes that that something else is the biases he enumerated earlier. The data tends to support Caplan's argument, with most (but not all) of the enlightened public closer to economists than to the public. Rational irrationality In standard neoclassical economics, people are assumed to be rational; the notion of systematic bias is considered to be a sloppy assumption. In many ways, Caplan agrees: most people are rational when it comes to choosing a job, buying milk, hiring employees, and selecting a business strategy. They can be wrong, of course, but a systematic bias rarely, if ever, occurs. But the author argues they are rational only because it is costly to be wrong. A racist will still hire a qualified black person because going to the second- best option will be expensive to the company. A protectionist will still outsource because he has to achieve as many advantages over his competitors as he can to stay in business. Someone who thinks a discount store is haunted will seriously question their conclusions when they find their budget to be tight. Sometimes, however, it is virtually costless for the individual person to hold on to their preconceived beliefs, and people enjoy such beliefs. Rational irrationality simply states that when it is cheap to believe something (even when it is wrong) it is rational to believe it. They refuse to retrace their logic and seriously ask themselves if what they believe is true. For some people, thinking hurts and so they avoid it if they can. This often appears in politics. Caplan argues that, \\"Since delusional political beliefs are free, the voter consumes until he reaches his 'satiation point,' believing whatever makes him feel best. When a person puts on his voting hat, he does not have to give up practical efficacy in exchange for self-image because he has no practical efficacy to give up in the first place.\\" Relation to public choice theory The book is notable in use of irrationality, a rare assumption in economics. Yet the work is also a challenge to conventional public choice, where voters are seen as rationally ignorant. Conventional public choice either emphasizes the efficiency of democracy (as in the case of Donald Wittman) or, more commonly, democratic failure because of the interaction between self-interested politicians or bureaucrats, well- organized, rent-seeking special interests and a largely indifferent general public (as in the work of Gordon Tullock, James M. Buchanan, and many others). Caplan, however, emphasizes that democratic failure exists and places the blame for it squarely on the general public. He makes special emphasis that politicians are often caught between a rock and a hard place: thanks to advisors, they know what policies would be generally beneficial, but they also know that those policies are not what people want. Thus, they are balancing good economic policy, so they do not get voted out of office because of slow growth, and bad economic policy, so they do not get voted out of office because of unpopular policies. Reception Popular press The book was reviewed in the popular press, including in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and the New Yorker. It was also briefly mentioned in Time Magazine. Nicholas Kristof wrote in the New York Times that it was the \\"best political book of this year.\\" Academic press The book received a mixed- to-positive review from Loren Lomasky in Public Choice, co-inventor of the theory of \\"expressive voting\\" that was a close competitor to Caplan's theory of rational irrationality. Stuart Farrand wrote a critique of Caplan's book for Libertarian Papers. Gene Callahan reviewed the book for The Independent Review. Prema Popat of NorthEastern University and Benjamin Powell of Suffolk University jointly wrote a review of the book for New Perspectives on Political Economy. Prior to publication of the book, Caplan had put forward the main thesis of the book as the lead essay in the November 2006 issue of Cato Unbound. Other participants in the debate, who critiqued various aspects of Caplan's thesis, included David Estlund, Loren Lomasky, and Jeffrey Friedman. The book received a mixed review from the libertarian Austrian economist Walter Block in the Journal of Libertarian Studies. Block was highly critical of Caplan's attempts to paint Austrian economics as a form of irrational free-market extremism. He also criticized Caplan for not referencing Hans-Hermann Hoppe's book Democracy: The God That Failed that had a similar theme. Block's review was also published in LewRockwell.com and Psychology Today. Related books Books published earlier * Democracy and Decision by Geoffrey Brennan and Loren Lomasky, where the authors describe their \\"expressive voting\\" thesis in detail. Caplan's theory of rational irrationality is a close competitor to the theory offered here, and is in many ways similar. Lomasky wrote a review of Caplan's book. * The Myth of Democratic Failure by Donald Wittman, the book that Caplan says was the impetus for writing his own book. Caplan included Wittman's book on his reading list, writing \\"This is the book that awoke me from my dogmatic public choice slumbers‚Äîand (negatively) inspired all of my work on voter irrationality. It's a gift.\\" Caplan and Wittman participated in a public debate shortly after Caplan's book was released. Books published later * The Ethics of Voting by Jason Brennan, a 2011 book examining whether people have a moral obligation to vote. Brennan argued that people are not morally obliged to vote, but that if they do vote, they are obliged to vote responsibly. He argued that people who are not confident that they can vote well should refrain from voting. The final chapter of Brennan's book reviewed the evidence regarding whether people are generally well-qualified to make responsible voting decisions, and this chapter referenced The Myth of the Rational Voter. * Against Democracy by Jason Brennan, a 2016 Princeton University Press book that challenges the belief that democracy is good and moral, and argues that the system doesn't produce good enough results. Furthermore, Brennan presents and defends different alternatives of \\"the rule of the knowledgeable\\" (epistocracy), where only the most knowledgeable voters get to elect the leaders. Caplan has endorsed the book.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Gerolstein, whose seat is in the like- named town.  Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth.  History  Neroth arose out of several small centres, namely Niederroth, Hundswinkel and Oberroth. The placename ending ‚Äîroth refers to clearing woods for farming, and goes back to the 12th century or thereabouts. As early as 1744, church books mentioned, besides the resident people, wandering families ‚Äì the Jenische people. They were pedlars and took up residence in winter in Neroth. They distinguished themselves from the long established peasant families with their endogamous marriages and their own language, Jenisch.  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

Coat of arms  The German blazon reads: Zwischen einem durch Zinnenschnitt von Gold und Rot geteilten Schildhaupt und einem gr√ºnen F√ºnfberg, darin eine silberne Mausefalle, in Gold eine rote Waage. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Or balances gules and in chief a fess embattled of seven of the same, in base a mount of five vert charged with a hemispherical wire mousetrap argent. The fess embattled (horizontal stripe with an upper edge resembling a castle's battlements) symbolizes the castle built by John of Bohemia on the Nerother Kopf (mountain). The red balances stand as a symbol of the old Neroth high court. The mount of five ‚Äì a five-knolled hill ‚Äì represents the five prominent peaks that frame the village. The silver mousetrap ‚Äì the municipality's website shows a drawing of this particular type, among others ‚Äì stands for the wireworking industry of the 19th century that was an important income earner in the municipality, and for today's unique mousetrap museum.Description and explanation of Neroth‚Äôs arms  Culture and sightseeing  On one of the nearby mountains, the Nerother Kopf, is found the Freudenkoppe, a castle ruin, near which is the old millstone quarry where the Nerother Wandervogel youth movement was founded by the brothers Robert and Karl Oelbermann on the night of New Year's Eve 1919 and New Year's Day 1920.  Mousetraps  In the 19th century, Neroth was no exception among the Eifel‚Äôs many villages insofar as it was poverty-stricken. Agriculture was extremely scant. Commercial and artisanal opportunities were hard to come by. Some of the villagers therefore plied sidelines to their usual work, peddling carved spoons or basketware. There was a further, smaller sector of the population made up of non-nomadic Jenische pedlars and tinkers. The stage was thus set for a new handicraft industry to arise, one that produced much sought-after articles: mousetraps and rat traps. The needed skills were brought to the community by a former teacher from Neroth, who saw such an industry as a way out of the otherwise intractible chronic wretchedness that had hitherto beset the village ‚Äì and indeed most of the Eifel. Many of the poorer villagers ‚Äì both Jenische and non-Jenische ‚Äì then went about peddling handicrafts made of wire, among these, mousetraps. The upshot was that many families‚Äô livelihoods improved markedly. These wire handicrafts were made mostly by women at home, while the men became travelling mousetrap salesmen, going well beyond Germany's current borders to sell their wares, into what is now Poland and the Czech Republic. The pedlars used a secret language amongst themselves, Jenisch. Growing industrialization began to hinder the trade noticeably by the early 20th century, until in 1970, it was brought to an end. Mousetraps have become so closely identified with Neroth that the municipality has a museum dedicated to mousetraps, and a dome- shaped wire mousetrap is even one of the charges in the municipal arms.Museen in der Eifel bringen sich neu in Position , Artikel der Landesregierung vom 8.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Daun, whose seat is in the like-named town.  Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features. Volcanic activity continues even today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. Niederstadtfeld lies roughly 8 km southwest of Daun, southwestwards towards Bitburg, near Bundesstra√üe 257, and can be reached directly over Landesstra√üe (State Road) 27. The original village (now the village centre) stands on a ridge between the K√§lberbach and Schwemmbach valleys in a side valley of the Kleine Kyll river. The Kleine Kyll valley is part of the protected area Zwischen Uess und Kyll. The newer built-up area today stretches farther along the ridge between the K√§lberbach and Schwemmbach valleys as well as along the slope of the Kleine Kyll, with the sport complex, the primary school, the Hauptschule and the tennis courts all having been built down in the valley. The Kleine Kyll itself rises above Neroth and empties into the river Lieser downstream from Manderscheid at the Neum√ºhle (\\"New Mill\\"). The local elevation ranges from 386 to 420 m above sea level, and the municipality's area is 913 ha, 465 ha of which is wooded and another 345 ha of which is agricultural land.  Neighbouring municipalities  Niederstadtfeld's neighbours are Bleckhausen, Deudesfeld, Meisburg, Neroth, Oberstadtfeld, Salm, Schutz, √údersdorf, Wallenborn and Weidenbach.  History  In 1016, the village of Stadefeld (\\"field on the banks of the Kleine Kyll\\") had its first documentary mention. In this year, the village was transferred by the Abbot of Pr√ºm, Urold von Daun, as a donation to the newly founded collegiate foundation at Pr√ºm, a deed that was also approved by Emperor Heinrich II. This ownership arrangement found further confirmation in 1136 under Abbot Albero, who appointed Count Bezelino as the Vogt. Thus it could have been that the collegiate foundation lost its grip on Stadefeld because the nobility not only claimed the local lordship, but also contributed to the building of a church, which was first mentioned in 1330. In 1457, Archbishop Johann II, the Margrave of Baden, in right of the Lordships of Sch√∂necken, enfeoffed the brothers Heinrich, Johann and Friedrich, Lords of Pyrmont and Ehrenberg, with, among other things, holdings and assets, and also with ‚ÄúStadefeld‚Äù. In 1460, Archbishop Johann II took Stadefeld as well as the rest of Heinrich's holdings, people and villages into his protection against payment of a yearly protection fee. The municipality of Niederstadtfeld owned 1469 Morgen (roughly 465 ha) of woodlands, 482 Morgen (roughly 153 ha) of wasteland and wilderness and 10 Morgen (roughly 3 ha) of meadowland and other kinds of land. In 1565, Archbishop of Trier Johann VI enfeoffed Count Dietrich I of Manderscheid-Kayl, for him and Margaretha von Sombref's other heirs, with, among other things, holdings of the Lords of Pyrmont, including Stadtfeld. Both Niederstadtfeld and Oberstadtfeld belonged to the Electoral-Trier Amt of Manderscheid. Niederstadtfeld had a special court. The parish belonged to the rural chapter of Kyllburg in the Diocese of Trier. The parish was responsible to either the Count of Manderscheid-Kayl or the Lord of Wiltberg, who took turns in this position. Besides Niederstadtfeld, Oberstadtfeld was also part of this parish. The mill at Niederstadtfeld belonged to the municipality. In August 1794, fire broke out in the newly built barn at the old rectory, which swiftly spread through the lower village, as most houses there still had thatched roofs. Many houses, barns and stables were destroyed in this fire. In 1800, a new industry began, sickle making. This afforded many villagers a livelihood. Other industries that cropped up in the 19th century were hatmaking and lead mining. The lead mine's now caved-in shafts can still be seen even today. In the time that followed the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871), when great economic need prevailed, many people from Niederstadtfeld emigrated to the United States. Named are the families Pauls, Steffes, Ewen, Weber, Eull and Basten. About the turn of the 20th century, with the beginnings of industrialization, migration to industrial areas began in Niederstadtfeld, as it likewise did in many other villages. The only livelihoods offered in the village were in forestry, agriculture and the village's two sawmills. Niederstadtfeld ‚Äì unlike its neighbour Oberstadtfeld ‚Äì came through the Second World War relatively unscathed. In 1955, a ball factory took over the sawmill that once stood on the former Kreisstra√üe (District Road) 8. Not long afterwards, though ‚Äì in 1959 ‚Äì the heat-pressing works, still in business today, set up shop in exactly the same spot.  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.  Mayor  Niederstadtfeld's mayor is G√ºnter Horten, and his deputies are Jakob Schnichels and Barbara Trosdorff.  Coat of arms  The German blazon reads: Von Gold, Rot und Silber zweimal geteilt, oben ein roter Zickzackbalken, in der Mitte eine silberne Waage, unten ein blaues Zahnrad. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: A fess gules charged with balances argent, in chief Or a fess dancetty of three of the first, and in base argent a cogwheel spokeless azure. Beginning in 1565, Niederstadtfeld belonged to the Counts of Manderscheid and was until 1794 in the Electoral-Trier Amt of Manderscheid. The red fess dancetty (that is, horizontal zigzag stripe) was the charge borne in those lords‚Äô arms. Within the Manderscheid high court, Niederstadtfeld had its own court for Niederstadtfeld, Schutz and Deudesfeld. The balances are meant to document this historical fact. The cogwheel in the lower division of the escutcheon stands for both the earliest beginnings of the handicraft industry in Niederstadtfeld and the industry still found here today.

It also reverses left and right, which are traditionally told from the armsbearer's point of view (that is, behind the shield), not the viewer's.James Parker on ‚Äúdexter‚ÄùJames Parker on ‚Äúsinister‚Äù The grounds for the composition seen in these arms were the village's history of political division. For centuries, the namesake brook that runs through the village, the Nitzbach, stood as a boundary. Until relatively recently, the brook marked the boundary between two districts, Mayen-Koblenz and Daun, and at the same time that between two Regierungsbezirke, Trier and Koblenz. Until this arrangement was swept aside by administrative reform, municipal administration was divided at the brook, as were school boards and church parishes. Earlier still, the Nitzbach was the boundary between the respective lordly domains held by the Counts of N√ºrburg and the Counts of Virneburg. The bend wavy azure (that is, diagonal blue wavy stripe), of course, represents the Nitzbach. The two other charges are those once borne by these counts. The lozenge was the Virneburg armorial bearing, while the N√ºrburgs bore the eagle. The arms have been borne since 18 December 1986.Description and explanation of Nitz‚Äôs arms  Culture and sightseeing   Buildings  * Catholic branch church, Hauptstra√üe ‚Äì small aisleless church, possibly from earlier half of 18th century, partly renovated in 1933 after a fire. * Kapellenstra√üe 1 ‚Äì timber-frame house, partly solid, 19th century.Directory of Cultural Monuments in Vulkaneifel district Also worth seeing are two mills, the Freundsm√ºhle and the Bauersm√ºhle.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Gerolstein, whose seat is in the like-named town.  Geography   Location  The municipality lies both in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features and even ongoing activity today, and in the Kalkeifel, another part of the Eifel characterized by limestone (Kalkstein in German). The municipality lies right on the boundary with North Rhine-Westphalia and at the common point of three districts, Ahrweiler, Euskirchen and Vulkaneifel (until 31 December 2006 called Daun). The nearest major centres within a 20 km radius of Nohn are Adenau, Blankenheim, Daun, Gerolstein, Hillesheim, Kelberg and J√ºnkerath.  History  The name ‚ÄúNohn‚Äù is held to derive from the Latin phrase ad nonum lapidem, meaning ‚Äúat the ninth stone‚Äù, that is to say, at the ninth milestone on the old Roman road between Trier and Cologne. This, however, cannot be taken as serious historical information, for in Roman times, Nohn had not yet arisen. Nohn had its first documentary mention about 970 as the location of a chapel. In feudal times, Nohn belonged to the Electoral-Trier Amt of Daun. The knightly seat at Nohn was held for several centuries by the Lords of Hillesheim. The municipality's and the church's patron saint is Saint Martin. This gives a clue as to a long church tradition in the village. As early as 970, a chapel in Nohn was named.Nohn‚Äôs history Until 30 September 1932, the municipality belonged to the Adenau district. This district, however, was abolished in the course of administrative reform. From 1 October 1932 to 6 November 1970, Nohn was part of the Ahrweiler district, and since 7 November 1970 it has belonged to the Daun district, whose name was changed on 1 January 2007 to Vulkaneifel.

Coat of arms  The municipality's arms might be described thus: Per fess, Or a demi-eagle bicapitate displayed sable armed and langued gules, and azure a sword bendwise point to chief argent, hilted of the first. The two-headed eagle in the upper part of the escutcheon refers to a relationship between the municipality and St. Maximin's Abbey in Trier. The Kapelle Noyn (‚ÄúNohn Chapel‚Äù) supposedly once belonged to the Abbey, according to a falsified, but presumably factually correct, document from 970. There is a further clue to a relationship between the two in a reference from 1759 that names the Abbey as the body with tithing rights to the village. The lower half of the arms is charged with a sword, Saint Martin's attribute, thus representing the municipality's and the church's patron saint.  Culture and sightseeing   The Nohner  The Nohner is a motorcycle built as part of a limited series in the early 1920s by the Brothers Hoffmann in Nohn. The one on display on the premises of the firm Hoffmann-Reisen is the only one of these vehicles still in existence. It is driven by a British Villiers engine. In 2005 and 2006, the Nohner was driven in the fourth and fifth Bad M√ºnstereifel Ernst Neumann-Neander Memorial Roadtrip.  Buildings  Saint Martin's Parish Church The Nohn parish church was built by Brother Nick from Solothurn as an aisleless church in 1781. The tower has its beginnings in the 16th century. The church is consecrated to Saint Martin of Tours. The Romanesque Revival building has a high altar from the earlier half of the 17th century that, although altered a number of times, is still in very much its original condition. The confessionals and the pulpit come from the 18th century. The Baroque organ was installed in 1868; it had been built in 1720 and used elsewhere. Before coming to Nohn, it had been at Saint Mathias's Abbey. In the abutting graveyard stands a Crucifixion Bildstock from 1741. The church's entrance door, flanked by lions, bears a warriors‚Äô memorial to the dead of the First World War.Generaldirektion Kulturelles Erbe Rheinland-Pfalz (Hrsg.): Nachrichtliches Verzeichnis der Kulturdenkm√§ler Kreis Vulkaneifel (PDF; 1,0 MB).

Given its favourable central location, Nohn is an ideal starting point for outings in all these holiday regions or to other points of interest in the Eifel. Through the municipality runs the ‚ÄúGeo-Path‚Äù of the Verbandsgemeinde of Hillesheim, a local hiking loop as well as one of the Eifel Club's hiking trails. Through the nearby Ahbach valley run the well known Eifel-Krimi-Wanderweg (‚ÄúEifel Crime Fiction Hiking Trail‚Äù), the Eifelsteig and the two cycle paths Kalkeifel-Radweg and Mineralquellen-Route, the latter's name referring to mineral springs.  Nearby points of interest  Worth seeing are a natural monument lying in the √úxheim-Ah√ºtte municipal area, the Dreim√ºhlen Waterfall, which draws its name from the nearby ruin of Dreim√ºhlen, a basalt deposit on the Nohner Bach, the limekiln in the √úxheim- Niederehe municipal area (on the road from Nohn to Stroheich), the limestone crags in the Ahbach valley and the ruin of Neublankenheim near √úxheim-Ah√ºtte. Cycle paths in the area are the Ahrtal-Radweg, the Kalkeifel-Radweg and the mountain bike path for cross-country riders that leads around the N√ºrburgring.  Economy and infrastructure   Transport  It is only a few kilometres over Landesstra√üe (State Road) 10 or 167 to Bundesstra√üe 258 (Aachen-Koblenz), over Landesstra√üe 68 to Bundesstra√üe 421 (Belgian border-Hunsr√ºck) or Landesstra√üe 70 to Bundesstra√üe 410 (Luxembourgish border-Mayen). After A 1 is completed between the Blankenheim and Gerolstein interchanges, the municipality will be reachable through the Adenau interchange.  Businesses  In the village centre is a small supermarket with a butcher‚Äôs shop. Not far from the village square is a small beverage dealer's shop. Also, there are two auto workshops/dealerships as well as an electrician‚Äôs business. On the village's outskirts (towards Adenau) are a woodworking business, a street improvement business and a bus company with a filling station. Several times each week, Nohn is visited by vending trucks selling baked goods and foods.

In the Middle Ages, the village belonged to the House of Bettingen, under whom were the Counts of Blankenheim, Manderscheid and Gerolstein. About 1470, Oberbettingen was made subject to the County of Gerolstein.

Under French rule (1794-1814), Oberbettingen was assigned to the mayor of the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Lissendorf in the like-named canton. Even later, under Prussian administration, the village was still administered by Lissendorf. Oberbettingen was until 1750 an autonomous parish. Ever since, it has belonged to the Parish of Niederbettingen, a constituent community of the town of Hillesheim. The former parish church, Saint Nicholas‚Äôs, now serves only as a chapel of ease. There was a conversion of the quire in 1827 and of the nave in 1841. The churchtower was built higher in 1937 to accommodate another bell. In 1960 came more expansion work on the nave, and the adjoining rectory was built. Venerated in Oberbettingen is the Irish saint Brigid of Kildare, patron saint of livestock, and for decades, on 1 February ‚Äì Saint Brigid‚Äôs feast day ‚Äì pilgrims from all the surrounding villages would come in processions to Oberbettingen. In 1815, after the Congress of Vienna assigned the area to the Kingdom of Prussia, the Rhine Province was founded. This lasted until Germany‚Äôs defeat in the Second World War. In 1816, districts (Kreise) were formed, and uninterruptedly ever since, Oberbettingen has belonged to the district of Daun, although this was given a new name ‚Äì Vulkaneifel ‚Äì in 2007. In 1873, the Ehrang ‚Äì Kalscheuren (Trier ‚Äì Cologne) railway came into service with the opening of the railway station in Hillesheim‚Äôs outlying centre of Alter Bahnhof (whose name means ‚ÄúOld Railway Station‚Äù). This lasted until the opening of the Ahrtalbahn (another railway) in 1912, when the local station became Hillesheim-Oberbettingen ‚Äì and then later Oberbettingen-Hillesheim. In 1899, a grant of 1,500 Marks was mentioned for the meadowlands in the Kyll valley, which existed until the Flurbereinigung in 1952. In the same year, the Oberbettingen volunteer fire brigade was also founded. In 1903, a new two- class school building was built, replacing the hitherto one-room school at the house still found today at Am Bach 5. In 1913 a new graveyard, Friedhof Auf Kringelsrech, came into use. Until then, there had only been the graveyard behind the chapel, where the rectory now stands. In 1914, the new waterworks came into being. The water was fed by gravity into a cistern and thence into the supply network. Founded in 1921 was the Oberbettingen savings and loan institution of Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen and Georg Friedrich Dasbach. In 1922 came the first electricity supply to Oberbettingen, from Niederbettingen. As soon as the next year, Oberbettingen was connected to the Schleiden district network (later RWE). In 1936 came the introduction of the first Flurbereinigung measures, but they were interrupted by the Second World War in 1939. On 5 March 1945, United States forces seized Oberbettingen and crossed the Kyll on a Bailey bridge, whereupon the frontline turned its attention towards Hillesheim across the unoccupied ‚ÄúKyll Position‚Äù. Along with the whole Regierungsbezirk of Trier, the district of Daun (now Vulkaneifel) was assigned to the French Zone of Occupation. Since 1946, the municipality has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. In 1946, the sport club FC Oberbettingen 1946 e. V. was founded. In 1952, first Flurbereinigung measures, begun before the war, were finished. The second round was completed in 1987. In 1970, in the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland- Palatinate, Oberbettingen, along with Basberg, Mirbach and Wiesbaum, was transferred from the Amt of Lissendorf to the Verbandsgemeinde of Hillesheim. In 1979, classes ended at the three-room Oberbettingen primary school and scholastic operations were merged with the Hillesheim primary school.Oberbettingen‚Äôs history  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Daun, whose seat is in the like-named town.  Geography   Location  Oberstadtfeld lies 6 km southwest of Daun on Bundesstra√üe 257 in the valley of the Kleine Kyll river in the Volcanic Eifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth.  Neighbouring municipalities  Oberstadtfeld's neighbours are P√ºtzborn (a constituent community of Daun), Neroth, Niederstadtfeld, √údersdorf and Wallenborn.  Geology  Among geologists, Oberstadtfeld is well known for its varied fossils from an eventful geological past. Remnants of long-gone lifeforms, which have been preserved despite all the changes that have taken place in the rocks, show that the stone underlying the municipality is made up of marine deposits from the Lower Devonian. The fossils come from the Devonian Sea, as geologists call it, which covered not only the Eifel but also broad areas of Central Europe too, roughly 400 to 340 million years ago. Several lava flows and a dried-up maar kettle to the right of the road on the way to √údersdorf bear witness to volcanic activity many millennia ago. Climatic swings  Climate  Yearly precipitation in Oberstadtfeld amounts to 890 mm, falling into the highest fourth of the precipitation chart for all Germany. The driest month is April. The most rainfall comes in December. In that month, precipitation is 1.6 times what it is in April.  History  In 1242, Oberstadtfeld had its first direct documentary mention in a partition document between the Count of Daun and Himmerod Abbey. Further documents dealing with tenancy agreements with the Lords of Castle Pyrmont come from 1392, 1447 and 1460. About 1500, a two-naved church with middle supports was built in Oberstadtfeld. From 1503 comes a tenancy agreement with Pyrmont dealing with the mill; it was still using Pyrmont measurements up until 1780. The first available taxation roll from Oberstadtfeld in the Amt of Obermanderscheid comes from 1654. Forty-four years later, in 1698, as can be seen in a tenancy agreement, there were four Electoral estates at Oberstadtfeld: the Achterhof, the H√ºhnerhof, the Hundswinklerhof and the Heinenhof. From 1787 comes the first population figure for Oberstadtfeld, which was then home to 251 inhabitants. In 1794, the Eifel passed to France and was in the new Department of Sarre, and beginning in 1803, Oberstadtfeld was part of the parish of Niederstadtfeld in the Diocese of Trier. Formerly it had belonged to the greater parish of Steinborn in the Eifel deaconry in the Archdiocese of Cologne. In 1808, the Oberstadtfeld mill was auctioned for 1,775 French francs to Matthias Irmen. In 1815, the Eifel passed to Prussia. Oberstadtfeld's old church was replaced with a new nave between 1837 and 1841 after it had fallen into disrepair. The old tower, however, stayed standing. In 1840, the register of inhabitants listed 356 villagers by name. In 1888, the Heiligenh√§uschen (a small, shrinelike structure consecrated to a saint or saints) in the Mark valley on the road to Niederstadtfeld was built by Friedrich Hein as thanks for a healthy homecoming from the Franco-Prussian War. Great parts of Oberstadtfeld were destroyed in the early 20th century when 17 houses along with stables and barns were lost to a fire. Crown Prince Wilhelm visited Oberstadtfeld after the fire, on the occasion of a journey through the Eifel. Towards the end of the Second World War, in 1944 and 1945, Oberstadtfeld was bombed in air raids three times. Twenty-eight civilians were killed.  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.2009 municipal election results for Oberstadtfeld  Mayor  Oberstadtfeld's mayor is Arnold M√∂seler, and his deputies are Hans-J√ºrgen Hennen and Helmut Th√∂nnes.  Coat of arms  The German blazon reads: Durch blauen, schr√§grechten Stufenbalken geteilt. Vorne in Silber eine Scheune mit schwarzem Dach, hinten in Gold eine rote Flamme. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: A bend indented azure between argent a barn with roof sable and Or fire gules. The unusual bend (diagonal stripe) is taken from the arms formerly borne by the Lords of Pyrmont. In 1392, Werner von Falkenstein, the Archbishop of Trier, made it known that he had leased Oberstadtfeld and Weidenbach from Lyse von Lussenich, Widow of Pyrmont, although these two villages were to pass on Werner's death back to Heinrich of Pyrmont. Once more, in 1447, another Heinrich of Pyrmont stated that he still owned the villages of Stadtfeld, and in 1503, too. A further important indicator of the lordly influence is that Pyrmont measurements were used at the Oberstadtfeld mill until 1780. The barn on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side is meant to refer to the four Electoral estates at Oberstadtfeld, the Achterhof, the H√ºhnerhof, the Hundswinklerhof and the Heinenhof. The state archive holds leasing protocols dealing with these estates from 1698 and 1792. The red flame on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side is Saint Brigid's attribute, thus representing the municipality's and the church's patron saint.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Gerolstein, whose seat is in the municipality of Gerolstein.  Name  It is often supposed that Ormont's name is of French origin (or = ‚Äúgold‚Äù; mont = ‚Äúmountain‚Äù), but this is not so. In the Liber Aureus, the ‚ÄúGolden Book‚Äù of the town of Pr√ºm, is a boundary description for the centres of Olzheim and Ormont. Here, the village is called Aurimuncio, in Mediaeval Latin. Nonetheless, this does have the same literal meaning as the supposed French derivation (aurum = ‚Äúgold‚Äù; mons/montem = ‚Äúmountain‚Äù). Either way, therefore, the municipality's name means ‚ÄúGold Mountain‚Äù.  Geography   Location  The municipality lies at the foot of the Schneifel in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth.  Geology  Geologically interesting is the Goldberg, a local mountain whose name, like Ormont's own, means ‚ÄúGold Mountain‚Äù, but in Modern High German. The former volcano is the Vulkaneifel's westernmost outlier. Its name comes from the many biotite crystals that glitter in the sun. In the local folkspeech, these have been given the name Katzengold (‚Äúcat gold‚Äù), although this is actually a name given several minerals in German, including fool's gold.Katzengold translated by LEO Now and then, olivine nodules can also be found. Since the Second World War, the volcano's lava has been intensively quarried.  History  In Roman times a road led from Losheim to Ormont, which to this day bears the name Walenstra√üe. The word Walen comes from the Old High German walahisc, which meant ‚ÄúRomance- (but originally Celtic-) speaking‚Äù. It is cognate with the English word ‚ÄúWelsh‚Äù. In 893, Ormont had its first documentary mention when Pr√ºm Abbey‚Äôs directory of holdings, the Pr√ºmer Urbar, said that all inhabitants of Oremunte were to make hay for Pr√ºm Abbey. The boundary description mentioned above (see Name), however, is believed to date from 801, but this cannot be definitively confirmed. What can be said, though, is that Ormont can look back on a history more than 1,200 years old. In the directory of holdings from 1222, the reader learns that the Count of Vianden was enfeoffed by the Pr√ºm Church with ‚Äúthe estate at Oremunte‚Äù. Almost a century later, in 1320, Friedrich II of Blankenheim was enfeoffed by King John of Bohemia, who was also Duke of Luxembourg, with the village of Oyrmunde. Friedrich's wife was ‚ÄúElse, Frau von Neuenstein‚Äù (see Neuenstein below). In 1329, the brothers Arnold I and Gerhard V of Blankenheim bought the estate of Neuenstein (as discussed later, the castle had not yet been built). Ever since, Neuenstein's history has been bound with Ormont's. In the early 14th century, Ormont was therefore Luxembourgish domain and was held by the Lords of Blankenheim as a fief. In 1361, Ormont and Neuenstein passed by way of exchange to Johann I of Schleiden and his brother Konrad of Schleiden, Provost at St. Gereon in Cologne. About 1365, Konrad built Castle Neuenstein. In 1450, Ormont and Neuenstein changed lords once again, ending up under the Counts of Manderscheid-Schleiden. They were a mighty and influential dynasty with good relations with the Imperial court, and they significantly shaped the Eifel‚Äôs history in the Late Middle Ages. After this comital line died out in 1593, Count Philipp von der Mark held Ormont and Neuenstein unrightfully for the next 20 years. From 1613 to 1719, the two centres were held by the House of Manderscheid-Gerolstein (Kronenburg). From 1719 on, they were then held by Manderscheid-Blankenheim-Gerolstein (Kronenburg). The last regent was Augusta, Imperial Countess at Manderscheid. She fled in 1794 before French Revolutionary troops with her husband, Christian von Sternberg, to his holdings in Bohemia. In the autumn of 1794, the French occupied Ormont and Neuenstein. Ormont was grouped into the Department of Ourthe in the Arrondissement of Malmedy and the Canton of Kronenburg. More locally, it was administered by the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Hallschlag. After the Congress of Vienna in 1814 and 1815, the village passed to Prussia as part of the Rhine Province, becoming a self-administering municipality in the Amtsbezirk of Stadtkyll in the Pr√ºm district. Late in the Second World War, the village sustained heavy damage during the Battle of the Bulge. The local soldiers‚Äô graveyard recalls this difficult time of war in early 1945. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate in 1970, Ormont passed to the Verbandsgemeinde of Obere Kyll, and ever since it has belonged to the Daun district, which has since been given the name Vulkaneifel.  Neuenstein  About 1300, an ‚ÄúElse, Frau von Neuenstein‚Äù crops up in the archives. If this Else was an hereditary daughter of a Lord of Neuenstein, then the House of Neuenstein would be traceable back to the 13th century. However, Else seems to have had no strong link to Neuenstein. When her husband, Friedrich II of Blankenheim, died, she sold the Neuenstein estate in 1329 to Arnold I and Gerhard V of Blankenheim. Arnold's grandson, Gerhard VI of Blankenheim exchanged Neuenstein and Ormont in 1361 for other landholdings. The new owners were Johann I of Schleiden and his brother Konrad of Schleiden, Provost at St. Gereon in Cologne. On a conical hill, high above the river Pr√ºm's left bank, about 1365, Konrad built Castle Neuenstein. Whatever his spiritual leanings were, Konrad was also a fervent warrior. The castle served him in defending his estate against his Blankenheim cousins, with whom he was at war. Surrounding the castle were broad moats, which were fed by the river Pr√ºm. The castle could be entered behind a wall from the east. In 1370, Provost Konrad died, whereupon the new owner became Konrad V of Schleiden. He openly styled himself ‚ÄúLord of Ormont and Neuenstein‚Äù. In 1397, the Cologne Council sent a ‚ÄúJohann von Neuenstein‚Äù to the Imperial encampment at Frankfurt. In 1413, a ‚ÄúDr. jur. Johann von Neuenstein‚Äù also crops up. Also witnessed in written records are Wolf Ludwig von Neuenstein, Hermann Dietrich von Neuenstein and Georg von Neuenstein. In 1794, French Revolutionary troops burnt Castle Neuenstein down and sold it off as a quarry. Scant remnants of the foundations are all that can be found today.  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.  Mayor  Ormont's mayor is Cornelius Dahm, and his deputies are Hermann Weber and Klaus Harings.  Coat of arms  The German blazon reads: Unter goldenem Zackenschildhaupt und √ºber goldenem Bogenschildfu√ü (Berg), darin ein roter Drachenkopf, der mit einem roten Kreuzstab bedeckt ist, in Rot f√ºnf (2:1:2) silberne Kugeln, begleitet rechts und links von je einer goldenen Gleve. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Gules five plates, two, one and two, between two glaives Or in fess, the whole between a chief indented and in base a mount of the second, the latter charged with a dragon's head erased surmounted by a Latin cross of the first. Ormont and the outlying centre of Neuenstein belonged in feudal times to the County of Manderscheid. The ‚Äúchief indented‚Äù ‚Äì the stripe across the top of the escutcheon with the sawtooth lower edge ‚Äì is a reference to the arms borne by those counts, whose arms were actually charged with a fess dancetty of four (see the article about the county to see the Manderscheid arms). Konrad of Schleiden, builder of Castle Neuenstein, bore arms charged with golden glaives (a mediaeval pole weapon). The five ‚Äúplates‚Äù (silver roundels, or in this case balls or orbs, as the German blazon has it) are taken from a seal used by a Johann von Neuenstein. The golden mount symbolizes the Goldberg, a mountain in the municipality whose name has the same meaning as the municipality's Latin- derived name, and the charge is therefore also canting.

Neighbouring municipalities  Pelm's neighbours are Gerolstein, Rockeskyll, Berlingen, Dohm-Lammersdorf and Hohenfels-Essingen.  History  Ruins of the Kasselburg Pelm is notable for its connection with ancient history. Unearthed to the west of the village was a Gallo-Roman sanctuary. It had already been widely destroyed by graverobbers by the time a systematic investigation was done in 1928. More recently, newer information was brought to light by a dig undertaken in 1986 by the Trier Rhenish State Museum. The trapezoidal wall that once bounded the hallowed grounds, whose greatest length is 65 m and whose greatest breadth is 42 m, was built of limestone. Inside is a Gallo-Roman temple with a cella and a passageway in which a limestone tablet was found as early as 1833 inscribed with a dedication to the goddess Caiva. The tablet mentions that a man named Marcus Victorius Polentius granted an endowment of 100,000 sestertii for the temple to Caiva to be built. This inscription has been dated to AD 124. There were two other temples on the grounds. At one, a fragmentary red sandstone club, likely from a statue of Hercules, was found in 1986. A torso from such a statue was unearthed in 1834, but has since been lost. Other statuary has been found representing Mercury and Venus, for instance. Coins, too, have been found, from a quinarius minted in Africa in 47 or 46 BC to various coins struck about AD 400. One find, a fibula, dates from early La T√®ne times.Gallo-Roman Sanctuary, Judenkirchhof In the Middle Ages, the village was held by the House of Kasselburg, whose castle seat was in the village. It gave the noble family its name, and is still known today as the Kasselburg.Pelm‚Äôs armorial history up to 1988 On 18 May 1897, Pelm was the site of a railway disaster when a troop train crashed into some uncoupled rolling stock causing seven of the train's coaches to derail.

From the Middle Ages until the late 18th century, Retterath belonged to the County of Virneburg. Up above Retterath runs a hiking trail around the Hochkelberg.

The reconstructed gallows remind one that this County of Virneburg blood court held its executions here in the woods. The condemned were not only hanged from the gallows, but also, according to each one's sentence, broken on the wheel, drawn and quartered or beheaded. A stone's throw from the gallows lies the Gr√ºner Weiher, a pond where once women who had killed their child were drowned. In those days, women were also deemed guilty if they had become pregnant by rape or if they were too poor to raise their child. In 1809, the village had, together with Arbach and Salcherath, its own municipal area. Under Prussian administration, Retterath was a municipality in the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Kelberg in the Adenau district. In the 1820s, a killer was on the loose around Retterath.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth.  History  In 1335, the Counts of Blankenheim transferred the town of Kyle (which included Reuth) to King John of Bohemia, whereupon they were promptly enfeoffed with it. Less than a century later, however, Reuth found itself in the hands of the Counts of Loen, in 1423. In 1469, all the Blankenheims‚Äô holdings fell under the administration of the Counts of Manderscheid. These they held for more than three centuries, until in 1780, the Count of Sternberg took over all the Manderscheids‚Äô holdings. He did not enjoy them for very long, for in 1794, the French took over this part of Germany in the wake of the French Revolution, incorporating Reuth and the rest of the region into the French Republic. It is believed that the outlying centre of Neureuth was founded in 1814. Two years later, Reuth found itself under Prussian administration. In 1859, the village's first school was built. In 1870 and 1871 ‚Äì the time of the Franco-Prussian War ‚Äì 17 families from Reuth emigrated to the United States. In 1891, the first watermain ‚Äì made of stones ‚Äì was built into the village centre. In 1893 and 1894, this facility was updated and leaden pipes were laid. In these same two years, 15 children died in a diphtheria outbreak. The waterworks were further improved in 1911 with the advent of household connections. In 1924 came electric light. Once again in 1932, sickness claimed lives when 15 people died in an influenza outbreak. An unfinished new school building was destroyed during the Second World War. However, Reuth got its new school eventually. It was dedicated in 1954. Then, in 1971, it was shut down. Sewerage finally came to Reuth in 1956, along with a sewage treatment plant. In 1958, the local bypass, the E 42, was built, and in 1963, Flurbereinigung was finished. In 1968, a youth centre was newly built. It was expanded in 1987. A children's playground was built in 1990. Between 1988 and 1990, the sewerage and sewage treatment plant were rebuilt. Between 1996 and 2002, all municipal streets and the village square were expanded. In 2000, the wind farm was built with nine generators. In 2003, a new playground was opened in the village centre.

The municipality‚Äôs landmark is the Rockeskyller Kopf, a stratovolcano in the heart of the Vulkaneifel, which stretches from the Belgian border to the Moselle. Southwest of Rockeskyll flows the river Kyll, a tributary to the Moselle and the longest river in the Eifel.  History  In 1098, Kila had its first documentary mention in a donation document. In 1511, a Gothic church with columnar supports was built. This church is a highly ranked cultural monument and stands as a protected cultural property according to the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. Until the end of feudal times, Rockeskyll belonged to the Electorate of Trier. In 1795, the tithing domain of Rockeskyll became a mairie (‚Äúmayoralty‚Äù) during the time of French rule.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. Near the village rises the river Salm, which empties into the Moselle near Kl√ºsserath.  History  In 1225, Salm had its first documentary mention in an agreement between Gerhard von Blankenheim and Abbot Heinrich von Himmerod dealing with the donation of an estate to Himmerod Abbey, which was reached on the cobbled road between the abandoned village of Hundswinkel and Bremescheit (Pr√ºmscheid). It is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that the village's beginnings reach back somewhat further, but an entry in Pr√ºm Abbey‚Äôs directory of holdings, the Pr√ºmer Urbar, that supposedly mentions Salm is at the very best doubtful. It would, however, make the village centuries older, since it dates from 803. Salm's early history speaks of well-off townsmen, whose wealth, however, suffered later as the village's population grew. Throughout the ages, the leading sources of income were agriculture and forestry. In the case of the latter, the broad forests even afforded a livelihood in logging. In the 13th century, the villages of Salm and Hilscheid and the estate of Muckenberg were held by the Counts of Manderscheid. In 1238, Salm had a church under the patronage of Heinrich, Lord of Manderscheid-Kerpen. In 1608, Kyllburg townsman Petrus von Salm donated to the church the silver-gilt monstrance. By 1687, patronage was being exercised by the nobles of Roben and the heirs of Melbaum. By 1743, it was the Countess of Manderscheid. On 11 October 1803, during the time of French rule, the Salm Mill (Salmer M√ºhle), which had belonged to the Counts of Manderscheid, was sold for 186 Thaler. By 1815, Salm belonged to the Kingdom of Prussia. Both before and after the Prussian takeover, extensive surveying and mapping were undertaken, first under Colonel Tranchot (1803-1813) and then under Generalmajor von M√ºffling (1816-1820). The Year Without a Summer ‚Äì 1816 ‚Äì struck the Eifel hard, bringing famine, floods and weather damage along with it. Snow was still lying on the ground into June. Hay was only harvested in September, and the grain only ripened in October. That same month came frost, and by early November, snow was falling once again. The next year, 1817, the Eifel dwellers suffered under the lingering effects of the foregoing year's disastrous and unusual weather patterns. Common foodstuffs were not so common, and cost much more than usual. People were so hungry that they were eating livestock fodder and roots. The Prussian government helped ease the crisis by making available two million Thaler, and ensuring the poor their daily bread by buying up great quantities of grain from East Prussia. In 1856, the whole lower village was destroyed in a great fire. One man, who had fallen asleep on some hay, was burnt alive. Between 1869 and 1871, the Trier-Cologne railway line was built, putting the Ruhr area within much easier reach. The Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871) gave railway building the highest priority. This same time saw the decline of the Eifel's iron industry and an outflow of people to the new industrialized areas. In 1872, there were even advertisements in local newspapers exhorting people to emigrate to the ‚ÄúNew World‚Äù. In 1887, there was yet again hardship due to the weather. This time it was drought and frost. The latter wrought devastation to fruit crops mainly in the dales, while sparing those higher up. The potato crop was very bad, and the price of potatoes soared that year as a result. Oats likewise yielded a very poor harvest, and the hay failed altogether. Six years later, in 1893, agriculture suffered once more. Summer and autumn were very dry, resulting in a dearth of fodder. Many farmers felt forced to sell their livestock off. Thin brushwood was being crushed and cut up for livestock fodder. The year 1899, however, was in every respect a good year for farmers. The turn of the 20th century was an uneventful time until the First World War. A savings and loan institution was established in 1903 and a fire brigade in 1910. On 30 June 1914, news of Archduke Franz Ferdinand's assassination reached Salm, causing great unease. People began to hoard coffee and salt in expectation of the forthcoming war. The western border was militarized, and then on 1 August 1914 came the Mobilization Order from the Emperor. Among other side-effects was a great upswing in prices for various foodstuffs. In 1916, heavy guns could be heard shooting in the Battle of Verdun about 140 km away; the noise was loudest on 14 December. In 1918, the war ended and Salm was occupied by United States troops. Twenty-four soldiers from Salm fell in the Great War. The Americans were replaced by French occupiers, who did not withdraw until 1930. In 1920, heavy spring rains and frost in June ensured a poor harvest. On 20 February 1921, elections for the Prussian Landtag were held. In 1925, work began on the local waterworks. The following year, Salm was connected to the district electrical grid. In 1936, the local electricity supplier became the Rheinisch- Westf√§lische Elektrizit√§tswerke (RWE). The years between 1929 and 1931 were a time of great hardship brought on by the Great Depression. As a make-work scheme, men were put to work building a road linking Daun, Bitburg and Trier. Within a few years, the new Nazi r√©gime led by Adolf Hitler brought along with it not only an upswing in the number of jobs, but also the foreboding of yet another war, especially after Anschluss and Kristallnacht in 1938. The Organisation Todt quartered itself in the Eifel and the second Siegfried Line sprang up. So did a great munitions and fuel dump, in the Salmwald, the local forest. Soldiers from East Prussia were posted as guards. In 1940, early in the Second World War, Salm and the surrounding region became a deployment area in the runup to the Battle of France, which began on 10 May of that year and ended on 21 June with an armistice. French prisoners of war came to Salm. They were put to work in agriculture to offset the dearth of labour due to the war, and were fed by local families whom they were detailed to help. In 1944, after the war's fortunes had swung against Germany, the area once again became a military staging area, this time for the Battle of the Bulge, which began on 16 December. Technical problems with the much-vaunted V‚Äë1s due to errors in the guidance system and sabotage at the assembly plants by the political prisoners who were forced to work there led 21 of these devices to unintentionally rain down on Salm and the surrounding area. They claimed one life. Two fliers are known to have crashed in the municipality in 1944. One was German ‚Äì he was killed after his parachute caught on his falling aircraft ‚Äì and the other American. He was taken to Daun in custody after a successful parachute jump. In 1945, the Allied attack on Germany continued in earnest, and this was brought home locally by an airstrike on Rom, a hamlet between Salm and neighbouring Birresborn. Six civilians (including one whole family) and ten soldiers were killed in the attack, and two houses were destroyed. In unrelated action, another American aircraft crashed near Rom in 1945; the pilot managed to save himself. On 5 March 1945, General George S. Patton‚Äôs 4th Armored Division overran the area and Salm surrendered without a fight. German forces had already pulled out of the village. After Germany's capitulation, the American troops, as had been the case after the last war, were replaced by French ones as the whole region found itself in the French Zone of Occupation. After the war, there followed a time of great neediness. During the 1950s, there was much in the way of cottage industry, including quilting. Many worked as lumberjacks. A lack of apprenticeships in the municipality led many young people to migrate to the Ruhr area. By 1960, the new road to Gerolstein had been finished. Between 1960 and 1962, Flurbereinigung took place. Mechanized farming began. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland- Palatinate in 1970, Salm was grouped into the Verbandsgemeinde of Gerolstein in the Daun district, which has since been given the name Vulkaneifel. In the course of building works for the new sewerage in 1994, remnants of an old wall were unearthed. Nothing is known of its history, except that it is believed to be older than the street under which it runs crosswise.Salm‚Äôs history before 1800Salm‚Äôs history from 1800 to 1937Salm‚Äôs history from 1937 to 1952 (on this and several pages that follow; click on weiter for the next)Salm‚Äôs history from 1949 on (on this and several pages that follow; click on weiter for the next)  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat  Mayor  Salm's mayor is Paul Hoffmann, and his deputy is Karl-Heinz Schwarz.Salm‚Äôs council  Coat of arms  The German blazon reads: In blauem Schild oben ein rechtsgewendeter silberner Salm, unten ein goldenes Jagdhorn.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. Sarmersbach is in the traditional parochial area known as the Struth. The municipality's namesake river, the Sarmersbach, rises within its bounds, emptying into the river Lieser at Nerdlen.  History  Sarmersbach had its first documentary mention only in 1316, but its founding may be placed in Frankish times in the 9th and 10th centuries. Even earlier than that, however, Celts and Romans had settled the broad fields. Archaeological finds from a small Roman temple in the ‚ÄúAuf den Steinen‚Äù area can today be found in the State Museum in Trier. Right near Sarmersbach ran the former Roman road between Trier and Cologne. An ancient indulgence cross, the so-called Afelskreuz, today stands at a prominent spot, an historical procession point, and nowadays a destination for many hikers and also worshippers. Sarmersbach experienced Germany's long history in microcosm in the Middle Ages. They were held by both secular lords, such as the Castle Lords of Daun, the Lords of Winneburg and the Lords of Brohl, and ecclesiastical ones such as the Archbishopric of Trier and Springiersbach Abbey, under whom the unfree peasants toiled away at compulsory labour and paid their tithes. Sarmersbach's great importance in days of yore in the middle of the Struth villages can also be seen in the 14th-century Sch√∂ffenstuhl. This was the seat of seven elected Sch√∂ffen (roughly ‚Äúlay jurists‚Äù), who along with their 49 colleagues in Daun and the Daun Amtmann or the Archbishop of Trier held the assizes several times each year, meting out justice for the Amt of Daun. The Thirty Years' War with its attendant devastating Plague brought death to half the villagers. Almost the whole 17th century with its violent disputes between various lordly houses brought neediness, suffering and misery to the poverty-stricken Struth. After the French Revolution, the Eifel, and thereby Sarmersbach too, were ceded to France. The French administration made Sarmersbach the administrative seat of the like-named mairie (‚Äúmayoralty‚Äù), to which belonged not only Sarmersbach but also Beinhausen, Boxberg, Kradenbach, Gefell, H√∂rschhausen, Katzwinkel, Neichen, Nerdlen, Sch√∂nbach and Utzerath. This arrangement persisted into Prussian times in 1815 after the Congress of Vienna (although the German- speaking Prussians called it a B√ºrgermeisterei, also meaning ‚Äúmayoralty‚Äù). The Prussians also grouped Sarmersbach into the Daun district in the Rhineland, and this arrangement lasted until the mid-1920s. Ever since, Sarmersbach has been administered by the B√ºrgermeisterei ‚Äì later the Verbandsgemeinde ‚Äì of Daun.Sarmersbach‚Äôs history Sarmersbach was until the late 1960s a rural farming village. Since then, agriculture has undergone a swift change in structure. While there were still 4,216 agricultural businesses in the Daun district (now the Vulkaneifel district) in 1971, by 2000 there were fewer than 1,500. In Sarmersbach, there are still a very big computer-driven dairy farm and a Demeter operation, recognized as good. Changes in agriculture were paralleled by changes in the face of the village. The once characteristic timber-frame buildings have almost without exception disappeared. New town developments are also attracting newcomers to Sarmersbach.Sarmersbach‚Äôs more recent history  Religion  The citizens of Sarmersbach are roughly 90% Roman Catholic and belong to the Catholic parish of St. Hubertus Beinhausen with its Hilgerath parish church. In earlier times, believers from Sarmersbach needed to walk several kilometres to take part in church services in great numbers.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Kelberg, whose seat is in the like-named municipality.  Name  The municipality's name, Sassen, is derived from the German word Ansassen or Beisassen, words once used to designate people who were not local, but rather had come from elsewhere to settle. The area around √úlmen and √úrsfeld was already settled when others came along to settle at the village now known as Sassen. Another explanation, however, is that the name arose from transplanted Saxons brought to the Eifel by Charlemagne. A Carthusian monk wrote in an account that Charlemagne also removed Franks from the Eifel to the Saxons‚Äô homeland as part of his campaign to break Saxon resistance once and for all.Name's origin  Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. Sassen lies on the south slopes of the Hochkelberg, the High Eifel‚Äôs third highest mountain, in a hollow with an elevation of about 550 m above sea level.  History  In feudal times, which ended in 1794 with the French occupation, Sassen belonged to the Electoral-Cologne Amt of N√ºrburg. Under Prussian administration, it was a municipality in the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Kelberg in the Adenau district. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate in 1970, the municipality, along with the others in the Amt of Kelberg, was assigned to the Daun district, which has since been given the name Vulkaneifel. Below the village once lay a farm, which may have been the ‚Äúseed‚Äù for the first settlement in what is now the municipality. The oldest houses are all bungalows built out of Rhenish brick (an air-dried brick made of 9 parts pumice to 1 part lime) and simple woodwork. The front door opens straight into the kitchen. Above the stove was the smoke hood for smoking meat. Sassen was once held by the Counts of N√ºrburg. The court was in √úlmen. Tithes were paid to the castle there and to N√ºrburg. On the Hohe Acht, a height near the village (not the like-named mountain), lay two fields, one named Zehntanwand and the other Freianwand, references to paying tithes (Zehnten ‚Äì frei means ‚Äúfree‚Äù). At the south end of the village stands a small chapel, which features Stations of the Cross. It was built in 1807, a date engraved above the door. The village's great age makes itself known in the many legends told hereabouts. One tells of a time in the Thirty Years' War when the Swedes plundered the village. On the nearby Hochkelberg once stood, supposedly, a castle of the Knights Templar, and people speak of a treasure that is supposed to be hidden there. Ecclesiastically, Sassen once belonged to the parish of √úrsfeld, but since 1809 it has belonged to the parish of √ú√ü.Sassen‚Äôs history  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Daun, whose seat is in the like-named town.  Geography   Location  Schalkenmehren The municipality of Schalkenmehren lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. It is roughly 4 km south-southeast of Daun as the crow flies, at the northeast foot of the Hoher List, a stratovolcano which is home to a formerobservatory. Several volcanic lakes, like the Schalkenmehrener Maar, the Weinfelder Maar and the Gem√ºndener Maar, lie within the municipality‚Äôs limits. The Schalkenmehrener Maar has a popular bathing area.  History  On 25 November 1287, Schalkenmehren had its first documentary mention in a document from Himmerod Abbey. Some mention of the now vanished village of Weinfeld must be made, for it is linked historically with Schalkenmehren. The only building from this forsaken village that still stands today is a small church which even now appears as a charge in Schalkenmehren‚Äôs coat of arms. It is consecrated to Saint Martin. Weinfeld lay east of this church, where a cross-country path to Mehren now leads. It had been a Roman settlement that converted early on to Christianity, perhaps as early as Constantine‚Äôs time, but certainly after Saint Boniface‚Äôs works in Germany. The village‚Äôs name is variously interpreted as being derived from Weihefeld (roughly \\"Hallowed Field\\") or from Winefeld, meaning \\"Friend‚Äôs Field\\" (this root also shows up in English, in names such as \\"Baldwin\\"). Weinfeld was a parish quite early on. The Altburg (castle), built in 731, belonged to the parish of Weinfeld. The parish included Weinfeld, Schalkenmehren with the Altburg, Saxler, Udler and three houses from Gem√ºnden. The chapel in Schalkenmehren was considered a branch of the one in Weinfeld. Today, the Weinfeld chapel is a pilgrimage site. In the yard around the chapel, the dead of Schalkenmehren are still buried, as they have been for centuries. By 1562, though, Weinfeld had been forsaken. It was in this year that the last pastor left the now dead village and moved to Schalkenmehren. In 1522, the Plague had broken out in the German Emperor‚Äôs army. A chronicle from the Saarland reports: \\"At that time, warring peoples had brought a plaguelike sickness in, which in the Rhinelands wrought great devastation. The people died en masse and suddenly.\\" Weinfeld was one of quite a few Eifel villages that were wiped out in the epidemic. The statues of the \\"Plague Saints\\", Saint Sebastian and Saint Roch, recall this time. The survivors migrated away or moved to Schalkenmehren. However, Weinfeld remained a parish until 1803 ‚Äì the onset of Napoleonic times ‚Äì and the pastors still bore the title Parish Priest of Weinfeld, even though they lived in Schalkenmehren.Weinfeld‚Äôs history In 1920, the young schoolteacher Anna Droste-Lehnert came to Schalkenmehren. It struck her that the Eifel farmers were very poor, and also that they could weave very pretty cloths, the so-called Maartuch (\\"maar cloth\\"). With friends from the Wandervogel movement, she convinced the villagers to found, together with her, a co√∂perative. In 1926, nineteen Schalkenmehren citizens joined together to form the Heimweberei-Genossenschaft Schalkenmehren e.G. The farmers wove, the farmers‚Äô wives did the cutting and sewing, and the co√∂perative marketed the products. Mrs. Droste-Lehnert also designed new patterns for the weavers. In the 1930s, the co√∂perative was very successful, and even in the difficult time just after the Second World War, it managed to keep itself going. In the 1970s, one episode of the German children‚Äôs television programme Die Sendung mit der Maus featured the co√∂perative. When the village‚Äôs structure moved away from farming and the numbers of active weavers declined, the co√∂perative was dissolved in 1983. Some active women citizens of the municipality of Schalkenmehren later founded the Heimweberei- Museum Schalkenmehren (\\"Schalkenmehren Home Weaving Museum\\"), which exhibits the history of the Heimweberei-Genossenschaft Schalkenmehren e.G. They run it as a volunteer operation.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Gerolstein, whose seat is in the municipality of Gerolstein.  Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. Scheid is the northwesternmost place in the Vulkaneifel district. It lies roughly 1 km northwest of Hallschlag on a mountain ridge. Its elevation is 593 m above sea level.Scheid‚Äôs location  Name  The name Scheid might best be explained as coming from the German word Wasserscheide, cognate with, and meaning the same as (at least in some varieties of English) the word ‚Äúwatershed‚Äù, for south from Scheid flows the Hallschlager Bach and north from the village flows the Scheider or Gonsbach. Still others derive the name from the road junction here in Roman times, when the road from Trier to Cologne and Aachen branched at what is now Scheid (scheiden means ‚Äúdivide‚Äù or ‚Äúsplit‚Äù in German; this is cognate with the English word ‚Äúshed‚Äù [v]Etymology of ‚Äúshed‚Äù (both senses)).Scheid‚Äôs name On the other hand, placename researchers hold that the name is not German at all. They derive it from the old Celtic word keito-n, meaning ‚Äúwood‚Äù or ‚Äúforest‚Äù (cf. Welsh coedwig and Breton koadeg).The Celtic theory in the explanation of Scheid‚Äôs arms  History  In 1276, Scheid had its first documentary mention as a holding of the Counts of Neuenahr. The document itself deals with Count Theoderich von Neuenahr's widow Mechtildis's and her children's pledge of their lordship of Neuenahr and other holdings with the exception of the estate of ‚ÄúGreuel in Scheid‚Äù for four years to Archbishop of Cologne Sigfrid. At this time, the village consisted of no more than a few farms. The same document also held the Archbishop to a yearly payment of three Marks from the tolls that he would raise in Scheid to Wincmarcus von Gelzdorf. With a busy road ‚Äì busy with mediaeval trade traffic ‚Äì dating from Roman times, it is understandable that there would have been a ‚Äútollhouse‚Äù in Scheid. According to local oral history, there was once a village of Niederscheid over on the opposite slope to where today's Scheid is, about 500 m to the east. The village lore holds that it was wiped out by the Plague, but no written records of this event have survived. The villagers of Scheid have from days of yore won their livelihood exclusively from agriculture. When the J√ºnkerath-Malmedy railway was built, the dwellers of the Upper Kyll Valley were afforded better links to the surrounding area. At the turn of the 20th century, a grenade factory was built 3 km from Scheid, which furnished jobs. This factory was utterly destroyed by fire after the First World War. From the late 1920s to the mid-1930s, despite the region's generally high rate of joblessness, construction was busily being carried out. This mainly entailed the building of the (second) Siegfried Line. The bunkers and line of dragon's teeth bordered right on Scheid. On the one hand, this brought the region's inhabitants better financial circumstances, but on the other hand, only a short time later they found themselves right at an active defensive line, for between September 1944 and March 1945, the front ran right through Scheid as the Allies thrust their way into Germany late in the Second World War. Scheid was almost utterly destroyed in the war. In 1927, the municipal council planned and decided, at the then mayor Josef Schr√∂der's suggestion, to clear 29 ha of wasteland to create grazing land for the municipality's livestock owners. The undertaking was approved by the Bonn Chamber of Agriculture and overseen by professionals. The cost for the whole project was assessed at 41,000 Reichsmark, of which 18,000 Reichsmark was afforded through a grant. The municipality had to come up with the rest. The project was a great success. Flurbereinigung was carried out between 1958 and 1970. After the Second World War ended, half Scheid's municipal area had become unusable for any normal, peacetime purpose because of demolished Siegfried Line bunkers and all the minefields; there were roughly a million mines. In 1956, the community centre was built, with a fire brigade area, and also a freezer room with 30 freezing chests. In 1964, sewerage and sidewalks were built. After much negotiating with the diocese, leave was granted to tear the old chapel down. The municipality financed the new chapel with a grant from the diocese. After it was finished, the municipality had to hand the new chapel over to the parish. Along with this work, a graveyard with greenspace was also laid out. In 1969, the seven wayside crosses were renewed so that an old tradition would not be forgotten. In 1970 came administrative reform. Ever since then, the forester's office, the district waterworks, the agricultural advisory centre and school, the cadastral office and the lawcourt that are responsible for Scheid, have been in Pr√ºm. In the early 1970s, there were 28 agricultural businesses in Scheid; by 2001, there were only seven, only five of which were full-time operations. Tourism has challenged farming's status as the municipality's top income earner. Nevertheless, despite the great number of agricultural businesses that have been forsaken by their owners, all usable agricultural lands in Scheid are still fully used. Scheid has rebounded from the utter destruction wrought in the Second World War. Nevertheless, Scheid's scenery includes not only its forest and open landscape with its hedgerows, but also ‚Äúdragon‚Äôs teeth‚Äù tank traps left over from wartime, stark reminders of those awful days.Scheid‚Äôs history  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Argent a bend sinister wavy between a spruce with two lower branches couped vert and a bugle-horn bendwise sinister gules. The spruce tree is a canting reference to the municipality's name, Scheid, on the assumption that the Celtic theory of the name's origin holds true (‚Äúwood‚Äù or ‚Äúforest‚Äù). The tree is also meant to stand for forestry, which has always been important in Scheid. The horn is Saint Cornelius‚Äôs attribute, thus representing the municipality‚Äôs and the chapel‚Äôs patron saint. During the 19th century, a small herd of sheep was kept in Scheid, the so-called ‚ÄúCornelius sheep‚Äù, which served to support the chapel.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Daun, whose seat is in the like-named town.  Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. Near Sch√∂nbach runs the Autobahn A 1\\\\.  Geology  The bedrock under Sch√∂nbach is made up of greywacke, a mineral of the Rheinisches Schiefergebirge (Rhenish Slate Mountains), which formed 360,000,000 years ago out of the ooze on the floor of the Devonian Sea. Often found in this stone are fossils of long extinct marine animals. Volcanic activity began aeons later, after an uplift had already laid the former seabed bare. The most recent volcanoes, the maar volcanoes, are only about 9000 years old.Sch√∂nbach‚Äôs geology (near top)  History  Traces of early human habitation have been found locally, including stone tools, sometimes ground, dating from the New Stone Age, which began about 4000 BC. They passed through the dale as hunter-gatherers and later settled, as witnessed by the ringwalls on the Hommerich and the Steineberger Ley, local peaks. There are barrows in Sch√∂nbach dating from this time, as well. Finds made there, such as ‚Äúfat- bellied‚Äù urns, small bowls, bronze rings, neck rings and iron lance heads, date the barrows to the 7th century BC. Research has yielded information that these people were Celts, more specifically the Treveri, a people of mixed Celtic and Germanic stock, from whom the Latin name for the city of Trier, Augusta Treverorum, is also derived. In Roman times, which began in 51 BC when Julius Caesar subdued the Celts, Roman roads sprang up in the Eifel, and many buildings appeared, one of which was at the foot of the Kreuzberg in Sch√∂nbach. A springwater parlour has also been brought to light. According to the State Museum in Trier, it is Roman. A Roman grave was also unearthed during Flurbereinigung. It yielded two well preserved urns, now in the State Museum. Next came the Franks, who ended Roman hegemony in the Eifel in the 5th century AD. Placenames ending in ‚Äîheim and ‚Äîhof were given places that arose as a single household, whereas groups of houses ‚Äì villages ‚Äì were given names ending in ‚Äîdorf, ‚Äîhausen, ‚Äîbach, ‚Äîfeld, ‚Äîborn, ‚Äîroth, ‚Äîrat, ‚Äîscheid, ‚Äîberg or ‚Äîbruch. Christianity first arrived in the region even in Roman times, although the Franks were not Christian when they first settled. It is known that Frankish King Clovis I converted to Christianity after his victory at the Battle of Tolbiac (Z√ºlpich). Furthermore, the preamble to the Salic law, the Franks‚Äô law written in the 5th or 6th century, reads: ‚ÄúLong live Christ, Who loves the Franks! May He keep their empire and fill its leaders with the light of His grace.‚Äù Clearly, the Franks had become a Christian power. Later on in the Middle Ages, the village's namesake brook, the Sch√∂nbach, formed the border between the Electorates of Cologne and Trier, thus splitting the village between these two bodies. In 1364, Sch√∂nbach had its first documentary mention on the Sunday after Saint Vitus‚Äôs Day (15 June). The document itself, thus dated, deals with Arnold von Daun‚Äôs yearly payment of 7 Gulden to Burkhard von Vinstigen, Lord of Sch√∂necken, and his wife Blanchflor from his half of an estate at Schonnbach; he also enfeoffed Burkhard with this holding. The Thirty Years' War spared no village in the Eifel. What was not felled by the sword was beaten by hunger and sickness ‚Äì the Plague. In 1563, before the war, Sch√∂nbach had 17 houses. In 1654, after the war, only 5 hearths remained. After the Thirty Years' War, Sch√∂nbach belonged to the Electoral-Trier Amt of Daun (actually beginning in 1357). The Electorate of Cologne, however, continued to hold the Amt ecclesiastically until 1801. In 1716, a chapel was built in Sch√∂nbach. It stood until 1968. In the wake of the French Revolution in 1789, German armies invaded France, but were not only repulsed, but also overwhelmed on their own soil. This put an end to the Electorate of Trier and indeed, all lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank then found themselves under French rule as a result of the 1797 Treaty of Campo Formio. Sch√∂nbach became part of the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Sarmersbach in the Canton of Daun, which in turn was part of the Arrondissement of Pr√ºm in the Department of Sarre. Napoleonic administrative reform grouped Sch√∂nbach parochially with Utzerath, Allscheid and H√∂rscheid, thus ending the parochial division that had prevailed in Sch√∂nbach. French rule ended with the Congress of Vienna in 1814 and Waterloo the following year, which put a definitive end to Napoleonic times. The late 18th and 19th centuries were lean years in the Eifel. Farmers owned little enough livestock without the sicknesses that struck both cattle and swine in these years, which not only decimated herds but also raised the price of meat. Furthermore, a column of 40,000 Russian troops who passed through the needy region in May 1814 on their way back home to Russia did not help matters. The Kingdom of Prussia acquired not only new territory under the terms of the Congress of Vienna, but also no dearth of new problems. Worst of all was the Year Without a Summer ‚Äì 1816 ‚Äì which almost drove the Eifel into famine. Between 1870 and 1890, railways began to crisscross the Eifel, but none ever came to Sch√∂nbach. The nearest stations were in Utzerath and Ulmen. In 1882, sixteen children in Sch√∂nbach ‚Äì and many more in the district as a whole ‚Äì died in an outbreak of scarlet fever, literally decimating the village, whose population had been 160. The turn of the 20th century brought Sch√∂nbach some measure of relief from the usual neediness. This was a time that saw the rise of industry in the cities, and this replaced the customary emigration to places overseas with migration to industrial areas within Germany itself. Many from the region found work there and remitted their earnings to the still struggling Eifel. The early 20th century brought the First and Second World Wars, each sweeping away an old order and replacing it with a new one. After the Second World War, 21 new houses were built in Sch√∂nbach and 13 other buildings were remodelled or expanded. Streets were paved and a new freezer building was built. A new chapel was built to replace the old one built in 1716. On 2 February 1959, work began on Flurbereinigung, the rearrangement of rural property boundaries, which over the centuries had become such a tangle that agriculture had become rather inefficient owing to the splintered bits of property that had arisen over time. Heading the board that oversaw this undertaking was Peter Hab and the treasurer was Rudi R√∂der, both from Sch√∂nbach. The work resulted not only in a redistribution of lands among the landowners, but also in woods and hedgerows being removed. New hedgerows were planted in some places as windbreaks, and as habitat for birds and hedgehogs. A new drainage system was also laid out.Sch√∂nbach‚Äôs history  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Sch√∂nbach‚Äôs council  Mayor  Sch√∂nbach's mayor is Armin Breuer, and his deputy is Adolf Clemens.Sch√∂nbach‚Äôs council  Coat of arms  The German blazon reads: In Silber durch schr√§glinke, blaue Wellenleiste geteilt; oben ein rotes Balkenkreuz, unten ein roter Schild belegt mit 9 (3 : 3 : 3) goldenen Kugeln.

The wavy bend sinister refers to the municipality's namesake brook, the Sch√∂nbach. The red cross refers to Sch√∂nbach's former allegiance to the Electorate of Trier as part of the Amt of Daun from 1357. The inescutcheon charged with nine bezants (golden disks, or in this case balls or orbs, as the German blazon has it) is Saint Quirinus's attribute, thus representing the municipality's patron saint.Description and explanation of Sch√∂nbach‚Äôs arms  Culture and sightseeing   Buildings  * Across the street from Borngasse 5 ‚Äì timber-frame house, 17th/18th century. * Sch√∂nbacherm√ºhle (mill), east of the village on the Ue√übachDirectory of Cultural Monuments in Vulkaneifel district  References   External links  *Municipality‚Äôs official webpage Category:Municipalities in Rhineland-Palatinate Category:Vulkaneifel ","title":"Sch√∂nbach, Rhineland-Palatinate"},{"id":"13081423","title":"Wasted Time (Fuel song)"},{"id":"13081425","text":"Schutz is an Ortsgemeinde ‚Äì a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality ‚Äì in the Vulkaneifel district in Rhineland- Palatinate, Germany.

Neighbouring municipalities  Schutz‚Äôs neighbours are Wallenborn (5 km), Weidenbach (3.5 km), Bleckhausen (1.3 km) and Deudesfeld (3.5 km).  History  In 1238, Schutz had its first documentary mention. Dietrich von Hanster (or Hanxler) was enfeoffed by Heinrich, Lord of Manderscheid and Kerpen with a castle at Manderscheid, a house in the dale and the estate and the mill ‚Äúzu Schutze‚Äù (‚Äúat Schutz‚Äù). In 1570, the chapel, consecrated to Saint Wendelin, was mentioned. In 1723, there was a dispute among Schutz, Manderscheid, Bleckhausen and Niederstadtfeld over how the woodlands of Idler and Ruckbein should be divided. It led to a court case. In 1794, the village had 94 inhabitants. In 1803, Schutz became a branch of the Parish of Bleckhausen. In 1814, Schutz was grouped into the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Weidenbach in the Daun district in the Regierungsbezirk of Trier. In 1845, a new chapel was built. In 1854, Schutz had 18 houses with 114 inhabitants. The municipality had 547 Morgen (340 ha) of wooded land, 417 Morgen (106 ha) of scrub and wild land and 4 Morgen (1 ha) of other lands. To prevent famine, in 1915, the miller had to grind 82% of the grain. Bread was made from rye meal and potatoes. On 1 February, all cereal and meal stocks were seized, as were all the oats, for the army administration. Beginning at this time, everybody received a bread ticket entitling him or her to 200 g or half a Pfund (250 g) of bread each day. On 1 April everybody got a flour ticket. There was a bumper potato harvest. The winter was marked by petroleum shortages. Many people burnt candles and others obtained carbide lamps. On 1 December 1916, according to a census, Schutz had 147 inhabitants. In 1918, Schutz was stricken twice by floods within a short time, once in January and again in May. By the time the First World War ended, 7 men from Schutz had fallen. On 21 April 1923, electric light came to the village for the first time. On 9 November, a new bell was dedicated. In 1925, work began on the watermain. In 1931, lasting rainy weather destroyed 75% of the harvest. In 1939, the bathing beach was dedicated. In 1945, after the Second World War was over, once again, 7 men from Schutz had fallen, and 4 were missing. In 1953, a new bridge on the road to Deudesfeld was built. In 1965, the memorial to the fallen in both World Wars was dedicated. In 1988, the new municipal coat of arms was chosen. A fire station was built in 1995, and work began in 2003 on a community centre, which was dedicated the following year.Schutz‚Äôs history  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Municipal election results for Schutz, 2009  Mayor  Schutz‚Äôs mayor is Thomas Tombers, and his deputy is Joachim Heibges.Schutz‚Äôs council  Coat of arms  The German blazon reads: Unter rotem Schildhaupt, darin ein goldener Zickzackbalken, in Silber ein gr√ºner Berg, darin ein silbernes M√ºhlrad.

The chief showing a gold fess dancetty (horizontal zigzag stripe) on a red field is a rendering of the arms formerly borne by the Counts of Manderscheid, although the tinctures are reversed (this might be to comply with the general rule in heraldry that holds that two colours or two metals must not touch). The village once belonged to this noble family, and then later to the Electoral- Trier Amt of Manderscheid. The green mount in base symbolizes the Burberg, which is the local landscape‚Äôs most striking feature. The green tincture stands for the scenic and heavily wooded municipal area. The waterwheel refers to the four mills that once stood in Schutz. The first was mentioned in a document as early as 1238. The Rutschm√ºhle has found its way into local legend.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. Stadtkyll lies on the river Kyll.  Constituent communities  Stadtkyll's Ortsteile are Niederkyll, Sch√∂nfeld and Stadtkyll.  History  Near the village and in the outlying centre of Niederkyll, many finds from Roman times have been unearthed during excavation work. In the lists of the Archiepiscopal Cathedraticum, which come from about 1100, is a mention of the village under the name Kyll. In the 13th century, the village quickly grew in importance. About 1250 it was raised to town and thereby also acquired the right to bear a coat of arms; the one borne then matches the one borne today. In 1292, it had already become a town girded with a wall and with a castle. In 1308, it had its first documentary mention as Stadtkyll-Opidum in the Liber valoris. Over the course of its history, Stadtkyll has been beset by several catastrophes. In 1632, in the Thirty Years' War, an army of mercenaries set most of the village on fire. In 1687, the French destroyed the village. In 1814 and again in 1854, great fires burnt Stadtkyll down. After these fires, the old town wall served as a quarry of sorts for building material to rebuild the village. The wall completely disappeared as a result, and its alignment can now only be made out in the rows of houses on Burgbergstra√üe. The heaviest destruction sustained by Stadtkyll, however, came in the air raids in December 1944 and just after New Year's, late in the Second World War, after the Battle of the Bulge. Seventy-five percent of the village was destroyed. The outlying centre of Sch√∂nfeld was bound to pay tributes to Pr√ºm Abbey in the 13th century. Beginning in the 14th century, it was administered from Stadtkyll. Since 1 January 1971, when Sch√∂nfeld was amalgamated, it has been an Ortsteil of Stadtkyll.Stadtkyll‚Äôs history Stadtkyll's other outlying centre, Niederkyll, had its first documentary mention in 1345 when the Lords of Blankenheim enfeoffed, among others, King John of Bohemia as Count of Luxembourg, with Niederkyll. The chapel was built about 1600, and was supposedly once Stadtkyll's parish church. Niederkyll's history apparently stretches all the way back to Roman times. A Roman road supposedly passed along this way, and it is also said that the chapel's tower stands on the foundation of what was once a Roman sacrificial site. In 1970, the sawing works of the firm Hermes located itself in the industrial park near Niederkyll. The company makes up a prominent part of the community's appearance with its 70 000 m¬≤ area.Niederkyll‚Äôs history On the Stadtkyller Heide, a local heath, between 1952 and 1992, stood a Decca transmitter.

The representative from the outlying centre of Sch√∂nfeld, the Ortsvorsteher, is Herbert Thielen.Stadtkyll‚Äôs council  Coat of arms  The German blazon reads: Von gold und rot durch gesenkten, schr√§glinken, blauen Wellenbalken und silberen Wellenleistenstab geteilt, der Wellenbalken mit sieben vierendigen goldenen Sternen belegt. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: A bend sinister wavy abased azure charged with seven mullets of four Or and conjoined by a bendlet sinister wavy argent, the whole between Or and gules. The Stadtkyll Castle was most likely built by the Lords of Blankenheim. In 1469, the County of Blankenheim, and thereby also Stadtkyll, found itself in the ownership of the Counts of Manderscheid, whose armorial tinctures. Stadtkyll was granted town rights in 1310, and thereby also the right to bear arms. They were more or less the same as the ones that the municipality bears today. The bend sinister in the old arms has been made wavy, however, and a silver bendlet has been added to its lower edge, to symbolize that the village's and the castle's surroundings are shaped by their location on the river Kyll.Description and explanation of Stadtkyll‚Äôs arms  Culture and sightseeing   Buildings  Stadtkyll graveyard chapel * Saint Joseph‚Äôs Catholic Parish Church (Pfarrkirche St. Joseph), Hauptstra√üe ‚Äì Classicist aisleless church, 1853/1854, originally built in 1814 to Karl Friedrich Schinkel‚Äôs plans; burnt out in 1853. * Saint Hubert‚Äôs Catholic Church (branch church; Filialkirche St. Hubert) in Niederkyll, Niederkyll 1 ‚Äì aisleless church, about 1600.

Outside, on the gable, a Roman bust of a man is set in the wall. Many legends and stories swirl around the Late Gothic Saint Hubert‚Äôs. It is said once to have been Stadtkyll‚Äôs parish church. Furthermore, stories have it that it is built on Roman foundations that formerly bore a sacrificial site that the Romans used to appease their war god, Mars. Offered as proof of this are finds of Roman coins nearby and, particularly, the find of a stone head ‚Äì now set in the wall on the chapel‚Äôs east gable ‚Äì formerly falsely claimed to be a likeness of Mars or Jupiter. Thus far, the origin of this Roman bust is unknown, as is the man whose likeness it is. Scientific interpretation has raised the possibility that it might be part of a grave, given that it is near the old Roman camp of Icorigium (now J√ºnkerath). It is even possible that the chapel‚Äôs builders interpreted it as a saint‚Äôs likeness, and accordingly set it in the chapel‚Äôs wall.  Economy and infrastructure  Stadtkyll is a state- recognized climatic spa (Luftkurort) and records in its many lodging facilities roughly 70,000 holiday guests with some 300,000 overnight stays each year. In the village centre are restaurants and small shops. One of the main attractions is a heated open-air community swimming pool with a giant chute and a rope swing. There is also an outstanding spot for anglers. The local municipality operates a forest camp for youth. A large holiday village and a camping site are partially publicly accessible.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth.  Constituent communities  Steffeln's Ortsteile are, besides the main centre, also called Steffeln, Auel and Lehnerath.  Climate  Yearly precipitation in Steffeln amounts to 946 mm, which is very high, falling into the highest fourth of the precipitation chart for all Germany. At 81% of the German Weather Service's weather stations, lower figures are recorded. The driest month is April. The most rainfall comes in December. In that month, precipitation is 1.6 times what it is in April. Precipitation varies moderately. At 65% of the weather stations, lower seasonal swings are recorded.  History  Traces of Roman settlement (a villa rustica) can be found in the rural cadastral area ‚ÄúRingmauer‚Äù not far from the village beside today's ‚ÄúR√∂merhof‚Äù (‚ÄúRoman Estate‚Äù). The tuff quarry below the church was already in use in ancient times. In 943, Steffeln had its first documentary mention as villa stephelin. In 1222, steffele was listed in Pr√ºm Abbey‚Äôs directory of holdings, the Pr√ºmer Urbar: The Count of Hochstaden held Steffeln as a fief. From the Hochstadens, Steffeln passed to the Lords of J√ºnkerath, and from them by marriage to the Schleidens. In 1282, Konrad von Schleiden sold Steffeln to Gerhard von Blankenheim. In 1489, 1501 and 1562, the Counts of Nassau and Vianden were the feudal lords. From the 16th century until 1794, the lesser lordship of Steffeln belonged to the lordship of Kronenburg under Luxembourgish Imperial territorial superiority. Between 1488 and 1593, the Counts of Manderscheid-Schleiden were enfeoffed with Steffeln. Through sale it found its way into Manderscheid-Gerolstein hands in 1617. After this line died out, Steffeln was held from 1693 to 1719 by the Manderscheid-Blankenheim line. The castle, mentioned in 1282, on the tuff crags overlooking the village was converted in the 15th or 16th century into a compulsory-labour and toll estate for the Manderscheid toll station on the long-distance trade road running from Li√®ge by way of Malmedy to Koblenz, and into a seat for the comital Schulthei√üen. Part of the residential house is preserved (the back part of today‚Äôs rectory). There was trade in ‚Äúoven stones‚Äù from the K√ºllenberg (mountain) and millstones from the Steffelberg. After a years-long lawsuit against the landlord, Count Karl of Manderscheid, a compromise was reached in 1638 before the High Court in Luxembourg, which secured what is today the extensive municipal forest for the dwellers of Steffeln. After the occupation of the lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank by French Revolutionary troops in 1794 and the French annexation of the Austrian Netherlands between 1795 and 1797, Steffeln became the seat of a mairie (‚Äúmayoralty‚Äù) in the Canton of Kronenburg, the Arrondissement of Malmedy and the Department of Ourthe, whose seat was in Li√®ge. In the course of the sweeping political changes in Europe in the wake of the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Steffeln passed as the seat of a B√ºrgermeisterei (‚Äúmayoralty‚Äù) to the Pr√ºm district in Prussia‚Äôs new Rhine Province. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland- Palatinate on 7 November 1970, Steffeln was grouped into the Daun district, which has since been given the name Vulkaneifel. Amalgamated with Steffeln that same year were Auel and Lehnerath.Steffeln‚Äôs history Auel had its first documentary mention in 983. It and Lehnerath were held in the Middle Ages by the Counts of Manderscheid-Gerolstein.  Population development  In 1632, twenty families lived in Steffeln. In 1687, however, there were already 87 houses. In the 19th century, the population figure rose steeply, reaching 229 in 1818 and 415 in 1871. Since the beginning of the 20th century, only slight changes in the figure have been observed, although the number of households has shrunk: in 1939, 445 inhabitants, in 1970, 424 inhabitants, in 1987, 447 inhabitants, in 2001, 493 inhabitants (with Lehnerath). Since the 1970s, it has become a commuter community with a pronounced rural character.Steffeln‚Äôs population development  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. The village, which lies somewhat back from the Daun Maars, is actually a typical street village (by some definitions, a ‚Äúthorpe‚Äù). Over the last few decades, particularly since the 1970s, the village has been growing. New building areas have been opened. Today, along the now four streets, live 240 inhabitants. Steineberg lies south of the High Eifel, some 20 km north of the Moselle valley, near the district seat of Daun. The village's midpoint sits at an elevation of 530 m above sea level. The highest elevation, at 557 m above sea level, is the Steineberger Ley. The municipal area comprises 124 ha of wooded land and 169 ha of cropland and meadows.

View along Steineberg's main street  History  In prehistoric times, the Celts built a stone refuge castle on the Steineberger Ley.

The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Argent a pile transposed throughout vert charged with three stones of the field, one resting on the other two, dexter a sword palewise gules, the hilt to chief, and sinister a dove of the last. The ‚Äúpile transposed‚Äù (that is, the wedge-shaped charge) stands for the Steineberger Ley, the 560 m-high volcanic cone that defines the local scenery. On this mountain, the Celts built a defensive wall out of basalt stones and logs that served the local people as a refuge castle. The stones symbolize this place. They and the mountain are also the origin of the municipality's name (Steine = stones; Berg = mountain). The sword on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side is meant to stand for the so- called Schwedenschlacht (‚ÄúSwede Battle‚Äù) in the Thirty Years' War, which was supposedly fought near the Steineberger Ley. In this battle, many peasants are said to have died by the sword. The dove on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side symbolizes Saint Francis of Assisi, the municipality's patron saint, for it is one of his attributes. The tincture vert (green) seen in the pile transposed stands for the village's scenically charming surroundings. The tinctures gules and argent (red and silver) stand for Steineberg's former allegiance to the Electorate of Trier as part of the Amt of Daun. The arms have been borne since 15 January 1990.Description and explanation of Steineberg‚Äôs arms  Culture and sightseeing   Steineberger Ley  The most prominent point of interest in the municipality is the Steineberger Ley at 557 m above sea level. This mountain on Steineberg's southeast outskirts, which can be seen from afar, and which stretches to the neighbouring municipality of Steiningen, is important to history and tourism. This thickly wooded mountain is the subject of many legends and historical events. It had its beginning in the Eifel‚Äôs once much livelier vulcanism about 35,000,000 years ago in the Tertiary. Steineberg then lay in a north-south band that was characterized by a particularly high level of volcanic activity. As a result of these natural forces, the Steineberger Ley‚Äôs bedrock is solid basalt. The second word in the name, Ley, is a word often used in the Eifel area, and it means ‚Äúcliff‚Äù or ‚Äúcrag‚Äù. Another well known occurrence of this term is in the name Loreley. View of the Vulcano- Infoplattform over Steineberg and Steiningen, looking towards Darscheid  Vulcano Infoplattform  On 3 October 2003, the Vulcano Infoplattform of the municipality of Steineberg was opened on the Steineberger Ley. The 28 m-tall tower rose with the help of subsidies from the European Union, the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, the Verbandsgemeinde of Daun and the Daun/Vulkaneifel Economic Promotion Organization (Wirtschaftsf√∂rderungsgesellschaft Daun/Vulkaneifel). The structure was, for ecological reasons built out of 100-year-old, untreated Douglas-fir logs. It has an overall weight of 38 t and supports an observation deck 24 m above the ground. Given its outstanding location above the Steineberger Ley's treetops, visitors can on a clear day see far across the Eifel and the Moselle valleys, and even make out the N√ºrburgring some 20 km away.  Celtic ringwall  The Steineberger Ley's peak bears at its south end an old fortification. Broken-down walls made of mortarless masonry and artificially steepened sides hem a gently sloping inner area of 2.2 ha. At the north end in particular, it is hard to tell natural rubble heaps apart from artificial wall remnants. An old gatehouse is believed to have stood where two wall ends clearly stand facing each other. Since there have yet to be any archaeological investigations, the complex's age can only be estimated: The size of the area and the wall building method using dry stonework (likely with a wooden truss) would seem to suggest a Celtic castle from the time between 500 and 100 BC. In those times, similar castles arose throughout the low mountain range as rival lords squared off against each other. From late Celtic (1st century BC) and late Roman times (4th century AD) come various finds that have, however, still yielded no conclusions as to the reasons why these peoples frequented the mountain. At its southern foot spreads an early Celtic burying ground with barrows (6th to 3rd centuries BC). Of the roughly 90 barrows, many of which were excavated in the 19th century, many are still discernible. The castle and the barrows are protected cultural monuments, any digging of or changes to which are therefore forbidden.http://www.landesmuseum-trier.de/ Rheinisches Landesmuseum Trier  Buildings  * Saint Francis's Catholic Church (branch church; Filialkirche St. Franziskus), Hauptstra√üe ‚Äì Gothic Revival aisleless church, 1884-1886. * Hauptstra√üe/corner of Im Br√ºhl ‚Äì former pump well, latter half of 19th century. * Hauptstra√üe/corner of Zur Held ‚Äì pump well, latter half of 19th century.Directory of Cultural Monuments in Vulkaneifel district  Economy and infrastructure   Economy  The municipality itself is characterized by agriculture, even if nowadays only one farm, dealing mainly in dairy, is still being run. Even before the First World War, many Steinebergers worked at a basalt quarry on the edge of the Steineberger Ley. Since this lay right near the historical ringwall on the ‚ÄúLey‚Äù, closure of the quarry was already being considered in the 1950s. It eventually met just this fate in 1967, and beginning in 1976, the quarry became a wetland. In 1983, the Steineberger Ley was officially declared a natural monument, thereby ensuring protection. Today, the overwhelming majority of Steineberg inhabitants work in the service and industrial sectors throughout the Eifel, mainly in Daun, Wittlich or Cochem. Long commutes to work and shopping are an everyday reality here.  Transport  Steineberg lies right near the Autobahnen A 1 and A 48, southeast of the Vulkaneifel Autobahn junction. The nearest Autobahn interchange, Daun-Mehren, is only a few kilometres away. Bundesstra√üe 421 passes by the municipality's southern limit. The nearest railway station is in Gerolstein, more than 20 km away. Steineberg can be reached by bus on route 503 from Daun.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. The vanished village of Allscheid lay northwest of Steiningen at an elevation of 475 m above sea level.  History  On 28 August 1193, Steiningen had its first documentary mention in a document signed by Emperor Heinrich VI in Boppard. The document itself dealt with a confirmation of ownership for Springiersbach Abbey, and it names Steiningen explicitly. In 1136 and 1150, great landholdings were transferred to Springiersbach Abbey. Since all secular land belonged to the Emperor, any transfer of ownership had to have its rightfulness thus confirmed. In 1144, King Conrad III had done this with Springiersbach, making it necessary for Heinrich VI to confirm the transfer to Sprenkirsbach (Springiersbach) Abbey after he took the throne in 1190. The document comes from the Koblenz Main State Archive (Landeshauptarchiv Koblenz), and the original parchment on which it is written measures 40 √ó 40 cm. It says in the text: In Steguenam curtem unam (‚ÄúIn Steiningen [we own] an estate‚Äù) It is clear from this document that Steiningen was one of Springiersbach Abbey‚Äôs holdings. This is also proved by two Steiningen municipal borderstones that were still on hand as recently as the mid 20th century, upon which the inscription ‚ÄúSp.W‚Äù, for Springiersbacher Wald (Wald means ‚Äúforest‚Äù) was chiselled. Two of these stones were used to build the back staircase at the old school, but when new building work was done in 1952, they were walled up along with the staircase, despite pleas from schoolteacher Adolf Molitor. The manor house belonging to Springiersbach Abbey, which was mentioned in the 1193 document, has completely disappeared; only a waterpipe that was unearthed by ploughing in the 1920s, leading to the estate, is still preserved.Steiningen‚Äôs history  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Municipal election results for Steiningen, 2009  Mayor  Steiningen‚Äôs mayor is Reinhold Sch√§fer, and his deputies are Horst Michels and Hermann H√§b.Steiningen‚Äôs council  Coat of arms  The German blazon reads: In Gr√ºn durch silbernen, schr√§glinken Wellenbalken geteilt; vorne eine silberne Kapelle, hinten ein silbernes Hufeisen, begleitet von zwei silbernen, f√ºnfstrahligen Sternen.

The bend sinister wavy (the slanted stripe) symbolizes the Altbach, which lends character to the local scenery. The horseshoe and the two mullets of five (star shapes) stand for the municipality‚Äôs patron saint, Saint Maurice, who is also patron saint of horses.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Daun, whose seat is in the like-named town.  Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. Strohn lies south of Gillenfeld and the Pulvermaar, a local volcanic crater lake, on the river Alf‚Äôs left bank.  Constituent communities  The following hamlets and homesteads belong to Strohn: Altheck, Buchholz, Dornheck, Herrenb√ºsch, Sprink, Tannenhof and Trautzberg.  Vulcanism  The surrounding area is characterized by the Eifel‚Äôs vulcanism. Particularly worthy of mention is the Strohner M√§rchen, a small maar that has almost dried up (M√§rchen here is a diminutive of Maar, not the German word for \\"fairy tale\\"). It came into being about 8,100 years ago through a side eruption of the R√∂merberg, a local cinder cone. Together with the Pulvermaar and the R√∂merberg, it forms a nature conservation area, which became protected in 1984. Lava bomb at Strohn In the village itself sits a lava bomb, a basalt globe formed by volcanic activity. It has a diameter of some five metres and a weight of more than 120 metric tons. It formed not through a single expulsion from the volcanic vent, but rather by being shot upwards several times and then sliding back down into the crater, getting a new coating of lava and cinder each time until it got stuck at the edge of the crater and cooled permanently. It came to light in 1969 during blasting at a quarry on the volcanic cone, and in the winter of 1980 and 1981 was towed on an iron plate over a compacted layer of snow with a bulldozer into the village centre.  History  As early as Roman times, there was a settlement at what is now Strohn named Struhna. The view into the distance from the Wartgesberg (mountain) as far as the Altburg and the heights of the Hunsr√ºck was used by the Romans, who built watchtowers on its heights. Emperor Heinrich VI, who was the great Emperor Barbarossa's son, transferred lordship over Struhna and the estate of Drucksbersch (Trautzberg) to Springiersbach Abbey. This monastery maintained a monasterial estate here with huge forest and land areas. The estate buildings stood in what is today's outlying centre of Sprink. Even today, Springiersbach's coat of arms can be found preserved on a house in Sprink. Among the places named in a confirmation document issued by Heinrich VI to Abbot Absalon von Springiersbach are cropfields and meadows at Struhna. In 1297, Count Heinrich of Luxembourg enfeoffed the knight Richard, Lord of Daun, with the tithes from Stroin. In 1299, the fief was expanded to include the whole village, which hitherto had only been an allodial holding. A newly built house ‚Äì a fortified one ‚Äì was owned in 1336 by Aegidius, Lord of Daun, who, because of this house, had to assume obligations to the Archbishop. In later centuries, the monastery's estate was forsaken. The lands and woods were sold off, and bought up by the villagers. The estate buildings in Sprink were acquired by three families. Even today, there are agricultural businesses being run there. In the Middle Ages, Strohn was also the site of a high court. In the 19th century, Strohn found itself under the lordship of the Count of Daun and thereby belonged to the County of Daun. A great fire struck the village in 1760, and it burnt down utterly. Only one house was left, the Justenhaus owned by the family Schmitz. Even the church's nave burnt down; only the tower remained standing. From inside, the old Marien Glocke (bell) still sounds. It bears the year 1483 and this inscription, in archaic German: Maria hei√üen ich, alle Weder verdriffen ich Claus von Enen gos mich (\\"Maria is my name, all weather I drive away, Claus von Enen poured me\\"). During the time of French rule, Strohn was the seat of a mairie (\\"mayoralty\\") in the Canton of Manderscheid and the Arrondissement of Pr√ºm, and even into Prussian times, this was still a B√ºrgermeisterei (also \\"mayoralty\\"). On 22 August 1841, with ministerial permission, the B√ºrgermeisterei of Strohn was amalgamated with that of Gillenfeld. The B√ºrgermeisterei of Strohn included until 1841 Brockscheid, Immerath, mit dem Heckenhofe, M√ºckeln mit Schutzalf, Niederwinkel, Oberwinkel, Sprink, Trautzberg and Strotzb√ºsch. On the road from Strohn to M√ºckeln lies the Herrenb√ºsch where graves from Roman times can still be found. Some officers who were here on manoeuvres in 1875 had one such grave right at the roadside opened. Inside, they found jugs still filled with ashes, old coins, swords, amulets and lance heads.Strohn‚Äôs history, p.1 Strohn‚Äôs history, p.2 Strohn‚Äôs history, p.3  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Tierced in mantle, dexter vert a lion's head couped Or langued gules, sinister vert a millstone argent surmounted by three ears of wheat laid per pall reversed of the second, in base argent balances of the third. The lion's head refers to Strohn's former status as a Springiersbach Abbey holding. The lion was a common charge in arms borne by abbots. Lions may still be seen in the sandstone coat of arms on a house in the outlying centre of Sprink, which was also a monasterial landholding, and on the hearth heating plate in the same house. The millstone and ears of wheat refer to Strohn's mills, of which one is still working today. The three ears also refer to agriculture, which is still important in the municipality. The balances are meant to stand for the high court at Strohn, belonging within whose jurisdiction were not only Strohn, but also M√ºckeln and Oberscheidweiler as well as the estates of Sprink and Trautzberg. The tinctures gules and argent (red and silver) stand for the Electorate of Trier; Strohn for centuries belonged to the Electoral-Trier Amt of Daun.

Constituent communities  √údersdorf's two outlying Ortsteile are Tettscheid and Trittscheid.  History  In 1287, √údersdorf had its first documentary mention in a donation document in which the earnings from the village of Oistersdorf were transferred to Himmerod Abbey. In 1563, twelve ‚Äúhearths‚Äù, or households, and some 70 inhabitants were counted in √údersdorf; Trittscheid and Tettscheid had seven households each.Hans Joachim Theis: 700 Jahre √údersdorf im Heimatjahrbuch 1987 des Landkreises Daun Until 1794, the village belonged to the Electoral-Trier Amt of Daun. In the time of French rule, √údersdorf was the seat of a mairie (‚Äúmayoralty‚Äù). When Prussia took over the Rhineland, to which √údersdorf then belonged, after the Congress of Vienna, the village passed to the then newly formed Daun district in 1815 or 1816 and was the seat of a B√ºrgermeisterei (also ‚Äúmayoralty‚Äù) in the Amt of Daun. To this mayoralty belonged the villages of Uederdorf with the Uederdorfer M√ºhle (mills), Nieder-Stattfeld, Ober- Stattfeld, Trettscheid, Trittscheid and Weyersbach (Weiersbach, today an outlying centre of Daun).Johann Friedrich Schannat; Eiflia illustrata oder geographische und historische Beschreibung der Eifel, Band 3, 1854, Seite 159 In 1878, the seat of the Amt was moved to Niederstadtfeld. The village had its first chapel quite early on. In 1717, a church consecrated to Bartholomew the Apostle was built on the spot. Today's church was built in the 1860s. A local parochial school is known to have existed beginning in 1769. The first schoolhouse was built in 1824. In 1936, the school building still used as a primary school now was built. On 1 January 1971, the formerly self- administering municipalities of Tettscheid (132 inhabitants) and Trittscheid (148 inhabitants) were amalgamated with √údersdorf.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz, Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis 2006, Seite 198  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 16 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat  Mayor  √údersdorf's mayor is Klaus Schmitt.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Kelberg, whose seat is in the like-named municipality.  Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth.  Geology  Like the rest of what is now the Eifel, the place that is now Uersfeld was underwater about 400,000,000 years ago, at the bottom of a Devonian sea. This is witnessed by fossils of sea creatures. Such things were found many years ago by Franz Kr√§mer from K√∂lnische H√∂fe (a hamlet now belonging to Kaperich) near Uersfeld's railway station. About 200,000,000 years ago, the Eifel was not only no longer underwater, but also considerably drier than it is today. It was a Triassic desert whose existence is still witnessed today in deposits of bunter and Rotliegend. About 70,000,000 years ago, a subtropical to tropical climate prevailed. The mountains H√∂chst, Hochkelberg and others in the High Eifel arose about 35,000,000 years ago as a result of Tertiary vulcanism. The maars, however, are quite new, at least geologically speaking, the Mosbrucher Weiher being only 11,000 years old, and the Ulmener Maar only about 10,000.  History  In the New Stone Age (3000 to 2000 BC), the Uersfeld-Kelberg area was home to hunter-gatherers, as witnessed by finds of flint blades and stone hatchets. The first time in which there were settlers in the area came in the first millennium BC, specifically about 700 BC, in Hallstatt times. There have been finds in the Uersfeld- Kelberg area from this time through to late Roman times, showing that there was settlement, albeit rather thin, but continuous, growing settlement nevertheless. A great deal is known about Roman times in the area from archaeological finds. What is known matches ancient authors‚Äô writings and is defined by ceramic finds and also coins. Dendrochronology can even yield details of years in which things happened. Many barrow fields can be found in the Uersfeld church woods within the limits of the outlying centre of H√∂chstberg. However, for want of any archaeological investigation, it is uncertain from what time they date, but the grave robberies and Court Counsellor Comes's (1774-1856) resulting collection in Cochem have yielded some idea of the time. Court Counsellor Comes bequeathed part of his collection to the Society for Beneficial Research (Gesellschaft f√ºr n√ºtzliche Forschungen) in Trier. The rest was auctioned off, scattering Roman finds from Uersfeld throughout the world. After the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century, there was nothing left in the Vulkaneifel but empty land. This is not hard to understand when one considers that all Western Europe lay at the perhaps 200,000 Frankish warriors‚Äô feet. The Vulkaneifel could hardly have been called the most fruitful land available to the Franks and their families, nor the land with the most favourable climate. For well over one thousand years, people held an unfavourable opinion of the region. With few exceptions, the area around the Hochkelberg and the H√∂chst, where Uersfeld now lies, was uninhabited. Only in the 11th century did the first clearing in a thousand years take place. In the early 12th century, Uersfeld (Urnesfeld) had its first documentary mention in an undated document. Research has put its date somewhere between 1120 and 1169. The Abbot of Springiersbach, Richard, is named in this document. Springiersbach Abbey's first two abbots were both named Richard. They appeared in document between 1120 and 1163. The third abbot, Gottfried von Springiersbach, only crops up in a document for the first time in 1169. The 1120-1169 time period for the document is confirmed by the mention of three witnesses to the document who are named, Heinrich von Ulmen and his brother Rudolf, and Theodorich von Klotten. All three are named in documents from 1130, and the brothers von Ulmen are furthermore mentioned in documents from 1144. In the document containing the first documentary mention, Justina, the knight Siegfried's noble wife, bequeathed three estates at Uersfeld, Wollmerath and Princka, which she had inherited from her rich father Alberto, to Springiersbach Abbey, receiving in consideration thereof eight Fuder of wine each year (a Fuder was somewhere between 800 and 1 000 L).Uersfeld‚Äôs history  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Daun, whose seat is in the like-named town. The municipality is a state- recognized tourism community (Fremdenverkehrsgemeinde).  Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. Indeed, Wallenborn is named after one of the region's phenomena, found right in the village (see Natural monuments below). Wallenborn lies roughly as the crow flies or by road southwest of Daun on Bundesstra√üe 257.  History  On 20 July 1225, Wallenbornhad its first documentary mention. Gerhard Lord of Blankenheim reached a compromise with Himmerod Abbey for a recently donated piece of land near Niederstadtfeld and Wallenborn (Walleburne), on the road between Hundswinkel and Salm. An ecclesiastical complex was first on hand in the village in 1354. Ten years later, Henne von Winneburg (Winneburg being a knightly family) held an estate at Wallenborn as a Casselburg castle fief. In 1491, Gerlach von Winneburg was enfeoffed with several Blankenheim holdings, among them the estate at Wallenborn. In 1515, the Von Zandt family had 14 subjects in the village, and the Kerpen family 3. In 1526, Johann von Winneburg was enfeoffed with the estate at Wallenborn. Only seven years later, Philipp Haust von Ulmen was granted the same fief by Count Gerhard von Blankenheim-Manderscheid. In 1559, Count Hans-Gerhard enfeoffed Hugo Zandt Voit in Hamm (Voit = Vogt) with, among other things, an estate in Wallenborn. In 1593, Johann Zandt was enfeoffed with the Wallenborn estate. In 1611 he was enfeoffed with it yet again by Count Karl. In 1614, Karl von Manderscheid- Gerolstein was Lord of Wallenborn. In 1664, Karl Ludwig von Zandt was enfeoffed with the Wallenborn estate, as were his descendants in 1711, 1732 and 1783. In 1680 and 1681, a lordly agreement was recorded at Wallenborn that still exists today. In 1681, Wallenborn belonged to the House of Arenberg. Of all fines, Zandt received two thirds, while the other third went to Kerpen, until 1794. In 1687, the villagers requested church services at their chapel. On 6 February 1705 there was a great fire in the village. The church books were all burnt. Whether the chapel consecrated to Saint Sebastian remained unscathed is unknown. In 1713, however, the rectory and the chapel were both said to be in good condition. Beginning in 1715, and lasting until about 1805, there was a chaplaincy in Wallenborn. The chaplain, or vicar, performed baptisms, weddings and funerals just like a parish priest and he kept the church books, just as a priest would in a full-fledged parish. It is also known that by 1715, Wallenborn had its own graveyard at the chapel, but probably had had it by then for as long as anyone could remember. In 1894, it was expanded. In 1719, the vicar began school instruction. In 1720, Wilhelm Dietrich, Baron of Ahr, was Lord of Wallenborn. In 1777, the vicar received for his services, including as teacher, 24 Thaler and fruit delivery from the municipality. In 1778, Wallenborn belonged to the Duchy of Arenberg, whose head, Duke Ludwig Engelbert, was later blinded as the result of a shooting accident. Wallenborn was then administered by Baron von Zandt zu Merl. In 1786, the von Zandt subjects at Wallenborn complained to the Kerpen financial office about financial penalties. In 1794, Wallenborn was in the Electoral- Trier Amt of Manderscheid and belonged to the Duke of Arenberg and the Baron of Zandt jointly. In 1802, during the time of French rule, Wallenborn, which had been in the parish of Sarresdorf in the Diocese of Cologne, was grouped into the parish of Salm, as were Michelbach, B√ºscheich and Niedereich. In 1812, a Heiligenh√§uschen (a small, shrinelike structure consecrated to a saint or saints) was built with a stone relief of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. In 1814 a new chapel was built. In 1819, a municipal assessment yielded the facts that Wallenborn had 1,114 head of cattle and 42 residents with entitlement. From 1825 to 1827, Wallenborn dwellers saw their money going to the Bishop in Trier. In 1825, a petition, with every villager's signature, was presented bearing the wish von Salm loszukommen (‚Äúto come loose from Salm‚Äù, that is, to separate from the parish). In 1826, the local landowners tried, unsuccessfully, to claim the municipal woodlands as their own. In 1830, Jakob Kraemer from Gromes was the schoolteacher. He earned 80 Thaler and was said to be adequately competent. In 1848, there was another great fire in the village. An 1854 edition of Eiflia Illustrata listed 8 springs in Wallenborn, known as Brubbeldreis; they are sulphur-bearing and deadly to insects. By 1864, Wallenborn had a new rectory. A collection undertaken with Bishop Wilhelm's approval for this purpose yielded 750 Thaler. ‚ÄúWith 8 rooms it is not a modern house, but it has comfortable spaces.‚Äù In 1868, families in Wallenborn were given money from a donation from a fire insurance institution to grow seed grain and seed potato. In 1869 Clemens Ringer from Montabaur was the schoolteacher. He earned 135 Thaler and the Pastor was said to be satisfied with him. On 21 June 1873, Franz Bender, a 26-year-old farmworker, emigrated to Ohio to live with relatives who were already there. By 1876, however, it would seem that he had come back, for he was by now the Ortsvorsteher, the village's head, and Ringer was still the schoolteacher. In 1880 came misfortune. A persistent scarlet fever and diphtheria epidemic struck Wallenborn. That same year, 17-year-old Matthias Pfl√ºger was denied leave to travel away from the village on the grounds that he was trying to avoid service in the army. In 1893, a mining concession was granted for Wallenborn, among other places, approving the mining of coal. That same year, there was trial drilling on the Heidwiese, a local area of open ground, for carbonic acid (H2CO3). The 20th century brought with it a new school building in 1906, and new financial help for Wallenborn from a fire insurance institution as ‚Äúaid‚Äù. In 1910, a fire brigade was founded, and also a fire brigade orchestra. Waterworks came in 1921. In 1928, an interesting find was made at the church. Behind the main altar were two gravestones, adorned with cross, chalice and host, of vicars (or chaplains) who had held office here in the 18th century, namely Michael Palandt and Josef Pickart, and who had been buried in the church. Likewise buried here was Margarete Webers n√©e Hees from Helterm√ºhle in Lorraine, who is believed to have been a benefactor. The 20th century also brought world wars, and on 6 March 1945, the Second World War came to an end in Wallenborn with Allied occupation. In 1951, Wallenborn was grouped into the Amt of Niederstadtfeld. The following year, the church was enlarged. In 1955, the St. Sebastianus-Sch√ºtzenbr√ºderschaft Wallenborn (‚ÄúWallenborn Saint Sebastian Marksmen‚Äôs Brotherhood‚Äù) was founded. Further work was done on the church in 1966 when a new belltower was built. On 3 June of that year, three new bells were hung, consecrated to Saint Peter, Saint Mary and Saint Sebastian. In 1970, the Verbandsgemeinde of Niederstadtfeld was dissolved, and Wallenborn was then assigned to the Verbandsgemeinde of Daun. In 1976, the Wallenborn church choir was newly founded. In 1988, the primary school had a new gymnasium and multipurpose hall built onto it, and village renovation was completed.Wallenborn‚Äôs history  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairwoman.

The nine jets of water in the chief are meant to stand for the Wallender Born (‚ÄúWavy Spring‚Äù), which gave the municipality its name. The silver arrow is Saint Sebastian‚Äôs attribute, thus representing the municipality‚Äôs and the church‚Äôs patron saint. The Lords of Zandt bore three crowned lions in their arms, and the Lordship of Arenberg bore as an heraldic charge three cinquefoils (this device is so-called in English heraldry,Parker on cinquefoils but the German text describes it as a Mispel, German for the common medlar), thus explaining the charges either side of the arrow.

These cinquefoils now appear as a charge in the municipal arms to recall this era in the municipality's history. The annulet is Saint Arnulf's attribute and the lily Saint Anthony's, thus representing the municipality's two patron saints, the former being Walsdorf's and the latter Zilsdorf's.

The holdings served to support the collegiate church at Pr√ºm that Urold endowed that same year.Erste urkundliche Erw√§hnung Weidenbachs, Homepage der OrtsgemeindeHeinrich Beyer: Urkundenbuch zur Geschichte der mittelrheinischen Territorien: Vom Jahre 1169 bis 1212 Ausg. 2, 1865 Centuries later, the Lords of Pyrmont were enfeoffed with, among other holdings, Weidenbach by Archbishop of Trier Johann II in 1457. In 1460, the Archbishop also took Weidenbach under his protection. In 1565, Count Diedrich I of Manderscheid-Kayl was enfeoffed with Weidenbach. In 1794, just before the French Revolutionary Wars, Weidenbach belonged to the court district of Ober- Stadtfeld in the Amt of Manderscheid. The lordship was held by the collegiate foundation B. M. V.

History  Welcherath had its first documentary mention in an undated document from Archbishop of Trier Ruotbert (931‚Äì56), although at least one writer claims that this document is actually a falsification from about 1100. This would mean that Welcherath's first documentary mention actually came somewhat later than is locally and popularly believed, and, given the document's allegedly false contents, it would also profoundly alter the date on which Welcherath became a parish in its own right to 1654, a full 700 years later than this alleged forgery would suggest.Falsification claim In 1138, the village belonged to Laach Abbey. In feudal times, the village was held by the County of Virneburg. Under Prussian administration, Welcherath was a municipality in the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Kelberg in the Adenau district. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland- Palatinate in 1970, the village was grouped along with the others in the Amt of Kelberg into the Daun district, which has since been given the name Vulkaneifel.Welcherath‚Äôs history  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

On 17 March 1974, Mirbach, which until then had been self-administering, was amalgamated with Wiesbaum.  History  In 804, Wiesbaum had its first documentary mention in a document that dealt with a territorial swap between Abbot Tankrad and a man named Beringar. Some holdings in Wiesbaum in the Eifelgau, which had earlier been given Tankrad's monastery along with fields, cropland, woods, meadows, grazing land and standing and flowing waters by a man named Gunthar, were now given Beringar, against which Beringar yielded up his holdings in Sefferweich in the Bitgau, some of which were his own, while others he had inherited from his mother Gomalinde. These consisted of lands, woods, fields, meadows, grazing land and standing and flowing waters. The document was drawn up by a monk named Landohic and dated 25 July ‚Äúin the 30th year of our Lord and King Karl‚Äôs rule and in the 4th year of his empire‚Äù. The ‚ÄúKarl‚Äù named here is Charlemagne. The Wiesbaum church was first mentioned in a Papal confirmation bull dated 31 March 1131 and issued by Pope Innocent II.

The Schulthei√üerei of Wiesbaum belonged until the end of feudal times in 1794 to the County of Blankenheim as part of the Lordship of J√ºnkerath. This passed in 1469 into the ownership of the Counts of Manderscheid. The Knights of Wiesbaum bore in the black chief of their arms five silver rings, or annulets. These have been taken up into Wiesbaum's arms above the line of partition, although the field tincture here is gules (red) rather than sable (black). The outlying centre of Mirbach is bound with the old noble family of the same name, who kept their seat in Mirbach. Their arms bore silver stag's horns (‚Äúattires‚Äù in heraldry) on a black field, and this device can now be seen below the line of partition in the original tinctures.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Daun, whose seat is in the like-named town.  Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth.  Constituent communities  Winkel's Ortsteile are Niederwinkel and Oberwinkel.  History  In 1143, Winkel had its first documentary mention as Winkela in a document in which King Conrad III of Germany confirmed the Springiersbach Monastery's holdings in Winkel. Fifty years later, in 1193, Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor reconfirmed the Monastery's holdings. The land where Winkel now stands was already settled in pre-Christian times. In the spring of 1958, barrows were found at the northwest municipal limit. These were investigated by the Trier State Museum (Landesmuseum Trier). Some barrows had been destroyed by agricultural activities, but one was quite intact and well preserved. It was 2.9 m long and 1.1 m wide. The museum's investigation found that the body lay in a log halved lengthwise and hollowed out to form a kind of coffin. At the man's feet lay grave goods: a \\"potbellied\\" pot and a dish. Also found was a lance whose head was about 32 cm long. The barrow was originally roughly 1.5 m high and 15 m in diameter. The graves found in Winkel are characteristic of the so-called older Hunsr√ºck-Eifel Culture of the 6th and 5th centuries BC. In the Middle Ages, the estate of Oberwinkel and the outlying centre of Niederwinkel belonged to the Lordship of Wollmerath and its attendant court jurisdiction. This lordship comprised the villages of Wollmerath, Filz, Wagenhausen and Niederwinkel, several mills (among them one in Winkel) and estates (among them the great estate in Oberwinkel, whose chapel still stands). Wollmerath was an hereditary fief held by the Counts of Wied. The overlords were Electoral Palatinate and, beginning in 1309, the Electorate of Trier. The Counts enfeoffed various lordly families with their Wollmerath landholding over the centuries: Berg (1241), Thurnst√∂√üer (1260), Mainfelder (1364), von S√∂tern (1503), von Kretzig called Mertloch (1536), von Metzenhausen (1567), von Zandt (1597) and finally von Landenberg (beginning in 1698). In a document from the 14th century, the estate of Oberwinkel is mentioned as being a Springiersbach Monastery holding. The estate was, however, much older than that. The Oberwinkel estate's importance can also be established by its having its own Weistum (a Weistum ‚Äì cognate with English wisdom ‚Äì was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times), which was even confirmed in writing and notarized by the Springiersbach Monastery on 13 January 1494. Laid out in the Weistum is the age-old law passed down by word of mouth, renewed each year at the Dingtag before the whole community so that it would last through the generations. At this Dingtag, the municipal area was exactly described and boundary markers were renewed or established. Also, the municipality confirmed who the lord was and who exercised jurisdiction. The Oberwinkel estate held its own Dingtag, which was opened with a peal from the churchbells. The estate was lease- and tithe-free, although the estate's holder was obliged to provide compulsory labour for the overlord (Springiersbach Monastery) with six horses and two farmhands. Whoever held the estate in any given year also had to lay on food and drink at the Dingtag for all the Sch√∂ffen (roughly \\"lay jurists\\") and their servants who had come to the meeting. In the 1563 Feuerbuch (\\"Fire Book\\"), the only person mentioned for Oberwinkel was the estate holder, whereas three were mentioned for Niederwinkel: the estate holder (of the Springiersbach estate of Niederwinkel), the schoemecher (\\"shoemaker\\"; Schuhmacher in Modern High German) Somer Frantz (who was also later mentioned as a miller) and der weber (\\"the weaver\\"). Niederwinkel with the estate and three further houses may have had 25 to 30 inhabitants. The estate of Oberwinkel seems to have come through the Thirty Years' War relatively unscathed. Nevertheless, neediness within the Lordship of Wollmerath was very great. The feudal lord, Ludwig Zandt, appealed in 1630, during the war, to the Elector in Trier to avert the occupation of the \\"Imperial Baronial Region of Wollmerath\\". \\"The villages in the Lordship of Wollmerath had all but died out, the mills were not working. One village was burnt down in 1630. Seeding and harvest did not happen, the land was full of warriors.\\" The estate of Niederwinkel seems to have been less lucky than the one at Oberwinkel, having fallen victim to the war. When the French Revolution reached the Rhineland and the monasterial holdings were confiscated by the French state, the hereditary landhold arrangement between the Springiersbach Monastery and the estate of Oberwinkel was also dissolved. Both the estate of Oberwinkel and the farmers at Niederwinkel were obliged to yield up great amounts of produce to the occupying French forces. In 1804, the estate was auctioned off. The lot included: one house, a yard, a barn, a stable, a sheep farm, girding wall, garden, 18 ha of cropland, 24 ha of wild and fallow land and 7.06 ha of meadowland. It was assessed as being worth 4,088 francs; its final sale price was 8,000 francs. The estate went to the old estate holder, Josef Matthias Maas, whose forebears had held the estate for 200 years. The family Maas lived on the estate until 1916. In 1922, Dr. August Cnyrim, a former notary, and his wife Marie n√©e Hellwig acquired the estate as a retirement seat, and they had the estate run by tenants. The husband and wife were both buried in the estate chapel. In the 1960s, the whole estate but for this chapel was razed for housing development, even though the chapel and the manor house were under monumental protection. Even the chapel was threatened with downfall ‚Äì albeit from disrepair, not by development ‚Äì before the little church was restored with support from the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, the district, the Ortsgemeinde and private donors. The chapel still stands today at the entrance to the village as the only remaining trace of the estate of Oberwinkel. Besides the Wollmerather M√ºhle (\\"Wollmerath Mill\\") and the Heckenm√ºhle (\\"Hedge Mill\\") there was also a gristmill in Niederwinkel. It was mentioned on the occasion of its leasing in 1555 to Franz and Christina Sommer, but was likely destroyed in the Thirty Years' War.Winkel‚Äôs history  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

Niederwinkel and the estate of Oberwinkel belonged to the Lordship of Wollmerath. Beginning in 1597, the lordship belonged to Lord Zandt von Merl. Odilie von Zandt wed Adam Heinrich von Landenberg in 1698, thereby bringing Winkel into the Landenberg family's ownership. This family bore three silver rings, or annulets, in their arms. This same charge has been taken up in today's municipal arms. The chevron is canting for the municipality's name, Winkel, which in German literally means \\"angle\\". Borne in the chief is a pair of tongs, Saint Apollonia‚Äôs attribute, thus representing the municipality's and the church's patron saint.

According to Hodgson, any unifying thread beyond that was left to the listener's imagination.  Structure  The song begins with Rick Davies playing a Wurlitzer electric piano 51-second piano solo, leading into the rest of the band joining in. There is then a guitar solo played by Roger Hodgson, making use of the wah-wah pedal, leading in the first sung word at the 1:38 mark in the song. The first verse and chorus occur with a short instrumental bridge into the second verse and second, slightly modified, chorus. The rest of the song is different variations of the chorus with a saxophone solo in the background. The song slowly fades away to the sound of the saxophone.

The Manor then contained 7 messuages, one cottage, 10 tofts, 1 water mill, 10 gardens, 14 orchards, of land, of meadow, of pasture, of wood, of furze and 4s annual rent and 1 lb of pepper. Babington House The current Babington House was built around 1705 for Henry Mompesson, probably on the foundations of an earlier building. Babington was inherited by successive members of the Knatchbull family until 1952, when the House and immediate grounds were sold. In 2000, it was bought by the Soho House club, and converted to a hotel, club and wedding venue in 2000. The Georgian architecture house is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. The 18th-century stable block and coach house have now been made into three separate dwellings. The grounds also contain a listed ice house and two impressive sets of gates. Church of St Margaret The church is thought to date from 1748 and was probably built by John Strahan or William Halfpenny, and is considered to be very similar in conception to Redland Chapel in Bristol which was long considered to be by John Strahan but now known to be by William Halfpenny. It is a Grade I listed building. The interior includes an unusual Royal Arms of the Hanoverians on the Rood. The church is owned and operated by the St Margaret's, Babington, Charitable Trust, and is licensed for weddings and public worship. The Trust works in partnership with the management of Babington House, which is adjacent, to arrange weddings for Babington House clients in the church. The church is not exclusively for Babington House clients. Within the churchyard there are a set of three chest tombs. The monument to John Shute is dated 1688 and that to Thomas Branch 1779. Charity Cottage Charity Cottage (or White Cottage) in Charity Lane Charity Cottage in Charity Lane dates from the 17th century and was built as three cottages, although they have now been converted into one property.

During that month and in December, she shuttled fuel to Johnston Island and to bases in the Hawaiian Islands. On 31 December, she sailed southwestward to begin duty as a unit of ServRon 10. By mid-January she was in the Marshalls, and on 12 February, she arrived at Saipan, where she discharged cargo during March. At the end of that month, she commenced shuttling fuel to Iwo Jima and continued that duty, alternating it with station ship duty at Saipan, into August.  End-of-war activity  At the end of the war, Sequatchie was at Saipan where she remained until 26 September, when she returned to Iwo Jima to assume station ship duties there. At the end of November, she returned to Saipan.  Post-war decommissioning  The tanker remained in the Central Pacific until ordered back to the United States for inactivation in 1946. In March, she arrived on the U.S. West Coast. At the end of May, she got underway for the Gulf Coast; and, on 26 June, she was decommissioned at New Orleans, Louisiana. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 15 August; and, on 7 October, she was returned to the Maritime Commission and laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Mobile, Alabama.

The disputed territory was claimed by the nascent Ukrainian state, the Western Ukrainian People's Republic, which also was disputed by the Ukrainian People's Republic and the recently re-established Poland. The area claimed between these three groups was a mixture of Polish, Ukrainian, Jewish peoples intermixed throughout the area. The attack was initially successful, with Ukrainian forces successfully taking a vast swathe of territory,Subtelny however in the end the offensive was repelled by the overwhelming numerical superiority of the Polish forces that pushed the Ukrainians back. Eventually, the interwar future of Galicia was decided at the Allied Council of Foreign Ministers that officially hostilities were ceased, however operations existed all the way to the Zbruch River.KubiyovychEncyclopedia of Ukraine The goals The goal of the Chortkiv offensive was to push the Polish army back to the Zolota Lypa River in order to improve morale among the Ukrainian army and locals by mobilizing a larger army to push the Poles back past Lviv, Przemysl, Chelm, Lublin, and other claimed territories by the Western Ukrainian Republic. The offensive On 8 June the 19,000 strong UHA assaulted the city of Chortkiv, forcing the Poles to retreat to the Holohory‚ÄìPeremyshliany‚ÄìBukachivtsi line. Under the command of Oleksander Hrekov, the Ukrainians came close to Lviv, the main city of the province, which was their greatest success. The Ukrainian forces also gained victories at Yazlovets (10 June), Buchach (11 June), Pidhaitsi, Nyzhniv and Ternopil (14 June) and Berezhany (21 June).Pidkova Polish counterattack As the UHA suffered from a lack of ammunition, on 28 June a better equipped and much larger Polish force broke through the Ukrainian lines at Janczyn and forced the UHA to retreat to the Zbruch River. Eventually the Ukrainians were forced back toward the Dnipro Valley then controlled by the Ukrainian People's Republic, another nascent Ukrainian state that did not hold the same territorial aspirations as its ethnic neighbor. Aftermath Though the UHA initially experienced numerous early victories, the numerical and technical superiority of the Polish forces ended its rule. Thus the predominantly Ukrainian provinces of former Austrian Galicia were forcefully integrated into the Polish Republic.

Diplovertebron was a medium-sized animal, around 50 cm in length. Members of the genus inhabited European Carboniferous swamps in what is now the Czech Republic. They were closely related to larger swamp-dwelling tetrapods like Proterogyrinus and Anthracosaurus. However, Diplovertebron were much smaller than these large, crocodile-like creatures. Known from a single species, Diplovertebron punctatum, this genus has had a complicated history closely tied to Gephyrostegus, another genus of small, reptile-like amphibians.  History  Plate 53, Friƒç's illustration containing fossils from the larger slab Diplovertebron was one of many tetrapods found in Czech coal swamps by Antonin Friƒç in the late 19th century. Its remains were an assortment of disarticulated fossils encased in two slabs of coal, which were designated Fr. Orig. 96 (for the smaller slab) and Fr. Orig. 128 (for the larger slab). D.M.S. Watson (1926) assigned two more complete specimens to the genus. One of these had already been named as the type specimen of the reptile-like tetrapod Gephyrostegus by Otto Jaekel in 1902, while the second specimen, DMSW B.65, was newly described. A later study, Brough & Brough (1967), restored the validity of Gephyrostegus and rebuked Watson's decision to add Jaekel's and his specimens to Diplovertebron. Richard Lydekker renamed Diplovertebron to Diplospondylus in 1889, based on the fact that the etymology of \\"Diplospondylus\\" was all Greek, while that of \\"Diplovertebron\\" was a hybrid of Greek and Latin. However, few other paleontologists shared Lydekker's aversion to hybrid names. Another aspect of Diplovertebron's history which led to some confusion relates to the labeling in Friƒç's original lithographic illustrations. Plate 53, the illustration which featured remains from the larger slab of Diplovertebron fossils (Fr. Orig. 128), was accidentally labeled as pertaining to fossils from the smaller slab (Fr. Orig 96). As a result, many paleontologists misunderstood the original description and ignored the larger slab when describing Diplovertebron, as they assumed that there was only a single slab (Fr. Orig. 96) available. There were only a few exceptions to this mistake, namely Steen (1938) and Klembara et al. (2014). Several Czech fossils described by Friƒç as other genera may actually represent additional Diplovertebron material. Hemichthys problematica, a supposed fish skull described in 1895, was later found to be an anthracosaur skull. Klembara et al. (2014) petitioned for a redescription of Hemichthys, which they regarded as a nomen oblitum. Likewise, an embolomerous tail with dense scalation along its underside was named Nummulosaurus kolbii in 1901. Romer (1947) could find no evidence that Nummulosaurus was not identical to Diplovertebron. Romer was also one of the few paleontologists to consider Diplovertebron to be a seymouriamorph, rather than an embolomere. However, this classification scheme was based on Gephyrostegus fossils, as the two genera were still considered synonymous in 1947.  Description  Historical recounts of Diplovertebron between 1926 and 1967 typically reconstructed it as a reptile-like terrestrial animal with five-fingered hands and feet. However, these reconstructions were created using more complete skeletal remains of Gephyrostegus and Solenodonsaurus, which at the time were considered to be synonymous with Diplovertebron. Without these skeletons, the fossil remains of Diplovertebron are much more limited. Nowadays it is assumed that Diplovertebron was partially or fully aquatic, akin to other embolomeres like Archeria and Proterogyrinus. Nevertheless, it was probably still similar to Gephyrostegus in terms of general proportions. Like other embolomeres, each of Diplovertebron's vertebrae were composed of two ring-shaped components of equal size. Friƒç originally regarded this as a unique feature, but as early as 1884, E.D. Cope drew connections between the vertebrae of Diplovertebron and \\"Cricotus\\" (an American embolomere more commonly known as Archeria). The preserved vertebrae were from the tail region, since the front segment (intercentrum) connected to thin haemal arches. alt=The fragmentary skull bones are only slightly ornamented with striations, rather than the numerous pits that were present in its relatives. The premaxilla contained five thick and conical teeth, about twice as long as they were wide. The maxilla likely had over 30 teeth in it, and its teeth were thinner than those of the premaxilla. The teeth towards the front of the maxilla were thicker and more widely separated, while those at the back were closely packed. The teeth of the lower jaw were more numerous, closely packed, and much smaller than those of the upper jaw. There were over 40 in total, and the first 7 were the largest and most well-spaced. All of the teeth possessed maze-like enamel folding similar to other \\"labyrinthodonts\\". These dental features showed some similarities to the teeth of Calligenethlon, an embolomere which was similar in size to Diplovertebron. The belly was covered with long, oblong scales with rounded edges, while the back was bare. Various limb bones were preserved. Unusually, they were covered with tiny pores. The humerus had a strong diagonal ridge along half of its shaft, similar to that of Archeria. The pelvis was also quite similar to that of Archeria and Calligenethlon in the fact that the ilium had a structure typical for embolomeres: two rod-like prongs atop a short \\"stem\\". The front prong was short, but the rear prong was very long Friƒç (1885) referred an interclavicle to Diplovertebron, though it may have actually been from Gephyrostegus instead.

Reverend Elam Stevenson was of Scots-Irish descent, being the son of James Stevenson of Iredell, now Alexander County, North Carolina who was a Captain in the American Revolutionary War. Elam was the third son and the first of the family to join the Methodist Church. He professed religion in 1804 and joined the church in 1806.

Sargus was elected probate and juvenile judge of Belmont County, Ohio in 1966. After only four weeks in this position he died of a heart attack on March 4, 1967. Because of his concern for juveniles, a multi-county juvenile detention facility located in St. Clairsville, Ohio was named in his honor. Sargus married Anne Elizabeth Kearney in 1946. The two met while Sargus was stationed in Newport, Rhode Island during World War II. Sargus attained the rank of Lieutenant Commander during his service.

It was opened by Lady Cicely Gore, the Marchioness of Salisbury and wife of James Gascoyne-Cecil, 4th Marquess of Salisbury. Another grammar school, the Apsley Grammar School, opened in the town in 1955. Comprehensive It became a comprehensive school in 1971, when schools in the town were reorganised. Buildings The original Hemel Hempstead School building (known as 'Main Block' today) opened in 1931, along with a canteen and gymnasium block to the west and north of it. In the early 1960s an outdoor swimming pool was installed. In the latter half of the 1960s a new assembly hall, canteen, sports hall and changing rooms, and technology block were constructed. Work was completed shortly before the school became comprehensive. In 1974 a \\"temporary\\" languages block was opened, which had been built on the land of the old canteen building which had been disused since 1969. In the late 1960s, a 15th-century barn (called Heath Barn) to the south of the school fields was reconfigured and put back into use as a Music block. In 1990 a new Technology block was built adjacent to the former swimming pool. In 1999 the swimming pool was demolished and replaced with car parking. In the same year a new block containing Maths, Geography and ICT classrooms was constructed next to the old Sports hall, with 12 classrooms. In 2004 a new Sixth Form block was completed, essentially an extension to the Main Block (but east of West Block), that replaces storage space. In 2008 and 2010 new Drama and Food Technology blocks were opened. Sometime around 2017, an astro turf playing field was completed on the site's southern grassland. In 2019, the Heath Barn building referred to above was sold, with the music department moved to a newly built two-storey mixed use block commonly referred to as \\"North block\\". In May of the same year, a new sports hall was opened on the site of the old sports hall.

An officer in Morocco during his early life, Barreto sailed to Portuguese India and was eventually appointed viceroy of the colony. After his return to Lisbon, he was tasked with an expedition to southeast Africa in search of legendary gold mines. Barreto died in what is now Mozambique, having never reached the mines. Early life Barreto was born in Faro, Portugal, in 1520, to Rui Barreto and Branca de Vilhena. He received military training in Morocco, and eventually became captain and governor of Azemmour, near Casablanca. Viceroy in Goa Coat of arms of the Portuguese colony of Goa In 1547 Barreto arrived in Portuguese India. He took up the position of viceroy in Goa, headquarters of the colony, in June 1555, following the death of Pedro Mascarenhas. On the occasion of his investiture, a play by Lu√≠s de Cam√µes, Auto de Filodemo, was put on. Barreto later ordered Cam√µes exiled to Macau (also a Portuguese colony) for his satirical Disparates da √çndia, which criticized Portuguese life in India. During his tenure as viceroy, the intended Catholic Patriarch for Ethiopia arrived, accompanied by an embassy led by Fernando de Sousa de Castello Branco, on 15 March 1556. Because he had more accurate information on matters in that country, Barreto held back most of this party, although allowing Bishop Andr√© de Oviedo to continue with some companions. This small group, carried in four small ships, landed at Arqiqo in March 1557, shortly before the Ottoman Empire occupied that port.Baltazar T√©llez, The Travels of the Jesuits in Ethiopia, 1710 (LaVergue: Kessinger, 2010), pp. 138f According to Robert Kerr in A General History and Collection of Voyages and Travels, Mascarenhas, in a bid to gain a Portuguese ally in the region, had supported a usurper against one Adel Khan, King of Visapur. Mascarenhas died shortly after sending soldiers to aid in the usurper's takeover, and Barreto continued Portuguese support of the usurper until his capture. In 1557, Barreto clashed with Khan's army at Ponda and was victorious. Return to Lisbon Barreto was succeeded by Constantino de Bragan√ßa in 1558, and he left Goa for Lisbon aboard the √Åguia on January 20, 1559. After a damaging storm she was repaired in what is now Mozambique, and set sail again on November 17 of the same year. Soon after she sprang a leak, and returned to the African coast. Barreto returned to Goa on a different boat, almost dying of thirst on the trip. Once back he again set sail for Lisbon, this time on the S√£o Gi√£o. She reached the Portuguese capital in June 1561, 29 months after Barreto first left the city. In 1564, King Philip II of Spain requested Portuguese naval aid in capturing Pe√±√≥n de V√©lez de la Gomera, an island off the coast of Morocco. Portugal supplied and Barreto commanded a fleet consisting of a galleon and eight caravels alongside Spaniard Garc√≠a de Toledo, and the combined navy took over the island's fort in two days. Expedition to Monomotapa After Barreto's return to Portugal, King Sebastian gave him the job of leading an expedition to Monomotapa (Great Zimbabwe) to take over the empire's legendary gold mines. According to historian Diogo de Couto, the reason for the expedition was that Portuguese mercantilists thought that the country needed mines to bring in gold similar to Spain's in the Americas (the country's colonies in Asia were not bringing sufficient wealth back to Portugal). Barreto was given instructions to \\"undertake nothing of importance without the advice and concurrence\\" of Jesuit Francisco Monclaros.Kerr, p. 447 Barreto set sail from Lisbon on April 16, 1569, with three ships, 1,000 men, and the title of Conqueror of the Mines, bestowed upon him by the king. The first boat arrived in Mozambique in August 1569, Barreto's on March 14 of the next year, and the third ship months later. Although Barreto opted to take the easier route, via Sofala, to the location of the mines, Monclaros demanded that the expedition take the Sena route, as this would lead them to where another Jesuit, Gon√ßalo da Silveira, had been thrown into a river and killed in 1561. So the expedition set out for Manica, the reputed location of the great mines, via the Sena route. The expedition sailed up the Cuama river in November 1571, armed with weapons and mining tools, and arrived in the Sena region on December 18. Barreto sent an envoy to the Emperor of Monomotapa with a request for permission to attack a people called the Mongas, whose territory lay between the Portuguese and the mines. The emperor granted Barreto permission to attack them and even went so far to offer his own men. Barreto, however, declined assistance, and marched onward upriver.Kerr, pp. 453-455. The Portuguese fought several battles against the Mongas, victorious in all of them despite the overwhelming numbers due to their guns. According to Kerr, when their king sent ambassadors to Barreto in hopes of securing a peace, the soldier tricked them into thinking that the camels used by the Portuguese, creatures foreign to southeastern Africa, subsisted on flesh, leading the Mongas to provide the Portuguese with beef for the camels. Before the expedition could further progress Barreto was recalled to the Island of Mozambique to deal with one Ant√≥nio Pereira Brand√£o, who was spreading false information about Barreto. The governor removed him from duty as commander of the S√£o Sebasti√£o fort, and returned to Sena where his men were waiting. At this point, however, many of the men were sick with tropical diseases, and Barreto too fell ill. He died at Sena on July 9, 1573, having never reached the mines, and was buried at the Igreja de S√£o Louren√ßo in Lisbon alongside his wife, Brites de Ata√≠de. Homem continues the search Barreto's deputy, Vasco Fernandes Homem, succeeded him as governor and returned with the remaining company to the coast. After Monclaros had left for Lisbon, the expedition to Manica was resumed via the Sofala route. The mines, when finally reached, did not resemble the legends, with the natives only producing very small amounts of gold. After further failure looking for different mines in a neighboring kingdom, Homem abandoned the search for gold.Kerr, pp. 456-458 See also *Ophir References Category:1520 births Category:1573 deaths Category:People from Faro, Portugal Category:Portuguese soldiers Category:Portuguese expatriates in Mozambique Category:Colonial people in Mozambique Category:Viceroys of Portuguese India Category:16th- century explorers Category:Portuguese explorers Category:Explorers of Africa Category:Infectious disease deaths in Mozambique Category:Portuguese colonial governors and administrators Category:16th-century Portuguese people ","title":"Francisco Barreto"},{"id":"13082030","text":" Heathoberht (also Heathubeorht or Hathoberht) (died 801) was a medieval Bishop of London.

One of the highlights of his career was his appointment as the first Dean of the newly formed University of Georgia Graduate School in 1910. Much of the present success of graduate programs at the University of Georgia can be traced to his visionary leadership. Throughout his career, Bocock maintained a reputation for excellence in scholarship and leadership. Bocock was, as were many members of the first graduate faculty, a Virginian. He was born in 1865, the son of a prominent Presbyterian clergyman. He attended school in Lexington, Virginia and at the Kemper School (later Kemper Military School) in Boonville, Missouri.Bocock‚Äôs uncle was headmaster of Kemper. Kemper had been founded by Bocock‚Äôs maternal grandfather, Frederick T. Kemper. Bocock entered Hampden-Sydney College in 1881. He graduated in 1884 with the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Letters. After his graduation from Hampden-Sydney he spent a year at the University of Virginia and obtained diplomas in Latin and Greek. Bocock was a recipient of the now extinct Master of Arts degree from Hampden-Sydney. Bocock spent the year after he left the University of Virginia in Richmond as a school teacher. He was offered the position of professor of Greek at Hampden- Sydney in 1886, a position which he gleefully accepted. Hampden-Sydney president J. D. Eggleston wrote of Bocock: ‚ÄúI doubt whether Hampden-Sydney has ever had a more brilliant teacher than W. H. Bocock. He was elected full professor when he was twenty-one.‚ÄùJ. D. Eggleston in Brinkley, On This Hill, 612. Bocock also attended the University of Berlin in the period 1892-93 and traveled throughout Europe. He was offered the chair of Professor of Ancient Languages at the University of Georgia in 1889. In 1894 separate professorships of Greek and Latin were created. Bocock assumed the professorship of Greek and William Davis Hooper, another Hampden-Sydney graduate, assumed that of Latin. With the formation of the University of Georgia Graduate School in 1910, and Bocock‚Äôs appointment as dean, he assumed demanding administrative duties as well as maintaining excellence in teaching. Bocock‚Äôs career illustrates the problem with the lack of publications by nineteenth and early twentieth century faculty. Bocock was a talented and assiduous researcher, what he did not have is free time to compile his research. Thomas Walter Reed comments about this problem: \\". . . that the inability of the University of Georgia and other Southern institutions to provide enough members of their faculties to make it possible for some members to have time in which to prepare and publish articles and books of great value, has resulted in a loss to American literature of many valuable contributions.\\"Reed, History of the University of Georgia, http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/reed/ page 1151. This is certainly true of Bocock, although he made regular contributions to journals such as: Studies in Philology, Classical Review, and American Journal of Philology, he was never able to publish any extended work. Bocock developed an interest in international relations as a result of World War I. He was named Lecturer on International Relations by the University of Georgia Board of Trustees in 1931 and was a popular and prolific speaker on this subject. Bocock served as Dean of the Graduate School for eighteen years. In his tenure enrollment rose from twenty-four graduate students in 1913 to over two hundred in 1928. He stepped down in 1928, at the age of sixty-three, because he felt it was time for a younger man to assume the leadership role. He was succeeded by Roswell Powell Stephens of the Mathematics Department. Bocock continued teaching and at his retirement in 1945, had served the University of Georgia for fifty-six years. He was noted as an exacting and systematic scholar. It was this outlook that he brought to the systematization of graduate education at the University of Georgia. Bocock and R. L. McWhorter taught, in 1910, a major graduate course in Greek which consisted of literary selections and exercises in grammar, written and spoken Greek, history, and poetry. The course description points out a problem with early graduate education at the University of Georgia that was common with many other institutions: ‚Äústudied from sources so far as the library resources of the University permit.‚ÄùUniversity of Georgia Graduate Bulletin, 1910-11, 3. Bocock also taught, by himself, ‚ÄúAn Introduction to New Testament Greek.‚Äù These classes were in addition to undergraduate teaching and his duties as Dean. The New Testament Greek class was not offered after 1913 and after 1923, Bocock taught the major Greek class by himself. Bocock often decried the declining interest by students in Greek, symptomatic of this is the fact that the 1931-32 Graduate Bulletin notes: ‚ÄúFor courses in Greek Literature, consult the professor.‚Äù207 After 1931, the Greek Literature class would be transformed into ‚ÄúIntroduction of European Literature‚Äù which had a prerequisite of three years of college-level Latin. Greek literature was no longer studied in the original language but was now ‚ÄúGreek Literature in Translations.‚Äù In a memorial to Bocock in 1948, Robert Preston Brooks wrote: \\"Mr. Bocock was an altogether charming companion. Few men were so perennially delightful. The depth and variety of his knowledge of literature, ancient and modern, and of world history and contemporary affairs was impressive; and he invariably expressed his views in perfect English. No one was ever bored in his presence.\\"Georgia Alumni Record, April 1948. Bocock continued to serve the Graduate School after leaving the deanship. He served as a member of and advisor to the Graduate Council into the 1940s. He retired from the University of Georgia in 1945. Bocock married Bessie Perry Friend of Petersburg, Virginia in 1885. The Bococks had two children: John Holmes Bocock and Natalie Friend Bocock. Bocock died October 31, 1947 in Richmond, Virginia. Notes References *Boney, Frederick N.

The Witham valley in Lincolnshire is notable for its high concentration of monasteries--there were six on the east bank and three on the west--all presumably drawn to the area by the usefulness of the River Witham for transport and by the wealth (in wool) that it transported. The abbey was largely destroyed by 1538, after being seized during Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries. The abbey ruin is located off the B1190 between Bardney and Horncastle. is a Grade I listed building It is maintained by Heritage Lincolnshire, and may be visited, free of charge, any day, from dawn until dusk. The Placename The name Tupholme reflects the influence of Scandinavian cultures on Lincolnshire during the Danelaw during the 9th-11th centuries and it means basically an island where rams were raised. 'Tupp' is a word for male sheep first used in the north of Britain during the Middle Ages, with origins generally given as 'unknown', though it is conceivably related to the Swedish word 'tupp' meaning a male chicken (cock).An English and Swedish Dictionary As for the 'holme' in Tupholme, it comes from an old Norse word 'holmr', meaning an island and indicating that the abbey once stood on an island in a marsh, the surrounding lands having been wet before the fens were drained for farming. The Premonstratensian Order An order whose medieval traces are not much averted to in modern England is the Order of Canons Regular of Pr√©montr√©, also known as the Premonstratensians, the Norbertines and formerly, in Great Britain and Ireland, as the White Canons (from the colour of their habit). This is an international religious order founded in 1120 in Pr√©montr√© near Laon, France, by Saint Norbert of Xanten, who later became Archbishop of Magdeburg. Norbert was a friend of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, the great Cistercian abbot, and like Bernard aimed at intensification of the Christian life. However, the Premonstratensians are not monks but Canons Regular. Like monks, the Canons Regular live in community and celebrate together the various religious services. Unlike monks, however, the work of Canons Regular places fundamental emphasis on preaching and the exercise of pastoral ministry. There have been and are several orders of Canons Regular, of which the Premonstratensians are one. The latter were ruled by an abbot general who before the French Revolution was the abbot of their French motherhouse of Pr√©montr√©, but is now resident in Rome. The larger houses of Canons Regular are sometimes ruled by an abbot and the smaller ones by a prior. All the orders of Canons Regular have as their fundamental guidelines the ancient Rule of St. Augustine, but with supplementary statutes that apply this to times and circumstances. The Premonstratensian order received approbation by Pope Honorius II, in 1126. At that time they had in all nine houses, but by the mid-fourteenth century throughout western Europe there were some 1,300 monasteries for men and 400 for women. The order came to England about 1143, first founding a house in Lincoln known as Newsham (or Newhouse) Abbey. By the early sixteenth century they came to have 35 houses throughout the country, with other houses in Scotland and Ireland. All, like Tupholme Abbey, were wiped out during the Protestant Reformation. In the Middle Ages, Lincolnshire was one of the most densely populated parts of England. Within the historical county there were no less than nine Premonstratensian houses. Other than Tupholme Abbey, these were: Barlings Abbey, Cammeringham Priory, Hagnaby Abbey, Newbo Abbey, Newsham Abbey, Orford Priory (women), Stixwould Priory and West Ravendale Priory. A House of Canons Regular The abbey was founded in honour of the Annunciation between 1155 and 1165 by Gilbert and Alan de Neville by appeal to the Premonstratensians. As the founding community, an abbot and twelve canons were sent from Newsham Abbey, also in Lincolnshire. In the Middle Ages, Lincolnshire was one of the most densely populated parts of England. Within the county there were no less than ten Premonstratensian houses. Other than Tupholme Abbey, these were: Barlings Abbey, Broadholme Priory, Cammeringham Priory, Hagnaby Abbey, Newbo Abbey, Newsham Abbey, Orford Priory, Stixwould Priory and West Ravendale Priory. The original endowment of Tupholme Abbey embraced the demesne at Tupholme and other smaller parcels of land, along with the churches of Burreth, Middle Rasen, Market Stainton, Ranby, and Sturton. Long after the founding endowments, we know that in 1329 Henry, Earl of Lancaster (c. 1281-1345), a grandson of King Henry III (1216‚Äì1272), granted the Lincolnshire manor of Burreth, and in 1342 Ralf de Neville donated that of Ranby. However, Tupholme was never a prosperous house-- in 1347, when the abbey was heavily in debt, an enterprising abbot was accused of \\"forgery and counterfeiting of coin of the realm\\", allegedly using the proceeds to buy corn and wine, which he sold for a profit. Was this an attempt to finance the Abbey? Records of visitations in the later years of the abbey also show some misdemeanours--in 1497 Thomas Pynderwelle was banished to Croxton Abbey in Leicestershire as he was said to have become involved with a local woman called Philippa and fathered her child. In 1482 the behaviour of the canons had evidently been unruly, as they were forbidden to leave the precincts of the abbey without permission, or to sit up drinking after Compline (the last service of the day). The penalty for such misdeeds was to be three days on a bread and water diet. Nevertheless, these negative episodes are perhaps little against a silent record of almost four hundred years of an institution dedicated in large part to prayer, pastoral ministry among the local people and care of the poor. Tupholme was a small house and as such was suppressed in the first wave of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, in 1536. The clear revenue of the Abbey in 1534 had been ¬£100 14s. 10d. The last abbot, John Ancaster, was given a pension of ¬£18 and eight other canons received ¬£1 each, which was regarded as a usual amount.

List from the Victoria County History. Seizure and Development of the Site The site of the abbey, together with the church, bell tower and church yard, did not go to the poor and needy, but was granted to Sir Thomas Heneage of Hainton. The Heneages were a family already making its way. This Sir Thomas may have been the man who with his brother, Sir Robert Heneage, was a member of Henry VIII's Privy Chamber. In 1536‚Äì1546 Thomas was also Henry VIII Henry's Groom of the Stool, no less. His siblings included George Heneage (1484-1549), a former chaplain to Thomas Wolsey and at various times archdeacon of Oxford, archdeacon of Taunton, archdeacon of Lincoln and dean of Lincoln. Their brother was John Heneage (1484-1557), a member of Parliament, and their nephew was Sir George Heneage (c. 1520-1595), also a member of Parliament. It seems likely that the church was demolished at an early stage of remodelling the site, churches being generally seen as a profitable source of lead and building materials. Moreover, having the church out of the way may have salved qualms of conscience about depradation of a sacred site. Heneage built a grand house, based on the monastic buildings, for his daughter Elizabeth and her husband William Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby of Parham, who may have been the man of the same name who in 1536 was in service with King Henry VIII's illegitimate son, Henry Fitzroy and the nephew of the man, Gilbert Tailboys, 1st Baron Tailboys of Kyme, who in 1520 married Henry Fitzroy's mother, Elizabeth Blount. The house Heneage built was in the fashionable Tudor style and surrounded by a large Tudor formal garden, of which traces remain on the site. This mansion passed through theWilloughby family until it was sold in 1661 by the the then Lord Willoughby, onetime Governor of Barbados after whom a colony that is now part of Suriname, was once called Willoughbyland. Upon sale, the house and grounds became the property of the Vyner family, whose head at the time, Sir Thomas Vyner, a gold dealer and former sheriff and Lord Mayor of London was that same year created a baronet by Charles II. Ruins of the Abbey Ruins of the Abbey By 1700 the style of the Tudor mansion was deemed unfashionable and the Vyners proceeded to demolish it, building in the classical style a new house called Tupholme Hall (demolished 1976), located some 750 metres north-east of the abbey site. They cleared away the old house, but retained the one surviving wall of the medieval abbey as an eye-catching feature, a fashionable ornament in their surrounding landscaped parkland. Despite these developments, in the 1730s the Vyners moved to yet another house in the possession of their family, Gautby Hall, and let Tupholme to tenants. In the 18th century, a farmyard developed around the site of the remaining wall. By the start of the 20th century this had become a busy farmstead, but by the middle of that century it had declined and the site was used only for labourers' housing, by the 1970s becoming empty and derelict and despite attempts to save it, was demolished in 1984. However, Tupholme Abbey was to have one more moment of fame, for in 1972 one of the country's biggest pop festivals, starring Rod Stewart and the Beach Boys (among many others), was held there. In 1988 the site was acquired by Heritage Lincolnshire, and the ruin was repaired and opened to the public. The surviving monastic ruin at Tupholme now comprises a single wall, standing two storeys high, virtually to eaves height. It has small square-headed windows lighting the lower storey which was a vaulted undercroft. The upper floor was the refectory of the abbey and has beautiful lancet windows and a very fine reader's pulpit. The reader's pulpit has clearly been 'prettified', presumably as part of the Vyners' landscaping scheme--but thankfully so, as it would not otherwise have survived in such a stone-hungry region. Geography and ecology There are several fruiting trees on the grounds, including apple and bullace. The many ponds in the abbey grounds are home to a great deal of wildlife including fine-leaved water dropwort and great crested newt. The nearby Southrey Wood is rich in forest wildlife. Sheep have (and for thousands of years have had) a big influence on the vegetation at Tupholme, their dung promoting the growth of stinging nettles and thistles.

He was the third successor to Musa bin Nusair, the North African governor who had directed the conquest of Visigothic Hispania several years earlier in 711.Hitti (1956) p. 499 Al-Hurr was the first Muslim commander to cross the Pyrenees in 717, leading a small raiding party into Septimania. His incursions were largely unsuccessful, for which he was deposed in 718.Livermore (1947) p. 30  Background  In 711, an Umayyad army led by freedman Tariq bin Ziyad had been sent to the Iberian peninsula under the orders of North African governor Musa bin Nusair, resulting in its eventual conquest. Leaving his son 'Abd al-'Aziz in charge, Musa led a triumphant procession of over 400 well- dressed Visigothic princes, followed by slaves and prisoners of war, to the Caliph al-Walid I in Damascus. During that visit, Musa dramatically fell out of favor with al-Walid: Tariq informed the caliph that the treasure paraded, for which Musa had claimed credit, had actually been captured by himself instead. Musa was stripped of his status, and 'Abd al-'Aziz remained in charge of the newly conquered territories, which were now named \\"Al-Andalus.\\"Hitti (1956) pp. 496-499  Governorship  After the assassination of Abd al-Aziz in 716, and the six-month rule of his cousin Ayyub ibn Habib al-Lakhmi, al- Hurr ibn 'abd al-Rahman al-Thaqafi was assigned the post. Soon afterwards, he relocated the Andalusian administrative capital from Seville to C√≥rdoba.Meri (2006) p. 175 Al-Hurr was heavily involved in trying to suppress Christian Gothic resistance, and was largely successful in doing so. He's actually credited with the pacification of virtually all Visigothic Hispania, except for the mountain ranges of the Basque region, most of the Pyrenees and the still almost intact Duchy of Cantabria in the north of the Peninsula. After his rule in al-Andalus, the realm would become years later the leading realm in the Reconquista. Some historians date the small Battle of Covadonga at the end of his term in office, in 718. He laid the foundations of the future Umayyad administration by sending Umayyad officials to towns, setting up rules for the management of real estate and taxation imposed on it (the tributa or land based taxation), returning property to Christian owners where applicable and punishing Berbers for looting and concealment of undeclared acquisition of goods.Collins, R. (1989) pp. 45-47 This job of establishing a civil administration was continued by his successor Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani and completed by the wali Yahya ibn Salama al-Kalbi.Collins, R. (1989) p. 48 Al-Hurr also turned his attention to the Aquitanians (referred in most Arabic chronicles as \\"Franks\\") across the Pyrenees. Sources suggest he was enticed by the treasure hoarded in the convents and churches, or maybe chasing refugees, or taking advantage of the civil war going on between the chief officers of the Merovingian court with the involvement of Odo the Great, duke of Aquitaine. None of al-Hurr's predecessors had attempted to cross the Pyrenees, and in 717, he attempted to do just that. He led a small expedition across the range into still Gothic Septimania, the first of which was likely to just reconnoiter the region. Several attempted raids later, all of which proved unsuccessful, al-Hurr was deposed by the caliph, who appointed Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani in 718 as his replacement. Al-Samh continued expeditions into present-day France, reaching as far as the Rh√¥ne, but would be killed in the Battle of Toulouse in 721.

German- and English-language versions have also been released. Plot The film explores the obsession Adolf Hitler had with his own particular vision of what was and was not aesthetically acceptable and how he applied these notions while running the Third Reich. His obsession with art he considered pure, in opposition to the supposedly degenerate avant-garde works by Jewish and Soviet artists, reveals itself to be deeply connected to Hitler's equally subjective and strict ideal of physical beauty and health. A series of so-called degenerate art exhibitions were sponsored in order to depict modernist painting and sculpture as expressions of mental illness and general depravity. Classical art that reinforced Hitler's personal taste, from Roman statuary to Dutch oil paintings, was scavenged from across Nazi occupied Europe. Hitler is shown as an amateur architect, planning new building designs for the Third Reich that express his vision of a Nordic empire to rival those of classical antiquity. He is said to be intimately familiar with the grand opera houses of Europe. He visits Paris with a group of architects and artists who will be tasked with rebuilding Berlin to suit the Nazi aesthetic. Designs for new structures include depictions of the ruins they will make for distant generations. The film posits that Hitler's affinity for Greek and Roman antiquity is also expressed in his insistence of a totalizing strategy of war. In what Hitler imagined to be the style of Sparta and Rome, war was meant to annihilate the enemy, enslaving the population and erasing the history of the vanquished. Reception Although Caryn James found the period photos and film footage valuable, she thought that The Architecture of Doom was \\"simplistic\\" and \\"dangerously facile.\\" Washington Post reviewer Benjamin Forgey wrote that the film-maker \\"marshals his arguments and his evidence masterfully,\\" and in a separate review Desson Howe said that the film was a \\"dryly effective documentary.\\" Austin Chronicle reviewer Steve Davis declared that the \\"impeccably researched documentary The Architecture of Doom formulates a convincing thesis about Hitler and his legacy.\\" Ed Simmons wrote in Crisis magazine that Cohen had made a \\"remarkably insightful film which shows the F√ºhrer not as a psychotic, an anti-Christ, or even Aryan Angel.\\" In a 1999 Village Voice article, Michael Giacalone noted that \\"The Architecture Of Doom shows us that the control of ideals is at the very root of fascism's appeal.\\" And it was judged to be a \\"brilliantly written and visualized documentary\\" by Bright Lights Film Journal in 2001. A 2006 review by Emanuel Levy acknowledged that \\"Bruno Ganz‚Äôs poignant narration and Richard Wagner‚Äôs music\\" contributed to the coherence of the documentary.

Recognized for his versatile, abstract, and often experimental style, he is also known for his beat-making alias Dr. Who Dat? and his groups Willie Isz, JJ DOOM and Shape of Broad Minds, who've shared the stage with artists ranging from Jay-Z to Radiohead. He has collaborated with artists such as Damon Albarn, Count Bass D, Massive Attack, TV on the Radio and Kimbra among others. History Jarel was born in Brooklyn, and would spend the next several years of his life living in Maryland, Arizona, Atlanta and Houston, before eventually moving back to New York City. It was in New York that he started his own label, Orienj Recordings (now Label Who?), and released his first EP as a solo artist. In 2003 he signed to indie record label Kindred Spirits, and was the sole representative from New York to participate in and perform at Red Bull Music Academy in Cape Town, South Africa. In 2004 Jneiro moved to Philadelphia and, through his success in the indie music scene, was able to work with some of the city's most influential artists King Britt and Rich Medina. He signed a multi-album record deal with Lex Records in 2006. Career  2000-2005: Early Career Following the 2000 release of his Section A EP, Jneiro also released his first full-length album, Timeless Volume 1 in 2004, via Label Who? Over the next year he'd make a number of guest appearances and contributions on various projects, and release several promo singles and DJ mixes, before jointly releasing his Three Piece Puzzle LP on, both, Kindred Spirits and Ropeadope Records in 2005. The album was universally met with positive reception. 2006-2011: Lex Records and mainstream recognition 2006 marked the beginning of Jarel's relationship with Lex Records, and saw the release of his critically acclaimed instrumental project, Beat Journey, under his Dr. Who Dat? alias. The album cover art was designed by the UK based graphic artists collective, and frequent Lex Records collaborators, Ehquestionmark, best known for their previous work on The Mouse and the Mask and Ghetto Pop Life. The aesthetic approach featured in \\"Beat Journey's\\" art design would become a staple in Jneiro's future releases. He followed up Beat Journey with his 2007 Lex release, Craft of the Lost Art, under the group name Shape of Broad Minds. Like many of his previous works, \\"Craft...\\" saw Jarel incorporating several of his aliases on to the album, although this was the first time they would all converge in one place. In addition to fellow group member and emcee Jawwaad Taylor, the project also included a number of features from DOOM, Count Bass D, Stacy Epps and John Robinson. \\"Craft...\\" widely received positive reviews, and saw Jneiro teaming with Ehquestionmark once more, for an artwork design that included a limited edition, glow-in-the- dark LP, as well as an EP, single and mixtape download. In early 2009 he revisited his Dr. Who Dat? alter ego for the digital-only release of Beyond 2morrow. This instrumental EP would showcase the more experimental approach to production that was previously, but briefly, explored in some of Jneiro's earlier work. Having been fully realized and embraced on this project, it would also help in solidifying his place among a growing musical genre that would later become popular in the Low End Theory and L.A. beat scene. That same year Jneiro teamed with Goodie Mob's Khujo Goodie to form the group Willie Isz. They released their debut project Georgiavania on June 15, 2009, via Lex Records. The album features backing vocals from Tunde Adebimpe of TV on the Radio, and continued the string of positive reception Jarel's work had come to know. It would also set the stage for a number of collaborations between Jarel and TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek. 2010 brought about both new and old professional relationships. Jarel signed a digital distribution deal with Alpha Pup Records, which resulted in the release of his Android Love Mayhem- EP and the reissue of Beyond 2morrow, as Jneiro Jarel. Artwork for both EP's was handled by painter and muralist, and Three Piece Puzzle album cover designer, Joshua Mays. Jneiro also joined forces with Kindred Spirits again and released the Brazilian themed album Fauna. All three projects had heavy electronic overtones in their production, and continued to show Jarel's willingness to move away from more traditional sample based music, and explore beyond the rigid boundaries set in place by many musical genres. In 2011 Jneiro was handpicked by Damon Albarn to be a part of the, newly established, musical collective DRC Music (Democratic Republic of the Congo Music) group. Working in conjunction with Oxfam, the project's intention was to bring awareness to Oxfam's relief work in Congo, as well as give exposure to over fifty local Congolese musicians. Albarn assembled a team of ten producers, composed of Jarel, Dan the Automator, XL Recordings managers Richard Russell & Rodaidh McDonald, Kwes, Actress, Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs, Marc Antoine, Alwest, and Remi Kabaka Jr. to work alongside local musicians in Kinshasa. The result was Kinshasa One Two; an album recorded in five days, with all of its proceeds going towards Oxfam. It was released on Warp Records October 3, 2011. 2012-Present: JJ DOOM and Label Who On December 16, 2011, a Dave Sitek remix of a JJ DOOM track, titled \\"Rhymin' Slang\\", was posted on Pitchfork. JJ DOOM was revealed to be the pairing of Jneiro Jarel and Lex label mate DOOM, which drew speculation at the time that the two were working on an album together. This suspicion was confirmed when Pitchfork later ran an article on February 16, 2012, detailing the album's title, Key to the Kuffs, and leaked one of its tracks \\"Banished\\". A third track from the album, \\"Guv'nor\\", was posted on Pitchfork July 27, 2012. KTTK was released August 20, 2012 on Lex Records. Debuting at number 124 on the Billboard 200, \\"...Kuffs\\" received notable positive praise, eventually charting a total of six Billboard charts and landing on several \\"Best Albums of 2012\\" lists. It had a number of high-profile guest appearances, from previous Jneiro Jarel collaborators Damon Albarn and Khujo Goodie, to Beth Gibbons of Portishead. A video for the song \\"Guv'nor\\" premiered August 23, 2012. Directed by Ninian Doff and presented by RizLab, the video garnered attention for its use of an optical illusion/split-screen visual effect. Later a video for the \\"Rhymin' Slang (JJ Tron Remix)\\" would be released, as an extension of the JJ DOOM/RizLab project. The album artwork for Key to the Kuffs was designed by American artist/graff artist, Steve \\"ESPO\\" Powers. Powers would also later direct the music video for JJ DOOM's \\"Bookhead\\". The video premiered June 19, 2013 and the track was featured on the expanded, deluxe edition of KTTK, titled Key to the Kuffs (Butter Edition), released August 20, 2013. The \\"Butter Edition\\" also included the Dave Sitek \\"Rhymin' Slang\\" remix, as well as the previously released, alternative version of \\"Retarded Fren\\" by Radiohead's Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood. It also featured a number of guest contributions in the form of remixes, features and alternative versions from Beck, BADBADNOTGOOD, Del the Funky Homosapien and Clams Casino. In August 2013, Jneiro Jarel announced (via Okayplayer) the official launch of his own record label, Label Who, with Ropeadope Records serving as digital distributor.

It typically presents with painless vision loss affecting both eyes. Rarely, it may cause acute vision loss with severe pain due to perforation of the cornea. It is typically characterized by a clear, bilateral thinning (ectasia) in the inferior and peripheral region of the cornea, although some cases affect only one eye. The cause of the disease remains unclear. Pellucid marginal degeneration is diagnosed by corneal topography. Corneal pachymetry may be useful in confirming the diagnosis. Treatment usually consists of vision correction with eyeglasses or contact lenses. Intacs implants, corneal collagen cross-linking, and corneal transplant surgery are additional options. Surgery is reserved for individuals who do not tolerate contact lenses. The term \\"pellucid marginal degeneration\\" was first coined in 1957 by the ophthalmologist Schalaeppi. The word \\"pellucid\\" means clear, indicating that the corneas retain clarity in pellucid marginal degeneration. The condition is rare, though the exact prevalence and incidence are unknown. Signs and Symptoms Pain is not typically present in pellucid marginal degeneration, and aside from vision loss, no symptoms accompany the condition. However, in rare cases, PMD may present with sudden onset vision loss and excruciating eye pain, which occurs if the thinning of the cornea leads to perforation. While PMD usually affects both eyes, some unilateral cases have been reported. PMD is characterized by bilateral thinning (ectasia) in the inferior and peripheral region of the cornea. The distribution of the degeneration is crescent or arcuate shaped. The cornea just above the region of thinning is of normal thickness, and may protrude anteriorly, which creates an irregular astigmatism. This is described as a \\"beer belly\\" appearance since the greatest protrusion occurs below the horizontal midline (unlike keratoconus). Normally, PMD does not present with vascularization of the cornea, scarring, or any deposits of lipid. Pathophysiology PMD is an idiopathic, non-inflammatory condition. The thinning of the corneas may approach 20% of normal thickness. There may be an increase in the number of mucopolysaccharides in the corneal stroma. The Bowman's layer of the cornea may be absent, irregular, or have ruptured areas. Diagnosis The center of the cornea shows normal thickness, with an intact central epithelium, but the inferior cornea exhibits a peripheral band of thinning, to about 1‚Äì2 mm. The portion of the cornea that is immediately adjacent to the limbus is spared, usually a strip of about 1‚Äì2 mm. In PMD we can see high against the rule astigmatism along with horizontal bow ties. The inferior peripheral thinning is seen between the 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock positions. PMD lacks apical corneal scarring, Rizutti's phenomenon, Munson's sign, and the central corneal thickness is usually normal. The gold standard diagnostic test for PMD is corneal topography. However, it may not be as specific as corneal pachymetry, because corneal topography only evaluates the degree and distribution of surface irregularities on the cornea, not the thickness of the cornea. Corneal topography may show a \\"crab claw-like\\" appearance, a finding that is seen in both keratoconus and in pellucid marginal degeneration. Thus, if corneal topography is used for diagnosis, it should be in conjunction with clinical findings of peripheral, inferior corneal thinning. Treatment Eye glasses Most people can be treated non-surgically with eyeglasses, or contact lenses. Contact lenses The early stages of pellucid marginal degeneration may also be managed with soft contact lenses. Success has been shown with the use of rigid gas permeable contact lenses combined with over-refraction. People wearing contacts don't report increased problems with glare and contrast sensitivity, but it is not clear if this is due to the corneal disease, or the contact lenses themselves. New studies found that the use of Scleral contact lens, a type of rigid gas permeable (RGP) lens, may be a good option for most people with PMD. Most of these lenses are in the range of 15.5mm to 18.0mm in diameter. Regardless of the lens size, it is thought that the larger the RGP lens will in most cases be more comfortable then standard rigid corneal lenses, and at times more comfortable than soft lenses, regardless of the fact that it is a rigid lens. The highlight to the scleral design and the correction of eye disorders such as pellucid marginal degeneration is that vision with these types of lenses is exceptional when fit correctly. Intacs The use of intacs implants has been tested as a treatment for PMD, with slight improvement in visual acuity noted after eleven months, and intacs have been used with keratoconus with success. Corneal collagen cross-linking There is evidence suggesting corneal collagen cross-linking may be beneficial for patients with pellucid marginal degeneration. Research shows some promising results by combining collagen cross linking with photorefractive keratectomy, or with topography- guided transepithelial surface ablation. Surgery Corneal transplant surgery may be difficult due to the peripheral thinning of the cornea, even with large and off-center grafts. Therefore, surgery is usually reserved for people that do not tolerate contact lenses. Several different surgical approaches may be taken, and no one approach is currently established as the standard. Examples of surgical procedures used for PMD include: wedge resection, lamellar crescentic resection, penetrating keratoplasty, lamellar keratoplasty, epikeratoplasty and intracorneal segments. Transplantation of the entire thickness of the cornea (penetrating keratoplasty) may be performed if there is enough normal tissue present. However, if there is not enough normal tissue present, then attaching the graft is difficult. New surgical techniques are in evaluation such as Intrastromal lamellar Keratoplasties and Sclerocorneal Intrastromal Lamellar Keratoplasty (SILK), these techniques allow thickening of the inferior peripheral cornea and steepening of the vertical meridien. Due to the thinning of the cornea, people with PMD are poor candidates for procedures such as LASIK and photorefractive keratectomy. Prognosis Visual function declines as a result of the irregular corneal shape, resulting in astigmatism, and causing a distortion in vision. Deterioration can become severe over time. Epidemiology The incidence and prevalence of PMD are unknown, and no studies have yet investigated its prevalence or incidence. However, it is generally agreed that PMD is a very rare condition. Some uncertainty regarding the incidence of PMD may be attributed to its confusion with keratoconus. PMD is not linked to race or age, although most cases present early in life, between 20 and 40 years of age. While PMD is usually considered to affect men and women equally, some studies suggest that it may affect men more frequently. Several diseases have been observed in people with PMD. However, no causal relationships have been established between any of the associated diseases and the pathogenesis of PMD. Such diseases include: chronic open-angle glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa, retinal lattice degeneration, scleroderma, kerato-conjunctivitis, eczema, and hyperthyroidism.

It was first isolated from the spinal cord in 1985, and named after its ability to cause smooth muscle contraction in the uterus. Structure Neuromedin U is a highly conserved neuropeptide present in many species, existing as multiple isoforms. For example, in humans it is a 25 amino acid peptide (U-25) in rats it is 23-aas long (U-23) and it has been found to be as low as 8-aas long in some mammals. NMU-8 is identical to the C terminus of NMU-25, thus is the most highly conserved region of the entire peptide. The relative contribution of the different isoforms to the biological function of neuromedin U is generally not well understood. Neuromedin U, like many neuroactive peptides, is amidated at the C-terminus, and all isoforms have identical C-terminal heptapeptides. The sequence of neuromedin U-23 in rats is: YKVNEYQGPVAPSGGFFLFRPRN-(NH2). Function The activation of NmU receptors leads to intracellular signal transduction via calcium mobilization, phosphoinositide (or PI) signaling, and the inhibition of cAMP production NmU will contract smooth muscle only in a tissue- and species-specific manner. Intracerebroventricular (or i.c.v) administration of the neuropeptide mediates stress response and increases both the arterial pressure and heart rate. i.c.v administration of NmU elevates the plasma adrenaline levels, though has no effect on the amount of plasma noradrenaline. It has been suggested that large doses () of NmU inhibits the activity of the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus and/or the sympathetic preganglionic neurons, thus controlling the activity. Regulation Neuromedin U is mediated by two receptors, peripheral NmUR1 and central nervous system NmUR2. Both receptors are examples of Class A G-protein coupled receptors (or GPCRs) with a distinct distributional pattern. NmUR1 is expressed predominantly in the peripheral nervous system, with highest levels in the gastrointestinal tract, whereas NmUR2 is mostly found in the central nervous system, with greatest expression in the hypothalamus, medulla, and spinal cord. The discovery of set distribution patterns has begun to allow assignation of specific roles of the two receptor subtypes within the body. What is known for certain is that recombinant NmU receptors will increase the internal calcium concentration, signaling via the MAPK/ERK pathway  Role in disease   Cancer Its role in cancer is not yet fully understood, though NmU and its receptor NMUR2 have been shown to be over-expressed in human pancreatic cancers compared to normal cells. Studies also showed NmU serum levels decreased after the tumors were removed, as NmU and its receptor are localized predominantly in cancer cells. Although NmU exerts no effect on cancer cell proliferation, it induces c-Met, a proto-oncogene that encodes the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) protein. Increased invasiveness as well as an increased hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-mediated scattering suggest NmU is also involved in the HGF-c-Met paracrine loop regulating cell migration.  Pain perception and stress response  The effect of NmU on stress and pain perception pathways has been demonstrated using mice. In contrast to NmU peptide-deficient mice, NmUR2 knockout (KO) mice appeared normal with regard to stress, anxiety, body weight regulation, and food consumption. However, the NmUR2 KO mice exhibit reduced pain sensitivity in both hot plate test and the chronic phase of the formalin test. Furthermore, facilitated excitatory synaptic transmission in spinal dorsal horn neurons, a mechanism by which NmU stimulates pain, did not occur in NmUR2 KO mice. Both NmUR2 expression and NmU-23 binding sites are highly localized to the outer layers of the spinal dorsal horn, and administration of NmU via intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections usually increases pain sensitivity in rats and mice. The expression of NmUR2 in the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN), a major site for the release of Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), suggests an alternative role in mediating stress response. NmU and its receptors are also abundantly expressed in nociceptive sensory pathways, including the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), spinal cord, and brainstem. In particular, NmU induces hyperalgesia, allodynia, and increased persistent pain after formalin injection. ICV injections of NmU in rats and mice induce behavior responses associated with activation of the nociceptive pathways, for example it will increase plasma levels of corticosterone, and stimulates the release of CRH from hypothalamic explants in vitro. Central administration of NmU also induces expression of key genes in hypothalamic areas associated with stress, as well as stress-related behaviours that can be blocked by CRH antagonist (this is absent from CRH knockout mice). Certain stress responses are abolished in NmU knockout mice. These results suggest that NmU significantly modulates nociceptive sensory transmission.

London: Guildhall Library Publishing, 1996 by 1456 it had fallen into disrepair, and had to be taken down and rebuilt. Rebuilding after the Great Fire The medieval building was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. A new church was completed in 1676 to the designs of Sir Christopher Wren, after which the parish was united with that of St Mary Colechurch, which was not rebuilt. George Godwin described the interior of the new church as \\"a simple room with a flat ceiling coved at the sides ‚Ä¶ remarkable for nothing but a strange want of symmetry apparent at the west end\\". It was 56 feet long, 42 feet wide and 36 feet high. The most ornamented part of the exterior was the south side, towards Poultry, with a central pediment and Ionic pilasters. There was a 75-foot-high tower, topped by a copper weather vane in the form of a ship. An organ was provided in the mid-eighteenth century by George England.

This church is rooted in the Congregational denomination, does not require uniformity of belief, and welcomes all visitors. Its present church building, a Gothic Victorian structure designed by architects Allen & Collens and completed in 1916, was listed in the National Register of Historic Places (as \\"Second Church of Newton\\") in 1990. Description and history The West Parish of Newton was organized in 1764 and formally recognized in 1778. At that time it was Newton's second parish. As the congregation grew, a meeting house was built on Washington Street in 1848, when the first structure was adapted for use as town hall as part of the town government's move to West Newton. The current structure is the third home of this congregation. Discussion to build a new structure began in 1908, with the land purchased in 1913 and the cornerstone laid in 1914, the 150th anniversary of the congregation. The building was designed by the noted ecclesiastical architects Allen & Collens, a leading firm with offices in Boston and New York, with Charles Collens having the principal role for the design. The firm was noted for its Gothic Revival design work including the Cloisters Museum in New York. The location of the Second Church in Newton is on the east side of Highland Street, just south of the Massachusetts Turnpike and the West Newton Village Center Historic District. The parcel it occupies is bounded on the north by the highway and on the east by Chestnut Street; both Chestnut and Highland are collector roads leading through the residential area of West Newton Hill. The church building is an elaborate example of Gothic Revival architecture executed in stone. The main facade, facing west toward Highland Street, is narrow, with a buttressed projecting section housing the main entrance in a recessed arch, with a large stained-glass window above. The side walls are also buttressed, with pointed-arch windows in each of four bays. The prominent spire which reaches to 196 feet is topped by two figures, a young man facing east and an old man facing west, towards the sunset. The bell in the tower, which dates from 1828, was brought from the previous building. There are gargoyles on either side of the front entrance. A square tower rises at the eastern end of the north elevation. To the north of the main building an education wing with Tudor styling was added in 1938. West elevation. Photo by John Borchard The interior of the sanctuary was inspired by European Gothic elements from the 12th to 16th centuries. The ceiling, which is supported by stone pillars recalling the trunks of trees, is the shape of an inverted boat, referencing Noah's ark and the sanctuary it provided. The stained glass windows contain glass imported from Europe and were designed by Henry Wynd Young and Charles Connick. The windows at the rear of the nave, designed by Connick, are original to the building and have distinctive crosses at the top of each panel. In the Fuller Chapel are found two windows designed by Henry Wynd Young, considered to be an unusually gifted artisan at the time. The distinctive and elaborate wood carvings crafted in red oak at the altar, choir stalls, pulpit and lectern were created by Johannes Kirchmayer. The elements included such as branches, birds and small animals, are reflective of the Arts and Crafts design style. South elevation. Photo by John Borchard North side. View of Parish House.

Clarke (born Washington DC, May 16, 1947) is a lesbian poet, essayist, educator and a Black feminist community activist: she lives in Jersey City, New Jersey, and Hobart, New York. With her life partner, Barbara Balliet, she is co-owner of Bleinheim Hill Books, a used and rare bookstore in Hobart. Her younger sister is novelist Breena Clarke, with whom Clarke and Balliet organize the Hobart Festival of Women writers each summer. Her scholarship focuses on African-American women's literature, black lesbian feminism, and the Black Arts Movement in the United States. Retired from her work in higher education, she maintains a teaching affiliation with the Graduate Faculty of the Department of Women and Gender Studies, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, and serves on the board of the Newark Pride Alliance. Early life and education The daughter of James Sheridan Clarke (September 18, 1912 ‚Äì January 18, 2009), a veteran of World War II, and Edna Clarke, Cheryl was born and raised in Washington, D.C. at the height of the American civil rights movement, one of four sisters and a brother. The family was Catholic, descended from freed slaves who had emigrated to the nation's capitol after the Civil War. Both parents were civil servants and registered Democrats: James Clarke worked for the National Bureau of Standards for 33 years, and was considered to be the \\"mayor\\" of their neighborhood in the NW section of Washington. Experiencing Jim Crow segregation first hand in Washington for much of their lives, James and Edna raised their children with a strong sense of social justice and a belief in the importance of political activism. When she was 13, Clarke crossed a picket line of African-American activists protesting segregation at Woolworth's on 14th Street, believing that this was a rebellious act. However, when she came home her mother, a staunch union member, told her never to cross a picket line again, educating her about the role of direct action politics in the civil rights movement. At 16, Clarke was allowed by her parents to attend the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom with them, despite their concerns that there might be violence. The day before the march, on the way downtown to acquire information about the route, she ran into Martin Luther King, Jr. Clarke attended parochial schools in the District of Columbia, and matriculated at Howard University in 1965. She received a B.A. in English literature in 1969. Subsequently, she enrolled at Rutgers University, completing a master's degree in 1974, an MSW in 1980, and a Ph.D in 2000. For much of this time, she also worked for Rutgers, beginning her employment there in 1970 as an administrator in student services. At Rutgers, Clarke was a pioneer in co-curricular programming that made the university more accessible to students of color and LGBT students. In 1992, she was the founding Director of Diverse Community Affairs and Lesbian/Gay Concerns, which became the Office for Social Justice Education and LGBT Communities in 2004. She served as the Dean of Students of the Livingston Campus at Rutgers University from 2009 to 2013. After 41 years in higher education, Clarke retired from Rutgers in 2013. Writing Clarke is the author of four collections of poetry: Narratives: Poems in the Tradition of Black Women (originally self-published in 1981 and distributed by Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press in 1982); and for Firebrand Books Living as a Lesbian (1986), Humid Pitch (1989) and Experimental Love (1993). She also published After Mecca ‚Äî Women Poets and the Black Arts Movement (Rutgers University Press, 2005), the first study of its kind that made more visible the contributions of black women to a field that traditionally recognized black men, and Days of Good Looks: Prose and Poetry, 1980‚Äì2005 (Carroll & Graf Publishing, 2006), a collection that represented 25 years of published writing. Clarke has served on the editorial collective of Conditions, an early lesbian publication, and has been published in numerous anthologies, journals, magazines, and newspapers, including Conditions 5, The Black Women's Issue (1979), This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color (1982), Home Girls: A Black Feminist Anthology (1984), The Black Scholar, The Kenyon Review, Feminist Review of Books, Belles Lettres, The Gay Community News. Clarke's iconic articles, \\"Lesbianism: an act of resistance\\" and \\"The Failure to Transform: Homophobia in the Black Community\\", published in This Bridge and Home Girls, respectively, are often included in women studies, black studies, and English studies curricula. Clarke's fifth book of poetry, By My Precise Haircut (2016), is published by The Word Works Books of Washington, D.C., a press committed to the publication of contemporary poetry.  ‚ÄúLesbianism: an Act of Resistance‚Äù (1981)  Cheryl Clarke is the author of \\"Lesbianism: an Act of Resistance,\\" originally published in 1981 in the feminist anthology This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color. The essay's main intervention is to expand the categories of who counts as a lesbian and what lesbianism is. Rather than defining a lesbian only as a woman who has sex with other women, Clarke insists that \\"there is no one kind of lesbian, no one kind of lesbian behavior, and no one kind of lesbian relationship.\\" Thinking of \\"lesbian\\" as a continuum, she makes space for women who may have sexual and emotional relationships with women but identify with other labels (bisexual, for instance). In the same way, she redefines lesbianism \\"as an ideological, political, and philosophical means of liberation of all women from heterosexual tyranny.\\" Because she imagines lesbianism to be in opposition to male tyranny and coerced heterosexuality, she defines it as resistance, no matter how a woman is actually practicing it in her personal life.  ‚ÄúThe Failure to Transform: Homophobia in the Black Community‚Äù (1983)  The book Home Girls: A Black Feminist Anthology also includes one of Clarke‚Äôs essays, titled ‚ÄúThe Failure to Transform: Homophobia in the Black Community‚Äù (1983). This essay is a literary critique, including critiques of LeRoi Jones‚Äô Preface to a Twenty Volume Suicide Note (1961), Michele Wallace‚Äôs Black Macho and the Myth of the Superwoman (1979), and bell hooks‚Äô Ain‚Äôt I a Woman (1981). Clarke argues that homophobia is not unique to the Black community, but is indicative of a larger homophobic culture. This piece is directed at Black men, who Clarke says perpetuate homophobia and the white supremacist, anti-Black concepts of gender and sexuality as a means of becoming more palatable to white America. She specifically critiques the ‚Äúintellectual Black man‚Äù for acting as the savior that will bring liberation to the Black community by way of perpetuating homophobia to condemn Black lesbians as detrimental to the Black Family and Black nationhood (201). Additionally, Clarke asserts that intellectual Black women have excluded Black lesbians from their scholarship and subtly deny the womanhood of Black lesbians‚Äî‚Äúhomophobia by omission‚Äù. The oppression and exclusion of Black lesbian women from the Black liberation movement, according to Clarke, is counter-revolutionary and only by addressing and eliminating homophobia can the Black community find liberation. Clarke concludes that Black people must be committed to eliminating homophobia in the community by engaging in discussion with advocates for gay and lesbian liberation, educating ourselves about gay and lesbian politics, confronting homophobic attitudes within ourself and others, and understanding how these attitudes prevent us from being totally liberated. Community Clarke has served on a number of boards and community organizations, including New York Women Against Rape (1985), New Jersey Women and AIDS Network, Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies at the CUNY Graduate Center, and the Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice. Currently, she is a member of the Board of Directors of the Newark Pride Alliance, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to LGBTQ advocacy and programming in the city of Newark, New Jersey. She lives and writes in Jersey City, New Jersey.

The combination of the Bosch spark plug and the high voltage magneto, a process patented on 7 January 1902, made it possible for the gasoline-powered engine to become the standard for motor vehicles. Honold was born on 26 August 1876 in Langenau, in Germany, about 10 miles northeast of Ulm. Honold's father was a friend of the father of Robert Bosch, and in 1891, Honold first worked in Bosch's Stuttgart workshop at the age of 14. Following graduation from the Ulm gymnasium, Honold studied engineering at the Stuttgart technical university. In 1901, Honold accepted an offer to become the technical manager of Bosch's company, and worked on the task of developing an improved ignition system for combustion engines. The Daimler company ordered the Bosch engine and was soon breaking automotive speed records. Honold continued work on faster and more powerful engines. In 1913, Honold helped develop the automotive headlights that are used today. Although lights had been used to some extent for night driving, the early lanterns did little more than to draw attention to a vehicle, and were of little use for illumination. It was Honold who conceived the idea of placing curved mirrors behind the lamp to increase the amount of light without taxing the automotive electrical system. Honold also helped develop the Bosch car horn. Honold died in Stuttgart on 17 March 1923.

In variants of the interference microscope where object and reference beam pass through the same objective, two images are produced of every object (one being the \\"ghost image\\"). The two images are separated either laterally within the visual field or at different focal planes, as determined by the optical principles employed. These two images can be a nuisance when they overlap, since they can severely affect the accuracy of mass thickness measurements. Rotation of the preparation may thus be necessary, as in the case of DIC. One of the first usable interference microscopes was designed by Dyson and manufactured by Cooke, Troughton & Simms (later Vickers Instruments), York England. This ingenious optical system achieved interference imaging without requiring polarizing elements in the beam path. A later popular design involving polarizing elements was designed by Smith and marketed first by C. Baker, London, and subsequently by the American Optical Company in the US. The double-image problem commonly encountered with all the above-mentioned designs was completely avoided in the Mach‚ÄìZehnder interferometer design implemented by Horn, a most expensive instrument, not employing polarized light, but requiring precisely-matched duplicated objectives and condensers. With this design (marketed by E. Leitz) 60 mm beam separation was achieved in microscopy but here the new difficulty has arisen of balancing optical thicknesses of two separate microscope slide preparations (sample and dummy) and maintaining this critical balance during longer observations (e.g. time-lapse studies of living cells maintained at 37 ¬∞C), otherwise a gradual change in background interference colour occurs over time. The main advantage offered by interference microscopy measurements is the possibility of measuring the projected dry mass of living cells, which was first effectively exploited by Andrew Huxley in studies of striated muscle cell structure and function, leading to the sliding filament model of muscle contraction. Interference microscopy became relatively popular in the 1940‚Äì1970 decades but fell into disuse because of the complexity of the instrument and difficulties in both its use and in the interpretation of image data. In recent years, however, the classical interference microscope (in particular the Mach‚ÄìZehnder instrument) has been \\"rediscovered\\" by biologists because its main original disadvantage (difficult interpretation of translated interference bands or complex coloured images) can now be easily surmounted by means of digital camera image recording, followed by the application of computer algorithms which rapidly deliver the processed data as false-colour images of projected dry mass. Examples of computer-assisted developments of the technique are found in the application of \\"DRIMAPS\\" from the laboratory of Graham Dunn and other recent developments of the methodology are described by Mahlmann et al. Interference microscopy for industrial inspection, semiconductor inspection and surface structure analysis is highly developed and in widespread use.

Later Melodyland would have a drug rehabilitation program, a High School and a School of Divinity called Melodyland School of Theology. Years later, a preschool and daycare center were added as well. According to the Yesterland website: In 1976, two years after Motown formed a country subsidiary with artists such as Pat Boone, T. G. Sheppard and Jud Strunk using the Melodyland name, the Center sued, forcing the label's name to change to Hitsville. Hitsville folded in 1977. Charismatic Clinics In the 1970s, during the summer months, the church would host what were called \\"Charismatic Clinics.\\" These week-long events featured noted speakers from the Charismatic and Pentecostal movement, and drew people from all over the world. Melodyland High School Melodyland High School started in 1976 and used existing church grounds for the school campus. The school's unofficial nickname was Melo (pronounced \\"mellow,\\" rhyming with yellow). The team name for the school and its sports teams was \\"The Flames\\" as in the Flame of the Holy Spirit. 1976-1984 Started in the Fall of 1976, the class of 1977 was the first graduating class. The last class to graduate from the Melodyland Church Campus was the class of 1984. 1984-1985 In the fall of 1984, Melodyland High School left the church to a campus on Ball Road and became a separate entity. The class of 1985 was the last class to graduate with the name of Melodyland High School. Southern California Christian High School 1986-2000 The school then became Southern California Christian High School or SCCHS for short. In 1987 SCCHS moved to a campus in Orange, California.The last graduating class for SCCHS was the class of 2000. Eastside Christian High School 2000‚ÄìPresent The student body and school records were absorbed by Eastside Christian Schools in Fullerton, California in 2000.The school year of 2000/2001 was the first graduating class at Eastside Christian High School. School of Theology Melodyland School of Theology (MST) was a theological seminary college level school and had on its staff Walter Martin, who was also known as the Bible Answer Man and head of CRI (the Christian Research Institute), John Warwick Montgomery noted Christian apologist and lawyer, Dr. John Rea (noted Old Testament scholar and an editor of the New International Version of the Bible). The first president of the school was Dr. J. Rodman Williams (Presbyterian Theologian, author of a Systematic Theology). He was succeeded by Dr. John Hurston in 1981. There was also a branch of the school dedicated to Social Work. The school granted MDiv. and MSW degrees. Although the school struggled to acquire accreditation through major regional accrediting associations, they were never quite able to reach this goal however MST reached candidate status with the WASC which accredits all major western universities and colleges. However, as the forerunner of Renewal Theology scholarship, the school influenced other institutions, especially Regent University in Virginia Beach. At its height, MST drew more than 700 students from all over the globe. Many leading seminaries honor MST course work for credit towards graduate degrees. Graduates have transcripts of their course of study with many completing Ph.D. studies at leading colleges and universities. MST was renamed American Christian Theological Seminary (A.C.T.S.) June 1, 1982. MST closed in the mid-80's, but still has an active alumni base. Anaheim Christian College Alongside the School Of Theology, there was a two-year, upper-division college called Anaheim Christian College, requiring an associate degree or 60 credit hours of general college coursework for entry. This school was dedicated to training Christian ministers and workers and awarded bachelor's degrees in Bible, Theology, Ministry, Apologetics, Christian Education, & Church Music. The two-year college was successful at getting accreditation, but dwindling enrollment caused it to merge with other schools in the mid to late 1980s. Church outgrowth Several churches grew out of Melodyland Christian Center and went on to continue as organizations in the area. The church building was sold to developers in 1998 just as Pastor Ralph Wilkerson was deciding to retire. He invited Neville and Wendy McDonald to join the leadership team and in the year following they were voted to become the Senior Pastors. The church moved to nearby Tustin and changed its name to Healing Word Church. The building was demolished in 2003.MelodyLand Theatre Under Construction, Anaheim.

On November 3, 1973, at about 4:40 p.m., while the aircraft was cruising at 65 miles southwest of Albuquerque, the No. 3 (starboard) engine fan assembly disintegrated in an uncontained failure. Its fragments penetrated the fuselage, the Nos. 1 and 2 engine nacelles, and the right wing area. The resultant damage caused decompression of the aircraft cabin and the loss of certain electrical and hydraulic systems. One passenger was partially sucked into the opening made by a failed cabin window, after it too was struck by engine fragments. He was temporarily retained in that position by his seatbelt. \\"Efforts to pull the passenger back into the airplane by another passenger were unsuccessful, and the occupant of seat 17H was sucked entirely through the cabin window.\\" The flight crew initiated an emergency descent, and the aircraft was landed safely at Albuquerque International Sunport 19 minutes after the engine failed. 115 passengers and 12 crew members exited the aircraft by using the evacuation slides. Of those, 24 people were treated for smoke inhalation, ear problems, and minor abrasions. The plane was repaired and was later flown by Pan Am (as Clipper Meteor). The New Mexico State Police and local organizations searched extensively for the missing passenger who was sucked out of the window. A computer analysis was made of the possible falling trajectories, which narrowed the search pattern. However, the search effort was unsuccessful, and the body of the passenger was not recovered until two years later, when a construction crew working on the tracks for the Very Large Array radio telescope came upon his skeletal remains, which took another year for the medical investigator in Albuquerque to identify. Investigation The National Transportation Safety Board determined the probable cause of this accident was the disintegration of the No. 3 engine fan assembly as a result of an interaction between the fan blade tips and the fan case. According to the NTSB, \\"the precise reason or reasons for the acceleration and the onset of the destructive vibration could not be determined conclusively,\\" but enough was learned to prevent the occurrence of similar events. The speed of the engine at the time of the accident caused a resonance wave to occur in the fan assembly when the tips of the fan blades began to make contact with the surrounding shroud. The engine was designed to have a rearward blade retaining force of 18,000 pounds to prevent the blades from moving forward in their mountings slots and subsequently departing from the fan disk. The rearward force was not enough. As a result of this accident, GE re-designed the engine so that the blade retaining capability was increased to 60,000 pounds, and that change was incorporated into all engines already in service. In addition to this, it was found that between the 8th of August and the 12th of September 1973, there had been 15 problems reported about the third engine. The engine had been taken off the aircraft for repairs, and between the time it was replaced and the accident, a further 26 faults had been reported by the pilots. It was found that the bolts that had held the front covering in place, which had failed in the accident, were outside the tolerances laid down. An engineering dispatch was sent out to inspect these engines, and six more discrepancies were found in National Airlines fleet alone. Therefore, this dispatch was made compulsory for all early DC-10s in order to prevent the issue occurring again. The NTSB expressed concern about the cockpit crew conducting an unauthorized experiment on the auto-throttle system. They had been wondering where the system took its engine power readings from and to see if it was the N1 tachometer readout \\"the flight engineer pulled the three N1 tachometer [circuit breakers]\\" and then adjusted the autothrottle setting. The cockpit voice recorder proved that the engines altered their power setting when requested, proving to the crew that the system was powered from another source. The crew then manually reset the throttles to the normal cruising power before the flight engineer had closed the tachometer circuit breakers. It was considered whether the crew had accidentally over-speeded the engine when setting power without the tachometers, but there was insufficient evidence to deliver a certain verdict. Nonetheless; \\"regardless of the cause of the high fan speed at the time of the fan failure, the Safety Board is concerned that the flightcrew was, in effect, performing an untested failure analysis on this system. This type of experimentation, without the benefit of training or specific guidelines, should never be performed during passenger flight operations.\\" See also * United Airlines Flight 232, a 1989 accident involving a DC-10 which suffered an uncontained engine failure, resulting in 111 fatalities. * Aloha Airlines Flight 243, a 1988 incident that involved an explosive decompression of the fuselage with one fatality. * British Airways Flight 5390, a 1990 incident where a crew member was partially ejected from a window in flight. * Southwest Airlines Flight 3472 and 1380, two incidents in 2016 and 2018, respectively, on two similar Boeing 737-700, both with the same engine model, where the number one engine (left side) exploded in an uncontained engine failure (the latter resulting in one fatality). * Delta Air Lines Flight 1288, another uncontained engine failure where the engine exploded during take off that killed two. * Air France Flight 66, a 2017 incident where an engine exploded during cruise with no injuries. * Qantas Flight 32, a 2010 incident where the #2 engine suffered an uncontained failure with no injuries.

Post-war activities, 1945‚Äì1946 On 14 September she steamed into Tokyo Bay, from the Ry≈´ky≈´s, with Fifth Air Force units en route to occupation duty on Honsh≈´. She completed another Okinawa/Japan run for the Air Force, then steamed to Leyte, whence she carried IX Corps units to Aomori, Japan. Army cargo shuttles in Japanese waters were followed in December by orders to Saipan. From there, on the 27th, she headed back to the United States. LST‚Äì1071 arrived at San Diego on 5 February 1946. On the 10th she moved north to San Francisco, and on the 25th to Portland, Oregon for inactivation. There the LST decommissioned on 10 June 1946 and joined the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Atlantic Fleet, 1951‚Äì1955 LST‚Äì1071 recommissioned on 3 January 1951. Following shakedown and cargo runs along the California coast, she sailed for the East Coast, arriving at Norfolk, Virginia on 15 June. The LST then commenced operations out of Little Creek, Virginia as a unit of LST Flotilla 2, Atlantic Fleet. For the next four years, she conducted amphibious exercises along the mid-Atlantic coast and at Puerto Rico, and carried Army personnel and supplies to Labrador and Newfoundland. Named USS Ouachita County (LST-1071) on 1 July 1955, she returned from her last voyage in Canadian waters in September and, in November, steamed to Brooklyn for inactivation overhaul. Damage Sustained In early August 1952, LST-1071 sustained ice- related damage while navigating waters off the Northern coast of Labrador. The Officer of the Deck, who was disdained by the crew, did not correct his \\"wrong\\" order to turn to Port, rather than Starboard. As a result, the ship went directly into the iceberg. Two other LSTs on the mission pulled the 1071 off the ice. This account was made by a crew member (Richard G. Niehoff) who was on the Counting Tower at the time this event. The ship sailed to the Boston Navy Yard where she was placed in drydock for repairs. The ship was successfully repaired and on 22 September, she resumed her training and supply route that continued to take her around the North American continent. Decommissioning With the new year, 1956, she steamed south to Green Cove Springs, Florida, arriving on 31 January and decommissioning on 15 February. She remained there, berthed as a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet until struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 November 1959. Her final fate is unknown. One observer believes he went aboard her while she was tied up at Tacoma, Washington, (late fall, 1961) where within the following several years she was either scrapped or converted into a barge by Foss Tug & Barge.

The club most recently achieved prominence in the all-Fort William Camanachd Cup Final in 2005.  History  The club was founded in 1929 and is named after the parish of Kilmallie, within which the team plays. They were given a pitch at Corpach by James Weir of Annat Farm, where games took place until the pulp mill opened and they relocated to Canal Parks in Caol. The club has never folded or amalgamated with another club. Having won the MacGillvary Senior League in 1959 and 1960, the club won the Camanachd Cup in 1964 against Inveraray in Fort William but then fell on hard times, falling as low as North Division Four. The Kilmallie team which won the Camanachd Cup in 1964 shown with the cup and other trophies won that season.

Front from Left. Iain MacIntosh, James Burnett, Johnny MacMaster,Derek Fraser, Ronald Ferguson, Jimmy Bruce, Donald MacIntyre The club slowly made progress from this low ebb by a concentration on youth policy and they climbed the leagues and are now a fixture in the Premier Division. The club then reached the Camanachd Cup Final in 2005 where they were defeated 3‚Äì2 by Fort William Shinty Club at An Aird, Fort William, in one of the closest and exciting finals for many years. Whilst 2007 saw the first team's top-flight status come to an end despite a late season rally, the second team gained a revenge of sorts for the Camanachd Cup in 2005 by defeating Fort William Reserves in the Sutherland Cup Final on 17 August 2007 in Oban and also won the Strathdearn Cup the same year. The club finished second in North Division One in 2008 and 2009. The club won North Division One in 2010 and 2013. New league structuring by the Camanachd Association prevented Kilmallie being promoted in 2013 and the club being condemned to the National Division looking for promotion to the Premier League yet again. They were denied promotion again, but this time on the park, in 2015, when after a ten-week lay-off they faced Kingussie in a promotion-relegation play-off. They were defeated 2‚Äì0. The club went on to win National Division One in strong style in 2016. The club also won the National Division in 2018 and again gained promotion to The Premier League for season 2019. There's high hopes for the current Kilmallie squad and newly appointed manager John Stewart, to compete at the highest level in shinty once again. Kilmallie has had a number of successes over the years including the Camanachd Cup in 1964, the MacTavish Cup in 1959,1961,1967 and 1969, and the Balliemore Cup in 1992, 1993, 2016 and 2018  Location  Canal Park The pitch is on the north west side of Caol.

Beinn Challuim () is a Scottish mountain in the very northern part of the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park six kilometres east northeast of the village of Tyndrum in the Stirling Council area. The mountain stands in the Forest of Mamlorn, an ancient deer forest in Breadalbane.  Overview  With a height of 1025 metres (3363 feet) and a prominence of 450 metres (1480 feet) Ben Challuim qualifies as a Munro and a Marilyn. It stands at the head of Glen Lochay and is a prominent peak when seen from the head of that glen, its western slopes dominate the north eastern side of Strath Fillan. When seen from the south the summit of the mountain cannot be seen, being hidden behind the south top. The mountain name was originally written as Beinn Challuim before Ben Challum became the norm. However in recent years the Ordnance Survey have reverted to using the original name on their maps. The name translates as ‚ÄúMalcolm‚Äôs mountain‚Äù but it is believed that the older spelling could possibly refer to Saint Columba who is known in Scottish Gaelic as \\"Calum Cille\\". With St. Fillan's priory lying on the south west foothills of the mountain (St Fillan brought Christianity from the monastery of St Columba on Iona into Breadalbane),A Short History of Breadalbane. \\"St Fillan brought Christianity from the monastery of St Columba on Iona into Breadalbane\\" . the Columba connection is feasible. Some guide books give the translation as ‚ÄúCalum‚Äôs Peak\\".\\"The Magic of the Munros\\" Page 35 (Gives rest of details on name origins and translation).  Geography  Beinn Challuim is often regarded as a smooth grassy hill mainly because these are the characteristics of the southern and western slopes which are seen by many people from the A82 road around Strath Fillan. However from the north it shows a more exciting form with a steep and rocky face overlooking the head of Glen Lochay. Beinn Challuim is made up of three ridges, the broad grassy south west ridge descends to Strath Fillan and is used in ascents from there. The north west ridge is steep and rocky and descends to the Bealach Ghlas-Leathaid (575 metres) and then connects to the Corbett of Cam Chreag. Another ridge goes easterly, descending into Glen Lochay. The mountain has a subsidiary summit which is listed in the Munro Tables as a ‚ÄúTop‚Äù, The South Top reaches a height of 998 metres and lies 600 metres south of the highest point.Database of British and Irish Hills. The two summits are connected by a ridge and this area can be confusing in poor visibility with the logical temptation to go north to the main summit possibly resulting in encountering steep crags. The proper route from the south top is to go initially west for a short distance across a hollow and onto the ridge which leads north to the main summit.www.incallander.co.uk. Gives details of dangers of summit ridge. The summit ridge has two corries on either side, to the west is the Coire nan Each (Corrie of the Horse) and to the east is Coire Challuim (Malcolm's Corrie). Drainage from the mountain reaches both coasts of Scotland at the Firth of Tay on the east coast and the Firth of Clyde on the west coast.  Ascents and summit  The most popular route of ascent starts at Kirkton Farm in Strath Fillan (grid reference ), this gives the opportunity to visit the ruins of St. Fillans Priory at the beginning or end of the walk. The route continues north east up grassy slopes to reach the summit ridge.\\"The Munros\\" Page 37 (Gives details of ascent from Strath Fillan). A more interesting ascent starts at the road end in Glen Lochay, this gives the chance to view the more noteworthy northern side of the mountain but involves a nine kilometre walk up the glen to the foot of the eastern ridge.\\"The High Mountains of Britain and Ireland\\" Pages 65 (Details ascent from head of Glen Lochay). Hamish Brown recommends a northern approach starting at Auch (grid reference ) ‚Äúif you want to be different‚Äù but this requires good navigation and some mild scrambling up the north west ridge.\\"Hamish's Mountain Walk\\" Page 73 (Suggests ascent from Auch). The actual summit of the mountain is named as Stob Glas (greenish-grey peak) on maps and has a large cairn which overlooks the sheer northern face. The view from the top gives fine views of the many peaks around the Tyndrum and Crianlarich area.

An armed helicopter is a military helicopter equipped with aircraft ordnance. Most commonly, it is used for attacking targets on the ground. Such a helicopter could be either purposely designed for a ground-attack mission‚Äîin which case it would be more specifically categorized as an attack helicopter‚Äîor may have been previously designed for other uses, such as utility, air cargo, aerial reconnaissance, etc., with the weapons mounts being modifications, rather than part of the design of the helicopter. The purpose of the modification to an armed helicopter configuration can be field expediency during combat, the lack of military funding to develop or purchase attack helicopters, or the need to maintain the helicopter for missions that do not require the weapons. Specialized armed helicopters fly from ships at sea, and are equipped for antisubmarine warfare or strikes with anti-shipping missiles. History Direct fire support delivered by weapons mounted on helicopters began informally in the Korean War, with United States Marines firing their weapons from the open doors of the aircraft, into the treeline of the landing area below.Mazarella, Mark N. \\"Adequacy of U.S. Army Attack Helicopter Doctrine to Support the Scope of Attack Helicopter Operations in a Multi-Polar World\\" . Fort Leavenworth, Kansas: U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, 1994. Accessed on 12 December 2007. The concept evolved with the French during the Algerian and the First Indochina wars, in the form of armed helicopters; where utility, cargo, and observation military helicopters were modified to carry various weapons. Algerian War The French Army was one of the first military forces to modify and use helicopters in combat in a ground attack role during the Algerian War of 1954‚Äì62. In 1955, French field commanders placed infantry machine gunners in the stretcher panniers of their Bell 47 (Sioux H-13) casualty evacuation helicopters. The ad hoc gunships were used to reach FLN guerrilla positions on otherwise inaccessible mountain ridges and peaks, but were far too underpowered. In 1956, the French Air Force experimented with arming the Sikorsky S-55, then being superseded in service by the more capable Piasecki H-21 and Sikorsky CH-34 helicopters. The H-19 was originally fitted with two rocket launchers and an ex-Luftwaffe MG151/20 20-mm cannon, both mounted axially on the outside of the aircraft. Later, an MG151/20 cannon, two .50 cal. (12.7-mm) Browning machine guns, and an FN Browning 7.5-mm light machine gun were mounted inside the fuselage at the cabin windows, but this load proved far too heavy, and even more lightly armed H-19 gunships proved underpowered. Some Piasecki H-21 helicopters were armed with fixed, forward-firing rockets and machine guns and a few even had racks for bombs, but the H-21 lacked the maneuverability and performance needed for offensive action. Most H-21s in service were eventually fitted with a single door-mounted 12.7 mm machine gun or an MG151/20 20-mm cannon as defensive armament. The Sikorsky H-34 was also modified into a gunship by the French Navy: standard armament comprised an MG 151 20-mm cannon firing from the cabin door, two 12.7-mm machine guns firing from the cabin windows to port, plus racks for 37 mm or 68 mm rockets. While the CH-34 was effective in the ground attack role, official evaluations at the time indicated that the CH-21 was more likely to survive multiple hits by ground fire than was the CH-34; this was assumed to be a consequence of the location and construction of the CH-34's fuel tanks. Nevertheless, by the close of the Algerian War, attack helicopters such as the CH-34 were being used in synchronized operations with troop-carrying CH-21 helicopters in large-scale counterinsurgency operations. Vietnam War The United States Navy and the United Kingdom began modifying existing helicopters as anti-submarine weapons (ASW) platforms, carrying depth bombs and Magnetic Anomaly Detector gear. After learning of French Army experiments, there was a movement within the U.S. Army to arm helicopters. Under the leadership of Colonel Jay Vanderpool, the U.S. Army modified Sikorsky and other larger helicopters with fixed and flexible-mount machine guns, rockets, and cannon. While Col. Vanderpool was ridiculed by some in the Army, others saw his efforts as a great aid to ground troops. At the time, the Army leadership felt that the U.S. Air Force was not doing enough to support ground forces, and due to the Key West Agreement, the Army could not field its own ground attack fixed-wing aircraft. With the increasing use of the helicopter for infantry transport, the U.S. Army saw a need for specialized helicopters to be used as aerial artillery to provide fire suppression and ground support close to the battle. The first United States use of the armed helicopter in large-scale combat operations was during the Vietnam War. First the U.S. Army modified UH-1B 'Huey' helicopters, mounting machine guns and Folding Fin Aerial Rockets (FFAR) on struts parallel with the fuselage. Eventually, the U.S. Army would upgrade the engine and rotor to the UH-1C model, and again to the UH-1M model, to overcome power issues as more and more armament was added to the helicopters. But this was not fully satisfactory, so the AH-1 helicopter was developed. Warsaw Pact During the 1960s, the Soviet Union saw the need for an armed helicopter and equipped Mil Mi-8 helicopters with rocket pods. This armed helicopter eventually developed into the Mil Mi-24, which saw extensive action in Afghanistan during the 80s. Mi-24s were also exported in large numbers to many Asian and African countries. Special operations variants In the last 20 years US Special Operations Command has been developing the special forces gunship, using the MH-60. These helicopters are to be used as an attack element with special operators to do the cleanup, or to deliver the operators and support them on the ground. They were used successfully during the Scud Hunt. Other Army Special Operations include the MH-6 and AH-6 \\"Little Birds\\". The MH-6 carries special operators on benches outside the helicopters, from which they can move quickly. The AH-6 is for close air support. The MH-47 Chinook helicopter has been used to carry special operators using long-wheelbase Land Rovers and other vehicles in and out of an area of operations. For longer-range special operations, the Air Force had operated the MH-53 Pave Low helicopter with extensive avionics for navigation, flying at very low altitude, and electronic warfare. However the Pave Lows were retired at the end of September 2008, and the role is now being performed by Air Force CV-22 Ospreys. Helicopter bombing uses The idea of the helicopter as a bomber has likely been around since helicopters first came into military service. The helicopter offers what might appear to be a highly stable bombing platform, making the idea all the more attractive. The idea is generally used by air forces conducting counterinsurgencies, and often by those lacking traditional fixed wing options. In Vietnam Likely the first organized usage of a helicopter as a tactical bomber, the United States Army employed the UH-1 Iroquois, CH-47 Chinook, and CH-54 Tarhe helicopters. The US Army had already conducted tests using the OH-13 Sioux fitted with small napalm tanks.Mutza, 1995. p. 29 The CH-47 was used most often to assist in the clearing of bunkers, using an improvised bomb made from 55-gallon drums of bulk CS powder, designated Bomb, Fuze, and Burster, CS in 55-gallon Drum, XM920.United States, 1969. p. K-2 Thirty of these bombs, containing eighty pounds of CS powder, could be carried by a CH-47, and were used to \\"saturate base camps, way stations, or infiltration routes to deny their use.\\"Rottman, 2006. p. 46 The US Army used the UH-1 with a far wider array of systems. Using the M156 Universal Mount, conventional aircraft dispensers for cluster munitions and mines were fitted.United States, 1969. p. B-3, K-2 Another system developed was the Mortar Aerial Delivery System or MADS. This system used standard 60mm or 81mm mortar rounds in dispensers mounted on the side of the aircraft, and was to be used against both preplanned targets and targets of opportunity.United States, 1967. p. 12-3 Pictures show this system in use as late as 1969.Drendel, 1983. p. 51 Even improvised bombs, made from things such as a \\"can of engine oil...[and] a thermite grenade\\" or \\"four or five concussion grenades...[with] belted M-60 ammunition around the grenades\\" were used.Drendel, 1974. p. 20 The US Army also conducted a number of drops of large bombs using the CH-54 helicopter for the purposes of clearing landing zones. Operational drops were conducted using both modified M121 10,000 lb bombs and the BLU-82/B 15,000 lb bomb.Mesko, 1984. p. 48 Tests conducted prior to the deployment of weapons and equipment for Operation Combat Trap led to discontinued use of the CH-54 and a switch to the C-130E(I) aircraft (later MC-130E).United States, 1970. p. 1-3 Both the US Army and US Marine Corps also investigated using the AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter as a bomber. The Army tested a dispenser system that could be used to drop smoke grenades, while the USMC went further and qualified the aircraft to carry the CBU-55/B Fuel Air Explosive.Mutza, 2002. p. 10-1, 34 While the USMC continued to qualify their subsequent AH-1 variants for the CBU-55/B weapon, there are no reports of it actually being used in combat. In El Salvador El Salvador during their conflict with FMLN and other guerrillas between 1980 and 1992, made use of UH-1 Iroquois in the bombing role. UH-1Hs and UH-1Ms flew punitive strikes against villages linked to the FMLN dropping 250 and 500 pound bombs. The need for this greater flexibility was required by the nature of the conflict and the lack of resources available to the Salvadoran Air Force. Since the bombs utilized used the same type of mounting hardware as the standard rocket launchers, the FAS used M156 universal mounts and essentially unmodified aircraft.Cooper, Tom. Air Combat Information Group. 1 September 2003 El Salvador, 1980‚Äì1992. Access Date: 3 September 2007 In Lebanon Helicopter bombing was used by the Lebanese Army during the 2007 Siege of Nahr al-Bared when it converted UH-1H utility helicopters into bombers due to the urgent need to fight the Fatah al-Islam terrorist group. They mounted 30-year-old 500 lb (250 kg) Mark 82 bombs, originally carried by Hawker Hunter attack aircraft.Kahwaji, Riad.

Access Date: 3 September 2007 In Syria Helicopters have been used to drop both conventional bombs and improvised \\"Barrel Bombs\\" by the Syrian Air Force during the Syrian Civil War since at least August 2012. Mi-8s, Mi-17s, Mi-14s and Mi-24s have all been used to bomb rebel-held cities and military positions. Their seemingly indiscriminate use against civilian population centers has drawn international scorn. The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution in February 2014 demanding an end to indiscriminate aerial bombing, to include the use of barrel bombs dropped by helicopters. In Iraq Helicopters have been used by the Iraqi Air Force during the Anbar campaign (2013‚Äì14) and the subsequent Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014).Al Jazeera, Iraqi military battles for control of Tikrit, retrieved 25 January 2015Al Arabiya, Like Assad, Maliki uses explosive barrels to quell rebellion, retrieved 25 January 2015 According to Erin Evers of Human Rights Watch, \\"What's happening now in Iraq definitely started in Syria. If I were al-Maliki, and seeing Assad next door using the same tactics without a slap on the wrist and gaining ground as a result, it stands to reason he would say, 'Why the hell not?'\\". Tests and evaluations Other nations have also made moves toward helicopter bombing, but have not put it into practice. The Soviet Union qualified both the Mil Mi-8 and Mil Mi-24 to use members of the FAB general-purpose bomb family. It is possible these aircraft may have been put into service in this role by the armed forces of Sudan and Sri Lanka.Cooper, Tom. Air Combat Information Group. 29 October 2003 Sri Lanka, since 1971. Access Date: 3 September 2007 The Philippines also tested a single Sikorsky H-34 as an attack helicopter, armed with both rockets and bombs on locally fabricated racks. This aircraft appears to have been the extent of the testing, and the Philippines did not introduce any H-34s in this capacity.Lundh, 1998. p. 100 See also * Air interdiction * Army aviation * Attack helicopter * Close air support * Gunship * Tactical bombing * U.S. helicopter armament subsystems Citations and notes References * Drendel, Lou.

He is mostly known for his collaborations with Soul legends like Marva Whitney, Gwen McCrae, Lyn Collins, The Impressions and James Brown amongst others. Life DJ Pari is the son of former professional footballer Walter Schmidt. Born in Braunschweig, Germany, he began DJing at age 15. In 1994, he moved to the United States, first to Phoenix, Arizona, where he spent two years running a club night called The Hip Joint. In 1995 he re-located to Los Angeles, California, where he played the club circuit and worked with acts like the Solsonics, Mandrill (band), The Black Eyed Peas, Big Black, Roy Porter (drummer) and many others. Around the same time he began opening shows for the Godfather of Soul James Brown and even toured with him for quite some time. In 1998, DJ Pari moved back to Germany and launched his Soulpower organization at the Palo Palo club in Hannover, Germany. Originally just a monthly soul party, Soulpower quickly evolved into a global project and booking agency, producing more than 400 shows and parties in more than 20 countries and 50 cities on four continents. Some of the artists DJ Pari has worked with under the Soulpower banner are Marva Whitney, Gwen McCrae, Lyn Collins, Bobby Byrd, Maceo Parker, Fred Wesley, Vicki Anderson, Pee Wee Ellis, Roy Ayers, Bootsy Collins, Clyde Stubblefield, John \\"Jabo\\" Starks, Sharon Jones, Sweet Charles Sherrell, Karl Denson, and RAMP. DJ Pari's musical productions include I am what I am, the 2006 album by Marva Whitney, and her singles \\"I am what I am\\" and \\"Soulsisters (of the world unite)\\" as well as Mama Feelgood by Lyn Collins and Live in Paris by Gwen McCrae. Pari has also worked with Japanese Funk outfit Osaka Monaurail, co-writing for and co- producing several of the group's albums. Since his move to Richmond, Virginia in 2007, DJ Pari has collaborated with funk pioneer Sir Joe Quarterman and Chicago soul legend Leroy Hutson, managing the singer's 2010 European tour. That same year, he assumed management duties for The Impressions of Curtis Mayfield fame, producing several tours in the United States, Europe and Japan for the group. In July 2012, he DJed with the Impressions at the Curtis Mayfield 70th Birthday Tribute at Lincoln Center in New York, a show that also featured Mavis Staples, William Bell, the Roots and other soul legends. DJ Pari also introduced the Impressions to Binky Griptite, guitarist and MC of Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings, a relationship that produced the group's first single in more than 30 years. In 2016, he arranged a meeting of the Impressions with President Barack Obama at the White House. In Richmond, DJ Pari was the co-host of the Soulpower party series and of the weekly radio show Midnight Soulstice on WRIR-LP. In 2013, the film documentary Power of Soul, produced by DJ Pari, screened at the Cannes Film Festival and at several festivals and theaters in Germany. The documentary features original footage and Pari's interviews with artists like James Brown, Bobby Byrd, Vicki Anderson, Marva Whitney, The Pharcyde, Kurtis Blow, George McCrae and many others. In 2017, Marva Whitney's \\"I am what I am,\\" co-written and produced by DJ Pari, was licensed by Ford for the TV commercial promoting the 2017 Ford Explorer titled \\"For Those With Their Own Path.\\" That same year, DJ Pari co- produced the album Tribute to my Soul Sisters by former James Brown backing vocalist Martha High with Osaka Monaurail.

According to Polyaenus, he came to power by using public funds allocated for the hire of private contractors meant to assist with a temple building project, to instead hire a personal group of bodyguards. With this force at his disposal, he was able to seize control of the town's government. Polyaenus. \\"Stratagems in War.\\" 5.51 He soon became an ally of Gelo, who at that time controlled Gela, and from 485 BC, Syracuse. Gelo later became Theron's son-in-law. Theron went to war with the city of Selinunte and the tyrant of Himera, Terillus. The latter, expelled from his city, therefore sought an alliance with Carthage through his son-in-law Anaxilas, tyrant of Rhegium. Theron occupied Himera but was then besieged in this city by a Carthaginian army, assisted by Terillus. In 480 BC, Theron, with the support of Gelo, won a great victory outside the walls of Himera against the Carthaginians and their allies. During the reign of Theron, Acragas along with Syracuse and Selinunte formed a kind of \\"triumvirate\\" which dominated Greek Sicily at the time. Theron died in 473 BC and was briefly succeeded by his son Thrasydaeus, before he was defeated by Gelo's brother and successor, Hiero I. After that defeat, Acragas came under the control of Syracuse. Pindar dedicates two Olympian odes, 2 & 3, to Theron, both for the same victory in the chariot race at the Olympic Games of 476 B.C. The poet Simonides of Ceos was also active at Theron's court.

Kasos in the Greek War of Independence At the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, Kasos possessed a population of 7,000 people and a sizeable fleet. With the onset of hostilities, the Kasiots began raiding the coasts of Anatolia, the Levant, and even Egypt. Under their elected admiral, Nikolaos Gioulios, they also often gave aid to the other Greek rebels in Crete, Samos, and elsewhere. As George Finlay reports, \\"It was said that the Kasiots usually murdered their captives at sea\\", especially since the island was barren and could with difficulty sustain its existing population. Apostolos Vakalopoulos also points out that control of Kasos was necessary for consolidating Ottoman‚ÄìEgyptian control over rebellious Crete; strategically, Kasos was analogous with Samos and Psara as an advanced bulwark and base of operations for the Greek revolutionaries. Already in June 1823, an Egyptian fleet commanded by Ismael Gibraltar disembarked 3,000 Albanian troops under Djiritli H√ºseyn Bey at Crete. By spring 1824, H√ºseyn Bey, by a judicious mixture of force and terror, combined with amnesty towards the Greek rebel leaders who were willing to submit, had managed to wipe out the Greek revolt in Crete. With Crete subdued, the Ottoman sultan, Mahmud II, and his semi- autonomous governor in Egypt, Muhammad Ali, turned their attention on Kasos and resolved to make an example of the island. The Kasiots learned of their intentions, sending letters to the Provisional Administration of Greece to request aid, but the government replied that it was unable to mobilize the fleet for lack of money. The Egyptian fleet first appeared off the island on 2 June, launched an ineffectual bombardment, and made moves as if to land troops; as this was probably merely a reconnaissance mission, it soon departed. It was not until 18 June that the full 45 ships of the Egyptian fleet appeared off the island. Capture of Kasos and massacre The island was not well fortified, apart from a few guns placed at the coast to cover the likely landing place. The Egyptian commanders furthermore contrived to deceive the islanders: after sailing past the island exchanging heavy artillery fire for two days with the defenders‚Äîon the 19th alone the Egyptians fired over 4,000 shots‚Äîthe fleet moved towards the northern tip of the island. There it launched 18 great boats, pretending that it would make landing there, covered by much musket fire; while 24 boats with 1,500 Albanians landed behind the village of Agia Marina under cover of night on 19 June. The bulk of the population lived in the four mountainous villages around the main town, which were now between two hostile forces. H√ºseyn Bey issued a call for surrender, rejecting requests for time to consider the proposal. Finally, the village elders chose to submit; this did not prevent H√ºseyn Bey from executing many of them later. The men who were posted on the shore batteries on the western side, under a certain Captain Markos, put up firmer resistance, but they too were overcome, as the Albanians, veterans of mountain warfare, used the cover provided by the higher ground to approach and defeat them, suffering only 30 killed and wounded in the process. Markos himself was captured and brought bound before H√ºseyn Bey, where suddenly he managed to break his bonds, grab a knife from one of his guards, and kill three of them before he too as killed. The Albanians were given 24 hours to plunder at will; the Egyptian troops seized much plunder, as well as 15 larger and forty smaller vessels, while three newly built ones were burned. After that, however, Ismael Gibraltar and H√ºseyn Bey firmly restored order on the island, executing three Arabs who disobeyed orders to that effect. 500 Kasiot men were slain, but a general massacre was averted allegedly because the first Albanians to come ashore were Christians, who interceded with their Muslim fellows to spare most of the male population. However, over 2,000 women and children were sent to the slave markets of Egypt and Crete. The Egyptian admiral managed to recruit a considerable number of survivors‚Äîas well as from the neighbouring islands of Karpathos and Symi‚Äîas sailors into his own fleet, offering a salary of 50 kuru≈ü a month, before returning in triumph to Alexandria with his captured vessels, as well as fifteen elders and the families of the principal Kasiots as hostages. Aftermath News of the danger facing Kasos arrived at Hydra on the 21st, and the Greek fleet mobilized with much delay and difficulty, not arriving before the island until 2 July. The agha left as governor by Ismael Gibraltar fled the island to Karpathos, but the island was entirely destroyed; Vice Admiral Georgios Sachtouris and his captains proposed to the islanders to transport them to the Peloponnese, but the Kasiots refused, and the Greek fleet, receiving news that the main Ottoman fleet had set sail from Constantinople, was forced to leave the island. Indeed, the destruction of Kasos was followed soon after by another, heavier blow for the Greeks: the Destruction of Psara.

It has traditionally been classified as a subspecies of the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), but is now treated as a separate species based on differences in voice and size and because of the genetic distance between the two. It is about long with birds in the north of the range being largest. It has broad wings and a large head with two \\"ear\\" tufts. The plumage is mainly grey-brown but is quite variable in colour. The underparts are pale with narrow grey-brown bars and the breast has dark blotches. There is a black border to the facial disc and white stripes above the yellow eyes. The great horned owl is similar but larger with stronger feet and bill, broader bars on the underparts and longer ear-tufts. The deep hooting call consists of a double-note followed by a loud, vibrating note. The bird's local name tuc√∫quere is imitative of the call. The range extends from central Peru and western Bolivia southwards through Chile and western Argentina as far as Tierra del Fuego. The bird occurs in a variety of habitats including open forest, scrubland, farmland and grassland. It hunts over open country, mainly at night.

Beginning as a minor landowner and steward in Shropshire, he became Henry I's chief agent in the Welsh Marches and in 1108 Bishop of London. He founded St Osyth's Priory in Essex and was succeeded by a considerable dynasty of clerical politicians and landowners. Identity Richard's toponymic byname is given in modern accounts as de Belmeis. Occasionally the form de Beaumais is encountered. This is based on the modern spelling of the village from which his family perhaps originated: Beaumais-sur-Dive, which is east of Falaise, in the Calvados region of Normandy.British History Online Bishops of London accessed on 28 October 2007 The attribution is now regarded as not fully proven.J.F.A. Mason: Oxford DNB article It is made up of two very common French toponym elements, meaning ‚Äúattractive estate‚Äù: there is a village called Aubermesnil-Beaumais elsewhere in Normandy. Whatever the form of his name, Richard is easily confused with his namesake and nephew, Richard de Belmeis II, who was also a 12th-century Bishop of London. Tout refers to Richard I by the surname Rufus,T.F. Tout: DNB article which creates further confusion. His epitaph shows that he was called Rufus, but the name, in the form Ruffus, is now generally reserved for an Archdeacon of Essex a brother of Richard Belmeis II and thus another nephew of Richard Belmeis I. A further, later, Richard Ruffus may have been a son of the archdeacon. The family tree below attempts to clarify the relationships, which are still not beyond doubt. Background and early life Richard's background seems to lie in the lower reaches of the Norman landowning class. He is thought to be the Richard whom the Domesday enquiry found holding the very small manor of Meadowley, due west of Bridgnorth in Shropshire.Eyton, Volume 1, p.149 This he held as a tenant of Helgot, who held it of Roger Montgomery, the great territorial magnate who dominated the Welsh Marches. Meadowley was 6 ploughlands in extent and was populated by just five families: 3 slaves and 2 bordars.Palmer and Slater, p.13 However, there were evidently signs of revival in Richard's hands. In Edward the Confessor's time it had been worth 30 shillings, but it had sunk to only 2 shillings by the time Richard acquired it, since when it had risen again to 11 shillings. Richard also held three hides worth of land as a tenant of Helgot at Preen, to the north-west of Meadowley. Here he let a hide to Godebold, a priest who was a crony of Earl Roger.Owen and Blakeway, p.263 Godebold at this time was much wealthier than Richard and held a large number of properties that had been intended as prebends of the collegiate church of St Alkmund in Shrewsbury. Richard seems to have become steward of Earl Roger and appears as a witness in charters, both genuine and spurious, granted by Roger and his son, Hugh to Shrewsbury Abbey,Eyton, Volume 2, p.193 and in one is described as dapifer for Shropshire. Richard also seems to have been employed in Sussex, where the Montgomery earls had substantial holdings. Viceroy of Shropshire Henry I. Richard's position was almost entirely the result of Henry's patronage. Richard seems to have avoided entanglement in the revolt of Robert of Bell√™me, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury and consequently emerged in Henry I's favour. Probably in autumn 1102, Henry ordered ‚ÄúRichard de Belmes‚Äù, Robert of Falaise and all the barons of Sussex to secure for Ralph de Luffa, the Bishop of Chichester, lands near the town of Chichester.Eyton, Volume 2, p.194Johnson and Cronne, p. 26, no. 614 It seems, therefore, that Richard was not in Shropshire at that time, but in Sussex. He was probably sent to Shrewsbury late in 1102, after Henry had dealt with Robert of Bell√™me's Welsh allies, imprisoning Iorwerth ap Bleddyn, a powerful Welsh leader who had played a prominent but equivocal part in events. Henry continued to treat Shropshire as a marcher lordship but was determined not to install another earl who might threaten the monarchy.Lloyd, p.414 Probably at Christmas, Henry ordered Richard to help secure some land for the Abbey of Saint-Remi,Johnson and Cronne, p. 27, no. 618 which had a daughter house at Lapley Priory in Staffordshire and estates in Shropshire. This would indicate that he was fully in charge of Shropshire by the end of the year. However, the sequence of events is not certain. Henry allowed Richard to take effective control of the county as a royal agent. He was described by Ordericus Vitalis as the vicecomes or ‚Äúviscount‚Äù of Shropshire,Ordericus Vitalis, ed. Forester, p.417 a term sometimes translated as Viceroy.Eyton, Volume 2, p.192 It is possible that he was addressed on occasion as the Sheriff of Shropshire. He had a reputation as an expert on legal matters.Williams English and the Norman Conquest p. 157 Hence he served as the justiciar for the king at Shrewsbury, where his brief also included oversight of Welsh affairs.Crouch Reign of King Stephen p. 55 He was given substantial holdings in the county to support him in appropriate style. The priest Godebold had been succeeded by a son, Robert, and it seems likely that he had supported the rebels, as his estates were turned over to Richard.Owen and Blakeway, p.264 Other estates he acquired were Tong and Donington, both of which had been retained as demesne by the Montgomery earls themselves. Despite his focus on Shropshire, the king seems to have continued regarding Richard as a Sussex magnate: as late as 1107 he heads a list of Sussex notables informed of the king's confirmation of the right of Chichester Cathedral to hold a fair in the town.Johnson and Cronne, p. 64, no. 810 As Henry's viceroy, Richard made a considerable impact on the county. On occasion he convened and presided over ecclesiastical synods: Even after he became Bishop of London, he had no obvious authority for doing this, as Shropshire fell within the Diocese of Lichfield. His decisions at assemblies at Wistanstow in 1110 and Castle Holdgate in 1115Latin text in Eyton, Volume 3, p.232-4 greatly increased the powers and privileges of Wenlock Priory by recognising it as the mother church of an extensive parishM J Angold, G C Baugh, Marjorie M Chibnall, D C Cox, D T W Price, Margaret Tomlinson and B S Trinder. ‚ÄúHouses of Cluniac monks: Abbey, later Priory, of Wenlock‚Äù in Gaydon and Pugh, p.38-47 and made it an important force in the region.

As depicted on his seal. Eadmer, the historian who is the main source for details of Richard's ordination as priest and bishop. Richard was elected to the see of London and invested with its temporalities on 24 May 1108.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 258 The date is known from Eadmer, the contemporary historian and biographer of Anselm, who places Richard's election at Pentecost:Eadmer, ed. Rule, p.196 24 May in that year, according to the Julian Calendar, in which Easter was on 5 April. The king's confirmation affirms that he is granted ‚Äúthe see of London with the lands and men pertaining to it, and the castle of Stortford.‚ÄùJohnson and Cronne, p. 80, no. 881 Shortly afterwards, Henry restored to the canons of St Paul's a range of judicial powers and privileges they had enjoyed in the reign of Edward the Confessor.Johnson and Cronne, p. 83, no. 899 It appears that he had so far been ordained only as a deacon. Ordination as a priest was required before Richard could proceed to ordination as a bishop. Eadmer makes clear that he was ordained as a priest with many others by Anselm, the Archbishop of Canterbury, at his manor of Mortlake. Anselm had only recently returned from a long exile after he and the king came to a resolution of their Investiture Controversy, and it seems that there was a backlog of ordinations. Eadmer does not give a date as such but says that Anselm carried out these ordinations during jejunio quarti mensis - the ‚Äúfast of the fourth months,‚Äù i.e. the Ember Days, which were the Wednesday, Friday and Saturday following Pentecost. Eyton reasoned that the ordination would therefore have been on 27, 29 or 30 May. However, Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicani gives the probable date as 14 June 1108, nevertheless citing Eadmer as evidence. Richard was fairly typical of the men made bishops, even after Henry had made substantial concessions to the Church. Citing Richard as an example, Poole comments: ‚ÄúPiety in matters of religion was seldom the primary qualification in the election of bishops; the continued to be normally men of affairs, administrators, chosen for their experience in conducting the king's business.‚Äù What followed made clear that Richard was essentially a royal nominee, not really known, much less congenial, to Anselm and the supporters of Gregorian Reform. Eadmer says that the king went to embark for Normandy and waited until he received a blessing from Anselm, who then became very ill and was confined to his quarters.Eadmer, ed. Rule, p.197 The king then sent William Giffard, the Bishop of Winchester and William Warelwast, the Bishop of Exeter, who had taken opposite sides in the investiture dispute, to urging Anselm to look after his son and the kingdom and to make sure that Richard was soon ordained bishop at Chichester. The reason he gave was that Richard was a man of great ability for whom he had important business in the far west of the country. Anselm did expedite Richard's consecration as a bishop, which took place on 26 July 1108. However, he demurred at using Chichester Cathedral, preferring instead to use his own chapel at Pagham, assisted by the bishops of Winchester, Chichester and Exeter, together with Roger of Salisbury, the Bishop of Salisbury.Eadmer, ed. Rule, p.198 Primacy dispute One of Richard's concerns was to promote the interests of the Archdiocese of Canterbury, of which his own see formed a part. A dispute over the primacy between Canterbury and York had already dragged on for some years. Anselm had been granted a personal primacy over the whole English church by the Papacy. However, Thomas, archbishop-elect of York since May 1108 had used various stratagems to delay his own consecration, as it was clear Anselm was near to death. In May 1109, Anselm died and at Pentecost the king convened his court in London,Eadmer, ed. Rule, p.207 where the bishops demanded that Thomas accept consecration. This was a unanimous call, including even Samson, the Bishop of Worcester,Eadmer, ed. Rule, p.208 who was Thomas's father. Accordingly, Thomas was brought to consecration at St Paul's, Richard's seat, on 27 June. Seven bishops were scheduled to take part: Richard himself, William Giffard of Winchester, Ralph d'Escures, the Bishop of Rochester, Herbert de Losinga, the Bishop of Norwich, Ralph of Chichester, Ranulf Flambard, the Bishop of Durham, and Hervey le Breton,Eadmer, ed. Rule, p.210 the king's confessor, currently unable to fulfil his role as Bishop of Bangor but a bishop nevertheless. However, Richard refused to participate until Thomas had made a written profession of subordination. According to Eadmer, this was a comprehensive surrender of the primacy to Canterbury: However, doubt was to return later about the wording. Once the required formalities had been carried out, Richard pronounced himself satisfied and the consecration went ahead, with Thomas subsequently receiving a pallium from the Papal legate. Richard was still determined to pursue his campaign against Thomas, and raised the issue of who should say mass before the king at the Christmas court of 1109, which was held in London. Still an archbishop and a primate, Thomas claimed to be the senior bishop in the country because of the continuing vacancy at Canterbury. However, Richard claimed to be the senior bishop and dean of the Province of Canterbury,Eadmer, ed. Rule, p.212 and thus the archbishop's deputy. Moreover, his predecessor Maurice had been the one to crown Henry in 1100, when there was no Archbishop of Canterbury available. Richard celebrated the mass but the argument was pursued with renewed vigour, actually at the king's dinner table, until Henry sent both bishops home and remitted the issue to the future archbishop of Canterbury. Tout thought that Richard himself had aspirations to become archbishop, although it was not to be. Ralph d'Escures was already acquiring administrative authority within the province and, after prolonged wrangling, was to emerge as the next archbishop. Episcopal business Richard took part in settling numerous ecclesiastical and secular matters of his day. He was a witness to the king's writ recognising the establishment of the Diocese of Ely: this had been discussed for some time and adopted as policy by Anselm,Eadmer, ed. Rule, p.195 but papal approval arrived only in 1109. Hervey le Breton, displaced from Bangor by the resurgence of the Kingdom of Gwynedd, was translated to the new see,Eadmer, ed. Rule, p.211 which was created by the partition of the Diocese of Lincoln. Old St Paul's. The cathedral was only slowly rebuilt after the fire of 1086 and not rededicated until 1240 Richard attended the king when he was waiting to embark for Normandy in 1111 and 1114.Eyton, Volume 2, p.198 On 27 June 1115 he was at the enthronement of Ralph d'Escures as Archbishop of Canterbury. On 28 December that year he accompanied the king and queen to the consecration of St Albans Abbey.Eyton, Volume 2, p.199Johnson and Cronne, p. 127, no. 1102 He participated in the consecration of several other bishops. On 4 April 1120 it was when David the Scot, a new Bishop of Bangor agreed upon by Henry I and Gruffudd ap Cynan, was consecrated at Westminster Abbey; on 16 January 1121, when Richard de Capella was consecrated Bishop of Hereford at Lambeth; and on 2 October that year, in the same church, when Gregory or Gr√©ne was consecrated Bishop of Dublin. On 6 February 1123 he was prevented by paralysis from officiating when his prot√©g√© William de Corbeil was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury. William de Corbeil or Curboil had been for some years the Prior of St Osyth's Priory, an Augustinian house founded by Richard at the village of Chich in Essex. The king confirmed Richard's grant of the manor to the priory around 1117-9.Johnson and Cronne, p. 147, no. 1209 The priory was dedicated to a legendary Anglo-Saxon nun and martyr.‚ÄúHouses of Austin canons: Abbey of Chich or St Osyth's‚Äù in Page and Round, p.157-162. It was only one of his great building projects, although important to him personally and intended to provide a mausoleum and chantry for himself. The rebuilding of St Paul's was a much bigger project he inherited with the see of London from Maurice, his predecessor, as the previous building had been destroyed by fire. Ordericus Vitalis portrays his efforts as enthusiastic and determined, very nearly bringing the work to completion. Ordericus Vitalis, ed. Forester, p.418 This was possibly true initially. However, William of Malmesbury believed that Maurice had committed the diocese to a scheme that was too ambitious and that Richard was damaged not only in wealth but in mental health by the enormity of the task, ultimately despairing of the burden. Nevertheless he is celebrated as the founder of St Paul's Cathedral School,Harrison, p. 13. which was to provide an education for its choristers in the succeeding centuries, slowly evolving into distinct choral and grammar schools.St Paul's Cathedral School website Richard was the recipient of significant small tokens of royal favour. Probably in 1114 the king notified Hugh de Bocland that Richard was henceforth to receive the tithe of venison from Essex that had previously been a royal prerogative.Johnson and Cronne, p. 115, no. 1047 Rather later was a grant to Richard and his cathedral of ‚Äúthe whole of the great fish caught on their land, except the tongue, which he reserves for himself.‚ÄùJohnson and Cronne, p. 214, no. 1530 Apparently this referred to porpoises.Poole, p. 92 Welsh affairs Medieval Wales Richard's best-documented interventions in Wales date from the period immediately after his elevation to the episcopate in 1108. Richard's meddling in the complex dynastic politics of Wales was not always successful and Lloyd comments that ‚ÄúBishop Richard was cynically indifferent to the crimes of Welshmen against each other.‚ÄùLloyd, p.421 The imprisonment of Iorwerth had left a partial power vacuum in Powys, which his brother Cadwgan ap Bleddyn was unable to fill.Lloyd, p.417 Initially these were precipitated by Owain ap Cadwgan's abduction of Nest ferch Rhys in 1109, which had profound repercussions across Wales, as she was both the wife of Gerald de Windsor, the most powerful Norman baron in South Wales and the daughter of Rhys ap Tewdwr, the last Welsh ruler of Deheubarth.Lloyd, p.419 The widespread sense of outrage created a coalition of Welsh leaders against Owain and Cadygan. Richard was able to use this groundswell to send his forces and their allies across Central Wales, driving Owain and Cadwgan back into Ceredigion, then further into exile in Ireland. Richard partitioned the fugitives' land among his allies and in 1110 Iorwerth was released from seven years' captivity to create a new centre of power and authority. However, Richard ordered one of his allies, Madog ap Rhiryd, to surrender some English criminals whom he was sheltering,Eyton, Volume 2. p.196 alienating him from the new order. When Owain returned from exile, Madog immediately defected to his side and accompanied him in pillaging along the border. This led to hostilities with Iorwerth, who kept his bargain with Richard and the king, driving the outlaws from his realms.Lloyd, p.420 However, Owain continued his depredations from further west and Madog returned to corner and kill Iorwerth, driving him at spear-point into his blazing home. Richard dealt with each disaster by restoring relations with the perpetrators. Initially he reinstated Cadwgan in power, accepting Owain's return. When Madog murdered Cadwgan, Richard responded by granting substantial lands to him. Owain seems to have sidestepped the local conflict by making contact with the king personally.Eyton, Volume 2, p.197 Succeeding his father in Powys, he was able in 1113 to blind Madog in revenge for his father's murder and to survive a full-scale royal invasion in the following year. Eyton comments on Richard's part in these events: ‚ÄúThe grossest treachery seems to have pervaded this part of his policy.‚Äù Death Richard seems to have given up his political functions in his last years. Eyton thought it likely he retired to his Priory of St Osyth in Essex. Certainly he died there. On his deathbed, Richard confessed that he had lied about his tenure of a manor, previously testifying that he held it in fee, when in reality he had it under a lease.Crouch \\"Troubled Deathbeds\\" Albion p. 34 This was the manor of Betton in Berrington, to the south of Shrewsbury, which had been given to Shrewsbury Abbey soon after its foundation by Robert de Limesey, then Bishop of ChesterM J Angold, G C Baugh, Marjorie M Chibnall, D C Cox, D T W Price, Margaret Tomlinson and B S Trinder. ‚ÄúHouses of Benedictine monks: Abbey of Shrewsbury‚Äù in Gaydon and Pugh, p.30-37 Richard cleared up the matter through his confessors: William de Mareni, his own nephew and Dean of St Paul's, and Fulk, the prior of St Osyth's.Eyton, Volume 2, p.200 Fulk clarified the situation in letters to the king, the Archbishop and other notables. Although Richard directed that the estate be restored to the abbey, its status was contested by his successors for decades: by Philip de Belmeis in 1127, although he quickly defaulted;Eyton, Volume 2, p.201 a few decades later by his younger son, Ranulph, who ultimately recognised the abbey's rights in return for acceptance into its fraternity;Eyton, Volume 2, p.207 in 1212 by Roger de la Zouche, who continued his suit for years unsuccessfully.Eyton, Volume 2, p.216-7 Richard also restored to the abbey the advowson of the churches at Donington and Tong: these too were to be contested in the future. Richard died in 1127, with his death being commemorated on 16 January, so he probably died on that date. He was buried at the Priory of St Osyth. His epitaph, on a marble tomb, read: Family Tympanum over the south processional entrance to Lilleshall Abbey. Richard de Belmeis's nephews were able to endow the abbey from their large inheritance. Richard became the originator of both ecclesiastical and secular dynasties. He had at least two sons, Walter and William. Walter was a canon of London, holding the prebend of Newington, and William was Archdeacon of London. However, his nephews, heirs who could be legally acknowledged, were recipients of much greater benefits. The sons of two sisters, Ralph de Langford and William de Mareni, both pursued distinguished careers in the Diocese of London and in turn became Dean of St Paul's. Sons of his brother Robert received still more. Philip became his secular heir in the Midlands, receiving the substantial and lucrative estates at Tong and Donington. Philip's younger brother, Richard de Belmeis II received a royal grant of his prebends of St Alkmund's church, Shrewsbury, and the pair were able to found and endow another great Augustinian house: Lilleshall Abbey in Shropshire. However, both Philip's sons died young, after successively inheriting the estates,Eyton, Volume 2, p.206-7 which then passed through their sister Adelicia and her husband, Alan de la Zouche, to the Barons Zouche.Eyton, Volume 2, p.210 Richard later became Bishop of London. Richard Ruffus, their brother, apparently sharing his uncle's complexion, was archdeacon of Essex in the diocese of London, and had two sons who were canons of St Paul's. Another brother, Robert seems to have been the ancestor of the later Belmeis landowning dynasty. His son, William, was a canon of St Paul's and prebendary of St Pancras, but it is unclear whether he or a brother was Robert's temporal heir.

Career as player  Heiner Brand joined at the age of seven the handball club VfL Gummersbach. He was with that club six times German champion (1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1982 and 1983) and won four times the DHB-Pokal (1978, 1979, 1982 and 1983). He also became with that club internationally successful (European Cup winner in 1978 and 1979, European National Championship winner in 1974 in 1983, Super cup winner in 1979 and 1983, IHF cup winner in 1982). Heiner Brand was also successful in the Germany national handball team, where he played a total of 131 games and scored 231 goals, including one penalty throw. In 1976, he was a member of the West German team that finished fourth in the Olympic tournament in Montreal. He played all six matches and scored twelve goals.

She was part of the Carlisle group of the C-class of cruisers. She was laid down by Vickers Limited at Barrow-in-Furness in 1917 and launched on 9 July 1918. Calcutta was commissioned too late to see action in the First World War and was converted to an anti-aircraft cruiser in 1939. Calcutta served during the Norwegian Campaign and the evacuation from Dunkirk in 1940. She was used to escort allied convoys across the Mediterranean and was sunk on 1 June 1941 by Luftwaffe aircraft off Alexandria, Egypt. Construction and design Calcutta was laid down at Vickers' Barrow-in- Furness shipyard on 28 January 1917 and launched on 9 July 1918, completing in August 1919. The ship was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal and deep load. Six Yarrow boilers fed steam to two sets of Parsons geared steam turbines rated at , giving a design speed of . As built, Calcuttas main armament consisted of five BL 6 inch Mk XII naval guns, carried in single mounts, with an anti-aircraft armament of two QF 3-inch 20 cwt guns and two 2-pounder pom-pom autocannon. Eight 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes were carried, in four twin mounts. The ship had an armour belt of amidships, thinning to forward and aft, with an armoured deck thick protecting the ship's machinery. She had a complement of 432 officers and ratings. Modification In August 1938 Calcutta started conversion at Chatham Dockyard to an anti-aircraft cruiser. The conversion involved removal of all guns and torpedo tubes, with eight QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval guns in four twin mounts being fitted, with a close-in armament of a quadruple 2-pounder pom-pom and two quadruple Vickers .50 machine gun mounts. The conversion was completed in July 1939. Service Following commissioning, Calcutta joined the 8th Light Cruiser Squadron on the North America and West Indies Station as Flagship. In December 1919 it helped put down violence in Trinidad and Tobago during a General Strike there. On 6 March 1920, the American cargo ship caught fire in Port of Spain harbour. Calcutta sent some of her crew to try and fight the fire and used her boats to rescue Balabacs crew. Calcutta remained on the North America and West Indies Station until 1926, when she sustained structural damage from being dashed against a jetty in Bermuda by a hurricane on 21 October, the hurricane also sinking the sloop while at sea. Following repair and a period in reserve, Calcutta was recommissioned on 18 September 1929 as the flagship of the 6th Cruiser Squadron serving on the Africa Station, based at Simon's Town, South Africa, serving on that station until returning to the United Kingdom and paying off into reserve in 1931. Second World War Following conversion to an anti- aircraft cruiser, Calcutta joined the Home Fleet in August 1939 and in September was allocated to the Humber Force, acting as an anti-aircraft escort for convoys in the North Sea. She returned to the Home Fleet in February but continued to escort convoys as well as the Fleet. In April 1940, Germany invaded Norway and Calcutta was one of the units of the Home Fleet deployed in response. From 22‚Äì23 April, Calcutta, along with the cruiser , the destroyer , the sloop and the French destroyers and , escorted the French troopship Ville dAlger which was landing troops at Namsos but the operations were disrupted by poor weather. On 30 April, operations began to evacuate British and French troops from √Öndalsnes, with Calcutta providing anti-aircraft cover for the evacuation operations. Calcutta and Auckland evacuated the rearguard from √Öndalsnes on the night of 1/2 May, with Calcutta embarking 756 officers and men. At the end of May 1940, Calcutta took part in Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk. She evacuated 656 troops on the night of 27/28 May 1940, when she operated off La Panne, and a further 1,200 troops on the night of 28/29 May. Calcutta again operated off Dunkirk on the night of 31 May/1 June, and was slightly damaged by near-misses by German bombs on 2 June. Following the completion of the evacuation from Dunkirk, British Forces continued to operate in France, with Operation Ariel taking part in the second half of June 1940 to evacuate the remainder of British forces from ports in the west of France. Calcutta took part in Operation Ariel, providing anti-aircraft cover for evacuations from Saint- Jean-de-Luz in the far South-East of France, near the border with Spain from 23 to 25 June, when the Armistice between France and Germany ended the evacuations. On the return journey, Calcutta was in company with the Canadian destroyers and , when on the evening of 25 June Calcutta collided with Fraser off the Gironde estuary, cutting the destroyer in two. The front of Fraser sank quickly, while the aft part was scuttled by Restigouche. Calcutta was undamaged. On 30 August Calcutta set off from Gibraltar as part of Operation Hats, which had the purpose of strengthening the British Mediterranean Fleet based in Egypt while simultaneously escorting a supply convoy to Malta. Calcutta formed part of Force F, the reinforcements for the Mediterranean Fleet, and together with sister ship and the battleship delivered personnel and stores to Malta on 2 September after Force F met up with the Mediterranean Fleet, reaching Alexandria on 6 September. On 8 October 1940, Calcutta, together with Coventry and four destroyers, formed the close escort of Convoy MF.3 to Malta, reaching Malta on 11 September, with Calcutta and Coventry forming part of the escort of the return convoy MF4. Calcutta provided anti- aircraft support for the battleships , Valiant and when they bombarded Bardia on 3 January, then on 7 January set off from Alexandria as part of the escort of Malta Convoy MW5. This was part of a complex series of operations, with another Malta convoy, Operation Excess being simultaneously run from Gibraltar. Convoy MW5 arrived unharmed at Malta on 10 January, but the escort for the Operation Excess convoy was heavily hit by German dive bombers, sinking the cruiser and badly damaging the aircraft carrier and the cruiser . During March 1941, Calcutta escorted a series of troop convoys, known as Operation Lustre, carrying four British divisions from Egypt to Greece. An Italian attempt to attack these convoys resulted in the Battle of Cape Matapan in which three Italian heavy cruisers were sunk. On 18 April 1941 Calcutta sailed with the Mediterranean Fleet when it escorted the fast transport to Malta, continuing to escort the fleet as it bombarded the port of Tripoli on 20 April. On 24 April, the Mediterranean Fleet launched Operation Demon, the evacuation of British and Commonwealth forces from Greece, with Calcutta taking part in the evacuations. Between 6 and 12 May, Calcutta set out from Alexandria as part of the escort of Malta-bound convoy MW7, before joining the Operation Tiger convoy ferrying tanks from Gibraltar to Egypt. On 20 May, Germany launched an invasion of Crete by airborne troops. The British Mediterranean Fleet deployed to counter any sea-borne reinforcement of the German forces, with three groups of cruisers and destroyers (Forces B, C and D) deployed to the north of Crete to intercept invasion convoys, while a force of battleships and destroyers (Force A1) provided cover in case the Italian Navy attempted to intervene. Calcutta was sent from Alexandria to join Force C, meeting it on 21 May. Force C came under heavy attack by German and Italian aircraft during 21 May, with the destroyer being sunk. On 22 May Force C intercepted a convoy of Ca√Øques carrying German troops to Heraklion, escorted by the . While the convoy was forced to turn back, heavy German air attacks caused the commander of Force C, Rear-Admiral King, to break off the attack. The air attacks damaged the cruisers and before Force C rejoined the covering Force A1. Further attacks on the combined force damaged the battleships Warspite and Valiant and sank the cruisers Gloucester and and the destroyer . Force A1 was ordered back to Alexandria early on 23 May to restock anti- aircraft ammunition. On 27 May, the deteriorating situation on Crete resulted in the evacuation of Allied forces being ordered, with Calcutta along with the cruisers Coventry, and , the destroyers , and and the transport evacuating 6,000 troops from Sfakia on the night of 29/30 May 1941. On the night of 31 May/1 June 1941, a final effort was made to evacuate the remaining troops from Sfakia, with the cruiser Phoebe, the minelayer and the destroyers , and picked up a further 3,710 men. Calcutta and Coventry set out from Alexandria on 1 June to provide extra anti-aircraft protection for this force, but the two ships were attacked by two Junkers 88 bombers of Lehrgeschwader 1 about northwest of Alexandria, which dived out of the sun, giving little warning. Calcutta was hit by two bombs and sank, with 255 men being rescued by Coventry and 107 men killed or missing.

His career culminated in election as Bishop of London in 1152. He was one of the founders of Lilleshall Abbey in Shropshire. Origins Richard de Belmeis belonged to an ecclesiastical and secular land-owning dynasty associated with his uncle, Richard de Belmeis I, Bishop of London from 1108 to 1127, He is generally regarded as the brother of Richard Ruffus, who was an archdeacon of Essex, and their father is given as Robert de Belmeis throughout Diana Greenway's edition of Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae. However, Eyton, the Shropshire antiquarian and historian, gave the name of Richard's father as Walter in his study of the origins of Lilleshall Abbey,Eyton, Lilleshall Abbey, p.229 and repeated this in his further work on the Belmeis family and their holdings, including a family tree. This has been accepted by successive editions of the Dictionary of National Biography.T.F. Tout: DNB article J.F.A. Mason: Oxford DNB article The Belmeis family is thought to have originated in Beaumais-sur-Dive, east of Falaise, in the Calvados region of Normandy, although this is not certain. Beginning as a minor Shropshire landholder and steward of Roger Montgomery, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, the elder Richard de Belmeis skilfully avoided involvement in rebellion to become Henry I's viceroy in Shropshire and later Bishop of London. His success enable not only the younger Richard, but a considerable number of family members, to pursue lucrative ecclesiastical careers, while Philip de Belmeis, emerged as his main temporal heir.Eyton, Antiqities, Volume 2, p.201 Family tree Based on genealogy given by Eyton,Eyton, Antiquities, Volume 2, p.208-9 supplemented by reference to Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae.Greenway (1968) Career Archdeacon of Middlesex Richard Belmeis II seems initially to have held Caddington Major, an important prebend of St Paul's Cathedral. The parish of Caddington lay across the border of Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire, but the prebendal estates of Great and Little Caddington were at that time on the Hertfordshire side. They were of great importance to the chapter of St Paul's: it had very full rights of jurisdiction there and was to hold the manors until it was abolished at the end of the English Civil War in 1649.‚ÄúCaddington‚Äù, in Page (1908), p.314-20 Innocent II depicted, left, in a mosaic in the church Santa Maria in Trastevere, Rome. Well before the death of his uncle in 1127, Richard was named Archdeacon of Middlesex. Installed while still a minor, his nomination was the work of his uncle.Eyton, Lilleshall Abbey, p.231 His archdeaconry was placed under the custody of one Hugh \\\\- thought to be the Master Hugh who was magister scholarum until 1127\\"Chancellors\\", in Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066-1300: Volume 1, St. Paul's, London, ed. Diana E Greenway (London, 1968), p.25-7 (accessed 12 January 2015) and sometime Prebendary of Hoxton.\\"Prebendaries of Hoxton\\", in Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066-1300: Volume 1, St. Paul's, London, ed. Diana E Greenway (London, 1968), p. 55-6, (accessed 12 January 2015) At some point in the episcopacy of Gilbert Universalis (1128‚Äì34), Richard sought the return of his archdeaconry, but the bishop allowed Hugh to retain it. Though the details are little known, Richard's rivalry with Hugh prior to the final installation of Richard in 1138 was possibly the origin of the notorious English drinking song \\"Oh Lord Belmeis.\\" However, Gilbert's death was followed by a bitter struggle over the succession, which gave Richard an opportunity to seek resolution to his own dispute. The bishop-elect, Anselm of St Saba, was opposed by a faction within the chapter of St Paul's Cathedral, centred on the dean. This continued even after he was enthroned in 1137. In 1138 Richard de Belmeis was sent to Rome as a representative of the dean's faction in an attempt to induce Pope Innocent II to reverse Anselm's appointment. At this point the dean was probably William de Mareni, although he died during 1138 and was replaced by William de Langford: both were cousins of Richard de Belmeis. Innocent upheld the appeal and Richard then pressed the question of his archdeaconry. The Pope remitted the issue to the arbitration of Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln and Robert de Bethune, Bishop of Hereford, who found in Richard's favour. Probably as a consequence of this victory, in December Alberic of Ostia, the Papal legate, who was in England to oversee a fresh election for the see of London, ordered that he be ordained a deacon. This was done by Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester and brother of King Stephen. Founding of Lilleshall Abbey The western entrance to the church at Lilleshall Abbey King Stephen. A view of the north wall of the chancel at Lilleshall. Empress Matilda's great seal Richard, and his brother, Philip, lord of Tong, Shropshire, were instrumental in establishing Lilleshall Abbey, an important Augustinian house in Shropshire. Richard was granted substantial estates in Shropshire by a charter of confirmation. This was issued by the king at Portsmouth in August 1127, probably while he was waiting to embark for Normandy. It covered four prebends of St Alkmund's collegiate church in Shrewsbury: Lilleshall, Atcham, Uckington and Preston Gubbals. The Domesday survey had found that these were in the hands of a cleric called Godebold,Godebold the Priest at Open Domesday, accessed 13 January 2015. who seems, like Richard de Belmeis I, to have been close to Roger Mortimer,Owen and Blakeway, p.263 and who gave his name to Preston Gubbals. He was succeeded by his son, Robert, who probably sided with the revolt of Robert of Bell√™me, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury, as the estates were granted by Henry I to the elder Richard.Owen and Blakeway, p.264 They were within the king's gift, as St Alkmund's was a royal foundation. However, they remained ecclesiastical estates, held in mortmain, and could not be alienated to an individual. The king's charter, addressed to the Bishop of Chester and to the barons of Shropshire, simultaneously honoured the memory of the faithful, deceased bishop; recognised his nephew as his spiritual heir; and reasserted the inalienability of the prebends as Church property in the gift of the king. It reaffirmed that these were lands which the Bishop of London ‚Äúheld from the king and which formerly belonged to Godebald and his son Robert.‚ÄùJohnson and Cronne, p. 207, no. 1492 Richard became a canon of St Alkmund's and was later recognised as dean. Richard's brother, Philip, already had a record as a benefactor of religious houses, particularly Buildwas Abbey, which was affiliated to the Congregation of Savigny (and later absorbed into the Cistercian Order). He was admitted to the Savignac lay fraternity. However, in the early 1140s he gave land at Lizard, Staffordshire, ‚Äúto found a Church in honour of St. Mary for Canons of the Order of Arrouaise, who had come from the Church of St. Peter at Dorchester, and are serving God and St Mary there.‚ÄùEyton, Lilleshall Abbey, p.230 He also gave the canons the right to collect wood for fuel and for building and also donated two Leicestershire churches ‚Äì at Blackfordby and Ashby-de-la-Zouch.Eyton, Antiquities, Volume 2, p.204 These were Canons Regular who followed the rigorous practice of Arrouaise Abbey in northern France. Like all such canons, they were integrated into the Augustinian Order by a decree of the Second Council of the Lateran in 1139. They had been brought from their first house in England, at Dorchester on Thames, to attempt to establish a colony in Shropshire. This proved a struggle. As Lizard proved unviable, they moved first into Donnington Wood, near Wrockwardine, and then by 1148 to Lilleshall, where a substantial community was established. This was made possible by Richard, who carried through the dissolution of St Alkmund's college to invest its property in the new community.Owen and Blakeway, p.265 The dissolution of St Alkmund's, a chapel royal, was only possible with royal assent. A charter was obtained from King Stephen, granted in 1145 at Bury St Edmunds.Cronne and Davis (1968), p.173, no. 460 This not only confirmed Richard's donation of all his holdings to the canons but also promised the remaining prebends as they fell vacant.Eyton, Antiquities, Volume 8, p.214 It was countersigned by Imar of Tusculum, the papal legate.Facsimile in Cronne and Davis (1969), plate 31 Pope Eugenius III ordered Roger de Clinton, the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, to issue a charter confirming Richard's gift to the canons and Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, subsequently also issued a confirmatory charter.Eyton, Antiquities, Volume 8, p.215 The prevalence of the Anarchy made it essential to win the approval also of Stephen's opponents, initially Empress Matilda. She issued a confirmatory charter to the canons, now at Lilleshall, in 1148 - probably while she was at Falaise.Cronne and Davis (1968), p.173, no. 461 Henry, Duke of Normandy, her son and heir, also gave his consent Cronne and Davis (1968), p.173, no. 462 and repeated it when he became King Henry II. Bishop of London Henry of Blois, as depicted on a contemporary plaque, now in the British Museum. He not only ordained Richard as deacon but later sent a panegyric to his consecration as Bishop of London. Henry II, depicted on his great seal Richard was probably elected to the see of London by the chapter of St Paul's, where he could rely on the votes of family members and friends, in the spring of 1152. Robert de Sigello, his predecessor had died as early as September 1150, so there was a significant delay, which seems to have been the result of royal obstruction. King Stephen demanded ¬£500 to countenance the chapter's right of free election. It is unclear whether this was the result of a simple desire to milk the church for money or whether the king resented Richard's election. He had certainly vacillated during the civil war. In the summer 1141 he is known have been in attendance on Matilda at Oxford, as he witnessed one of her charters confirming a grant of land to Haughmond Abbey, his name appearing next to that of the notorious Shropshire rebel William FitzAlan.Eyton, Antiquities, Volume 7, p.287 One of those who rallied to his support was a relative: Gilbert Foliot, then Bishop of Hereford, who wrote a series of letters on his behalf. Papal approval seems to have been announced during the summer of 1152. However, the delay continued for further months. As he was still a deacon, Richard was ordained a priest on 20 September by Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury.Eyton, Antiquities, Volume 8, p.218 Finally, on 28 September, after a vacancy just short of two years, Theobald consecrated him bishop, with almost all the bishops of the English church attending the event. Bishop Henry of Winchester, the king's brother, who could not be present, wrote a letter to the Synod, praising Richard's elegance, courtesy, hard work and learning, with the wish that ‚Äúthe tree now planted in God's temple, with divine help, flourish and be fruitful.‚Äù However, controversy continued. Richard had appointed Ralph de Diceto to replace himself as Archdeacon of Middlesex. However, Pope Eugene III had not been heard on the matter. His choice was John of Canterbury, who seems to have held the London prebend of St Pancras, as well as serving as clerk to Archbishop Theobald. The issue was an embarrassment to Richard but it was resolved when John was made treasurer to the Archbishop of York in 1153. Little is known of Richard's episcopate, although he seems to have been industrious in the administrative and legal aspects of his post. Eyton thought he was involved in the negotiations of 1153 between Stephen and the future Henry II that settled the succession. He attended Henry's coronation on 19 December 1154. It was he who baptised Prince Henry, the first surviving son of the king and Eleanor of Aquitaine, who was born on 28 February 1155. Toward the end of his life, between 1160 and 1162, he established the post of Treasurer for his diocese, a notable administrative reform.\\"Treasurers\\", in Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066-1300: Volume 1, St. Paul's, London, ed. Diana E Greenway (London, 1968), pp. 21-22, (accessed 13 January 2015) His last recorded public appearance was when he attended the king's court at Colchester on 24 May 1157. Death During his last years Richard was afflicted by a disorder that affected his speech, possibly a stroke, and it may be that it had a similar cause to the paralysis that affected his uncle. He was also heavily in debt. He died on 4 May 1162.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 258 Citations References *H.A. Cronne and R.H.C. Davis (1968).

Written by Geoff Johns and Dave Gibbons and drawn by Ivan Reis, Patrick Gleason, and Ethan Van Sciver, the 11-part saga was originally published between June and December 2007. In addition to the main storyline, four supplemental \\"Tales of the Sinestro Corps\\" one-shot specials and a Blue Beetle tie-in issue were concurrently released. The story centers on the Green Lanterns of Earth‚ÄîHal Jordan, Kyle Rayner, John Stewart and Guy Gardner‚Äîand the rest of the Green Lantern Corps as they fight an interstellar war against the Sinestro Corps, an army led by the former Green Lantern Sinestro who are armed with yellow power rings and seek a universe ruled through fear. A 1986 Alan Moore \\"Tales of the Green Lantern Corps\\" story was the thematic basis of the storyline. Many characters were changed, killed off, or re-introduced as a result of the event. Critical and fan reception to \\"Sinestro Corps War\\" was highly positive. Many reviewers ranked it among the top comic books of the year and the storyline's first issue garnered a 2008 Eisner Award nomination for Best Penciller/Inker or Penciller/Inker Team. The storyline was also a financial success, and several issues underwent multiple printings. \\"Sinestro Corps War\\" is the second part of a trilogy in the Green Lantern storyline, preceded by the 2005 miniseries Green Lantern: Rebirth. The conclusion of \\"Sinestro Corps War\\" sets up the third and final part of the trilogy, Blackest Night, which was published in 2009.  Plot  Prominent members of the Sinestro Corps, including (clockwise from top left): the Cyborg Superman (Hank Henshaw), Superman-Prime, the Anti-Monitor, Parallax (Kyle Rayner), and Sinestro. Art by Ethan Van Sciver. Following his defeat in Green Lantern: Rebirth, the events of Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special #1 see the supervillain Sinestro retreat to the planet Qward in the Antimatter Universe. There he amasses an army, the Sinestro Corps, that he selects based upon their ability to \\"instill great fear\\". Each member is armed with a yellow power ring, mirroring the green ones of the Green Lantern Corps. Amongst Sinestro's allies are Parallax and the resurrected Anti-Monitor. The Sinestro Corps then launch an all-out assault against the Green Lantern Corps and the universe itself. During the assault on Oa, the Sinestro Corps manages to inflict heavy casualties and free Superman-Prime and the Cyborg Superman from their imprisonment. Kyle Rayner is captured and transported to Qward, where Sinestro manages to separate Rayner from the symbiote Ion allowing Parallax to possess him.Geoff Johns (w), Ethan Van Sciver (a), Moose Baumann (col), Rob Leigh (let). \\"Sinestro Corps, Prologue: The Second Rebirth\\".

Hal, John and Guy return to Earth to warn the Justice League of the Anti-Monitor's return. As the Sinestro Corps spreads out to ambush Green Lanterns across the universe, Green Lantern (vol. 4) #23 sees the Guardians decide to rewrite their sacred text, the Book of Oa. They remove a section devoted to a prophecy concerning the \\"Blackest Night,\\" against the objections of two of their number, Ganthet and Sayd. They then add ten new laws, the first of which authorizes the use of lethal force against the Sinestro Corps, while Ganthet and Sayd are expelled from Oa.

The Sinestro Corps War\\" part 11. Green Lantern (vol. 4) #25, DC Comics. The Guardians arrive on Earth and appoint Sodam Yat to be the new Ion. After a lengthy struggle in New York City, the Sinestro Corps are defeated by the overwhelming numbers against them. One of the Guardians sacrifices himself to send Superman-Prime to an alternate universe and another, Scar, suffers a major wound at the hands of the Anti-Monitor, while Hal and Kyle subdue and arrest Sinestro in Coast City. It is learned 440 Green Lanterns perished during the course of the war.Green Lantern Corps #19 (Feb. 2008) As seen in Green Lantern (vol. 4) #25, the Guardians decide to bring the second of the new laws into effect. After realizing that the \\"Blackest Night\\" prophecy will come to pass, Ganthet and Sayd depart after creating a blue power ring with the intention of creating their own corps, based on the spreading of hope to the rest of the universe. The Anti-Monitor's remains, having been blown across the vacuum of space at the battle's climax, lands on a dark planet where it is transformed by an unknown force into a black power battery.  Origins  A page from the 1986 Alan Moore/Kevin O'Neill story Tygers depicting the fall of the Green Lantern Corps. Elements from the story were incorporated into \\"Sinestro Corps War\\". \\"Sinestro Corps War\\" was based on concepts introduced by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill in the short story \\"Tygers\\", published in Tales of the Green Lantern Corps Annual #2 (1986). Writers Geoff Johns and Dave Gibbons incorporated several ideas from Moore's stories into \\"Sinestro Corps War\\", including the prophecy of the Blackest Night, Sodam Yat, Ranx the Sentient City and the Children of the White Lobe. Leezle Pon, a minor character only mentioned once in Moore's \\"Mogo Doesn't Socialize\\" story from 25 years ago, also makes an appearance in Green Lantern #25. Work began on \\"Sinestro Corps War\\" in September 2006. The structure was fluid, at one point becoming a few issues with two bookends to just one gigantic issue. The title was originally just \\"Sinestro Corps\\", but during development the creators added the word \\"War\\". Eventually the structure finalized into a one-shot special for release in June, after which the story would alternate between Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps until November. After the crossover's initial publishing successes, DC added four Tales of the Sinestro Corps one- shots to the publishing schedule. Johns and Ethan Van Sciver first announced the crossover during the DC \\"Big Guns\\" panel at the 2006 Fan Expo Canada, with Johns calling it \\"the next level of Rebirth\\". By January 2007, Johns, Gibbons and editor Peter Tomasi had planned out most of the storyline. Sterling Gates, whom Johns had met at a convention, was brought in to write a backup story for the Superman-Prime one-shot and co-write Green Lantern/Sinestro Corps Secret Files #1. The creators called \\"Sinestro Corps War\\" \\"World War II with the entire universe\\". In a September 2007 interview, Johns compared \\"Sinestro Corps War\\" to the Star Wars trilogy, with Green Lantern: Rebirth as A New Hope and \\"Sinestro Corps War\\" as The Empire Strikes Back. References to other science fiction stories were made by artist Ivan Reis, who inserted characters such as E.T., ALF and a Predator into large two-page illustrations. The writers also included the sound \\"EPA\\" in Green Lantern #25 as a direct reference to a scene in The Simpsons Movie where Comic Book Guy says it is the sound Green Lantern made when Sinestro threw him in a vat of acid.  Format  The main story consisted of 11 parts running through the Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps books. Expanding upon the overall story are four one-shots labeled Tales of the Sinestro Corps, as well as one tie-in with Blue Beetle #20. Part One, the one-shot Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special #1, was released in June 2007. Parts Two through Ten were released between August and December, alternating between Green Lantern #21‚Äì25 and Green Lantern Corps #14‚Äì18, with an epilogue in Green Lantern #26. The content of Green Lantern Corps #19 was changed to illustrate the battle between Sodam Yat and Superman- Prime in response to the fans' reaction to the story. Geoff Johns announced in October 2007 that the conclusion Green Lantern #25 would be delayed two weeks. After the storyline concluded, Green Lantern/Sinestro Corps Secret Files and Origins #1 was released in December. The issue further explored the back story of the opposing groups and listed every member of the Green Lantern Corps and Sinestro Corps. Cover to Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Superman-Prime #1, one of four one-shot issues about specific members of the Sinestro Corps. Art by Ethan Van Sciver. There was much internal discussion at DC about how the storyline would be collected. Eventually DC decided to release two hardcover volumes (a February 2008 release containing the first five parts of the story and a June 2008 release containing the last six issues) and a June 2008 hardcover collecting the tie-in issues and backstories. This follows DC Comics' recent trend of releasing durable hardcover collections initially, followed later by softcovers.  Tales of the Sinestro Corps  In addition to the main story, DC released four Tales of the Sinestro Corps one-shots in September, October and November 2007. The issues were late additions to the crossover that DC added after the initial successes of \\"Sinestro Corps War\\". A hardcover collection of the four issues was released in June 2008. The Tales of the Sinestro Corps one-shots focused on: * Parallax, written by Ron Marz and illustrated by Adriana Melo and Marlo Alquiza. * Cyborg Superman, written by Alan Burnett and illustrated by Patrick Blaine and Jay Leisten. * Superman- Prime (previously solicited as about the Anti-Monitor), written by Geoff Johns and illustrated by Pete Woods. The issue also featured the backup story \\"Fear is a Baby's Cry\\" written by Sterling Gates and illustrated by Jerry Ordway. * Ion, written by Ron Marz and illustrated by Michael Lacomb.  Story and character changes  \\"Sinestro Corps War\\" introduced the Sinestro Corps in full after allusions to them throughout the post-One Year Later Green Lantern title. Sinestro received a major thematic overhaul as a result of his leadership of his eponymous Corps, with parallels drawn with Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. Green Lantern villains Superboy-Prime (later Superman-Prime), Cyborg Superman, and the Manhunters became members of the Sinestro Corps. The Anti-Monitor also made his first reappearance since his death at the conclusion of Crisis on Infinite Earths in 1985 as the \\"Guardian\\" of the Sinestro Corps and later the power source of the Black Lanterns. Superboy- Prime was renamed Superman-Prime during the event. Ostensibly to illustrate his coming of age in the story, Geoff Johns cited the ongoing legal dispute over the Superboy name as another reason for the character's new name. Some changes were also made to the heroes during the course of the storyline. The role of Ion passed from Kyle Rayner to Sodam Yat, making Yat the \\"strongest Green Lantern in the universe\\" as a result according to Johns. The Book of Oa was rewritten by the Guardians to institute 10 new laws for the Green Lantern Corps, the first of which authorized lethal force against the Sinestro Corps. The rebirth of Coast City, the process of which had been seen throughout Geoff Johns' run on Green Lantern, as \\"the City Without Fear\\" was used to symbolically represent Hal Jordan's journey towards acceptance after his resurrection. The second volume of the story's collection revealed that the original plan was for both John Stewart and Guy Gardner to be possessed by Parallax, with artwork of them facing off against Hal Jordan. However, in the midst of the story planning, Johns realized this would make Parallax's possession of Kyle less effective and the segment was dropped and redrawn. Green Lantern #25 expanded on the \\"emotional spectrum\\" concept and introduced five new color-based corps of similar structure to the Green Lanterns and the Sinestro Corps. These corps each draw from different emotions, corresponding with the seven colors of the rainbow (red for rage, orange for avarice, yellow for fear, green for willpower, blue for hope, indigo for compassion and violet for love). Ganthet and Sayd, two Guardians of the Universe who were exiled during the course of the war, were shown as developing the corps that corresponds to the color blue and the emotion hope, while the Anti-Monitor becomes the power source for an eighth color-based corps, the \\"Black Lanterns\\", who represent death and the \\"absence of human drives and emotions.\\" The issue also laid the foundations for the 2009 event Blackest Night, something the creators had been working towards since early 2007.  Critical and financial reception  Altogether, \\"Sinestro Corps War\\" turned Green Lantern into one of DC Comics' most profitable titles. Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special #1, first released June 2007, sold out in a single day. DC later reprinted the issue four times, each time with new variant covers by Van Sciver. By August, the issue had sold over 89,000 copies, 36% of which was the result of an unusually high number of reorders. The first four parts of the storyline, Green Lantern #21 and 22, and Green Lantern Corps #14 and 15, were released in July and August and also sold out. The issues went to a second printing, with Green Lantern Corps #14 going to a third printing. Green Lantern #23 and Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Parallax #1 later went on to second printings as well. Blue Beetle #20 saw much higher sales than usual for the title as a result of its tie-in to \\"Sinestro Corps War\\", with sales 75% higher than in the previous month. Critical reception to \\"Sinestro Corps War\\" was highly positive. IGN.com called the story a \\"smash hit\\" and Newsarama referred to it as both an \\"action-packed DC adventure\\" and \\"DC's blockbuster event of the year\\". Comic Book Resources released an editorial in mid-October 2007 entitled \\"Sinestro Corps War is what World War Hulk SHOULD be\\", citing the former's ability to keep up and gain momentum throughout despite being both twice as large and far less publicized than the latter. Comic Book Resources placed \\"Sinestro Corps War\\" on its \\"Best of 2007\\" list, and named Geoff Johns one of its \\"Best Writers of 2007\\". In 2008, Ethan Van Sciver earned an Eisner Award nomination for his art in Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special #1. DC Comics Executive Editor Dan DiDio praised the storyline as \\"the best thing that [DC Comics] put out this year. Without a doubt\\", and called \\"Sinestro Corps War\\" the model for crossovers in 2008 and beyond, including \\"Final Crisis\\". Didio has also stated that he would like to see a direct-to- video animated \\"Sinestro Corps War\\" film similar to Justice League: The New Frontier. Geoff Johns suggested elements of \\"Sinestro Corps War\\" will appear in DC Universe Online, on which he was collaborating with artist Jim Lee, although the comic storyline wasn't incorporated in the game.  Collected editions  The main story was first collected in two volumes, but was later collected in a single volume. Miscellaneous stories were collected in an additional volume: *Green Lantern: The Sinestro Corps War (336 pages, paperback, September 2011, ) **Green Lantern: The Sinestro Corps War Volume One (collects Green Lantern vol. 4 #21‚Äì23, Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #14‚Äì15, and a story from Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special #1; 176 pages, hardcover, February 2008, ; softcover, May 2009, ) **Green Lantern: The Sinestro Corps War Volume Two (collects Green Lantern vol. 4 #24‚Äì25 and Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #16‚Äì19, 192 pages, hardcover, July 2008, ; paperback, June 2009, ) *Green Lantern: Tales of the Sinestro Corps (collects Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Parallax #1, Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Cyborg-Superman #1, Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Superman-Prime #1, Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Ion #1, Green Lantern/Sinestro Corps Secret Files #1, and stories from Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special #1 and Green Lantern vol. 4 #18‚Äì20; 200 pages, hardcover, July 2008, ; paperback, June 2009, )  In other media  In an interview with Newsarama in 2008, DC Comics executive editor Dan DiDio expressed interest in making an animated adaptation of Sinestro Corps War as part of the DC Universe Animated Original Movies.https://web.archive.org/web/20080511204507/http://www.newsarama.com/WWLA/08/DCNation.html During the early development of the cancelled Green Lantern sequel in 2012, the main plot was based on the Sinestro Corps War storyline.http://comicbook.com/blog/2012/11/15/report-green-lantern-2-still- happening-features-the-sinestro-corps-war/  References  Category:Comics by Geoff Johns Category:Comics by Dave Gibbons Category:Alien invasions in comics Category:Crossover comics ","title":"Sinestro Corps War"},{"id":"13083303","text":"Medullary sponge kidney is a congenital disorder of the kidneys characterized by cystic dilatation of the collecting tubules in one or both kidneys. Individuals with medullary sponge kidney are at increased risk for kidney stones and urinary tract infection (UTI). Patients with MSK typically pass twice as many stones per year as do other stone formers without MSK. While having a low morbidity rate, as many as 10% of patients with MSK have an increased risk of morbidity associated with frequent stones and UTIs. While many patients report increased chronic kidney pain, the source of the pain, when a UTI or blockage is not present, is unclear at this time. Renal colic (flank and back pain) is present in 55% of patients. Women with MSK experience more stones, UTIs, and complications than men. MSK was previously believed not to be hereditary but there is more evidence coming forth that may indicate otherwise. Signs and symptoms Most cases are asymptomatic or are discovered during an investigation of blood in the urine. Symptomatic patients typically present as middle-aged adults with renal colic, kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis and/or recurrent urinary tract infections; however, MSK also may affect children very rarely. In addition to the typical clinical phenotype of recurrent stone disease, other clinical profiles have now been recognized, that is, an indolent, almost asymptomatic MSK, and a rare form characterized by intractable pain. Complications Complications associated with medullary sponge kidney include the following: * Kidney stones * Urinary tract infection (UTI) * Blood in the urine * Distal renal tubular acidosis (Type 1 RTA) * Chronic kidney disease (rarely) * Marked chronic pain Cause In recent studies, insight has been obtained on the genetic basis of this disease, supporting the hypothesis that MSK is due to a disruption at the 'ureteric bud-metanephric mesenchyme' interface. This explains why so many tubular defects coexist in this disease, and particularly a distal tubular acidification defect of which the highly prevalent metabolic bone disease is one very important consequence. In addition to the typical clinical phenotype of recurrent stone disease, other clinical profiles have now been recognized, that is, an indolent, almost asymptomatic MSK, and a rare form characterized by intractable, excruciating pain. It was previously believed that most cases of medullary sponge kidney were sporadic; however, recent studies show familial clustering of MSK is common and has an autosomal dominant inheritance, a reduced penetrance, and variable expressivity. Other theories suggest that dilatation of a collecting duct may occur, caused by occlusion by uric acid during fetal life or resulting from tubular obstruction due to calcium oxalate calculi secondary to infantile hypercalciuria. A rare, autosomal recessive form is associated with Caroli disease. Diagnosis Classically, MSK is seen as hyperechoic papillae with clusters of small stones on ultrasound examination of the kidney or with an abdominal x-ray. The irregular (ectatic) collecting ducts are often seen in MSK, which are sometimes described as having a \\"paintbrush-like\\" appearance, are best seen on intravenous urography. However, IV urography has been largely replaced by contrast-enhanced, high-resolution helical CT with digital reconstruction. Treatment Often, aggressive treatment is unnecessary for people with MSK disease that does not cause any symptoms (asymptomatic). In such cases, treatment may consist of maintaining adequate fluid intake, with the goal of decreasing the risk of developing kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Cases of recurrent kidney stone formation may warrant evaluation for possible underlying metabolic abnormalities. In patients with low levels of citrate in the urine (hypocitraturia) and incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis, treatment with potassium citrate helps prevent the formation of new kidney stones. Urinary tract infections, when they occur, should also be treated. Patients with the more rare form of MSK marked by chronic pain typically require pain management. Non-obstructing stones in MSK can be associated with significant and chronic pain even if they're not passing. It is not certain what causes this pain, but researchers have proposed that the small numerous stones seen in MSK may cause obstruction of the small tubules and collecting ducts in the kidney. This pain can be constant, can often be debilitating and treatment is challenging. Narcotic medication, even in large quantities, is sometimes not adequate. Some success with pain control has been reported using laser lithotripsy (called \\"ureteroscopic laser papillotomy\\"). Epidemiology In the general population, the frequency of medullary sponge kidney disease is reported to be 0.02-0.005%; that is, 1 in 5000 to 1 in 20,000. The frequency of medullary sponge kidney has been reported by various authors to be 1221% in patients with kidney stones. The disease is bilateral in 70% of cases.

Growing to tall by broad, it is conical when young but more rounded in shape when mature. Its leaves are mottled yellow-green with curly edges and a salient bright midrib, and have a strong lemony smell when crushed. It has highly fragrant clusters of attractive yellow-cream flowers in spring, followed by distinctive black seed capsules. It is found throughout New Zealand's North and South Islands along forest margins and stream banks from sea level to . It is New Zealand's largest Pittosporum. The binomial qualifier eugenioides means \\"resembling Eugenia\\", a different genus of plants. The variegated cultivar 'Variegatum' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Life cycle/phenology Pittosporum eugenioides starts out as a small compact tree, as it matures it becomes a tall branched tree. The lemonwood flowers between October and December. The following year after flowering the capsules will open. The capsules open the next year because the fruit of the lemonwood takes between 12 and 14 months to ripen. There is unripe fruit and ripe fruit present on the lemonwood at the same time, this is the current season‚Äôs fruit and last season‚Äôs fruit. Lemonwood is pollinated by both insects and birds, the seeds are bird dispersed. The seeds of the lemonwood germinate quickly and will become seedlings within a month. Range Pittosporum euegnioides is endemic to New Zealand. There are ‚Äúabout 200 trees and shrubs‚Äù in the genus located in neighbouring parts of the world. Countries with the same genus found include; Africa, Australia, some Pacific islands, southern & eastern Asia, and New Zealand. A reason for this endemic occurrence is due to the isolation of New Zealand over a long period of time. New Zealand range Pittosporum euginiodes is found throughout New Zealand‚Äôs South Island and North Island in low lying forests. It is found in forest clearings and along forest margins up to 600m above sea level. Habitat preferences Pittosporum euegnioides can be found in a cooler, mature, lowland and subalpine forest climate zone throughout New Zealand. The species can be found in regenerating areas of forest, both young and old. It has proved to be a great plant for establishing a quick canopy. This species, along with other Pittosporum are making their way in to the average house hold garden‚Äôs. Nurseries and Garden Centre‚Äôs are stocking this native because it is suited to New Zealand conditions where it naturally grew many years ago. At home in the garden, P. euegnioides prefers a sunny to part shade position, does not mind the wind, and thrives in soil with good drainage. Diet and foraging The viability of the lemonwood's seeds is affected by moisture levels of the soil. If the moisture levels are too high the seed is likely to become unviable. The lemonwood like other pittosporums is somewhat drought resistant therefore rainfall is not a major factor in the lemonwoods survival. P. eugenioides is relatively simple to look after from season at home. It grows well, thriving off regular watering intervals during Summer. It enjoys a feed with general tree and shrub fertiliser twice a year during Spring and Summer while it is growing. Responds well to pruning also, which will assure survival in the forest too if disturbed. Predators, parasites, and diseases The pittosporum flower weevil (Aneuma rubricale) is a parasite that feeds on the underside of the lemonwood leaves. This parasite does not kill the lemonwood it just damages the leaves through its feeding. The holes the weevils eat in the leaves are visible because the leaf reacts causing a dark brownie purple ring to form around the hole. Pittosporum eugenioides is only a host to the adult weevil as the larvae are hosted on different pittosporums. Common garden pests can cover this plant, such as Aphids and blister scale (Psyilids). Both can easily be controlled and treated with an insecticide. The best time to spray as a preventative is February, then again in October. Citrus aroma The sweet scent of the flowers suggest nectar loving birds find this an ideal plant to forage from. The experiment was carried out to see if the citrus-like chemicals were the same ones that are present in lemon-like species, such as Verbena varieties. The lemony leaves are a unique combination of scented chemicals found in the oil produced. Octyl acetae, Terpinen-4-ol and Decanol were found in a test that was carried out. Octyl acetae is responsible for the ‚Äúfruity, Jasmine, herbaceous aroma‚Äù. Terpinen-4-ol scent is ‚Äúsomewhere between peppermint and pine‚Äù. Finally, Decanol is a \\"fatty, orange blossom odor\\". Results of this test unearthed that this lemonwood aroma combination is very unusual for this genus and the chemicals are different to what you would find in other citrus scented species. Traditional uses Leaves of the Pittosporum eugenioides. Cultural uses Maori traditionally used the gum and crushed leaves and flowers of the tarata for scent, usually mixed with plant oils such as titoki and kohia. Maori also used the lemonwood to make hair oils and perfume. For perfume, the oil was mixed with bird fat. The gum from the tree was used for bad breath. They rolled the gum in to a ball and this was thought to last a whole generation. The gum made a great glue when chewed as well. Restoration planting Pittosporum eugenioides is great for establishing a shade canopy in a restoration setting. It then provides an opportunity to introduce understory, shade loving plants to the same location, later planting underneath the lemonwood trees. It is recommended to plant this species closer than you would normally find in the established forest. ‚Äúclose planting imitates the growth of the seedlings on the forest floor‚Äù, resulting in plants tending to grow upward more rapidly. P. eugenioides is one of the best plants for this rapid canopy growth because it is already fast growing. Lemonwood is on the recommended list for replanting ‚Äúsmall trees up to 6m‚Äù naturally occurring species in to the design guidelines of the Christchurch City Council. ‚ÄúHardy native species offer a great number of benefits‚Äù and are more flexible to suit local conditions compared to ‚Äúforeign‚Äù plant selection. Home garden design It is important to include historic, naturally occurring species planting design because they perform well in local conditions. ‚ÄúAs well as looking good, the design provides wildlife habitat, recreational spaces, also assisting in filtering water runoff‚Äù. P. eugenioides in a home setting will most likely be found as a hedging or screening plant. Happy to be near a swimming pool, a great choice too because it has minimal leaf litter drop. Great in a windy position in a design and also provides a barrier for the surrounding more intolerant plants. Great as a greenery backdrop with the textural leaves clustered together as well.

She was sailed to Pembroke Dock for outfitting, a process finally completed in February 1922, following which she was assigned to the America and West Indies Station, based at the Royal Naval Dockyard, on Ireland Island in Bermuda until 1929.WW2 Cruisers: HMS Capetown Capetown was commissioned too late to see action in the First World War, but served in the Second World War. Like most of her sisters, she was originally assigned to the Mediterranean and later to the Red Sea. Capetown rescued the 20 survivors of the sloop-of-war after Valerian foundered in the Atlantic Ocean south of Bermuda on 22 October 1926 during a hurricane with the loss of most of her crew. She spent a large part of her career with the Eastern Fleet, including a period between the wars from July 1934 until August 1938, when she returned to the United Kingdom for a refit. She rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet in August 1940. While deployed in the Red Sea, she was torpedoed and severely damaged by the Italian motor torpedo boat MAS 213 off Massawa, on 6 April 1941. Seven members of her crew lost their lives. After a year of repairs at Bombay, she served with the Eastern Fleet until 1943. She then returned to the UK and joined the Home Fleet. During the Normandy landings in June 1944 Capetown was deployed as a Shuttle Control/Depot ship at Mulberry A placed to seaward in order to direct incoming convoys to berths or anchorages. was anchored inshore to control returning convoys of unloaded vessels with Shuttle Control Command for both ships being embarked in Capetown. Shuttle Control Command was responsible for keeping the Army informed of expected arrivals and directing them to the proper unloading sectors. She survived the war and was sold on 5 April 1946. She arrived at the yards of Ward of Preston for breaking up on 2 June 1946.

L. Carr during his second visit to teach at a public school in Huron, South Dakota, United States. At the age of 25 years, after training as a teacher, J. L. Carr applied to the English-Speaking Union for a year's exchange as a teacher and arrived in Huron, South Dakota on 1 October 1938.Rogers, Byron (2003). The Last Englishman. The life of J.L. Carr. London: Aurum Press. Some of his experiences in Huron were incorporated into the novel The Battle of Pollocks Crossing. After military service during the war in the Royal Air Force in West Africa and in military intelligence in England, Carr returned to teaching. In 1951 he was appointed as the first headmaster of Highfields primary school in Kettering, Northamptonshire. He took a sabbatical in 1956 to return to Huron with his wife Sally and son Robert, to spend another year at Huron Public School.Carr, J. L. (1991) The Passport Interview. Huntingdon, Cambridge: Passport magazine, issue 2. During this time Carr wrote and illustrated a book of reminiscences of some of the first settlers in Beadle County, South Dakota which he entitled: The Old Timers. A social history of the way of life of the home-steading pioneers in the prairie states during the first few years of settlement, as shown by a typical community, the 'old-timers' of Beadle County in South Dakota.Carr, J. L. (1957). The Old Timers. Huron, South Dakota: mimeographed. The book consists of reminiscences of the men and women who established settlements on the land around Huron in South Dakota from the 1880s onwards, or descriptions of those pioneers given by people who knew them. Carr recorded in an interview in 1991 how he found the notes left by speakers at a defunct historical society that he had attended during his first visit in 1938. The notes and verbatim records of the County Historical Society meetings had been kept by Sherman Davis, Dr Ketelle and Mrs J. P. Walsh and these formed the basis of Carr's book. The Old Timers describes with small line drawings by Carr how people lived: how they built houses, wells and cyclone shelters; the domestic implements they used such as table lamps, coffee grinders and hand irons; the weather and terrible winters they endured; the children and how they were taught, played and dressed; and the machinery used on the farm such as ploughs and a stone-boat for hauling large rocks. Carr wanted to record the lives of the homesteading pioneers of the prairie before it was all forgotten. The credit for the book states: \\"Written in Huron, State of South Dakota, by J.L.

Carr reported that he printed 82 copies and paid $18 to have them bound. He gave 40 copies to people who had lent furniture to his family during their stay in Huron and sold the remainder at $2 each to university departments and public libraries. According to the South Dakota Libraries Network copies can be found in the library of South Dakota State University; Augustana College; Northwestern State University; South Dakota State Library; Rapid City Public Library; Brookings Public Library; and the Siouxland Public Library. There is also a copy in the Morgan Library & Museum, New York City. There is no copy listed in Copac, the catalogue of UK copyright and university libraries. Carr was obviously proud of his work because it is listed as one of his publications in the first editions of his novels A Season in Sinji, The Harpole Report, How Steeple Sinderby Wanderers Won the F.A. Cup (as The Dakota Old-Timers) and in all his novels published by The Quince Tree Press, his own publishing house, where it is dated 1956 and listed as The Old Timers of Beadle County or similar. \\"Why did I write it?\\" Carr wrote in his introduction to the book: \\"Because it needed to be written; because the tremendous qualities of these pioneering men and women needed to be shown to our generation; because, to a historian, this prairie country is virgin soil ready for the plough; because it has been great fun talking to many, many people, and very exciting to unearth things worn by the use of a past generation; because it gave me a reason to traipse around the prairie and to admire the great sweep of land and the sky\\".

Apart from the music, there is a medicinal recipe and other scribblings. At least two different hands can be discerned. As of 2001, the manuscript was in a private collection in England. The authors The first owner of the book was Priscilla Bunbury (1615‚Äì1682), daughter of Sir Henry Bunbury of Little Stanney in Cheshire and his second wife Martha. The second owner was also a Priscilla Bunbury (c. 1675 ‚Äì after 1707), daughter of Sir Thomas Bunbury, a grandson of Sir Henry and his first wife, and goddaughter of the first Priscilla.

He was one of the earliest astronomers in the Islamic world to suggest the possibility of the Earth's movement prior to the spread of the Copernican theory. He is considered one of the main co-founders of Isfahan School of Islamic Philosophy. In later years he became one of the teachers of Mulla Sadra.Encyclop√¶dia Iranica. MOLLƒÄ ·π¢ADRƒÄ ≈†IRƒÄZI. He wrote over 100 treatises and books in different topics, in Arabic and Persian. A number of architectural and engineering designs are attributed to him, but none can be substantiated with sources.

He is buried in Imam Reza's shrine in Mashad in Iran. Biography Shaykh Baha' al-Din (also spelled Baha'uddin) Muhammad ibn Husayn al-'Amili was born near Baalbek, in Ottoman Syria (present-day Lebanon) in 1547. After the execution of al-Shahid al-Tani in 1558, his father's mentor, he and his family moved to the neighboring Safavid Empire; first to Isfahan, and from there to Qazvin, the then Iranian royal capital. At the time, the Safavid realm was ruled by king Tahmasp I (r. 1524-1576). Tahmasp I appointed Shaykh BahƒÅ æƒ´'s father to serve as Shaykh al-IslƒÅm in several important Safavid cities in order to propagate Twelver Shi'ism amongst the population. Shaykh BahƒÅ æƒ´ completed his studies in Isfahan. Having intended to travel to Mecca in 1570, he visited many Islamic countries including Iraq, Syria and Egypt and after spending four years there, he returned to Iran. Shaykh Baha' al-Din died in 1621 in Isfahan. His body was buried in Mashhad according to his will. Exact dates of birth and death The exact dates of his birth and death are different on his grave stone and on the ceramic of the walls of the room where he is buried in. Date of birth: *On the ceramics of the wall: 27 February 1547 *On the grave stone: March 1546 Date of death: *On the ceramics of the wall: 30 August 1621 *On the grave stone: August 1622 The dates on the wall contain day, month and year, while the dates on the grave stone only contain month and year. The ceramics of the wall are made in 1945. It seems that at that time a research is performed about the exact dates, and, therefore, the information about the day is added to the dates. Pen name According to Bah√° º√≠ Faith scholar ‚ÄòAbdu‚Äôl-Ham√≠d Ishr√°q-Kh√°vari, Shaykh Baha' al-Din adopted the pen name (takhallus) 'Baha' after being inspired by words of Shi'a Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (the fifth Imam) and Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (the sixth Imam), who had stated that the Greatest Name of God was included in either Du'ay-i-Sahar or Du'ay-i-Umm-i-Davud. In the first verse of the Du'ay-i-Sahar, a dawn prayer for the Ramadan, the name \\"Bah√°\\" appears four times: \\"Allahumma inni as 'aluka min Bah√°' ika bi Abh√°h va kulla Bah√°' ika Bah√≠\\". Astronomy and mathematics His interest in the sciences is also apparent by some of his works and treaties, although many of his astronomical treatises are yet to be studied. He probably have written 17 tracts and books on astronomy and related subjects. The following are some his works in astronomy: * RisƒÅlah dar ·∏•all‚Äêi ishkƒÅl‚Äêi  øu·π≠ƒÅrid wa qamar (Treatise on the problems of the Moon and Mercury), on attempting to solve inconsistencies of the Ptolemaic system within the context of Islamic astronomy. * Tashrƒ´·∏• al‚ÄêaflƒÅk (Anatomy of the celestial spheres), a summary of theoretical astronomy where he affirms the view that supports the positional rotation of the Earth. He was one of Islamic astronomers to advocate the feasibility of the Earth's rotation in the 16th century, independent of Western influences. * Kholasat al-Hesab (The summa of arithmetic) was translated into German by G. H. F. Nesselmann and was published as early as 1843.  Architecture  Shaykh Baha' al-Din's fame was due to his excellent command of mathematics, architecture and geometry. A number or architectural and engineering designs are attributed to him, but none can be substantiated with sources. Shaykh Baha' al-Din is also attributed with architectural planning of the city of Isfahan during the Safavid era. He was the architect of Isfahan's Imam Square, Imam Mosque and Hessar Najaf. He also made a sun clock to the west of the Imam Mosque. There is also no doubt about his mastery of topography. The best instance of this is the directing of the water of the Zayandeh River to different areas of Isfahan. He designed a canal called Zarrin Kamar in Isfahan which is one of Iran's greatest canals. He also determined the direction of Qiblah (prayer direction) from the Naghsh-e-Jahan Square. He also designed and constructed a furnace for a public bathroom, which still exists in Isfahan, known as Sheikh Bahaei's bathroom. It is said that the furnace was warmed by a single candle, which was placed in an enclosure; and that the candle burned for a long time, warming the bath's water. It is also said that according to his own instructions, the candle's fire would be put out if the enclosure was ever opened. It is believed that this happened during the restoration and repair of the building and it was not possible to make the system work again. In fact, Sheikh Bahaei used the flammable gases that were naturally produced in a nearby cesspool for heating the bath's water. Recently in 1969-70 the bathroom heating system was excavated and some series of underground pipe lines made of sun dried clay were discovered. Even though there are many theories about the working of this heating system, it was concluded recently that he knew about biogas and the network was to guide toilet wells which were common to Iranian's houses and mosques. It is said that he also designed the Manar Jonban (shaking minaret), which still exists in Isfahan; but this edifice was built in the fourteenth century during the Il-khanid period on the tomb of Amu Abdollah, a pious sheikh who died in that century. The High Council of Cultural Revolution in Iran designated April 23 as the National Architect Day, marking the birth anniversary of Sheikh Bahaei. Imami Jurisprudence In the Twelver tradition, Shaykh Bahai is regarded as a leading scholar of his age and a mujaddid of the seventeenth century.Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, BAHƒÄ æ-AL-Dƒ™N  øƒÄMELƒ™, SHAIKH MO·∏§AMMAD B. ·∏§OSAYN BAHƒÄ æƒ™ by E. Kohlberg. His erudition won him the admiration of Shah Abbas, and he was appointed the Sheikh ul-Islam of Isfahan after the death of the previous incumbent. He composed works on tafsir, hadith, grammar and fiqh (jurisprudence). Mysticism Shaykh Baha' al-Din was also an adept of mysticism. He had a distinct Sufi leaning for which he was criticized by Mohammad Baqer Majlesi. During his travels he dressed like a Dervish and frequented Sufi circles. He also appears in the chain of both the Nurbakhshi and Ni'matullƒÅhƒ´ Sufi orders. In the work called \\"ResƒÅla fi‚Äôl-wa·∏•da al-woj≈´dƒ´ya\\" (Exposition of the concept of Wahdat al-Wujud (Unity of Existences), he states that the Sufis are the true believers, calls for an unbiased assessment of their utterances, and refers to his own mystical experiences. His Persian poetry is also replete with mystical allusions and symbols. At the same time, Shaykh Baha' al-Din calls for strict adherence to the Sharia as a prerequisite for embarking on the Tariqah and did not hold a high view of antinomian mysticism. Works A manuscript by Shaykh Bahai Shaykh Baha' al-Din contributed numerous works in philosophy, logic, astronomy and mathematics. His works include over 100 articles, epistles and books. Shaykh Baha' al-Din also composed poems in Persian. His outstanding works in the Persian language are JƒÅmi‚Äô-i AbbƒÅsƒ´ and two masnavis (rhymed couplets) by the names of Shƒ´r u Shakar (\\"Milk and Sugar\\") and NƒÅn u HalwƒÅ (\\"Bread and Halva\\"). His other important work is the Kashk≈´l, which includes stories, news, scientific topics, Persian and Arabic proverbs. His also wrote KhulƒÅ·π£at al‚Äê·∏•isƒÅb (, lit. \\"Essentials of arithmetic\\"), an Arabic textbook that became popular throughout the Islamic world from Egypt to India until the 19th century. It was translated into German in Berlin by G. H. F. Nesselmann and published in 1843. A French translation appeared later 1854.

He is most prominent within the Lancelot-Grail prose cycle where he is a noble enemy turned an ally of King Arthur as well as an inseparable friend of Arthur's champion Lancelot. The figure of Galehaut should not be mistaken with Lancelot's son, Galahad (which is also Lancelot's own birth name), and some other similarly named characters. In the legend Galehaut, lord of the Distant Isles (le sire des Isles Lointaines), appears for the first time in the Matter of Britain in the \\"Book of Galehaut\\" section of the early 13th- century Prose Lancelot Proper, the central work in the series of anonymous Old French prose romances collectively known as Lancelot-Grail (the Vulgate Cycle). An ambitious, towering figure of a man, he emerges from obscurity to challenge King Arthur for possession of Arthur's realm of Logres. Though unknown to Arthur and his court, Galehaut has already conquered lands and acquired considerable power, loyal followers, and a reputation for being a noble character. The Vulgate Cycle and the Prose Tristan describe him as \\"the son of the Fair Giantess\\" (fils de la Bele Jaiande), given the name Bagotta in La Tavola Ritonda, and the evil human lord Brunor, both of whom are later killed by Tristan who takes over their castle. Galehaut also has a sister, named Delice in the Prose Tristan and Riccarda in the Italian version I Due Tristani. 'Lacelot', 'Gallehault', and Guinevere: \\"How the first acquaintance was made with Galhault by the Lady of Logres.\\" alt= In the ensuing war, it becomes clear that Galehaut's army is going to win against Arthur's. However, Galehaut is so awed by the battlefield prowess of one of Arthur's knights, the mysterious Black Knight, that for his sake he renounces a certain victory and surrenders to Arthur. The knight, who turns out to be the young Lancelot, gratefully accepts Galehaut's companionship. What follows is a tale of love, interpreted by some as friendship and some as homosexuality, in which Galehaut figures as the central character as he becomes the tragic hero in the story. Galehaut, just as he has surrendered to Arthur, gives way before Guinevere, yielding Lancelot to her. He also joins Arthur's Knights of the Round Table, and later gives refuge to Lancelot and Guinevere in his land of Sorelois during the False Guinevere episode. He ultimately dies by longing for Lancelot, having been separated with him (Lancelot was first kidnapped by Morgan le Fay and then went mad and disappeared) and after receiving false news of his death. Lancelot, at the end of his own life, is buried next to Galehaut at his castle of Joyous Gard in the tomb that he had built to consecrate and eternalise their companionship. Long after his death, Galehaut continues to be commonly recalled as an exemplar of greatness. Since the early 13th century, there have been numerous retellings of the life, loves and chivalry of Lancelot's career and the story of his adulterous liaison with Queen Guinevere has always been part of every significant account of King Arthur. The second, overlapping love story, however, the one related in the Prose Lancelot, in which Galehaut sacrifices his power, his happiness, and ultimately his life for the sake of Lancelot, has been largely forgotten. The character himself reappears in a number of Arthurian tales, in several different languages, but without the same significance. The best known retelling in English, the 15th-century Le Morte d'Arthur of Thomas Malory, reduced him to just a relatively villainous minor \\"frenemy\\" of Lancelot's, leaving Guinevere without a rival for Lancelot's affections, besides also relating a part of the Tristan side of the story in the part \\"The Book of Sir Tristrams de Lyons\\". In Italian romance Tristano Riccardiano, Galehaut dies of his wound following a duel with Tristan in an attempt to avenge the slaying of his parents, forgiving him in the end. One of closest companions of Lancelot in Malory's telling, including during Lancelot's war against Arthur and later joining him in the hermitage at the end of his life, is instead the similarly Knight of the Round Table named Galahodin (Galihod[i/y]n, Galyhod[i/y]n). Also known in other texts as Galehodin (Galaodin, Galeh[a/o]udin), he is Galehaut's nephew and successor as the king of Sorelois introduced in the Prose Lancelot. In the Tavola Ritonda, Galehaut's heir is his son named Abastubagio, a character partially corresponding with Galehodin (both appearing in their respective texts in the role of the host of tournament in Sorelois). Of note, Malory's Galahodin should not be further confused with Lancelot's relatives and companions (including together with Galahodin as Lancelot's fellow monks at the end) named Galyhod (Galyhud) and Gahalantyne, two original characters from Le Morte d'Arthur. After taking over the lands in France, Malory's Lancelot appoints Galahodin as the duke Saintonge and makes Galyhod and Gahalantyne the earl of P√©rigord and the duke of Auvergne. Legacy As Dante says in the fifth canto of Inferno, Galehaut was the book that Paolo and Francesca had been reading, when they yield to their love. Dante mentions Galehaut [Inf. V, 137] as both the book itself and the author of it, intermediary between Lancelot and the Queen. And Boccaccio, moved by the great lord's generosity, uses his name as the subtitle of his Decameron (\\"Il Principe Galeotto\\"). In Spanish, galeoto is still an archaic word for a pimp.galeoto in the Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa√±ola, 22nd edition. Compare to the role of Pandarus in English culture. Subsequent novels, plays, poems, and films have accepted that simplification of the tale. Indeed, so obscure has Galehaut become that modern readers sometimes mistake the name for a mere variant of Galahad. Galahad is the \\"pure\\", the \\"chosen\\" knight who achieves the quest for the Holy Grail in a part of the Arthurian legend quite distinct from the story in which Galehaut appears. There is no connection between the two figures.

Edison, Incorporated (originally the National Phonograph Company) was the main holding company for the various manufacturing companies established by the inventor and entrepreneur Thomas Edison. It was a successor to Edison Manufacturing Company and operated between 1911 and 1957, when it merged with McGraw Electric to form McGraw-Edison. History Little Mischief, 1899 The National Phonograph Company was incorporated on 27 January 1896. It was restructured and reincorporated as Thomas A. Edison, Inc. on 28 February 1911. Edison Manufacturing Company also became a division of Thomas A. Edison, Inc. at this time. The company had an industrial research laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey where up to 200 people were employed in the \\"rapid and cheap development of inventions.\\" Frank L. Dyer was president until December 1912, when Thomas Edison took over the position himself. C.H. Wilson, general manager, was also vice president from 1912. Edison resigned as president in August 1926 in favor of his son, Charles Edison, and became chairman of the board. The company had divisions handling different products such as phonographs, Ediphone, and storage batteries. One of the first products were Blue Amberol cylinders and the Amberola player, an early sound recording medium and player. This was followed by the Edison Diamond Disc. In 1915 the soprano Anna Case and contralto Christine Miller showed in a tone test at the West Orange lab that there was no difference between their live voices and Diamond Disc recordings of their voices. Other Edison companies were absorbed in the years that followed, including Edison Phonograph Works (28 August 1924), Edison Storage Battery Company (30 June 1932) and Emark Battery Corporation (30 December 1933). Charles Edison, president of the company 1927‚Äì57 In the 1920s the recording company began to lag in technical innovation, and also failed to attract recording stars of the same quality as its rivals Victor and Columbia. An attempt to market a long playing record in 1926 did not succeed, and the company did not begin recording electrically (with condenser microphones) until mid-1927, two years after the rest of the industry had adopted the process. In 1928 the company finally moved into radio with the purchase of the Splitdorf Radio Corp. On 1 November 1929 Edison halted production of records apart from dictation records made by the Voicewriter division. In the late 1920s the \\"Edicraft\\" line of high-quality consumer appliances was developed at the laboratory and manufactured by Thomas A. Edison, Inc. Production of appliances was discontinued in 1934 due to lack of demand for luxury goods during the Great Depression. Merger Max McGraw, founder and president of McGraw Electric, had always been an admirer of Thomas Alva Edison, and had his picture hanging in his office. In 1956 he arranged a meeting with his son Charles Edison, former Governor of New Jersey and Secretary of the Navy, to discuss merging their two companies. They spent a few days at the Broadmoor resort in Colorado Springs, Colorado and came to an agreement. The merger was effective 2 January 1957. The combined company was named the McGraw-Edison Company. Max McGraw would joke after the merger that his name now appeared before Edison's on the New York Stock Exchange.

Aogashima is also within the boundaries of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. Geology Aogashima is a complex Quaternary volcanic island 3.5 km in length with a maximum width of 2.5 km, formed by the overlapping remnants of at least four submarine calderas. The island is surrounded by very steep rugged cliffs of layered volcanic deposits. The southern coast also rises to a sharp ridge forming one edge of a caldera named with a diameter of 1.5 km. The caldera dominates the island, with one point on its southern ridge, with a height of , as the island's highest point. The caldera is occupied by a secondary cone named .

An earthquake swarm in July 1780 was followed by steam rising from the lakes in the Ikenosawa Caldera. Further earthquakes in May 1781 led to an eruption.

Series 1 was made by RDF Television for CBBC and was filmed in Brazil, while series 2 onwards were produced by Foundation/Freehand for CBBC and ABC Television and were filmed in Australia. The show has been presented by 3 different sets of presenters; Caroline Flack and Reggie Yates (series 1), JK and Joel (series 2‚Äì3) and Myleen Klass and Johny Pitts (series 4‚Äì5). The show ran for five series across four years before being cancelled in 2011 following the end of BBC's and ABC's partnership. Format A number of adventurers, aged 11‚Äì14 and from either the UK or Australia, are brought to a mythical island called 'Scorpion Island', a tropical and exotic island that appears to have a mind of its own. Once on the island the adventurers are divided into two teams, usually either 'Team Sting' or 'Team Claw', though series 3 featured a third team called 'Team Venom', and for the first half of series 5 the teams were boys vs girls. The number of adventures on each team are usually fixed, though a team may lose, gain and swap members as the show goes on, depending on the series. The ultimate goal of each series for each team is to escape the island, so along the way the teams compete in various challenges to better their chances of escaping the island. Whoever wins the final challenge escapes the island while the losing team(s) are left behind. The show has been filmed in a variety of different locations and each series introduces different challenges and storylines. The challenges were usually a mix of both metal challenges and main physical challenges, and the challenges are done in either small teams or individually. Sometimes a team who is successful in the first challenge gets an advantage in the following challenge, such as a time bonus. Examples of the challenges faced throughout are: * Transporting certain objects from one area to another while suspended in the air on wires * Climbing/abseiling down a rock or cliff-face * Completing a large jigsaw puzzle * Collecting objects/running down an assault course * Driving an off- road buggy around a track * Swimming down a river or area of water while collecting objects * Filling a funnel with water so the object floats to the top * Assembling a raft and then paddling * Throwing an object at a target to score the most * Pulling objects up a hill with ropes * Various mental and arithmetic puzzles The final escape consisted of bigger, more tougher challenges done in multiple stages where everyone on each team is involved, and whoever wins each stage would get an advantage in the following stage and so on until the final round where the winning team escape the island.

She was the name ship of the Carlisle group of the C-class of cruisers. Carlisle was credited with shooting down eleven Axis aircraft during the Second World War and was the top scoring anti-aircraft ship in the Royal Navy.Navweapons British 4\\"/45 (10.2 cm) QF HA Marks XVI, XVII, XVIII and XXI Construction and early years She was laid down by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in 1917 and launched on 9 July 1918. She was completed with a hangar positioned under the bridge and she was to carry aircraft. This was never carried out and the hangar was later removed. Carlisle was commissioned too late to see action in the First World War. In 1919 Carlisle joined the 5th Light Cruiser Squadron at Harwich. During March 1919 she left Harwich in company with the squadron and took up station in China. On the evening of 3 March 1921, the Singaporean passenger ship ran aground on the White Rocks off Lamock Island, Swatow, China and was wrecked with the loss of an estimated 900 to 1,000 lives. The steamer discovered the wreck on the morning of 4 March and rendered assistance, rescuing 45 survivors before steaming to Swatow to seek additional help for Hong Moh. Upon receiving word of the disaster, the British consul at Swatow informed the British Senior Naval Officer at Hong Kong, who in turn broadcast a wireless message requesting ships to come to Hong Moh‚Ä≤s aid. The Royal Navy sloop arrived on the scene late on 5 March but was unable to locate the wreck in the darkness. Carlisle joined Foxglove on the scene at dawn on 6 March and the two ships located Hong Moh and began to rescue additional survivors, with Foxglove taking 28 survivors on board before having to depart late in the afternoon to refuel. Carlisle continued to work throughout the night of 6/7 March using searchlights and through the daylight hours of 7 March. Carlisle‚Ä≤s commanding officer, Edward Evans, swam over to the wreck at around 20:00 on 7 March to help the last few survivors get aboard the ship‚Ä≤s boats. Carlisle finally ceased rescue operations at 23:00 on 7 March. At dawn on 8 March, Carlisle‚Ä≤s boats approached the wreck of Hong Moh but found no further signs of life and Carlisle departed for Hong Kong with 221 survivors aboard. Among the officers and ratings of Carlisle, Evans, along with Lieutenant-Commander Ion Tower and Gunner John G. Dewar, were awarded the Board of Trade Silver Medal for Gallantry in Saving Life at Sea, while Leading Seaman W. G. Eldrett and Able Seaman A. E. Whitehead received the award in Bronze.Maritime Connector: Passenger Ship Incidents Carlisle was refitted between 1921 and 1929 and went on to serve on the Africa Station with the 6th Cruiser Squadron. In February 1930, Carlisle was docked in the Selborne dry dock at Simon's Town, South Africa prior to becoming a unit of the 2nd cruiser squadron Atlantic (Home Fleet). On 16 March 1937 she was relieved by the cruiser and returned to the United Kingdom to be reduced to the reserve. In June 1939 Carlisle started a conversion to an anti-aircraft cruiser, with eight 4-inch (102-mm) QF MK16 and 1 quadruple 2-pounder Pom-Poms being fitted. This conversion was completed in January 1940; Carlisle was fitted with radar during her conversion and introduced the Type 280 combined air warning and gunnery radar into the Royal Navy; she thus became the first naval vessel to be equipped with an anti- aircraft fire control radar system.Howse, Radar at Sea, p43 Early war service She then spent a brief period with the Home Fleet, in which she participated in Allied operations against the German invasion of Norway. She was employed on escort duties of a troop convoy consisting of the 148th Infantry Brigade which went ashore at √Öndalsnes; with this the German position in Trondheim was threatened from the north and south (Operation Sickle). Later that month, the sloop was mistaken for a cruiser and was badly damaged by German Ju 88s and had to be sunk by HMS Janus. In August Carlisle was serving in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden area when she assisted in the evacuation of British troops, civilians and the sick from Berbera in British Somaliland to Aden before Berbera was occupied by Italian troops. Mediterranean She returned to the Eastern Fleet in August 1940; like most of her sisters, she was then assigned to the Mediterranean Sea, departing the Far East in March 1941. Once in the Mediterranean, she was used to escort convoys as an A/A vessel of the 15th Cruiser Squadron for convoys from Alexandria to Greece (Operation Lustre). She became involved in Battle of Cape Matapan, as well as the first and second battles of Sirte. She was also involved in the naval attack during the Battle of Crete in 1941 and was hit and damaged by aircraft on 22 May whilst attacking an enemy convoy. A direct hit killed her commanding officer, Capt. Thomas Cloud Hampton, RN. The destroyer went alongside to give assistance, whilst Carlisle continued to engage the enemy. She went on to rescue the survivors of the SS Thistlegorm after the ship was sunk in an air attack on 5 October 1941. By December, the cruiser was back performing convoy duties between Alexandria and Malta, she was sent to support the commissioned auxiliary supply ship HMS Breconshire. Damage and reclassification In July 1943, she provided escort for the support force for the Allied invasion of Sicily. In September‚ÄìOctober, during the German counter-attack in the Aegean Sea, Carlisle made a sortie into the area south of Piraeus with the destroyers and HMS Rockwood to intercept German convoys in the Scarpanto Strait. On 9 October 1943, they were spotted by German Ju 87 dive bombers from I. StG 3 from the Megara air base which succeeded in sinking Panther at 12.05 and later on seriously damaged Carlisle. She was taken in tow to Alexandria by Rockwood. She was considered to be beyond economical repair as a warship and was converted to serve as a base ship in the harbour of Alexandria in March 1944. She was last listed as a hulk in 1948 after the war had ended, and was broken up in 1949. Carlisles badge can still be seen painted on the side of the Selborne dry dock wall at Simonstown, South Africa.

Based on Joseph Moncure March's 1928 narrative poem of the same name, it coincidentally made its debut off-Broadway during the same theatre season (1999‚Äì2000) as a Broadway production with the same name and source material. Synopsis Act I It‚Äôs the roaring 1920s and the beautiful, young Queenie, although she tries, cannot find a lover able to satisfy her desires ‚Äì until she meets Burrs, a vaudevillian clown with a voracious appetite for women. Both Queenie and Burrs have now met their emotional and sexual match (\\"Queenie Was a Blonde\\"). For a while, they live together happily sated. However, the relationship eventually sours. Burrs' violent nature, which once thrilled Queenie, now scares her (\\"The Apartment\\"). Still, she longs to generate the same excitement that brought them together. She suggests a party, and Burrs agrees (\\"Out of the Blue\\"). The party begins with a parade of guests: Madelaine the lesbian, Eddie the thug, Mae the dimwit, Jackie the dancer, lover-brothers d'Armano, Dolores the hooker, and Nadine the minor (\\"What a Party\\"). Although Queenie radiates beauty and confidence, Burrs preys on other women. He makes his move on their youngest guest, Nadine. Despite her casual reprimand of his behavior, Queenie wants to hurt Burrs in return (\\"Raise the Roof\\"). The vivacious Kate arrives with her new friend, Mr. Black (\\"Look at Me Now\\"). Queenie, quite taken by Black, plans to make her move on him. Kate drags him away to meet the other guests. Queenie‚Äôs plans are momentarily undermined (\\"He Was Calm\\"). The party's revelry continues: Burrs hits on Kate; Madelaine hits on Nadine, Eddie chugs beer and almost fights with Burrs. During the chaos, Black finds himself equally as taken by Queenie as she with him - much to the chagrin of Kate (\\"Poor Child\\"). As revenge, Kate plans on seducing Burrs. Meanwhile, in a corner of the room, Madelaine is in a drunken stupor and on the prowl for a woman with very little success (\\"An Old- Fashioned Love Story\\"). Although Queenie is fully aware that Burrs will threaten her physically, she makes her move on Mr. Black, easily getting him to dance with her (\\"By Now the Room Was Moving\\"). Burrs watches them, his ire rising. Unsuccessfully, Kate tries to get Burrs to dance ‚Äì then to defuse the situation, Kate takes Queenie out of Mr. Black‚Äôs arms and dances with her instead. Burrs' violent reaction against Mr. Black and Queenie is prohibited by the whole company dancing the Juggernaut (\\"The Juggernaut\\"). At its end, Mr. Black and Queenie are together again. To get the reaction he wants from Queenie, Burrs grabs Nadine, the minor, and makes out with her. This enrages Kate who throws Nadine to the ground by her hair. Madelaine rushes to aid Nadine. Burrs cuts into Mr. Black and Queenie‚Äôs dancing. Managing to have her to himself, Burrs tells Queenie to stay away from Mr. Black. Laughing at him, Queenie says she will do whatever she chooses. He twists her arm. They are interrupted by Oscar and Phil at the piano (\\"Intro to 'Wild, Wild Party'\\"). Burrs releases Queenie, seeing that too many people are watching. Burrs and Queenie join Oscar and Phil's epic musical number based on the story of Adams and Eve ‚Äì Burrs plays Adam and Queenie, Eve (\\"A Wild, Wild Party\\"). Their number is interrupted by a discontented neighbor. Eddie and Mae yell insults to the man and the crowd goes wild. The two celebrate their togetherness (\\"Two of a Kind\\"). Suddenly, Mr. Black approaches Queenie and pointedly asks why she stays with an abusive brute (\\"Of All the Luck\\"). She reflects on her situation and comes to the conclusion that, perhaps, she has just learned to like the aggressive treatment (\\"Maybe I Like It This Way\\"). Elsewhere, Kate is attempting to seduce Burrs. He refuses her advances and expresses his deepest, darkest feelings for Queenie - she is driving him crazy (\\"What Is It About Her?\\"). Kate tries to kiss Burrs, but he pushes away. Black kisses Queenie. She embraces him. Act II The party rages on. Kate is alone and reflecting on her youthful indulgence (\\"The Life of the Party\\"). Alone in the bathroom, Queenie is taking stock in her predicament. Although she's angry that she has confided in Black, a virtual stranger, she recognizes his goodness (\\"Who Is This Man?\\"). This both stirs and confuses her feelings. Black enters the bathroom with a drink. The two share a moment as Black conveys his admiration for Queenie (\\"I'll Be Here\\"). Suddenly, Burrs comes in seeking Queenie's attention. He apologises for his behavior and asks her forgiveness. Before she can respond, Kate arrives. She unsuccessfully tries to draw Burrs back onto the dance floor. Both men pull for her affections and devotion‚ÄîMr. Black asks Queenie to leave the apartment with him. Burrs asks her to stop the party and let them return to their isolation. Queenie is unable to respond to either man (\\"Listen to Me\\"). Frustrated and hurt, Burrs lashes out by physically threatening her. His outburst causes Queenie to leave the bathroom and Black quickly follows. It is clear that Burrs is quickly becoming desperate and depressed (\\"Let Me Drown\\"). Soon after, he begins to hallucinate and hear Queenie's voice in his head. Thinking Mae is Queenie, he mistakenly attacks her and angers Eddie. A fight ensues (\\"The Fight\\"). Mr. Black and Queenie return to find Eddie viciously beating Burrs. Queenie is afraid that Burrs will be killed if it is not stopped. Out of concern, Black rushes in and knocks Eddie unconscious with a chair. Mae tends to Eddie and Kate comes to the aid of a passed out Burrs. Realizing all of the trouble he is causing, Mr. Black tells Queenie that he will leave. Queenie, however, cannot let him go and leads him into the bedroom (\\"Tell Me Something\\"). In a moment of passion, the two begin making love. The party guests follow suit in the living room (\\"Come With Me\\"). Early the next morning, the revelers lie asleep in the living room and Jackie dances for the last time before he departs (\\"Jackie's Last Dance\\"). Kate wakes Burrs who is beside her. Queenie is strikingly absent. Burrs, fearing the worst, staggers to the bedroom to find her in the bed with Black. When the two lovers wake, Queenie recoils in shock; Black jumps up and attempts to tackle Burrs but fails. Burrs moves to the dresser and locates a gun. Full of rage, he vacillates between trying to force Queenie to make a choice between the two men, and threatening to kill Black, Queenie, or himself, claiming that when one of them dies, whoever it is, it will satisfy him (\\"Make Me Happy\\"). Black, who realizes that Burrs is about to make a decision, takes the chance and lunges at Burrs. The gun goes off. Burrs is dead. Fearing that Mr. Black will now be executed for the death, Queenie urges him to flee. Before leaving, Black professes his love for her (\\"Poor Child [Reprise]\\"). Queenie, now having lost both men, questions how things managed to reach that point of loss. She exits the apartment - with her coat - all eyes upon her sad, beautiful grace (\\"How Did We Come to This?\\").

In Lippa's version, the plot is tightly focused on the central love triangle of Joseph Moncure March's original poem, and the cast is much smaller. Many of the characters in LaChiusa's version do not appear in Lippa's version at all, or have much smaller roles (notably Dolores, who in LaChiusa's version was a major supporting role originated by Eartha Kitt). There are major differences in the music and tone of the two shows as well. Lippa's songs are not wholly dependent on the plot of the show and can be understood (arguably better than LaChiusa's) out of context. Comparatively, the LaChiusa score is tightly interwoven with the plot of the show. Stylistically, LaChiusa mimics the jazz of the era while Lippa uses a deliberately anachronistic pop-rock sound, complete with electric guitars.

In the simplest case, there is no preferential direction for an object's magnetic moment. It will respond to an applied magnetic field in the same way, regardless of which direction the field is applied. This is known as magnetic isotropy. In contrast, magnetically anisotropic materials will be easier or harder to magnetize depending on which way the object is rotated. For most magnetically anisotropic materials, there are two easiest directions to magnetize the material, which are a 180¬∞ rotation apart. The line parallel to these directions is called the easy axis. In other words, the easy axis is an energetically favorable direction of spontaneous magnetization. Because the two opposite directions along an easy axis are usually equivalently easy to magnetize along, and the actual direction of magnetization can just as easily settle into either direction, which is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Magnetic anisotropy is a prerequisite for hysteresis in ferromagnets: without it, a ferromagnet is superparamagnetic. Sources The observed magnetic anisotropy in an object can happen for several different reasons. Rather than having a single cause, the overall magnetic anisotropy of a given object is often explained by a combination of these different factors: ; Magnetocrystalline anisotropy: The atomic structure of a crystal introduces preferential directions for the magnetization. ; Shape anisotropy: When a particle is not perfectly spherical, the demagnetizing field will not be equal for all directions, creating one or more easy axes. ; Magnetoelastic anisotropy: Tension may alter magnetic behaviour, leading to magnetic anisotropy. ; Exchange anisotropy: Occurs when antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic materials interact. At the molecular level Magnetic anisotropy and NOE examples The magnetic anisotropy of a benzene ring (A), alkene (B), carbonyl (C), alkyne (D), and a more complex molecule (E) are shown in the figure. Each of these unsaturated functional groups (A-D) create a tiny magnetic field and hence some local anisotropic regions (shown as cones) in which the shielding effects and the chemical shifts are unusual. The bisazo compound (E) shows that the designated proton {H} can appear at different chemical shifts depending on the photoisomerization state of the azo groups. The trans isomer holds proton {H} far from the cone of the benzene ring thus the magnetic anisotropy is not present. While the cis form holds proton {H} in the vicinity of the cone, shields it and decreases its chemical shift. This phenomenon enables a new set of nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) interactions (shown in red) that come to existence in addition to the previously existing ones (shown in blue). Single-domain magnet Suppose that a ferromagnet is single-domain in the strictest sense: the magnetization is uniform and rotates in unison. If the magnetic moment is \\\\scriptstyle\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu} and the volume of the particle is \\\\scriptstyle V, the magnetization is \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathbf{M} = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}/V = M_s \\\\left(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma\\\\right), where \\\\scriptstyle M_s is the saturation magnetization and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\gamma are direction cosines (components of a unit vector) so \\\\scriptstyle \\\\alpha^2 + \\\\beta^2 + \\\\gamma^2 = 1. The energy associated with magnetic anisotropy can depend on the direction cosines in various ways, the most common of which are discussed below. Uniaxial A magnetic particle with uniaxial anisotropy has one easy axis. If the easy axis is in the z direction, the anisotropy energy can be expressed as one of the forms: :E = KV \\\\left(1 - \\\\gamma^2 \\\\right) = KV \\\\sin^2\\\\theta, where \\\\scriptstyle V is the volume, \\\\scriptstyle K the anisotropy constant, and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\theta the angle between the easy axis and the particle's magnetization. When shape anisotropy is explicitly considered, the symbol \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathcal{N} is often used to indicate the anisotropy constant, instead of \\\\scriptstyle K. In the widely used Stoner‚ÄìWohlfarth model, the anisotropy is uniaxial. Triaxial A magnetic particle with triaxial anisotropy still has a single easy axis, but it also has a hard axis (direction of maximum energy) and an intermediate axis (direction associated with a saddle point in the energy). The coordinates can be chosen so the energy has the form :E = K_aV\\\\alpha^2 + K_bV\\\\beta^2. If \\\\scriptstyle K_a > K_b > 0, the easy axis is the z direction, the intermediate axis is the y direction and the hard axis is the x direction. Cubic A magnetic particle with cubic anisotropy has three or four easy axes, depending on the anisotropy parameters. The energy has the form :E = KV \\\\left(\\\\alpha^2\\\\beta^2 + \\\\beta^2\\\\gamma^2 + \\\\gamma^2\\\\alpha^2\\\\right). If \\\\scriptstyle K > 0, the easy axes are the x, y, and z axes. If \\\\scriptstyle K < 0, there are four easy axes characterized by x = \\\\pm y = \\\\pm z.

Philips continued to improve and enlarge the tube plant in New York, but also used the Amperex name to distribute their new line of Dutch-made miniature tubes, (12AX7, 12AU7, 12AT7) to feed the booming U.S. hi-fi market. Classic hi-fi brands such as Marantz, Fisher, and H. H. Scott, Inc., used these tubes. Amperex also produced the 6DJ8, 6922 and 7308 frame grid tubes. Developed by Amperex in 1958 when transistors were beginning to supplant tubes and originally developed for video and radar use, the 6DJ8 also excelled in audio amplifiers needing its high transconductance, and it still has a niche market among audiophiles. A voltage regulator vacuum tube made by AmperexAmperex tubes were original equipment parts in many models of Tektronix and Hewlett- Packard test equipment. Although Amperex stopped making vacuum tubes long ago, hoards of new old stock (especially the original \\"Bugle Boy\\" series) are traded for profit, and other manufacturers produced compatible tubes more recently.  Hicksville, New York  Amperex facility in Hicksville, New York A new factory was constructed at 230 Duffy Avenue, Hicksville, New York, to manufacture electron tubes and semiconductors. Miniature receiving tubes, magnetrons, X-ray tubes, Geiger-Muller tubes, and large transmitting tubes were also manufactured at this location. This location became the headquarters for North American Philips (NAP). The factory was completed in 1953 and closed in 1989. All assets were then sold to Richardson Electronics of rural Lafox, near Batavia, Illinois. The Hicksville factory had a company-sponsored softball team that played at Eisenhower Park (then called Salisbury Park) in East Meadow, New York.  Slatersville, Rhode Island  Amperex facility in Slatersville, Rhode Island Amperex facility in Slatersville, Rhode Island North American Philips Corporation built a plant at 100 Providence Pike, North Smithfield, Rhode Island (Slatersville) on a plot in 1959. The 15-acre property is recorded by the Town of North Smithfield Tax Assessor as Lot No. 60 on Plat No. 4, and Lot No. 385 on Plat No. 5. There are five buildings located on the property. The property is bordered to the north by Industrial Drive; to the south by Comstock Road, to the east by a grassy area; and to the west by Providence Pike. The plant was operated by one of Philips' fully owned subsidiaries, Amperex Electronics, to supply IBM, one of Philips' largest customers, with high speed, gold-doped germanium logic diodes. Millions of these diodes were manufactured at the Slatersville plant every year. With the advent of silicon diodes in 1962 there was a decreasing demand for these germanium diodes, so Philips transferred their germanium Post Alloy Diffused Transistor (PADT) manufacturing to Slatersville to take advantage of the site's capacity. In 1960 Philips invented an imaging tube called the Plumbicon to replace the vidicon and Image Orthicon tubes used in studio television cameras. The technical advantages of this new tube allowed true color fidelity to be seen in television broadcasts for the first time. In 1967 the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences presented Philips with an Emmy Award for \\"Outstanding Achievement in Engineering Development\\" for the invention of the Plumbicon tube. The popularity of the Plumbicon tubes was so great that Amperex, built a second plant adjacent to the 1959 building on the Slatersville site to meet the demand. The new plant was , and at the time of construction employed the largest and cleanest clean room facilities in the world. The plant was officially opened in 1967 and is still making Plumbicon camera tubes today. Although the original use of Plumbicon camera tubes was in broadcast television, current demand is primarily in for use in medical imaging equipment. In 1973, several years after its acquisition by Amperex, the manufacturing operations of Advanced Micro Electronics were transferred to Slatersville. The products transferred from Advanced Micro Electronics included small signal silicon planar transistors for military and industrial applications, Leadless Inverted Devices (LIDs) and hybrid circuits using both thin and thick film technology. Manufacturing of these three products and the sales office for Philips Semiconductors were housed in Slatersville until 1992 when this business unit was sold. In 1998 Philips Components purchased, from English Electric Valve (EEV), the only other lead oxide camera tube business still in existence and so became the World's sole lead oxide camera tube manufacturer.  Cranston, Rhode Island  Amperex facility in Cranston, Rhode Island Amperex had a manufacturing facility at 99 Bald Hill Road, Cranston, Rhode Island, that manufactured monolithic integrated circuits . It was acquired by Micro Components Corporation, later renamed Cherry Semiconductor, moved to 1900 South County Trl, East Greenwich, RI. then sold to ON Semiconductor, a subsidiary of Motorola until 1999.  Other divisions  Ferroxcube, in Saugerties, New York, manufactured components for data processing equipment, namely, electromagnetic cores, memory planes, stacks of memory planes with controlled networks, shielding beads, threaded slugs, choke coils, filters, resistors, magnetic recording head assemblies, memory systems, Peltier batteries with or without control networks, capacitors, and magnetostrictive ferrites. Ferroxcube now belongs to Yageo Corporation. Amperex also operated a site in North Smithfield, RI . In the 1980s it was used for marketing, sales, QC and Engineering R&D; of their discrete semi- conductor business. Before any components were shipped to US based customers QC staff would run some or all pieces through EATON testing equipment. Engineers at customer sites would work with Amperex engineers to determine the best use and components for the customer needs.  Other products  GP-300_Matrix Printer For a brief time Amperex distributed a dot matrix printer, model GP-300.

Biography A son of John Anthony Notte and Eva Theresa (Rondina) Notte, he was born in Providence, Rhode Island. He was married to Marie J. Huerth in 1934. The couple had two children together. Notte graduated from the Boston University Law School in 1935. He went on to practice law and served as town solicitor in North Providence in 1937. During his undergraduate years, Notte joined Alpha Phi Delta. During World War II he served in the United States Navy and rose to the rank of lieutenant. Just after return to home he was elected Chairman of the Rhode Island Veterans' Bonus Board. From 1949 to 1950 he served as State Commander of the Rhode Island Department of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. He later served as a member of staff of Senator Theodore F. Green from 1948 to 1956, and as Chairman of the North Providence Democratic town committee. Notte resigned from Green's staff after he was elected Secretary of State, a post he held from 1957 to 1958. He was a delegate to the 1960 Democratic National Convention and became the 57th Lieutenant Governor of Rhode Island in 1959 and served until 1961 under Republican Christopher Del Sesto (Rhode Island Governor and his deputy are elected at the separate ballots). Governorship Notte was elected Governor in 1960, defeating Del Sesto, and held this post from January 3, 1961 to January 1, 1963 ‚Äì one single two-year term. Under his administration, a family court was established and Rhode Island held its first one-day, one-place Democratic and Republican primaries. He appointed Leonard Holland as state Adjutant General early in his term. Holland would lead the Rhode Island National Guard for the next 22 years. He was defeated for re-election by Republican John Chafee in the state's tightest gubernatorial race ever ‚Äì a margin of under 400 votes. His defeat was mainly caused by withdrawn support from labor unions (he was the first Democratic Governor running without labor support), because of his support for a state income tax. Later life After he left office, he returned to his law practice and sought Democratic nomination in the special election to the United States House of Representatives in 1967 and lost the primary. Governor Notte died in 1983 at the age of 73 and was buried in St. Francis Cemetery in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Legacy Governor Notte Park in North Providence is named after him.

The film is a modern retelling of the story of a virgin birth. It was entered into the 35th Berlin International Film Festival. All screenings in its initial theatrical distribution were accompanied by the short film The Book of Mary () by Godard's longtime companion and collaborator Anne-Marie Mi√©ville. Plot Marie, a student, works at her father's Swiss gas station and plays basketball for a local team; she claims to be a virgin and maintains a chaste relationship with her boyfriend Joseph, a taxi cab driver and college dropout. Joseph remains loyal to Marie even though she will not sleep with him, and another girl, Juliette, entreats him to be with her. When a passing stranger named Uncle Gabriel (who arrives by jet plane and is accompanied by a small girl who acts as his secretary) informs Marie that she will become pregnant despite remaining chaste, she is at first shocked and confused. For his part, Joseph cannot believe that Marie can be pregnant and a virgin, so he accuses her of sleeping around. Gabriel aggressively schools Joseph to accept Marie's pregnancy, while Marie comes to terms with God's plan through meditations that are sometimes angry and usually punctuated by elemental images of the sun, moon, clouds, flowers, and water. In a parallel narrative, Eva, a college student, gets involved with her professor, who theorizes that life on earth arose from a guided extraterrestrial intelligence. Unlike Marie, who does not allow Joseph to touch her sexually, Eva has an affair with her professor, who ultimately leaves her to go back east to his family, leaving her distraught. With Gabriel's help, Marie teaches Joseph to \\"touch\\" her without touching her. Joseph pledges to act as Marie's shadow, to which she responds, \\"But isn't that what all men are, the shadow of God?\\" Alone, Marie wrestles with and then gives herself over to the divine process of her pregnancy. Joseph and Marie are wed and she gives birth to a son. Together they raise the boy, who eventually leaves his family to pursue \\"his father's business.\\" In the end, Marie explores her sexuality, seeking to link her body and spirit.

The association‚Äôs mission is to provide leadership on rural health issues, which it attempts to carry out through education, communication, and advocacy. The NRHA membership is made up of a diverse collection of individuals and organizations, all of whom share the common bond of an interest in rural health. Many member organizations have specific facility designations such as critical access hospitals, rural health clinics, or community health centers. History In the mid to late 1970s, a small group of rural community health centers began to coalesce around the need for an independent association to make sure the rural-specific needs of the community health center movement was represented. In 1978, the National Rural Primary Care Association (NRPCA) was founded and based in Waterville, Maine The NRPCA would move its headquarters to Kansas City, Missouri in 1983, where it remains to this day. In the early 1980s two additional rural health associations were formed with similar desires to represent the rural-specific needs within their larger professional groups. The American Rural Health Association (ARHA) was formed in 1980 primarily made up of rural health researchers. The goal of the ARHA was to \\"become a definitive source of information on rural health.\\" In February 1981, the American Small and Rural Hospital Association (ASRHA) was formed. In 1984, the Board of the NRPCA changed the association's name to the National Rural Health Care Association (NRHCA). In doing so, the association moved past its mainly community health center roots and allowed other providers as segments of its membership. This change prepared the way for the NRHCA to eventually merge with both the ARHA and the ASRHA. These mergers took place in 1987 and 1986, respectively. These mergers led to a change of the name to the National Rural Health Association, a \\"new unified voice for rural health.\\" NRHA' roots in professional-specific rural organizations has led to a membership structure that contains specific constituency groups for different rural health interests. These associations within an association each have seats on the NRHA board of trustees and its policy setting body. Many also have their own conference or tracks within larger NRHA conferences.

World War II  During World War II, he was wanted by the Japanese forces because of the rebellions he led against them, mainly in Kudat during the Japanese occupation. But when they could not find him, they caught his younger brother and eventually killed him because his brother would not reveal where he was hiding. Albert Kwok invited Mustapha to join in the Jesselton Revolt but he advised Kwok to wait and prepare, saying the time wasn't right for insurrection. However, Kwok was forced to launch the revolt ahead of schedule because the Chinese were going to be subjected to conscription by the Japanese. Kwok was joined in the revolt along with Suluks and Bajaus under Panglima Ali. The revolt failed and the Japanese engaged in large scale massacres of indigenous civilians, including women and children especially from the Suluks community.  Political career   Appointment to Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Sabah  Mustapha founded the party United Sabah National Organisation, better known by the acronym USNO. He, together with Donald Stephens, are often credited as important figures in Sabah in bringing forth Sabah's independence and in the formation of Malaysia in 1963. When Malaysia was formed on 16 September 1963, he became the first Yang di-Pertua Negara (governor) of Sabah.  Appointment to chief minister of Sabah  In the 1967 state election, USNO won, and Mustapha became the third Chief Minister of Sabah. When he was Chief Minister, his relationship with the Malaysian central government was not very good. Although the central government, represented by the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, was a partner of USNO, they were worried about certain stances taken by Mustapha, in particular, his intention or threat to secede Sabah from Malaysia. Mustapha also refused to sign an oil agreement with the federal government which stated that only 5% of Sabah's oil revenue will be given to the state. Mustapha demanded at least 30% for the development of Sabah where it will be drilled. Mustapha also succeeded in converting a significant number of non-Muslim indigenous people in Sabah into Muslim.√Ösg√•rd, Bj√∂rn.\\"A Study of the Kadazan Dusun, Sabah, Malaysia\\" , Ethnic Awareness and Development, p. 28. Retrieved 8 March 2007. Aside from his involvement in politics and religion (Islam), he also made contributions in the education of Sabah. He mooted the idea of forming Sabah Foundation (Yayasan Sabah) and was responsible in setting up the first university, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) Sabah Campus, and also the setting up of ITM (Institut Teknologi Mara). He was also the Deputy Head of PERKIM, when the late Tunku was the President and also the time of Patinggi Taib. He was also the head of United Sabah Islamic Association (USIA) and a member of RISEAP. In 1975, USNO secretary-general Harris Salleh left the party to form BERJAYA. This party was backed up by the federal government thru the oil lobby.The Borneo Post Online In the 1976 state election, BERJAYA won and Mustapha was ousted from power.  Formation of Sabah chapter of UMNO  Since his ouster in 1976, Tun Mustapha had been trying to initiate a merger of his party USNO with peninsular-based United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) in a bid to return to the corridors of power in Sabah. However, the UMNO supreme council was hesitant on a merger because their party did not accept non-Malay/non-muslim members. Besides, the UMNO president at that time, Tun Hussein Onn was uneasy with Tun Mustapha's close relationship with UMNO's anti-Hussein faction. Mustapha remained active in politics, leading USNO and contesting in four subsequent state elections (1981, 1985, 1986, and 1990). Although they never won again, they still managed to win several seats in the state assembly. They also remained a partner of BN at the federal government level (as opposed to the state level).malaysiana1: About Datuk Seri Harris Salleh & Datuk Seri Musa Aman After the 1990 state election, he teamed up with Harris Salleh again, after BERJAYA themselves were ousted by Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS). This resulted in a merger of USNO and BERJAYA to create the Sabah chapter of UMNO. Mustapha became its first chief of UMNO Sabah.  Controversies   Arrests of Roman Catholic priests and the Islamisation of Sabah State  Mustapha is remembered by the Catholics of Sabah for imposing to the letter the immigration laws by denying foreign priests who have not obtained permanent residency on the extension of their visas. All the priests who object to their expulsion for doing religious works among the Catholics were arrested by using his powers as the Chairman of the State Security Operation Committee and CM of Sabah State Government. Under his orders, on 2 December 1972, the police made a raid at the missions at Tambunan, Papar, Bundu Tuhan and Kuala Penyu. The raids at Tambunan and Papar were successful, timed early in the morning with the church bell ropes cut to prevent it from being used to warn the people. The priests were at Kapayan long before the parishioners were aware of it. The raid at Kuala Penyu was initially a fiasco with a reception committee of 600 Catholics. To avoid clashes, by 11 am reinforcements were flown in to arrest one priest. On 15 December more priests were arrested at Keningau, Tenom and Limbahau.the book Khabar Gembira or \\"good news\\" - A history of the catholic church in East Malaysia and Brunei 1880 to 1976 by Fr John Rooney MHM Phd - 1981 Burns and Oates Ltd Wellwood North Farm rd, Turnbridge Wells Kent The rest of the priests who only had temporary residence permits, on hearing this has no choice but to say goodbye to their parishioners and went home or were given new assignments to nearby countries. As reported in local news such as Daily Express (p. 2, 11 November 2009), the Malaysian home ministry informed in parliament that a biography of Mustapha's political opponent who died in the Double Six Crash plane crash, Peter Mojuntin, is banned. The reason was that the book \\"allegedly\\" recorded that Peter exposed Mustapha's attempt to stop Catholism in Sabah by deporting and arresting foreign missionary priests who were serving their local parishes in the state.Daily Express News page 2, 11 November 2009 Peter's house was also surrounded by the police after all the priests were arrested because only he dared to voice his opposition to the prosecution of the priests. He was not arrested because of his strong political support from the Kadazan people of Penampang. Released online on 7 March 2013 courtesy of Chaos Computer Club Berlin. While the 20-point agreement had provided that ‚Äúthere should be no any state religion in North Borneo‚Äù, Mustapha party of USNO including himself is very active in propagating Islam and amend a bill to make Islam as the official religion of the state. He actively sponsored the creation of United Sabah Islamic Association (USIA) on 14 August 1969 which modelled from similar agencies that already existing in West Malaysia. He actively campaigned to persuade non-Muslims to convert to Islam due to what he perceive that the unity can only be achieved through a common religion and language, where he also make the Malay language as the official language of Sabah by limiting the importance of English language. By February 1974, around 75,000 non-Muslim Sabahans had been converted to Islam which rapidly increase to 95,000 in 1975.  Aiding the Moro rebels in the southern Philippines  During Mustapha term as a Chief Minister of Sabah, he had a vision to make Islam as the majority religion in the state. In order to achieve his aims, he was actively harbouring Muslim refugees from the Philippines especially those of similar ethnic background to himself. Mustapha was also believed to have aiding the Moro in their struggle for independence by providing arms and training facilities in Malaysia. His action were tolerated by the Malaysian government because he was consistent in delivering Muslim votes as well as for his continuous backing of the Malaysian government. He was later successful in making Islam the main religion of Sabah. However, as Malaysian government wanted to maintain good relations between Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with the Philippine central government, the Malaysian government could not raise the plight of Muslim minority in the Philippines. Due to this, Mustapha planned to secede the state of Sabah from Malaysia but his intention failed after he was removed from his position in 1975. The Philippine central government then retracted the Sabah claim in 1977 as a reward for Malaysian government action to stop supporting the southern Philippines Muslim rebels.  Death and legacy  Mustapha tomb in Putatan He died on 2 January 1995 at Sabah Medical Centre, Teluk Likas, Kota Kinabalu, at the age of 76. He was buried at the Muslim cemetery in Kampung Ulu/Ulu Seberang, Putatan, Penampang which was formerly used as a fortress by the late Paduka Mat Salleh and the State Government has named the cemetery \\"Taman Memorial Tun Datu Haji Mustapha\\". His memorial is not in Tambunan. The Tun Datu Mustapha Memorial in Tambunan is meant for the distant uncle, Paduka Mat Salleh. During the 8th Convocation Ceremony of UMS (Universiti Malaysia Sabah) held on 2‚Äì3 September 2006, he was conferred the Honorary Degree-Doctor of Philosophy (Social Development) The state government renamed the Sabah Foundation Building to Tun Mustapha Tower, as a token of appreciation for his contributions to the state.

He was the first man ever to ride a bicycle for one mile in less than a minute. He performed this feat in 1899 by drafting behind a Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) passenger car along the LIRR's Central Branch between Farmingdale and Babylon on Long Island. Biography He was born in October 1870 to Eliza G. and Martin J. Murphy. On May 27, 1891, he married Elizabeth E. \\"Libbie\\" Puhl in Brooklyn.Murphy in the 1880, 1900, and 1920 US census, the 1925 New York State Census, and Brooklyn marriage certificate #2046 After the death of the latter in 1922,Brooklyn Daily Eagle, September 1922 Murphy then married Catherine Kissel.Murphy in the 1930 US census Mile-a-Minute ride Murphy persuaded a railway company to board in two miles of track and run a train so he could ride a mile in a minute in its slipstream. It took him 57.8 seconds. He said in the Farmingdale Post that the idea came to him after an argument with friends at his home in Brooklyn, New York. \\"I was asked to give an opinion of the quality and relative speed of various prominent riders of the time\\", Murphy recalled. \\"My answer was that there is no limit to the speed of a bicycle rider, that speed depended largely upon the bicycle, gears, tracks and pacemaker. I declared there was not a locomotive built which could get away from me. The more people laughed, the more determined I became to accomplish the feat. I figured that the fast-moving locomotive would expel the air to such an extent that I could follow in the vacuum behind.\\" Murphy had ridden a mile in 37 seconds on static rollers and so, with a big enough shield, he said, he could go as fast as he liked. \\"By chance,\\" he said, \\"I met Hal Fullerton, special agent of the Long Island Rail Road at Howes Roadhouse. I pointed out that an exhibition of that kind would prove to the world that the Long Island Railroad had just as good rolling stock, roadbeds and employees as any other road in the world.\\" The contract was signed within 48 hours. James Edward Sullivan, secretary of the American athletics union, was referee and there were five timekeepers. The party arrived in Babylon, New York, at 5:00 pm on June 21, 1899, mounted the train and watched. Fullerton had spread a two-mile carpet of boards from Babylon to Farmingdale and built 11-foot side-wings and a small roof to the platform on the last carriage. Murphy told Sam Booth, driver of locomotive 39, to go as fast as he could. Murphy clocked 16.4 seconds for the first quarter- mile, 33.6 for the half, 49.2 for the three-quarters and the mile in 1:08. Fullerton was embarrassed that his locomotive failed to get to 60 mph. Its weight made the wooden track sink and rise and Murphy was forced to ride a wave. On the final, successful run, Murphy held the pacing compartment until he'd got his bicycle rolling and Fullerton told Sam Booth, the driver, to open the regulator. \\"With eyes glued upon the vertical strip of white on back of the car‚Ä¶ I experienced an entirely different feeling compared with my previous ride\\", Murphy recalled. \\"The officials knew that there was something wrong, that I was labouring under great difficulties. I could not understand the violent vibration in the track, as though I was riding over an undulation instead of level track; feeling hot missiles striking my face and body. I learned afterwards it was burning rubber from under the car. \\"Within five seconds the rate of speed was terrific; I was riding in a maelstrom of swirling dust, hot cinders, paper and other particles of matter. The whipsaw feeling through a veritable storm of fire became harder every second. I could feel myself getting weaker every second I saw ridicule, contempt, disgrace and a lifetime dream gone up in smoke. I saw the agonised faces, yelling, holding out stretched hands as if they would like to get hold of or assist me somehow.\\" The half-mile passed in 29.4 seconds. \\"Wobbling to and fro, but still gaining, the dust, the odour of burning rubber‚Ä¶ The car was crowded with men who had been used to seeing any and all things that were dangerous, but the howling and screaming of sturdy officials and newspaper men from all over the United States that stood on the platform put all on edge. Suddenly, three- quarters was passed in 43 4/5 seconds. I expected to go off the track, travelling faster than the train, with the terrible storm of dust, pebbles, hot rubber and cinders. I looked up blankly. It was getting to a point where I could expect anything.\\" Finally he saw the waving Stars and Stripes that marked the finish. He was at that point 15 feet behind the train, having struggled to stay with it. By then, however, he was closing the gap and therefore riding faster than the train. Sam Booth shut off steam. Murphy crashed into the train. The bike tipped up and Murphy let go and grabbed an upright bar. Fullerton caught one arm and a man called Joseph H. Cummin the other and they pulled both bike and rider to the platform. \\"I lay motionless, face down, on the platform. I was all in. I was half-carried to a cot at the end of the car; the roar of the train was challenged by hysterical yells. Grown men hugged and kissed each other. One man fainted and another went into hysterics, while I remained speechless on my back, ashen in colour and sore all over,\\" Murphy said. Booth, the driver, was worried. He'd seen Murphy drop back on the first ride and had looked for him to do the same on the second. Seconds after shutting off steam he reached the end of the racing track and thought Murphy had piled into unprotected ties (UK: sleepers) between the rails. Seeing him being treated for burns from flying cinders, he thought he was dead. James Edward Sullivan, the referee, said he would never again take part in such an event. Murphy, though, carried on racing. He was among 600 touring professionals on the Grand Circuit in the mid-1890s, won the American tandem championship in 1891 and American titles from one to five miles, setting 17 national records. In 1895 he claimed 7 world, 17 American and 29 state records. New York Police career He went on tour in the Keith Vaudeville Circuit, then joined New York City Police Department. He was commended four times and cited five times. He boasted of being the first policeman in the world to fly an aeroplane, and the first in New York to ride a motorcycle in uniform. As a motorcycle policeman, he had three accidents, two of them serious. His first happened in 1914, which sidelined him for a while. The second occurred on September 19, 1915, when he hit a touring car in pursuit (he was thrown off his motorcycle and the touring car passed over his legs, but he wasn't seriously hurt). The final one happened on September 3, 1916, breaking a leg in three places after a collision with an automobile on Manhattan Bridge. That last accident forced him into retirement from the New York police department on January 29, 1917. Death He died of complications to diabetes in Jamaica, Queens on February 17, 1950, aged 79. One leg had been amputated in 1948 from gangrene. He is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. Honors and awards The Farmingdale Post described him as \\"one of the men who added a bright spot of color to Farmingdale history.\\" He was elected to the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame in 1991.

The film's working title was Hell Below. It was filmed in CinemaScope and Metrocolor. A. Arnold Gillespie and Harold Humbrock were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.  Plot  In October 1942, ten months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, ComSubPac directs the American submarine Greyfish, under Lieutenant Commander Barney Doyle (Glenn Ford), to the convoy containing the Shinaru, one of the Japanese aircraft carriers that led the attack. Doyle also receives word that the target's escort includes a transport ship, Yoshida Maru, carrying all the American prisoners from the camp in the Philippines where his wife and child were being held. (Flashbacks show that Jane refused to leave Manila.) Doyle's second in command, Lieutenant Archer Sloan (Ernest Borgnine) first tries to talk his friend into letting him handle the torpedo run, sparing Doyle from being directly responsible for his family's death. In the end, the transport is so close to the carrier that Sloan begs Doyle to abort the attack. Doyle proceeds, hoping to time the shots to miss the Yoshida Maru and hit their target. Carefully counting the seconds, they realize that one of their torpedoes has hit the transport. Hoping to lure the sub to the surface, the Japanese make no attempt to rescue the survivors. Through the periscope, Doyle can see women and children grasping for pieces of floating wreckage. He is forced to leave the prisoners to die. Doyle follows the Shinaru into Tokyo Bay itself and tries again to sink his nemesis, but he fails. After a relentless bombardment of depth-charges from a Japanese destroyer, he escapes by making it look as if the sub has been destroyed by a mine. The Greyfish heads for Pearl Harbor, and Doyle goes to his cabin and sleeps, fitfully, for three days. At Pearl, Sloan meets with Admiral Setton (Philip Ober), who tells him he has been promoted to Lieutenant Commander; a sub of his own is waiting. Sloan asks about Doyle‚Äôs future, and when the Admiral asks what happened after Tokyo Bay, Sloan tells the truth. The Admiral accepts Sloan's assessment that Doyle is fit and agrees to give him ‚Äúone more trip‚Äù to get the Shinaru. The Admiral has only ‚Äúa long-shot hunch‚Äù about where the Shinaru will be, and when the Greyfish and another sub, the Bluefin, are assigned to a quiet, out-of-the-way patrol area off the Alaskan coast, Doyle (now a Commander) thinks he has been betrayed by both the Admiral and Sloan. Then word comes that the Shinaru is heading for Kiska Harbor (occupied by Japan from June 1942 to July 1943). Nearing the harbor, Sloan recommends diving the boat; Doyle rejects the idea. A broad band of sonar blips appears, and Sloan realizes that it may be the log-and-chain boom reported by intelligence. The Bluefin dives, but Doyle delays for another confirmation, and when the Greyfish dives, it is too late. The conning tower is dragged under the log boom. Both periscopes are disabled and the radar antenna is carried away. Doyle's left arm is broken, but he refuses morphine. ‚ÄúIt wouldn't help my shooting‚Äù. He plans to make a sound attack, a long shot with a one in eight chance of success. When it is time to push the buttons, he tells Sloan to do it. After the six torpedoes are away, the Shinaru's escort sends the sub to the bottom, using depth-charges. The Bluefin sinks the destroyer, and we see inside that sub for the first time when they move into position to rescue the crew of the Greyfish. The men use Momsen lungs to reach the surface and are taken aboard the Bluefin, their presence masked by the dense fog and the sound of sirens from the harbor. Doyle asks for confirmation that they hit the Shinaru. The Bluefish's Captain looks through the periscope, shares the view briefly with Doyle and Sloan, and then, over the intercom, describes the Shinaru's sinking for Doyle's crew. The Bluefish heads for home to the sound of ‚ÄúAnchors Aweigh‚Äù.

Horatio Gates House and Golden Plough Tavern are two connecting historic buildings located in downtown York, York County, Pennsylvania. The buildings were restored between July 1961 and June 1964, and operated as a museum by the York County History Center. Gates house The General Horatio Gates House was built by Joseph Chambers in 1751, and connected to the Golden Plough Tavern through a shared kitchen. It is a 2 1/2-story, brick and limestone dwelling in the Georgian-style. It was the home of General Horatio Gates (1727‚Äì1806), while the Second Continental Congress convened in York, September 30, 1777 to June 27, 1778. Tavern The Golden Plough Tavern was built by Martin Eichelberger in 1741 and is a two-story, Germanic influenced medieval style building. The tavern is quite significant for its age and social history but is also an exceptional museum of historic carpentry and vernacular architecture. The ground floor wall construction is a rare type which blends timber framing with log building. These walls are framed and the spaces between the posts are infilled with hewn beams, each beam fitted into its own mortise, and the gaps between the beams chinked with stones and mud like a log cabin. This construction technique is similar to timber framing infilled with planks known by many names including post-and-plank. The upper walls are half timbered in a Germanic style with brick nog and wattle and daub infill. Half timbered buildings in America are relatively rare, generally found in some areas settled by German immigrants. The roof structure is framed with a Germanic type of truss called a liegender stuhl directly translated as a \\"lying chair\\" where chair has the general meaning of support.

Early life When Blanco was a child he heard that a landowner applied a redhot iron on an indigenous man.https://www.sfu.ca/las/news/documents/Biography_HugoBlanco.pdf When he was 10 he met an indigenous leader who told him the story of his struggles. He involved himself in school strikes against Manuel A. Odr√≠a, which the students won. At age 20 he traveled to Buenos Aires and began studying in the university. There he joined a workers' party after he met Argentinian Trotskyists. Without finishing his agronomic studies in Argentina's Universidad de la Plata he became a worker in a factory because he did not want to work for the landowners. He worked on a coffee plantation as a subtenant farmer. Peasant struggle Returning to Peru he joined the Revolutionary Workers Party (POR) in Lima and participated in the famous protest to the then Vice-President of the United States, Richard Nixon, in 1958 . Following those demonstrations, Blanco caught the attention of the police, and decided to move to his home region to the Convencion Valley. Here he took residence in 1958 as a subtenant farmer, immersing himself in local politics.War of shadows: the struggle for utopia in the Peruvian Amazon /by Michael Fobes Brown, Eduardo Fern√°ndez Page 86 Beginning in 1958, with the help of students from the Cuzco University, Blanco‚Äôs Quechua federation mobilized the allegados against the hacendados and arrendires. In the early 1960s he led the Quechua peasant uprising in the Cuzco region of Peru. He was the first who managed to build a bridge between the Spanish speaking intellectuals and the Quechua speaking workers.War of shadows: the struggle for utopia in the Peruvian Amazon / by Michael Fobes Brown, Eduardo Fern√°ndez Page 86 He organised the 2000 peasants in trade unions which occupied the landowners' lands and organised the defence of the occupations against the police and the landowners. His organisation controlled an area, where national control did not exist, there he put an agrarian reform into effect. He set up a peasant trade union in the valleys of Convencion and Lares in Cuzco. Blanco's Chaupimayo Community had its government, public law, popular justice, defense and education, Blanco called this \\"dual power\\", it was reported at this time that, while he was arresting a hacienda owner in Pucyura who raped a little girl. He shot a police officer in self-defense. According to some historians this seems to be propaganda, since he could not have been at Pucyura at the time.Macht und Ohnmacht der Guerilla / by Fritz Ren√© Allemann 1974 / Page 439 De la Puente rejected a union with Blanco because Blanco was a Trotskyist. Captured by the military, he was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment on the island of El Front√≥n. Nearly all his Trotskyist comrades where already in prison when he was captured. In 1963, unionists took the city of Quillabamba, who were carrying out an order, that was issued in Cuzco by the Federation, to go on strike, so that some imprisoned union leaders, among them, Hugo Blanco would be freed. During his imprisonment he wrote Land or Death: The Peasant Struggle in Peru. During this time he exchanged letters with Jos√© Mar√≠a Arguedas which were written in Quechua. In 1968 he was chosen by the Swedish section of Amnesty International as prisoner of the Year. Exile In 1971 Blanco was deported to Chile.

The American broadcast was cut from 150 minutes to 100 and broadcast in one evening instead of over five evenings. The life story of Anne Frank describes about the holocaust in 20th century which is a part of history. Episodes Amsterdam 6th June 1942 English actress Ellie Kendrick portrayed Anne Frank. The series begins in June 1942, in wartime and Nazi occupied Amsterdam. Annelies Marie Frank, a teenage Jewish girl, is celebrating her 13th birthday - amongst her birthday presents, she is given a red diary. Days later, call up papers arrive for her 16-year-old sister Margot and her parents, Otto and Edith, decide to hasten their plan to go into hiding to ensure that the family does not get separated. The next morning, 6 July 1942, the Franks head to Otto's pectin and spice company. They proceed up to a Secret Annex at the back of the building. Only the trustworthy office staff, such as Miep Gies, know of their existence and have agreed to help them survive. In the annex they must obey strict rules, remaining completely silent during working hours. Otto and Edith sleep in one room, with Margot and Anne next door in another. At the very top of the building is a disused attic for storing food. This soon becomes Anne's getaway, as she is able to gaze outside at a chestnut tree and the tower of the Westerkerk. At first, Edith and Margot find the confinement hard to bear, while Otto and Anne sew material together to make black-out curtains. They are soon joined by their Jewish friends Mr and Mrs van Daan and their teenage son Peter. Their arrival liven things up, but also brings tension, especially since Peter brought his pet cat. She continues writing her diary. October 1942 It is now October 1942. In the secret annex, the achterhuis, the toilet is blocked and her father, Otto, is forced to try and unblock by hand. Their helpers in the offices downstairs call a plumber, and the family are terrified that he will need to come up to the annex. Anne finds Mrs. van Daan increasingly hard to bear, as she orders her around and criticises her in a way that her liberal parents never do. But overall they are getting used to their time together, and the strict routine by which they must live. Otto begins to oversee their school studies so that they won't be behind after the war. During an air raid, Anne is so scared that she runs to her father for comfort. One day Anne invites Miep and her husband Jan to dinner and to stay overnight in her room. When they agree, Anne draws up a special menu in their honour, which Mrs van Daan cooks for them. But Miep brings bad news, which she tells only the Franks, that the van Daans' apartment has been ransacked and all their property confiscated. Also another person arrives to stay at the annex, a dentist called Mr Dussel, who will sleep in Margot's bed. November 1942 It is now November 1942. The routine in the rear annex is now well established - as are the squabbles. Otto is shocked to discover that the building has had to be sold. They fear that the new owner will demand access to the annex and they will be discovered. The lease won't be exchanged for months yet, so for now the threat is over. When Miep arrives she tells them their helpful grocer has gone missing. Miep also gives Mr Dussel the latest letter and food parcel from his fianc√© - this annoys Anne as she thinks he is putting them at greater risk. Her parents agree but do not want to intervene. That evening Anne helps to wash her mother's hair and for once they are close. Soon it is Hanukkah and everyone in the annex gathers for the ceremony around the dinner table. Food shortages are getting worse and Bep Voskuijl from the office now comes up to the annex for lunch every day. Anne asks Mr Dussel to let her use their shared bedroom for the agreed time but he isn't ready to give up the desk and they row. Otto talks to Dussel and persuades him how important writing is to Anne. Mr Dussel also begins to learn Spanish for his life post-war. June 1943 It is June 1943 and Anne is dreaming about her fourteenth birthday party. Suddenly she wakes up and remembers she is in the annex. Her family give her whatever they can, but the only present that really excites her is a bar of chocolate. Also, the families are wearing out their clothes and don't have the money to replace them. In fact, the van Daans have little money left and argue about whether they should sell Mrs van Daan's fur coat. Otto measures Anne and Margot against the wall and finds that Anne has grown three inches in the last year. They learn on BBC radio of the capitulation of Italy (September 1943). Anne is growing into a young woman and is amazed by the changes happening to her body and emotions. Her periods have started and she is becoming aware of her feminine sexuality. She has even started to look differently at Peter. When Peter comes up to the attic she tells him that she sees him differently now and apologises for having teased him in the past. He invites her to accompany him down to the warehouse to collect the potatoes. However, one day on his potato run, Peter forgets to unlock the front doors, forcing the employees to break in. Later, in response to her feelings, Anne writes her parents a hurtful letter. May 1944 It is May 1944 and the Franks are woken up by the sound of intruders downstairs. When the noises seem to stop, Otto and Peter go downstairs to lock the front door so as not to attract the police, but they discover that the burglars are still there and flee back to the annex. The next morning Mr Kugler informs them that the burglars took a lot of valuables and that they must be more careful. The tension and the summer heat start to get to them and they continually snap at each other. Food shortages are getting worse and the authorities have confiscated all radios. Luckily, Mr Kleiman secretly gives them a replacement. As the bombing raids get worse, Anne takes to running up and down the annex stairs to block out the sound. But they try to keep their spirits up and are thrilled when Miep finds some butter to bake a small cake for Edith's birthday. Finally, their worst nightmare comes true when the SD and Dutch plain-clothed police raid the warehouse (4 August 1944). As all of the Jews are being led away one by one end title reveal each of their fates. In the final scene, Miep finds Anne's notebooks scattered across the floor and reaches down to pick them up.

Silberbabuer Reception One reviewer, Michael Fox of jweekly.com, wrote:http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/57606/bbcs-anne-frank-vividly- depicts-determined-dreamy-teen/ Retrieved 12 January 2012 : Sixty-five years on, and despite her legendary stature, Anne Frank still comes across as a willful, normal teenager with unrealistic ‚Äî and tragically unrealized ‚Äî dreams of her future. She attaches supreme importance to her own whims and needs, demands immediate satisfaction and musters barely an iota of tolerance for what she perceives as the stunted, compromised world of adults. :As it unfolds, however, the British television adaptation of The Diary of Anne Frank increasingly and irresistibly frames its subject‚Äôs willfulness as a determination to establish an identity, and a place of significance, in the soon-to-come postwar world... It is the pitiless snuffing of this potential ‚Äî the dream destroyed when the Gestapo breached her family‚Äôs Amsterdam refuge in 1944 after two long years in hiding ‚Äî that is, and has always been, the piercing tragedy of Anne Frank‚Äôs life. :Solidly engrossing and vigorously paced, The Diary of Anne Frank takes place almost entirely (after the first five minutes) in the secret annex above Otto Frank‚Äôs warehouse and office. It confines itself to the events recorded by our unintentional heroine ‚Äî which is to say that younger viewers unfamiliar with the Nazis‚Äô systematic, continent- spanning implementation of the Final Solution aren‚Äôt provided with a great deal of detail. :Anne Frank has long been an icon to Jews and a symbol of the Holocaust to non-Jews, but I suspect mainstream audiences will view this version a bit differently. In the current era, when children die in every corner of the world and \\"ethnic cleansing\\" has become part of our vocabulary, Anne‚Äôs story provokes associations with racism, persecution and lost promise that go beyond Nazis and Jews. :This production also has a more contemporary feel thanks to a shockingly candid scene where Anne acknowledges the changes in her body and admits her confusion over puberty. This was one of the passages regarding Anne‚Äôs sexuality that Otto Frank removed before the diary‚Äôs original publication in 1947, and which were restored in an edition published well after his 1980 death.

The film was first shown at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury and was nominated for the Palme d'Or. Adoration won \\"Best Canadian Feature Film ‚Äì Special Jury Citation\\" at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival. The film had its U.S. premiere in April 2009 at the San Francisco International Film Festival, and went into U.S. release on May 8, 2009. Plot High school French teacher Sabine reads to her class as a translation exercise a French newspaper report of a terrorist who planted a bomb in the airline luggage of his pregnant girlfriend. If the bomb had detonated, it would have killed her, her unborn child, and many others, but it was discovered in time by Israeli security personnel. Egoyan based the story partly on the 1986 Hindawi affair. In the course of translating, Simon, who lives with his maternal uncle Tom, imagines that the news item is his own family's story: that his Palestinian father Sami was the terrorist, the woman was his mother Rachel, an accomplished violinist, and he was her unborn child. Years ago, Sami crashed the family car, killing both himself and Rachel, making Simon an orphan. Influenced by his maternal grandfather, Morris, who disliked Sami, Simon has always feared that the crash was not an accident but intentional. Sabine asks him to develop the story as a drama exercise, to read it to the class, and for dramatic effect to pretend that it really happened. He does so, and discussions evolve on the Internet about the story. Sabine is fired for making Simon lie. Tom, who is a tow truck driver, tows Sabine's car away. Sabine follows him in a taxi, and by mobile phone she offers him a meal in a restaurant. Later she reveals to him that she had been married to Sami for 5 years, until Sami met Rachel.

As of mid-2009 there were an estimated 7,000+ of the larger 3745 models still in active production status, down from 20,000 or more in 2007. The 3745 and associated 3746 models were once heavily used within financial, insurance and retail industries as well as within government agencies globally. However, today most organizations have migrated away from the use of 3745s. IBM's Enterprise Extender and the Communication Controller for Linux on System z (CCL) have largely displaced the older 3745s. IBM announced in September 2002 that it would no longer manufacture new 3745s, but IBM continues to support the hardware by providing worldwide maintenance service, by providing microcode releases and by supporting the associated software including NCP (Network Control Program) and the virtual telecommunications access method (VTAM). IBM has announced end-of- service dates for Japan, Europe and the Middle East, but has not yet announced end-of-service for the Americas and parts of Asia. The latest and most commonly used models of the 3745 are the 3745-31A single CCU and 3745-61A dual CCU models. These are usually operated in conjunction with the 3746-900 expansion unit (aka 900 frame). The 900 frame provides multiple T1, token ring, V.35 and V.24 attachments on the front end, and connects on the back end to the mainframe host with multiple ESCON serial fiber optic channels. An operator and service interface to the 3745 and 900 frame is provided by an IBM Service Processor which operates under the control of the IBM OS/2 operating system and proprietary code.  Production  IBM maintained a contract manufacturing facility for the 3745/3746 product set in Havant, Hampshire, United Kingdom until the end of 2002. This facility was operated by Xyratex Technology Limited. When production at Havant ceased, the remaining inventory of new product, features, parts and components was purchased by Mid-Atlantic Research and Services, Inc. That company built and operated a re-manufacturing facility in Maryland, USA for the purpose of providing upgrade kits and service parts for those large companies that continued to rely upon the 3745/3746 for critical network applications. Re-manufacturing continued in the USA at the Mid-Atlantic Research Maryland facility until late 2013. In 2014 Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions, LLC (EIS) of St. Charles, Illinois purchased Mid-Atlantic Research for an undisclosed amount. EIS consults and sells data center solutions including active equipment and physical layer solutions.  Replacements  IBM does not market a direct hardware replacement for the IBM 3745 providing all of the 3745/3746 interfaces. However, IBM offers a software emulation product that provides a subset of 3745/3746 function, IBM's Communications Controller for Linux on System z. CCL is a software emulation that runs on the mainframe under Linux on System z. The NCP (Network Control Program) licensed for use in the 3745/3746 continues to be licensed for use with CCL. CCL employs the IBM OSA adapter for physical connectivity. Low and medium speed lines must be supported through router ports. Alternatively, in many cases it is possible to migrate away from networking protocols supported by the 3745 and CCL, relying solely on the SNA and TCP/IP protocol support provided by z/OS Communications Server.

Permanent employees do not have a predetermined end date to employment. In addition to their wages, they often receive benefits like subsidized health care, paid vacations, holidays, sick time, or contributions to a 401(k) retirement plan. Permanent employees are often eligible to switch job positions within their companies. Even when employment is \\"at will\\", permanent employees of large companies are generally protected from abrupt job termination by severance policies, like advance notice in case of layoffs, or formal discipline procedures. They may be eligible to join a union, and may enjoy both social and financial benefits of their employment. With exception of South Korea where extensive laws and regulations make firing of permanent employees nearly impossible, rarely does \\"permanent employment\\" mean employment of an individual that is guaranteed throughout the employee's working life. In the private sector, with the notable exception of academic tenure, such jobs are rare; permanent employment is far more common in the public sector, where it is often used to strengthen civil service independence from politicians.

The term originally was workers' \\"lifetime commitment\\" to companies, which was coined by James Abegglen in his book \\"The Japanese Factory.\\".  Origin  Japan‚Äôs lifetime employment originated in large companies around 1910 but became widespread during the economic growth period following World War II.Koshiro, Kazutoshi. \\"Lifetime employment in Japan: three models of the concept\\" (PDF). Foreign Labor Developments. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Retrieved 21 August2012. Before the war period, Japanese companies owed more its fund on direct financing. However, as the government started to take control of Zaibatsu, Japanese conglomerates, shareholders had difficulty in exerting their influence to them. In the enforcement of occupation policies GHQ dissolved Zaibatsu and emerging labor unions had started to claim for a higher standard of benefit.  Significance  Lifetime employment took an important role in Japan‚Äôs economic prosperity. In addition to the tendency to pursue equality and loyalty between employee and employer which have their basis on the informal nexus, Confucius norm. In industrial corporations, wage system expects labor's future improvement in productivity. Therefore, the first half of contract duration labor's productivity is below the wage.

In medicine, bilateral sound can refer to a type of sound coming from both sides of the body, as in crepitus from temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome when it occurs on both sides of the TMJ. In this case, bilateral is an anatomical term. In cochlear implant technology, bilateral sound refers to the provision of a different sound input for each ear to help the patient localize and interpret the sound. In analog optical sound recording technology applications such as that used to provide audio for film, bilateral sound production makes use of two mirror-image tracks of light and dark patterns that are designed so as to avoid sound distortion where light may not adequately illuminate the full width of an area of the tracks.

The cypress is grooved vertically to give the appearance of individual tree trunks. The sloping roof of the pavilion is composed of tongue-and-groove yellow pine and copper to mimic the look of medieval cathedrals. The front door is made of maple with inlaid Gothic patterns in cherry and an ornamental architrave of crenelated mahogany. The floor is made of three shades of travertine marble arranged in a geometric pattern based on the building‚Äôs structure.

During the Ottoman rule, he was a primate (prokritos) of Gastouni. He became a member of the Filiki Eteria in 1819. In 1821, as the Ottoman authorities suspected the Greeks of planning a revolution, he was requested to come to Tripolitsa along with other primates; at the suggestion of Germanos of Old Patras, he feigned illness and did not attend. Sisinis proclaimed the start of the Greek War of Independence in Elis, and was one of the most important contributors to the Greek struggle. He provided the Greek troops in the Peloponnese with provisions, and distinguished himself in the battles of Patras, Lala and of Chlemoutsi. As a politician, he was elected representative of Elis in the Second National Assembly at Astros, and was chairman of the Third National Assembly at Troezen and of the Fourth National Assembly at Argos. In early 1825, during the Greek civil wars of 1824‚Äì1825 he and his son Chrysanthos Sisinis were arrested and imprisoned in Hydra. Released in spring, they returned to an active part in the military operations. Under Governor Ioannis Kapodistrias, he was appointed a member of the Panellinion, and in 1829 he was named president of its successor, the Senate. He resigned following disagreements with Kapodistrias, but was not involved in the Governor's assassination in 1831, which he condemned. He married Yakinthi Stathakopoulou and had two sons, Michail and Chrysanthos.

Their first practice took place in a falling-down cabin located on the then-abandoned and overgrown Calliope Farm, which they had recently moved to. Nathan met Nick Paul at a local party and the three began to write material for their first demo. At the time, Nick was heavily influenced by Thrash, Speed, and Death Metal, citing bands like Death and Bolt Thrower, as well as Post-Punk and Gothic Rock influences such as Swans, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and Fields of the Nephilim. Aaron and Nathan's musical style was more informed by Crust, Doom, Norwegian Black Metal and American Black Metal. The band's first release was their 2004 demo, a black CD-R wrapped in fur with moss inside the lyric sheet. Nick Paul left the band soon after the first demo was recorded. Richard Dalahn joined the band in early 2005. They then began working on material for a second demo, which would end up including 2 tracks off of their first studio album Diadem of 12 Stars.

(2007): Pettalidae Shear, 1980. In: Pinto-da-Rocha et al. 2007: 99ff Name Pettalus is a name from Greek mythology that appears in Ovid's Metamorphoses. Description All species except the cave-dwelling South African Speleosiro argasiformis spend their entire life cycle in leaf litter. They are two to five millimeters long, usually with an oval shaped body. Although all Pettalidae except Parapurcellia have eyes, these were long thought to be absent in the family, mainly because they cannot be seen by scanning electron microscopy. They are often incorporated at the base of the ozophores and typically lack lenses. Distribution The members of this family are distributed throughout former temperate Gondwana, with genera in Chile, South Africa, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, eastern and western Australia, and New Zealand, where they are most diverse by far, with 29 species and subspecies found in three genera. Relationships The family Pettalidae is monophyletic, although it is at the moment (2007) unclear what the nearest relatives are. It probably originated in the southern part of Gondwana. Parsimony analysis suggests it could be a sister group to the remaining Cyphophthalmi, though this could also be the case for the Stylocellidae, or it could be related to the Sironidae, or specifically to the sironid genus Suzukielus. It is unrelated to the Troglosironidae that are endemic to New Caledonia. The main lineages of the family may have arisen rapidly, possibly during the rapid expansion of Glossopteris forests that were predominant in temperate Gondwana. Pettalidae were likely present throughout the forests of Antarctica, which formed a land bridge between Australia and South America up until circa 50 million years ago (mya). The Australian genera Austropurcellia (Eastern Australia: Queensland) and Karripurcellia (Western Australia) are not sister groups. It is possible that the Cyphophthalmi dispersed across Australia while the central region was covered with Nothofagus rainforest (until 37 mya), or that the ancestors of the two genera independently dispersed from adjacent landmasses now separate from Australia. Parapurcellia from eastern South Africa is sister to all other Pettalidae, while Purcellia from western South Africa is sister to the Chilean Chileogovea. Western South Africa and southern South America were last connected during the Late Jurassic, about 150 mya. Likewise, the monotypic Neopurcellia from New Zealand appears as the sister group to all Pettalidae except for Parapurcellia, instead of being monophyletic with the other two New Zealand genera, which themselves appear as sister groups in Bayesian analysis, but not in direct optimization parsimony analyses.

In 1985, Brent answered an ad for a teaching job at a local drum shop in Winnipeg, and despite being only 15 at the time, was hired based on his excelled musical ability and people skills.  Move to LA  Fitz got his professional start at age 15, playing in various Winnipeg clubs and outlying areas in a cover band named New Alliance. After graduating high school, he formed the band Seventh Heaven with two local musicians and two Los Angeles natives that had recently relocated to Winnipeg. After several years of touring, Brent formed another band with Seventh Heaven's guitarist, which evolved into Shake Naked. Of this period, his father related that 'we used to go to every gig he played in Winnipeg bars, ladies of the night would pass us, going through to go to the bathroom\\".

The prize includes $5000 cash and participation in an on- campus event in Richmond, Va. at VCU that focuses on the creation, publication, and promotion processes involved with a first novel. The award is more formally known as the \\"Virginia Commonwealth University Cabell First Novelist Award.\\" History The award was created in 2001 by playwright Laura Browder and novelist Tom De Haven. In addition, Richmond writer and VCU alumnus David Baldacci funded and supported the fledgling award in its early years. In 2007, VCU Libraries became a partner with the VCU Department of English in offering the award, and helping fund the prize and a fellowship for a graduate student to oversee the award process. When the James Branch Cabell Library Associates began contributing generous financial support, the award was named for James Branch Cabell (1879-1958), a Richmond writer who gained a national reputation and is best known today as a pioneer in fantasy fiction. Current sponsors are the James Branch Cabell Library Associates, VCU Libraries, the VCU Department of English, Barnes & Noble at VCU, and the VCU College of Humanities and Sciences. Created to recognize a rising new talent in the literary world who has successfully published a first novel, nominations are solicited nationwide from publishers, editors, agents, and writers. A panel of readers narrows the field to the four or five most promising new works of fiction. From that short list, three prominent judges, including the winner of the previous year‚Äôs award, choose the recipient of the Cabell First Novelist Award. The award is presented at the annual Cabell First Novelist Night. During this event, VCU brings together the newly published author and his or her agent and editor for a reading and a panel that focuses on the creation, publication, and marketing processes involved with a first novel. Earlier in the day, the itinerary includes a luncheon and a visit with a graduate fiction workshop. The public reading, followed by a Q&A; session and other events, draw together MFA and undergraduate writers, the VCU and Richmond literary communities, and the general public. Travel expenses to Richmond and lodging accommodations for the author, agent, and editor are provided, as well as a $5000 cash prize for the author.

Career   Amateur  Garza started boxing amateur at 18 years old and did it for three years. He won the Golden Gloves all three years, along with other big tournaments and was also on the U.S. boxing team.  Professional  Garza turned pro in 1982 at the age of 21. Working his way up the ranks, he got his opportunity. In 1988, Garza won the WBC Americas light welterweight championship with a spectacular first-round knockout of former world champion Harry Arroyo. Arroyo was knocked down three times in the fight. Later on that year, Garza knocked out former world champion Charlie Brown (other wise known as \\"Choo Choo\\" Brown) in four rounds. In 1989, Garza, with a single right hand in the 7th round, knocked out former world champion Joe Manley. Manley was out cold. A couple of months later on August 12, 1989, Garza won a unanimous decision in a 12-round war to win the USBA championship over #1 ranked contender Frankie Warren; Garza fought the last five rounds with his left eye swelled shut. Many boxing annals argue that Garza vs. Warren should have been the fight of the year. On August 17, 1990, with only two weeks notice, Garza flew to Nice, France, and won the WBA light welterweight world title by majority decision over the reigning three-time world champion Juan Coggi. Garza looked sharp with a beautiful display of counter punching. He came back to his hometown of Sacramento and defended his world title against former five-time world champion Vinny Pazienza. Garza out-smarted and out-boxed Pazienza and had his face bloody and battered. Pazienza was frustrated throughout the fight and in the 11th round, Pazienza picked up Garza and tried to slam him in the ring, so the referee disqualified Pazienza. The following year, Garza lost the belt to Edwin Rosario. Garza had three more fights after that and won them by knockout, and was promised another world title shot, but it seemed like all the world champions would duck when it came to Garza.

The most widely known university that is part of the Church Educational System (CES) that has adopted the honor code is Brigham Young University (BYU), located in Provo, Utah. The standards are largely derived from codes of conduct of the LDS Church, and were not put into written form until the 1940s. Since then, they have undergone several changes. The CES Honor Code also applies for students attending BYU's sister schools Brigham Young University-Idaho, Brigham Young University-Hawaii, and LDS Business College. History of the Honor Code at BYU BYU Honor Code office entrance Every year BYU has an \\"Honor Week\\" dedicated to celebrating the legacy of the Honor Code and to remind students of the importance of following it. Early forms of the CES Honor Code are found as far back as the days of the Brigham Young Academy (1875‚Äì1903). Early school president, Karl G. Maeser. Maeser created the \\"Domestic Organization\\", which was a group of teachers who would visit students at their homes to see that they were following the school's moral rules. In the 1901 school catalog this guide of conduct included a prohibition on \\"strong drink and tobacco\\", \\"profanity and obscenity\\", attending parties not under the control of \\"responsible persons\\", \\"keeping late hours, having improper associates, and visiting places of questionable repute\\". Maeser also, however, relied largely on individual student's honor and honesty in keeping the rules, intending faculty visits as times of counsel rather than espionage. After George H. Brimhall served as president, enforcement became somewhat more lax (there were no more faculty visits), but adherence to the same basic principles were encouraged. From 1910 to 1960 the annual student catalog would only contain a few brief sentences on student conduct and discipline, often mentioning the prohibition of tobacco, \\"improper associates\\", and \\"visiting places of questionable repute\\", though the 1930s and 40s saw increased standards regarding rules related to student housing and the dress code. Women were allowed to wear slacks only on Saturdays, and men wore uniforms for a short time. In 1949 students drafted the first Honor Code enforced by an Honor Council of students and administrators, and was used mainly for cases of cheating and academic dishonesty. The Student Honor Council, created around 1949, oversaw case violations. This council met with enough success among students in alleviating cheating that in 1957 BYU president Ernest L. Wilkinson suggested the Honor Code expand to include other school standards. This led to an expansion during the 1960s which created the bulk of what the Honor Code represents today: rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, drugs, and alcohol. Instead of a short paragraph on university standards, the undergraduate catalog began printing a more detailed set of Honor Code policies in 1968, including a clause requiring students to act when observing any violation and a list of banned drugs (\\"amphetamines, barbiturates, hallucinogenic drugs, psychedelic drugs, and narcotics\\"). This change came because the administration completely took over the previously student run honor code and disbanded the student senate and student honor code committee. The honor code was expanded in the 1970 catalog with a requirement to adhere to the \\"standards of dress\\" and the addition of marijuana and LSD to the list of banned drugs. In the 1960s, several rules regarding longer hairstyles in men were introduced after long hair on men became associated with the radical movements then springing up on college campuses around the country. However, long hair and beards were not completely against the rules until the mid-1970s with the 1978 annual catalog being the first edition to contain any detailed dress and grooming standards code. The 1960s also saw changes in rules regarding women's dress, as LDS Church leaders made statements against low-cut dresses and short skirts. By this time, women were allowed to wear slacks and pant-suits, but jeans were not allowed until 1981. Standards The CES Honor Code governs not only academic behavior but also everyday conduct on or off campus as well as dress and grooming standards of students and faculty, with the aim of providing an atmosphere consistent with LDS principles. The Honor Code requires: *Abstinence from illicit drugs, alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea (substances forbidden by the LDS Word of Wisdom) *Honesty *Encouraging others in their commitment to keep the Honor Code *Living a chaste and virtuous life: **Appropriate gender-specific behavior (no sexual harassment) **No involvement with pornographic or indecent material **No inappropriate sexual activity (no premarital or extramarital sex) **No homosexual behavior *Obedience to the law *Maintaining an ecclesiastical endorsement from a leader of the local congregation or the nondenominational BYU chaplain *Respect for others *Clean language (no profanity) *Following the \\"Residential Living Standards\\" (visiting hours for members of the opposite sex) *Dress and Grooming Standards: Abiding by the guidelines for dress, grooming, and housing. Skirts must reach to the knee and shirts may not be sleeveless. Form fitting, strapless and revealing clothing is not appropriate. Male students may not wear beards or goatees, hair length must be above the ears, and sideburns must not extend below the ear lobe. *Students are prohibited from having guns on campus. Specific additional restrictions on appearance have been mentioned including those deemed as \\"extreme fashion\\" including a ban on shaved heads for women, blue hair, long nails or eyeshadow for men, and any piercings besides a single pair for women. Policies on homosexuality Ban on gay students Before the 1960s there was little explicit mention of homosexuality by BYU administration, but by 1962 a ban on homosexual students was enacted. On 12 September 1962 Apostles Spencer W. Kimball and Mark E. Peterson and BYU President Ernest L. Wilkinson agreed on a university policy that \\"no one will be admitted as a student ... whom we have convincing evidence is a homosexual\\". They agreed to share information about individuals cases of homosexual members between general church administration and BYU administration. This policy was reiterated in Wilkinson's address to BYU in 1965 when he stated \\"we [do not] intend to admit to this campus any homosexuals. ... [I]f any of you have this tendency and have not completely abandoned it, may I suggest you leave the University immediately .... We do not want others on this campus to be contaminated by your presence.\\" The 1967 version of the Honor code stated that \\"homosexuality will not be tolerated\\" along with not approving \\"any form of artificial birth control\\". The ban on any homosexually oriented students was softened a decade later by Wilkinson's successor Dallin H. Oaks in a 19 April 1973 Board of Trustees meeting. There it was decided BYU would allow students who had \\"repented of\\" homosexual acts and \\"forsaken\\" them for a \\"lengthy period of time\\". Additionally they would allow students \\"guilty of irregular sexual behavior\\" (not including fornication or adultery equivalents) who were \\"repentant\\" and \\"showed evidence\\" that the act(s) would \\"not be repeated\\" while still banning overt and active homosexuals. Shock therapy According to the Standards Office director from 1971 to 1981, all homosexual BYU students who were reported to the Standards Office (now called the Honor Code Office) were either expelled, or, for \\"less serious\\" offenses, were required to undergo therapy in order to remain at the university; in \\"special cases\\" this treatment included \\"electroshock and vomiting aversion therapies\\". This program of aversion therapy‚Äîwhich spanned from the late 1950s until at least the late 1970s‚Äîwas dedicated to \\"curing\\" male homosexual students reported by bishops and BYU administrators through administering electrical shocks or vomit inducing drugs while showing \\"nude\\" pictures of men to the patient in an attempt to associate pain with homosexual visual stimulation. Ban on advocacy and coming out A gay pride parody of the \\"Y\\" logo In the late 1990s a reference to homosexual conduct was added to the code, and in 2001 Associate Dean of Students Lane Fischer over the BYU Honor Code Office stated that it was inappropriate for a BYU student to advocate for the [homosexual] lifestyle by publishing material or participating in public demonstrations as well as advertising ones same-sex preference in any public way. He also required homosexual students facing discipline to refrain from same-sex \\"dating, holding hands, kissing, romantic touching, showering, clubbing, ets., as well as regular association with homosexual men.\\" Current policies In 2007, BYU changed the honor code to read that stating one's sexual orientation was not an honor code issue while removing the phrase that \\"any behaviors that indicate homosexual conduct, including those not sexual in nature, are inappropriate and violate the Honor Code.\\" The change also clarified the policy on advocacy of LGBTQ rights or romantic relationships. Several students, including gay and lesbian students, thought that the previous wording was confusing and unclear. While both homosexuals and heterosexuals must abide by the church's law of chastity (i.e. no sexual relations outside of marriage, and no pornography), the Honor Code additionally prohibits all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings (i.e. dating, kissing). There is no similar restriction against expressing heterosexual feelings. The first explicit mention of homosexuality in the language of the school's code of conduct available to students was not noted until the Fall of 2009. Both this version and the 2010 versions contained a clause banning homosexual advocacy defined as \\"seeking to influence others to engage in homosexual behavior or promoting homosexual relations as being morally acceptable.\\" In early 2011, BYU quietly removed the clause prohibiting advocacy. In February 2020, the administration removed two paragraphs from the honor code prohibiting homosexual behavior, including \\"all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings\\". Together with this change they updated a bullet from \\"Live a chaste and virtuous life\\" and replaced it with \\"Live a chaste and virtuous life, including abstaining from any sexual relations outside a marriage between a man and a woman.\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20200220062451/https://policy.byu.edu/view/index.php?p=26 Enforcement Honor code policies and principles are promoted by BYUSA, the campus student association, and the Honor Code Office. The office handles all accusations and violations, and works in conjunction with bishops of BYU wards. If the student's bishop is thought to be able to corroborate the alleged infraction, the accused student may be required to sign a legal form waiving his or her rights to ecclesiastical privacy, which allows the school direct access to the bishop and any content discussed on the said topic, or others which may have been in violation of the Honor Code, but not yet reported. Not all students at the school are familiar with LDS standards, so students who break the code for the first time are usually only contacted by mail as a warning and clarification of standards. Later violations may cause the student to be called into the office to speak with an Honor Code officer. Severe and continued violations can merit expulsion. Students may be brought to the attention of the Honor Code office by faculty, staff, or other students but \\"no anonymous reports will be acted upon\\". BYU Events Staff patrol school dances for Honor Code violations. Cafeteria, library, athletics, and BYU Testing Center employees are asked to encourage students to follow dress and grooming standards, sometimes denying service to students not adhering to the code. In 2001 it was reported that less than 2 or 3 percent of BYU students are referred to the Honor Code Office annually, though no percentage on punitive actions were given. Data from 1955, however, showed that 9 students were expelled, 23 were suspended, and 72 were placed on probation. Beard Exemptions In regards to facial hair restrictions, permission to wear facial hair can be granted in three specific cases: For men with skin conditions aggravated by shaving, for theatrical performances, and (since a policy change in January 2015) for religious reasons. In regards to medical exemptions, students/faculty must visit a BYU Student Health Center doctor who will fax a recommendation to the Honor Code office. The student/faculty must then visit the office to fill out the requisite exemption paperwork. A new BYU ID card is issued including a symbol marked \\"BE\\" and a photograph with the facial hair. In regards to theater exemptions, students or faculty must obtain written permission from the theater or film company explaining the need for facial hair. Such exemptions are only granted for the duration of the production. Thus, in such cases a temporary exemption card issued. Religious exemptions will be coordinated through the university chaplain's office. Ecclesiastical endorsement Students are required to sign in agreement to the Honor Code, Dress and Grooming Standards, Residential Living Guidelines, and Academic Honesty Policy yearly. Additionally they must have a yearly interview with a leader of their local religious congregation, or (for religious students or those without a local congregation) the non- denominational BYU chaplain and maintain this ecclesiastical endorsement to attend BYU. In the past about 5% of BYU was not LDS, but that number has shrunk closer to 1% in recent years. The chaplain or religious leader is instructed to inquire about the student's and understanding of and adherence to specific policies. These include the ban on the consumption of specific substances, viewing pornography, any extramarital heterosexual \\"relations\\", any homosexual conduct, and adherence to the Honor Code, Dress and Grooming Standards, Residential Living Guidelines, and Academic Honesty Policy on and off campus. LDS bishops and branch presidents are additionally instructed to verify that LDS students demonstrate \\"appropriate and consistent church activity\\", \\"abid[e] by the standards of the Church\\", and are in \\"full fellowship\\". The chaplain or religious leader can revoke the endorsement at any time. Honor code staff As of 2017, the enforcement of the BYU's Honor Code is directed by Spencer Hawkins, who is under Vice Dean of Students Casey Peterson, who is under Dean of Students Vernon Heperi. Over the Office of Student Life is Vice President Janet S. Scharman, who reports to university president Kevin J Worthen, who is under the BYU Board of Trustees, which is composed of general authorities and general officers of the LDS Church. Housing accommodation Students have the option of living in on-campus housing, with family members who reside in the local area, or in off-campus housing which must pass a school inspection for health and safety, as well as satisfactory separation of gender quarters and compliance with other standards. Students under certain conditions can apply for a housing waiver for special approval. *Single parents with children. *Single students living with parents. *Single students who are taking classes away from Provo. *Graduate students. *Under certain conditions, as determined by the Off-Campus Housing Office, the university housing requirement may be waived for other students who have a special circumstance or hardship. This approval is designed to ensure that students live in a safe environment that is consistent with the standards of the University. Since students are only allowed to live in BYU-approved housing, landlords in the area consider it important to meet the standard in order to gain residents. The housing standards mandate that bathrooms and bedrooms be off limits to those of the opposite sex. Members of the opposite sex are required to be out of the apartment by midnight. Guns are permitted in off-campus housing only if the gun owner receives written permission from both the landlord and all residents in the apartment. In 2003, BYU announced that beginning in 2007, housing would only be approved if it was within of campus. The school did this out of concern that its Office of Residence Life was being stretched too thin and was unable to meet demands. Students feared the new boundaries might lead to a rise in apartment prices and decrease the amount of available housing. According to BYU, the effect would be minimal, as 98 percent of students already lived within the designated area. About 40 properties lost BYU approval due to the new guideline. Controversies There has been several controversies surrounding BYU's honor code, with criticism from students, advocacy groups, local governmental institutions, and national press coverage. YouTube Blocking As part of a BYU ban on websites containing sexual content, the popular website YouTube was blocked on all BYU networks. In 2007 Fox News highlighted BYU's blocking of pornographic and other sites, including YouTube, from campus Internet connections, pursuant to the code's prohibition of the viewing of pornographic material. BYU lifted the YouTube ban in 2009, again receiving nationwide press attention. Religious and academic freedom According to BYU spokesperson Carri Jenkins, LDS BYU students who experience a transition in faith views away from church orthodoxy are \\"not eligible to attend BYU\\" and are thus not granted religious freedom by the university. There are many non- believing and former Mormons on campus, and some have been expelled for publicly expressing disagreement or doubt. In 2014, the organization FreeBYU composed of BYU alumni and students asked the BYU Board of Trustees to reform the Honor Code to allow LDS students to change their religion, then subsequently challenged BYU's accreditation by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities on the basis of the honor code's suppression of academic and religious freedom. In 2015, religion scholar Dr. Mark Juergensmeyer boycotted a religious freedom conference held on BYU campus in protest over its policy of expelling and terminating LDS students who lose their faith. In 2015-2016, the American Bar Association reviewed formal complaints stemming from a student's allegations that the honor code violates the Association's non-discrimination standards; the student had written a book that laid out why same-sex marriage was not, according to his research, at odds with the LDS Church's teachings. Shortly after the submission of the American Bar Association complaint, BYU added an \\"Application for Exception\\" clause that would theoretically enable a formerly LDS applicant to be accepted if certain criteria are met. Treatment of rape survivors Protesters deliver 60,000 petition signatures to BYU's administration on April 20, 2016 asking them to add an immunity clause shielding these sexual assault survivors from any Honor Code investigations Beginning in 2014 and continuing through 2016, several students have alleged that when they reported being raped, the school punished them for violating the honor code. Some students report that, after having been victimized by a rapist, they were told they were guilty of sexual sin because of past actions that came to light in connection to their sexual assaults. This atmosphere may prevent some students from being willing to report similar crimes to police, a situation that local law enforcement have publicly criticized. The Victim Services Coordinator of the Provo Police Department called for an amnesty clause to be added to the Honor Code which would excuse rape survivors for past infractions of BYU policies. Hollingshead states \\"The victim of a sexual assault will never be referred to the Honor Code Office for being a victim of sexual assault. A report of sexual assault would always be referred to the BYU Title IX Office ‚Äì not to the Honor Code office.\\" BYU launched a review of the practice which concluded in October 2016. BYU announced several changes to how it would handle sexual assault reports, including adding an amnesty clause for the victim of sexual misconduct, and ensuring under most circumstances that information is not shared between the Title IX Office and Honor Code Office without the survivor's consent. According to a Spring 2017 BYU survey answered by over 40% of BYU students, 6.5% of women and 1.2% of men experienced unwanted sexual contact in the last year as BYU students. Of those, 64% of these incidents were not reported to any formal organization with 21% of those who did not report the crime citing a fear of Honor Code discipline or their ecclesiastical endorsement being questioned as a reason for not reporting. LGBTQ policies Controversy surrounding the BYU's honor code has grown since 2014, with criticism from students, advocacy groups, local governmental institutions, and national press coverage. Various LGBTQ advocacy groups have protested the honor code and criticized it as being anti-gay,\\"BYU Continues the Legacy of Anti-Gay Policies\\" , HeartStrong.\\"Brigham Young University Pages\\" , Affirmation: Gay and Lesbian Mormons.\\"The 2006 Equality Ride Route: Brigham Young University\\" , Soulforce. In the fall of 2016 BYU faced national criticism when many called its Honor Code policies for LGBTQ students discriminatory while the university was being considered as an addition to the Big 12 Conference. The Princeton Review has regularly ranked BYU among the most LGBTQ-unfriendly schools in the United States and the campus currently offers no official LGBTQ-specific resources after revoking permission in 2012 for the unofficial university gay-straight alliance USGA to continue meeting on campus. Other universities In March 2008, the University of Texas at San Antonio was accused of plagiarizing a portion of BYU's honor code related to cheating and plagiarism. Southern Virginia University, which also espouses LDS standards, uses a similar code of conduct. Student athletes The Honor Code received national attention in March 2011 when the university dismissed BYU basketball player Brandon Davies from the team for violating the code, reportedly by having premarital sex, the same day the college basketball rankings came out listing BYU as the #3 team in the nation. Davies was reinstated to the university the next school year, and returned to the basketball team, where he completed his athletic eligibility in 2013. Racial bias The CES Honor Code has been criticized at various times including by Darron Smith, a former BYU instructor, Marcus Whalen, a BYU football player, and Don Harwell, president of Genesis, as being applied in a racially disparate manner on many occasions. However, Vai Sikahema, a former BYU football player and native Tongan, has defended the honor code enforcement as not racist citing a number of players, of various racial backgrounds, who had positive experiences at BYU. Facial hair BYU students led a campaign to loosen the beard restrictions in 2014, but it had the opposite effect at Church Educational System schools: some students who had previously been granted beard exceptions were found no longer to qualify, and for a brief period the LDS Business College required students with a registered exception to wear a \\"beard badge\\", which was likened to a \\"badge of shame\\". Some students also join in with shaming their fellow beard-wearing students, even those with registered exceptions.

Later critics, such as Castleman and Podrazik (1982), cited The Stranger, among other DuMont series, as one of the reasons fewer and fewer viewers tuned into the ailing DuMont Network. They stated the series was, like several other DuMont programs during the 1953-1954 season, \\"doomed from the start by third-rate scripts and cheap production\\" and called the program a \\"stale pulp adventure\\".

Myself ; Yourself is the second original game published by Regista, the first being I/O. Takumi Nakazawa, the main scenario writer for the Infinity series (Ever17, Remember11), is the principal writer for Myself ; Yourself. Character design for the game is provided by Mutsumi Sasaki, who also produced the original character design for Memories Off, Happy Lesson, and Futakoi. Before the game's release, a light novel based on the story, written by Takumi Nakazawa, and illustrated by Wadapen, was serialized in the Japanese bish≈çjo magazine Dengeki G's Magazine between March and November 2007, published by MediaWorks. An anime television series adaptation by Doga Kobo aired in Japan from October to December 2007 on TV Kanagawa and contained thirteen episodes. A spin-off sequel to the visual novel was developed by the previous staff entitled Myself ; Yourself: Sorezore no Finale and was released on May 28, 2009 for the PlayStation 2. Plot Myself ; Yourself is set in 2007 in the fictional town in W Prefecture which is modeled after Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. The town is in a quiet, rural area on the southern tip of the prefecture and borders the Pacific Ocean. Sakuranomori is the birthplace of Sana Hidaka, a sixteen-year-old high school student, who grew up with his childhood friends Nanaka Yatsushiro & Aoi Oribe, his best friend Shusuke Wakatsuki, and Shusuke's fraternal twin sister Shuri Wakatsuki. Sana left Sakuranomori when he was eleven years old, but returns five years later living on his own in the apartment building Aoi's family runs. Sana soon finds out that while some things have stayed the same, there are still just as many things that have changed. Characters Protagonists ; : (regular), Madoka Kimura (childhood) :Sana is the main protagonist of the series. He left Sakuranomori during his childhood, and during the beginning of the series he comes back to live by himself in the apartment building owned by Aoi's parents. He apparently had a crush on Nanaka before he left and still holds those feelings for her. He used to play the piano, but he forgot every song except the song Nanaka wrote for him which he says is very important to him. He has a fear of blood because he tried to commit suicide during his middle-school years due to constantly being bullied. At the end of the anime series, Sana proposes to Nanaka and she accepts by wearing the proposal ring during her concert. :In the game, his default romantic partner is Nanaka Yatsushiro, as shown in \\"Sorezore no Finale\\". ; : (regular), Y≈´ko Sanpei (childhood) :Sh≈´suke is one of the four childhood friends Sana left behind when he moved, and they renew their friendship on his return. He is Sana's best friend and the only male besides Sana in their circle. He is the younger twin of Shuri Wakatsuki. Yuzuki-sensei refers him as the lucky one of the Wakatsuki twins. When he and Shuri are accused of being lovers, their father decides to send Shuri away to London. When Shuri tells Sh≈´suke that she cannot stand to be separated from him, they decide to run away together knowing people will think that they have eloped. :In the game, his default romantic partner is Asami Hoshino, as shown in \\"Sorezore no Finale\\". However, in the first game, if Sana takes Shuri's route, Sh≈´suke will admit that he has romantic feelings for his sister. Even though Sh≈´suke has these feelings, if playing the game as Sh≈´suke, there is no Shuri route. Heroines ; : :Nanaka is one of Sana's childhood friends and seemed to have feelings for Sana. When Sana returns to town after five years, her personality has changed from sweet and caring to a cold and moody demeanor. On meeting again she slaps him, apparently for not recognizing her. In the anime, it is also explained that they had agreed to send letters to one another and that Sana had neglected to do so, while Nanaka had stuffed their mailbox with countless letters begging for help. This may have also provided motivation for the slap. She still seems to have romantic feelings for him as she gets jealous whenever Sana is with another girl (especially Asami). :Nanaka was a victim of a possible arson shortly after Sana left Sakuranomori, and lost both of her parents in the fire. She managed to escape with only her violin (which she stopped playing and kept only as a memento) and the sakura bracelet that Sana had given her. She claims not to remember anything of the events of that night. Her uncle and aunt took her in and made efforts to ensure that she didn't try to remember to spare her further pain. Events after Sana's return, however, start triggering buried memories and she comes to remember everything. Her father was unable to cope with the knowledge that her mother had been unfaithful to him with their very close friend a short time prior to their marriage. As a result, Nanaka's father immolated himself and his wife after knocking her senseless when she confirmed that Nanaka was in fact the result of the tryst and not his daughter after all, something that Nanaka's uncle had always suspected. (Nanaka's biological father was also her violin teacher.) Unable to cope with the burden of her returned memories, Nanaka attempts suicide but is discovered in time by Sana, who overcomes his fear of blood to save her. In the last episode of the anime, Sana proposes to her and she accepts. :In the game, her default romantic partner is Sana, as shown in \\"Sorezore no Finale\\". It is also revealed that she and Asami Hoshino are cousins, which surprises Hinako at first. She later comments that she knew there was some kind of a connection between them because they both had the same air to them. Nanaka dreams of becoming a professional violinist, which was inspired by Sana's suggestion as a child. ; : :Despite the fact that Sana calls her mother his aunt, Aoi and Sana are not related (in Japan it is common to refer to a woman older than oneself as oba-san, which is also the term used for an aunt). Her parents own the apartment building that Sana lives in. Her vision has weakened ever since she entered high school, so she now wears glasses. She loves to read books and is very energetic but clumsy. She has a very high-pitched voice and child-like character, but has a busty physique. Despite being childish, Aoi has a very caring personality, and never fails to aid a friend in need. Her dream is to become a picture-book author. This dream was inspired by Sana. ; : :Shuri is one of Sana's childhood friends and the older twin of Sh≈´suke. Yuzuki-sensei refers her as the unlucky Wakatsuki twin. She is the most athletic of all the girls, although she is somewhat lacking when it comes to her figure. Shuri is a very supportive friend and had no trouble reconnecting with Sana, even after his prolonged absence. She also volunteers at the local retirement home and later invites Asami to join her. In the anime, she and Sh≈´suke run away together, but come back in the final episode to see Nanaka's violin performance. The heroines of Myself ; Yourself (from left to right): Nanaka, Aoi, Shuri, Hinako, Yuzuki, and Asami. ; :, Ayano Niina (Sorezore no Finale) :Hinako is a ten-year-old girl going on eleven. She has been infatuated with Sh≈´suke since he saved her from three bullies who had taken her school bag and would not give it back. She wants to know how to become a girl that he will like and asks Sana and Aoi for their help. Hinako's personality is similar to Aoi's, however being only in the fifth grade, she is more childish. In the last anime episode, it is shown that she is the girlfriend of Asami's cousin, who is five years younger than she is. ; : :Yuzuki is the twenty-five-year-old homeroom teacher of Sana's class; Sh≈´suke, Nanaka, and Shuri are also in the same class. It is a well known secret that she rewards her students with caramel candy whenever they do a good job in school, whether it involves assigned duties or favors for her. This habit of rewarding her students with candy originated many years previously when she was still in high school and found a child attempting to perform a flip over a metal bar in the park (revealed to be Sana in the anime). She offered him a caramel as a reward if he succeeded, which, of course, he did. ; : :Asami is Sana's childhood friend and a second year student. Although she volunteers at the retirement home along with Shuri and seems to have a very gentle personality, she is in fact quite vindictive and takes revenge on people who hurt her. In the anime, she had a crush on Shuri and when she confessed to her, Shuri said that they should remain friends. Angered, Asami wrote a letter to the school accusing Shuri and her twin of being lovers. She later invites Shuri and Sana to the hospital to visit a sick woman from the retirement home in an attempt to hurt Shuri mentally.

Plot synopsis The story covers the journey of ex-soldier and State Department employee Harry Creek in his work to acquire a sheep of the Android's Dream breed for the coronation ceremony of an alien race known as the Nidu. The Nidu assert that unless a satisfactory sheep can be provided, the political and diplomatic fallout will cause the Nidu to declare war on Earth‚Äîa war Earth will lose badly. The genetically designed breed is very rare and believed extinct after a sect of Nidu intent on deposing the government exterminated all known samples, leading Harry on a chase to find one along with assistance from Brian, an AI based on Harry's childhood friend. The only surviving remnant of the Android's Dream turns out to be Robin Baker, a young lady who is the child of an Android's Dream sheep/human hybrid. At the center of the story is the Church of the Evolved Lamb, whose members recognize that its founding was a total scam, but are devoted to making its prophecies come true anyway. Harry slowly meets and befriends Robin after numerous attempts to capture her (most notably being a daring escape in Arlington Mall). They flee from a group out to kill her to derail the Nidu coronation, and hide on an instellar liner. The Nidu attack the liner to capture Robin, and Harry eventually surrenders on the stipulation that Robin not be harmed before or after the coronation. During this, the Earth government injunct with the Common Confederation courts that Robin Baker is not human, and actually the sole member of her own unique species, and entitled to protection from the CC. Being forced to participate in the ceremony, Robin sabotages the proceedings by declaring herself the new Nidu leader, and Brian the controller of the Nidu network, effectively turning control of the entire Nidu nation over to Brian. During this, the Church also declares that Robin is the Evolved Lamb, as she has completed a majority of their prophecies, effectively making her a living goddess, a sovereign, and the single richest person on earth over the course of several minutes.

Biography H. L. McInnes Herman McInnes was born in Saint John, New Brunswick and educated in Fredericton. He worked as a druggist for five years in that city and in Winnipeg after graduating high school. He studied Medicine at the Manitoba Medical College ‚Äî now part of the University of Manitoba - from which he graduated in 1886. He served as an assistant surgeon during the North-West Rebellion. He came to Edmonton in 1886 and took up the practice of medicine before going to Europe for further study from 1889 until 1892. He resumed his practice upon his return and also founded McInnes Lumber Company in 1902. He was elected to Edmonton City Council for a one year term as an alderman in the 1907 municipal election, in which he finished fifth out of twelve candidates. He was re-elected to two year terms in the 1908 election (finishing third of thirteen candidates) and the 1910 election (finishing third of eleven candidates), but the latter term was truncated when Edmonton amalgamated with Strathcona and elections were held for an entirely new council. These elections saw McInnes re-elected for a one year term, but he resigned May 7, 1912. That same year he retired from the practice of medicine to look after his other interests, which included the lumber company (which he sold in 1914) and prospecting for oil. He was a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Masonic Order, the Conservative Party, and the Edmonton Philharmonic Society.

It was first aired on ABC on 7 October 1967. The episode was directed by Sidney Hayers, and written by Philip Levene. Plot An important peace conference is being held in Britain in which the British delegate Sir Andrew Boyd is due to make a ground-breaking agreement for the future of international relations in Europe. Boyd arrives at the conference centre and is surrounded by crowds of photographers. Suddenly he begins acting strangely. In a disoriented way, he approaches the Conference room door and has a powerful premonition that he will be killed upon entering the door. He refuses to enter and rushes from the venue. Steed and Peel visit him and tell him to get some rest. Later, Boyd rings Steed after he has slept and tells him to drive very carefully down the hill on the way to visit him. On the way the brakes of the car Steed and Peel are in fail and they crash safely in the woods. Whilst Peel has the car attended to, Steed makes his way to Boyd where he demands an explanation for how Boyd knew he was going to crash. Boyd implies he thinks he is becoming psychic. The following day on the way to the conference, Boyd begins predicting events, from the button missing on the coat of the butler, and mentioning that he will see a lion before his death. Arriving at the rescheduled conference, Boyd again becomes disoriented but flees this time even before he enters the building and in doing so is killed by a passing car. The last thing he sees is a lion's head sculpture on the wall of the path approaching the building. Boyd is replaced by the younger Lord Melford who promises none of the nonsense that has just occurred. However, that night he has a nightmare, including seeing 12 o clock on a clock, his bathroom cabinet collapsing, a Friday the 13th calendar, a cut on the face of an associate, a broken-down elevator, men dropping a box when getting out of a truck, a cyclist being run down by his car, a handle coming off the briefcase, seeing a sinister looking foreigner before the Conference door, and finally seeing a large chandelier falling upon his head, killing him. The following day, every turn of events in his dream starts to come true to the point that as he approaches the conference room door and, like Boyd, he refuses to enter and leaves. He experiences a similar dream the following night and informs Steed and is so certain of his premonition that he will not attend the conference. Steed and Peel investigate by following the journey that Melford would have taken and they find events in his second dream such as the \\"sound of machines guns\\" (men drilling) and being splashed by a puddle from a passing car at the very time Melford would have approached the conference. Finally Steed is curious to find out who the sinister looking man is in his dream and he is identified by Melford as Albert Becker, a representative for the eastern bloc and gives him his address. Steed visits him and finds him practicing his rifle shooting, with deadly aim. When he asks Steed to set up new targets, he begins shooting at Steed who hides behind the shooting target area and lodges a bullet in one of the holes and fires it with a stone and stick killing his attacker as he approaches. He finds the address of a warehouse in Becker's jacket. Peel meanwhile investigates the broken down elevator and finds it has been tampered with and traces it, subduing the culprit and finding a tag with the same warehouse address. Peel arrives at the warehouse first and discovers that all of the items experienced in the delegates dreams are in fact reality and discovers that the warehouse contains nothing but props seen in the dreams, including a mock conference room and door. It appears that the delegates were drugged and brought to the warehouse in their sleep and programmed to scare them away from the conference by the perpetrators to delay it for political reasons. Peel and Steed bring Lord Melford to the warehouse and as they contemplate the situation they realize that the associate with the plaster over the cut on his face must be in on the act. They meet him just as he is leaving the abandoned conference and a struggle ensues and the chandelier in the room is weakened by a stray gunshot during the fight and ironically, the chandelier falls and kills the man who had dreamed up the scheme.

The conference center featured in the episode was shot at the Royal Masonic Senior School. Reception The episode is strongly based around the concept of surrealism. In fact, Tom Soter believes that the dreams were inspired by the Salvador Dal√≠ sequence in Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound (1945). The Avengers Forever! website acknowledged that a number of people do not rate the episode very highly, but remarked that \\"it is a very clever story, with some great twists and a nice little nail-biter in the middle. If I was forced to make gripe, it would be the lack of a real diabolical mastermind; but the especially effective nightmare-perspective scenes, populated by spooky \\"faceless dream men,\\" more than make up for that.\\" References External links Episode overview on The Avengers Forever! website *Watch episode Category:The Avengers (season 5) episodes ","title":"Death's Door"},{"id":"13085893","text":"403 \\"City of Calgary\\" (Helicopter) Operational Training Squadron (403 Sqn) is a squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) located at Canadian Forces Base Gagetown. It is equipped with CH-146 Griffons and provides operational aircrew training to the crews who will fly the helicopter. The squadron also conducts operational test and evaluation, develops aviation tactics and carries out operations in support of the 1 Wing mission. It also supports the local Army requirements of the Combat Training Centre. It was founded as No. 403 Squadron RCAF. A pilot will spend three months at Gagetown learning to fly the Griffon before being posted to one of 1 Wing's five operational squadrons. While at Gagetown, pilots learn advanced aircraft handling, including slinging and hoisting, tactical formation, flying and low-level tactical flying. History World War II Curtiss Tomahawk I in July 1941. No. 403 (Fighter) Squadron RCAF was formed at RAF Station Baginton (now Coventry Airport), Warwickshire, England, on 1 March 1941. The first squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) formed overseas under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP), it was identified by the letters KH. Initially equipped with the Curtiss Tomahawk I, they were replaced with the Supermarine Spitfire after only 29 operational sorties. Through continual replacement and updating, the squadron flew various models, Mk I through Mk XVI, of this very popular aircraft. It was flying a Mk IX Spitfire in 1943 that ace George \\"Screwball\\" Beurling scored his 30th air victory while flying with the squadron.Shores & Williams 1994, p.127 The squadron served in RAF Fighter Command and Second Tactical Air Force for over four years. By May 1945, the squadron had a record of 123 enemy aircraft destroyed, with a share in seven more, 10 probably destroyed, and 72 damaged with a share in one more. Ground targets destroyed or damaged included 30 tanks, 50 locomotives, and nearly 100 other vehicles. Sixteen Distinguished Flying Crosses (DFC), four DFC with Bar, and one Military Medal were awarded to members of the Squadron, in addition to a number of Mentions in Despatch. The \\"Wolf\\" Squadron and many other units paid a high price in lives and aircraft. Eighty-five aircraft were destroyed. 76 pilots were reported missing; of these, four were killed, 39 presumed dead, 21 captured, nine successfully evaded capture, and three (text missing from Wikipedia article). Battle honours The squadron has been awarded seven battle honours for its wartime service: * Defence of Britain 1941‚Äì1944 * English Channel and North Sea 1942 * Fortress Europe 1941‚Äì1944 F/O Lynn Garrison with 403 Squadron 9281, 1956. * France and Germany 1944‚Äì1945 * Dieppe 1944 * Normandy 1944 * Rhine 1944 Post-war period C-45 Expeditor Canadair CT-133 Silver Star Early in 1948, ex-Air Force officers in Calgary pressed for the formation of an Auxiliary Squadron in the city. An active campaign was undertaken and, in June 1948, the reformation, effective 15 October 1948, of 403 Auxiliary Squadron with a Fighter-Bomber designation was announced. Its primary role would be close support to the Army. Early pilots were highly experienced veterans with operational experience on a variety of aircraft. The reformed squadron was equipped with the Harvard MK II, and received the first of its North American P-51D Mustangs in the latter part of 1950. It would remain in service until 1958 when the type was retired from RCAF service. F/O Lynn Garrison was the last 403 pilot to fly the Mustang. In January 1952, the squadron enlisted its first female officer, P/O V.A. Harding. In September 1952, \\"City of Calgary\\" was incorporated into the squadron's title. In November 1953, the squadron's title was changed to \\"Fighter\\" Squadron. In October 1955 the squadron received its first jet, the Canadair CT-133 Silver Star. In June 1956, the squadron was informed that its role was to change and that it would be re-equipped with the C-45 Expediter and the DHC-3 Otter. In addition, it would move to Air Transport, and receive its first Navigator. The squadron transferred to Training Command, in December 1956, with the role of training a reserve of transport aircrew for the Auxiliary and Regular Forces. In February 1958, the squadron became a general Transport and Rescue Squadron responsible for operations in support of military and civilian requirements. During the summer of 1961, the squadron was advised that consideration was being given to equipping the Auxiliary units with helicopters. Nothing came of it but, for the squadron, it was a sign of things to come. Activated as Operational Training Squadron Bell CH-146 Griffon. In January 1968, the squadron was activated as 403 (Helicopter) Operational Training Squadron (Hel) OTS at Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Petawawa and was equipped with 10 CUH-1H helicopters. Once again, it was formed specifically to support the Land Forces. In July 1972, the squadron was given the role of training of aircrew and technical personnel for the Tactical Helicopter and Rescue Squadrons. To carry out its new role, the squadron joined 422 Squadron at CFB Gagetown and was equipped with 11 CH-135 Twin Huey and 10 CH-136 Kiowa helicopters. In August 1980, the squadron gained aircrew and support personnel from the disbandment of 422 Squadron. In August 1980, the Air Ground Operations School was formed to provide advance training for future Flight Commanders and Operations Officers. Renamed Aviation Tactics Flight in June 1995, the Flight continues to provide this training, and aviation support to the Combat Training Centre, 1 Wing and the Air Force. As a Rotary Wing Aviation Unit, the squadron conducted two rotations of the Multinational Force and Observers. Renewing Air Reserve relationship In July 1990, the squadron renewed its post-war relationship with the Air Reserves. At that time the Combat Training Centre (CTC) Gagetown Detachment of the CFB Chatham Air Reserve Augmentation Flight (ARAF) took up residence in the squadron. The flight became an integral part of the Squadron in 1996.403 RCAF Squadron Otter, Burnt Stick Lake, Alberta 1963 Renamed the Air Reserve Section in 1998, the squadron's reservists are incorporated into and provide support to all flights. In August 1992 the Land Aviation Test and Evaluation Flight (LATEF) was formed to conduct, on behalf of 10 Tactical Air Group (10 TAG), operational and tactical testing of land aviation helicopter systems and support equipment, and to propose operational and tactical doctrine where applicable. It quickly evolved into a valuable asset and has been integrally involved in the testing and improvement of CH-146 Griffon systems. The Kiowa and Twin Huey were phased out of the squadron by the end of 1994 and early 1995 respectively and were replaced by the CH-146 Griffon in March 1995. The squadron became the first operational CH-146 unit in 10 TAG in October 1995. In October 1996, a full motion flight simulator was added to the squadron's establishment.

The highway heads northeast, through hilly regions before reaching the northern terminus at Interstate 70 in Union Township. Interstate 70 continues north to get to the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and south to pass into Maryland. PA 731 was originally signed in 1930. It was assigned to a series of local roads in northwestern Philadelphia. It was numbered this way until the PA 731 designation was removed in 1952. In 1964, the route was designated onto its current alignment. Route description PA 731 begins at an intersection with Pennsylvania Route 484 in the rural farmlands of Union Township. The highway, locally known as Fairview Road, progresses northeast and intersects with Zach's Ridge Road for the first time. Here, the highway turns left. After passing through a small wooded area, PA 731 comes to another intersection with McKees Gap Road, at which point it makes a right turn. The route now turns due east, and the woods break up at this point. A short distance later the road comes to the northern end of Zach's Ridge Road and soon after that Henderson Road, which is a long connector back to PA 484. Immediately after this, PA 731 comes to its final destination at Interstate 70. Interstate 70 goes south towards the Pennsylvania / Maryland border and north to the Pennsylvania Turnpike.

The route was around 4 miles long and included some of the larger, unmarked roads in the area. Later, in 1947, the route's eastern terminus was moved from Glenside to Fox Chase. Five years later, the PA 731 designation was removed. In 1964, the route was designated onto its current alignment in Fulton County.

It is home to the Scrub Island Resort Marina and Spa.  Geography  Scrub Island is located approximately east of Puerto Rico (eastern Fajardo, Puerto Rico to Scrub Island), NE of Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas of the U.S. Virgin Islands, and North of Trellis Bay (Trellis Bay dock and Scrub Island Marina). Formed by volcanic activity, Scrub Island is long and made up of a total which includes Big Scrub () and Little Scrub (). The mountainous island highest eastern peak reaches and the highest western peak reaches .  History  Earliest inhabitants that paddled up from South America were recorded about 5000 years ago on Scrub Island. At this time, Scrub was presumably connected to Great Camanoe and Marina Cay Island because sea level was significantly lower. The first record of Territory was claimed by the Arawak Indians who had left traces of Arawak pottery around 200BC, and they were preceded by Ciboney Indians who settled in nearby St. Thomas in 300 BC. The European discovery of the British Virgin Islands is attributed to Christopher Columbus. During his second voyage on 2 November 1493, small islands now known as the Lesser Antilles were discovered, one of which was Scrub Island. For many years after the discovery, the islands were untouched until privateers, pirates and buccaneers used the island as a haven. Concrete evidence also shows buried pirate treasures. During the early 17th century, the Dutch expressed interest in the copper mines that were discovered, but due to the Dutch‚Äôs interest in piracy and a Spanish attack, the settlement was economically unsuccessful. In 1672, the British took control. Presently, Scrub Island is occupied by Scrub Island Resort Marina and Spa which first development in the British Virgin Islands in the last 15 years. In late 2013 the Scrub Island Resort went into bankruptcy protection in the United States, and was locked in dispute with its primary lender, FirstBank, after receivers were appointed in the British Virgin Islands in relation to unpaid loans made to the Resort. The resort emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2015.  Scrub Island Resort, Spa & Marina  Scrub Island Resort, Spa & Marina Scrub Island Resort, Spa & Marina is a luxury private island resort built in 2010 and was the first resort development to be built in the British Virgin Islands in more than 15 years. It has 52 guest accommodations as well as a collection of two-, three- and four-bedroom villas, Ixora Spa, restaurants, three private beaches and a 55-slip marina. The master planned resort was designed by architecture firm OBM International USA for Mainsail Development International. Scrub Island is fringed by three beaches that shelve into the Caribbean Sea. It features protected coves, nature trails and scenery. The island is virtually vehicle-free with resort shuttles serving as the primary form of transportation.  Accommodations  Scrub Island Resort accommodations consist of 26 guest rooms; 26, one- and two-bedroom suites; and a collection of hillside villas. Marina Suite, Scrub Island Resort, Spa & Marina  Watersports/Marina  Scrub Island Resort‚Äôs marina offers 55 slips available for lease or transient docking, including five for mega yachts up to 170 feet. Marina Scrub Island Resort, Spa & Marina The shallows surrounding Scrub Island, as well as many nearby coves, bays, reefs and inlets, are used by snorkelers and divers. Dive BVI, Scrub Island Resort, Spa & Marina  Restaurants and Dining  The Resort features a number of restaurants.  Bankruptcy  On 1 November 2013 the primary lender to the development, FirstBank, sought orders of the Commercial Court in the British Virgin Islands appointing a receiver over the Resort due to the failure by the Resort to make repayments on over US$100 million of loans. The Resort did not comply with the order, but instead sought bankruptcy protection from the U.S. courts, and a Chapter 11 order was made on 20 November 2013. The Resort appeared to have reached an agreement with the bank in relation to the restructuring of the debts, but that agreement collapsed in acrimony in late 2014 with the bank claiming that it had been materially mislead. The resort emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2015.  Sale  In December 2015 it was announced that the Resort would sell the larger currently undeveloped side of the island currently referred to by the Resort as Big Scrub.  Travel to Scrub Island  The most convenient international airport to Scrub Island is San Juan, Puerto Rico. From San Juan, guests can take a connecting flight with Cape Air, Air Sunshine or Island Birds Air Charters to Beef Island/Tortola (airport code: EIS). Scrub Island is a seven-minute ride from Tortola via the resort‚Äôs private launch. Additional options include flights into St. Thomas with a 45-min. ferry ride to Tortola or St. Martin offering convenient connections. Scrub Island also has two heliports available to guests.

They had a short period of fame traveling around the United States performing for night clubs, theatres, radio shows, and eventually left the US to tour in Europe. Dorothy Dandridge, however, decided to become a solo artist, so the band split up and each woman then pursued small projects individually.  Claim to fame  Both Vivian and Dorothy Dandridge originally made up the band \\"The Wonder Children\\", organized by their mother, Ruby Dandridge (also a performer) in Cleveland, Ohio. When they added Etta Jones to the group, they changed their name to ‚ÄúThe Dandridge Sisters,‚Äù and moved to Los Angeles, California. They originally began performing as aspiring dancers, after studying at the Loretta Butler School of Dance and the Nash Dancing Company in Los Angeles, as well as the Mary Bruce School of Ballet in Chicago, Illinois. However, the trio decided to enter into a radio show contest at KNX Radio in Los Angeles just for the fun, and ended up winning over more than 30 white contestants. This brought them recognition in the music world as singers. They began performing shows around Los Angeles in various night clubs and theatres, and then were invited by Joe Glazer (the promoter for the Cotton Club) to perform at the Cotton Club in New York City alongside other famous musicians. They decided to move to New York with their mother, Ruby Dandridge, although they were each only 14 years old at the time. They were so well-liked at the Cotton Club that they were given a regular spot on the show.\\"Look Alike- but Just a Little Different,\\" Afro-American, April 22, 1939, p. 11.  Career  The trio became highly recognized as a musical trio at the Cotton Club and were often compared to another famous group, the Andrews Sisters. Although the Dandridge Sisters studied as dancers, their music career led them to study music more technically so as to be more stable artists. After working in New York, they began to be chaperoned by their aunt, Geneva Williams, rather than their mother. They moved to the islands of Hawaii for five months performing a show, and then moved back to Hollywood to work on musical shorts. In Hollywood, they worked for MGM and appeared in Going Places (1938) featuring Louis Armstrong. They then went back to New York to perform at the Cotton Club and other nightclubs and theatres. They eventually went to Europe in 1939 to perform and travel around in cities in England and Ireland. They performed at the London Palladium in a show with the Jack Harris Orchestra and a comedian named Jack Durant. However, Europe was preparing for war at the time and the sisters admitted to many dangers on their trip.\\"We Passed 12 Subs: Coming Back From Europe\\", Afro-American, September 23, 1939, p. 1.\\"Chic, Pretty, and Talented,\\" The Chicago Defender, December 2, 1939, p. 20. When they came back, they hit the height of their stardom in 1940. They toured around with Jimmie Lunceford and his big band orchestra, and recorded four songs with them.\\"Recordings\\", The Chicago Defender, December 14, 1940, p. 21.\\"They're a Hit on the Coast\\", The Chicago Defender, April 6, 1940, p. 20.  The Sisters' relationship  Vivian Dandridge acted as the leader of the group, in that she arranged all the meetings, rehearsals, and was the group‚Äôs spokeswoman. The sisters all mentioned that they spent much of their spare time (when not performing) dancing and making scrapbooks. The three were all seemingly religious (Etta was Catholic) and attended church each Sunday in every city they visited. They claimed to make all of their decisions as a musical trio after consulting in a group, but on the whole, the three girls were very similar. They claimed to have very similar opinions on everything including the way they dressed and their daily habits. They also said that they all preferred to be successful women in their musical career rather than seek out love and marriage.  Vivian Dandridge  After the trio broke up and stopped performing together in 1940, Vivian performed in a few movie roles. She was an extra in the movie Stormy Weather (1943), and the voice of \\"So White\\" in a controversial cartoon short Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs (1943). She then released an album called The Look of Love in 1968, but it was unsuccessful. She lived in Seattle for the last eight years of her life, but changed her stage name to ‚ÄúMarina Rozell‚Äù, after her third marriage. She seldom performed any longer except at open-mic nights. She died at the age of 70 in 1991 from a very sudden stroke.  Dorothy Dandridge  Dorothy often went by the nickname \\"Dot\\" while in the Dandridge Sisters. After quitting the group, Dorothy became the most successful of the trio. She began getting many minor roles in Hollywood films and became known as the African-American Marilyn Monroe. She was the first African-American woman to receive a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress for the title role in Carmen Jones in 1954. Porgy and Bess (1959), in which Dorothy played Bess, was another large role for her, after which her career went downhill. Her second marriage, to Jack Denison (after her first husband Harold Nicholas), ended poorly, and she developed an alcohol problem. On September 8, 1965, she was found dead in her apartment, poisoned from an overdose of barbiturates. She had written her will four months earlier and given it to her manager.\\"Dorothy Dandridge (1922‚Äì1965)\\" , IMDb.\\"44 Word Handwritten Will of Miss Dandridge Filed\\", New York Times, October 12, 1965, p. 58.\\"Samuel Goldwyn's 'Porgy and Bess' Has Premiere at Warner: Sidney...\\", New York Times, June 25, 1929, p. 20.  Etta Jones  Etta Jones, a native of Lake Charles, Louisiana, was born in 1919 (but is often confused with the other jazz singer Etta Jones born in 1928). She attended both of Dorothy Dandridge‚Äôs weddings. Little other information is known about her whereabouts after the splitting up of the Dandridge Sisters. It is known, however, that she did sing with the Jimmy Lunceford orchestra for some time, as her first husband, trumpeter Gerald Wilson was a member of the group. After retiring to raise a family, Etta later worked for the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation, teaching dance to young children in the parks and playgrounds. She died of heart failure in Los Angeles on June 29, 1997.Listing for Etta Jones in Imdb.com https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0428053/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm  Film  The sisters performed in a few films, including: * The Big Broadcast of 1936 (1936) * A Day at the Races (1937) * Easy to Take (1937) * It Can't Last Forever (1937) * Going Places (1938) * Snow Gets in Your Eyes (1938) * Irene (1940)  Recordings  The only known recorded songs that the Dandridge Sisters made on vinyl were \\"Undecided\\" (1939),\\"Undecided - Dandridge Sisters July 1939\\", YouTube. and \\"If I Were Sure Of You\\" recorded for the Parlophone label while they were in London, and \\"Minnie the Moocher is Dead\\", \\"You Ain‚Äôt Nowhere\\", \\"Ain‚Äôt Goin to Study War No More\\", and \\"That‚Äôs Your Red Wagon\\", which they recorded in 1940 with Jimmie Lunceford and his big band orchestra while they were on tour with him.

Vaillant that describes two multi-decade studies of the lives of 600 American males, non-alcoholics at the outset, focusing on their lifelong drinking behaviours. By following the men from youth to old age it was possible to chart their drinking patterns and what factors may have contributed to alcoholism. Another study followed 100 severe alcoholics from a clinic eight years after their detoxification. The National Review hailed the first edition (1983) as \\"a genuine revolution in the field of alcoholism research\\" and said that \\"Vaillant has combined clinical experience with an unprecedented amount of empirical data to produce what may ultimately come to be viewed as the single most important contribution to the literature of alcoholism since the first edition of AA's Big Book.\\"Teachout, 1984 Some of the main conclusions of Vaillant's book are: * That alcoholism is as much a social as a medical condition. \\"Alcoholism can simultaneously reflect both a conditioned habit and a disease.\\"Vaillant 1995, p 376. * Factors predicting alcoholism were related to ethnic culture, alcoholism in relatives, and a personality that is antisocial and extroverted. An unhappy childhood predicted mental illness but not alcoholism‚Äîunless the family problems were due to alcoholism. * That alcoholism was generally the cause of co-occurring depression, anxiety, and sociopathic (delinquent) behaviour, not the result. * That even though alcoholism is not solely a medical condition, it is therapeutically effective to explain it as a disease to patients. The disease concept encourages patients to take responsibility for their drinking, without debilitating guilt. * That for most alcoholics, attempts at controlled drinking in the long term end in either abstinence or a return to alcoholism. * That there is as yet no cure for alcoholism, and that medical treatment can only provide short-term crisis intervention. * Achieving long-term sobriety usually involves (1) a less harmful, substitute dependency; (2) new relationships; (3) sources of inspiration and hope; and (4) experiencing negative consequences of drinking.Vaillant 1995, p 241-244 Background Study Samples Core City: In 1940, Sheldon and Eleanour Glueck of Harvard began a major study of juvenile delinquency in teens from Boston ‚Äî mostly poor kids in tenements, half without a bathtub in their homes.Goodwin 1984 The control group for the study comprised 456 boys who were assessed as non- delinquent. In 1974 this control group, which Vaillant referred to as the Core City sample, was turned over to him to continue research. The Core City group had a mean IQ of 95, and 48% graduated from high school. College: In 1976 Vaillant inherited another study of more than 200 Harvard sophomores started in 1938‚Äîthe College sample. The sophomores were white males, selected because they were high achievers and had no known medical or psychological problems. The College sample had a mean IQ of 130, and 76% attended graduate school. Their 1976 mean income was three times that of the Core City group.Vaillant 2003, p 1044. The research eventually showed that for the Core City sample at age 60, 36% had abused alcohol at some time in their lives; for the College sample at age 70, the figure was 22%.Vaillant 1995, p 131. The samples were narrow (\\"male, white, American, and born between 1919 and 1932.\\"Vaillant 1995, p 317) but were followed for a long period. As critics and Vaillant himself pointed out, the samples did not include important segments of the population such as African-Americans and women.Saunders, 1884.Note that in this article alcoholics will be referred to as male to reflect the bias of the samples. Both samples likely excluded those who began abusing alcohol in early adolescence.Vaillant 1995, p 312 The Clinic sample was a group of 100 severe alcoholics who were detoxified at clinic in an urban, municipal hospital (Cambridge Hospital) in Massachusetts during the winter of 1971-1972.Vaillant 1995, p 188 The treatment was carried out under what was known as the CASPAR program‚ÄîCambridge-Somerville Program for Alcohol Rehabilitation. This group was followed for 8 years to measure the effectiveness of the treatment.

To diagnose full-blown alcoholism‚Äîi.e. alcohol dependence‚Äîhe used DSM III, which requires either physical tolerance or physiological withdrawal.Vaillant 1995, p 29 & 32. For the 1995 edition he abandoned the PDS and used the DSM definitions of both abuse and alcoholism. Longitudinal study A longitudinal study is one that follows test subjects over a long period of time ‚Äî as opposed to a cross-sectional study, which gives a 'snap-shot' of a group at one point in time. Longitudinal studies tend to examine smaller groups in greater detail, whereas cross- sectional studies are often based on a more representative segment of the population over a short time. The longitudinal method was useful in identifying factors in alcoholism, for instance by investigating whether delinquent behaviour started before or after drinking. Prospective study A prospective study is forward-looking and includes subjects who did not originally have symptoms of the disease being studied. Many retrospective, or backward-looking, studies might take a group of alcoholics and try to determine what common traits might have caused their alcoholism. A prospective study takes a group of healthy individuals and tries to predict which ones would become alcoholic based on their histories‚Äîa much broader technique that often yields surprising results.Goodwin 1894. Techniques for research on alcoholics Alcoholics present special challenges for researchers because they are good at concealing their drunkenness.Vaillant 1995, p 362 Vaillant asserts that \\"Alcoholics are expert forgetters,\\"Vaillant 1995, p 240. have inaccurate memories,Vaillant 1995, p 24. and give persuasive denials that manifest \\"an extraordinary ability to deny the consequences of their drinking.\\"Vaillant 1995, p 292 For effective interviews, the subject should first be relatively sober. The interviewer should ask non-threatening, non- judgmental questions that do not challenge the alcoholic's right to drinkVaillant 1995, p 33. and that minimise guilt.Vaillant 1995, p 364 (Failure to observe these guidelines by medical professionals has likely contributed to alcoholics‚Äô reputation for denial.Vaillant 1995, p 33) Interviewers should ask for objective evidence. For example, if an alcoholic claims that his divorce led to him drinking, the interviewer could ask if the alcoholic's spouse ever complained of his drinking before they split.Vaillant 1995, p 77. Interviews and questionnaires should always be backed up with interviews with the subject's family, with consultation of medical records, and with searches in public records for evidence of legal problems associated with drinking. Book summary Medical or behavioural disorder? A major focus in the book was a comparison of the various definitions of alcoholism: *the medical model, which focuses on the individual's physical addiction and on symptoms such as ulcers or cirrhosis of the liver; *the behavioural model, which focuses on alcoholism as an individual choice that may be influenced by environmental factors; *the sociological model, which focuses on the problems the subject creates in society, such as abuse to family members or arrests for drunk driving; and *common sense concepts such as \\"a person is likely an alcoholic if they admit it and have been diagnosed in a clinic.\\"Vaillant 1995, p 37. The first interesting observation was that there is no sharp dividing line between alcoholics and non-alcoholics. The number of drinking problems is spread out along a scale, just like IQ and blood pressure; there is not a cluster of alcoholics at the top end of the scale.Vaillant 1995, p 35-36. Vaillant compiled indicators of alcoholism from many sources, medical and sociological, and applied them to the Core City drinkers. Possible criteria includedVaillant 1995, p 31. *frequency of intoxication; *binge drinking; *complaints from spouses, friends, bosses, or police; *accidents and legal problems; *attempts at ‚Äúgoing on the wagon‚Äù; *clinical diagnosis; *admits problems; *the ‚Äòmorning shakes‚Äô; and *health problems. Statistical techniques were used to determine which, if any, of the criteria were the best indicators of alcoholism.Vaillant 1995, p 39-40. Surprisingly, the answer was that all criteria were of roughly equal importance.Vaillant 1995, p 36. No particular indicator or cluster of indicators predominated: it was the number and frequency of problems that best defined alcoholism. More importantly, the medical, sociological, and behavioural criteria were equally reliable (i.e. highly correlated).Vaillant 1995, p 37-39. In other words, it was equally valid to call alcoholism a medical or a behavioural disorder‚Äîevidence that doctors and sociologists are indeed talking about the same ‚Äúunitary disorder‚Äù. There are some grounds, Vaillant argues, for considering alcoholism a medical disease in the most severe cases. As the disorder worsens, conscious choice becomes less and less important and the alcoholic needs medical assistance to detoxify without risk to life (unlike, for example, heroin, which poses less physical danger to addicts going ‚Äòcold turkey‚Äô).Vaillant 1995, p 19 In this respect, alcoholism resembles coronary heart disease, which starts as ‚Äòvoluntary‚Äô, unhealthy behaviours such as poor diet and lack of exercise, but ends in a life-threatening medical condition. Causes of alcoholism Public opinion has it that alcoholics drink because they have underlying anxiety, unhappy childhoods, and lack of self-control.O.Reilly 1983. However Vaillant's results indicated that some \\"obvious\\" causes of alcoholism such as anxiety or unhappy childhoods, were not significantVaillant 1995, p 47 and that the alcoholic personality‚Äîself-centered, immature, dependent, resentful, and irresponsible‚Äîwas not evident until after the subjects had started to abuse alcoholVaillant 1995, p 51 and 76. The type of personality found most likely to become alcoholic was antisocial and extroverted, although most antisocial behaviour observed was a result of alcoholism. The presence or absence of childhood environmental strengths predicted which of the College men would take tranquilizers or require medicine for physical complaints, but did not predict alcoholism.Vaillant 1995, p 58 and 73 Unhappy family environments caused alcoholism only if the unhappy environments were the result of alcoholism in the first place.Vaillant 1995, p 84, 86-88, and 96-98. The ethnic culture of each man was important. Among the Core City subjects, 61% of whose parents were born in foreign countries,Vaillant 1995, p 60 alcoholics were seven times more likely to have Irish than Italian backgrounds.Vaillant 1995, p61. In general, more alcoholics came from countries such as Ireland that prohibited drinking among children but condoned adult drunkenness. Fewer alcoholics came from countries such as Italy that allowed children to drink, especially at meals, and looked down on adult drunkenness.Vaillant 1995, p 63 Alcoholism in ancestors was a factor. Men with several alcohol-abusing ancestors (i.e. not members of immediate family) were twice as likely to become alcoholics as those with none.Vaillant 1995, p 67. The presence of an alcoholic parent increased the risk of alcoholism by three times, although it was not clear from the data if the factors were genetic or environmental. Other miscellaneous factors leading to alcohol dependence Vaillant 1995, p 110 - 112. included the rapidity with which the alcohol reaches the brain (\\"gives a high\\"); jobs such as journalism that encourage drinking because they have no daily structure; drinking behaviour in one's social group; legal availability of alcohol; cost of alcohol; and social stability‚Äîin other words medical, environmental, social, and economic factors.Vaillant 1995, p 114. Depression, clinically so often found to occur with alcoholism,Vaillant 1995, p 84 was likewise found to be a result of alcoholism. Evidence such as this indicated that alcoholism is not merely a symptom of an underlying disorder, but is an independent disorder in itself. Natural history of alcoholism Contrary to popular conception, alcoholism does not start with the first drink, but usually has a gradual onset over 5 to 15 years of continuous alcohol abuse.Vaillant 1995, p 119 and 156 One surprise to Vaillant was the number of men who were able to abuse alcohol for decades without becoming dependent.Vaillant 2003, p 1047. Of 29 alcohol abusers in the College sample, seven men were able to drink heavily for a mean of three decades without showing symptoms of dependence. The average age of onset of alcohol abuse was 29 years for the Core City men and 41 years for the College men. Full blown alcoholism, where it appeared, usually lasted a decade or two before sobriety was attained. The number of alcoholics increased steadily until age 40 and then began to declineVaillant 1996, p 157-158 at a rate of stable remission of 2 to 3% per year. Older alcoholics are relatively rare because of the rate of remission and a higher mortality rate. Seventy-two alcoholics in the Core City sample were successfully followed to age 70. By this age 54% had died, 32% were abstinent, 1% were controlled drinkers, and 12% were still abusing alcohol. By comparison 19 alcoholics in the College sample were successfully followed to age 70. By this age 58% had died, 21% were abstinent, 10.5% were controlled drinkers, and 10.5% were still abusing alcohol.Vaillant 2003, p 1043. On the topic of whether controlled drinking is advisable as a therapeutic goal, Vaillant concluded that \\"training alcohol- dependent individuals to achieve stable return to controlled drinking is a mirage.\\"Vaillant 1996, p 383. Successful return to controlled drinking is possible, just a rare and unstable outcome that in the long term usually ends in relapse or abstinence, especially for the more severe cases.Vaillant 1996, p 167, 170, 233, and 297. Vaillant tracked two samples within his study group: 21 alcohol abusers who had attained stable abstinence, and 22 who had returned to a stable pattern of controlled drinking. At the end of 15 years of follow- up, in 1995, one of the 21 abstainers had returned to controlled drinking, and one had relapsed. In contrast, of the 22 controlled drinkers 3 became abstinent and 7 relapsed.Vaillant 1996, p 294. For the less severe cases, Vaillant concluded that controlled drinking is a worthwhile and valid goal, but \\"by the time an alcoholic is ill enough to require clinic treatment, return to asymptomatic drinking is the exception not the rule.\\" Clinical Treatment In the Clinic sample, 100 severe alcoholics treated at the clinic were followed for 8 years. The clinic's methods were multi-modal: detoxification and hospital treatment followed by referral to AA. At the end of the 8 years, 34% of subjects had achieved stable abstinence, 29% had died, and 26% were still abusing alcohol,Vaillant 1996, p 158. and the evidence was that other clinical studies had reported similar lack of success.Vaillant 1995, p 352. Subjects who had a stable social environment or who frequently went to AA meetings had the highest rates of abstinence. Overall, however, treatment other than AA did not significantly improve the subjects‚Äô outcome.Vaillant 1996, p 158 In fact Vaillant reports the dismal fact that fully 95% of the Clinic sample had relapsed at some time during the 8-year study period.Vaillant 1995, p 350.Note that the figure of 95%‚Äîthe number of clinical patients who relapsed at any time during the 8 year study‚Äîhas been quoted on some personal websites as evidence that AA is ineffective. Vaillant noted that clinical treatment helped only in the short term, as crisis intervention and detox. There was one indicator, a financial one, of short- term success: clinical intervention had significantly reduced the cost of future health care for the alcoholics.Vaillant 1995, p 360-361. Vaillant's conclusion was that ‚ÄúThere is compelling evidence that the results of our treatment were no better than the natural history of the disease.‚ÄùVaillant 1996, p 350. If clinical treatment had failed to improve on the long-term recovery rates of alcoholics, then what would be the most hopeful route to sobriety? Paths to recovery Research by Vaillant and others found that there were no obvious factors or personality differences to distinguish alcoholics from abstainers; ‚ÄúTo a large extent, relapse to and remission from alcoholism remains a mystery.‚ÄùVaillant 1996, p 252 and 371. As was observed in the 1940s in patients with tuberculosis‚Äîat that time incurable‚Äîrecovery depended largely on the patient's own resistance and morale. The same applies to alcoholism, which at present still has no known ‚Äòcure‚Äô. As with diabetes, professional help is in training to prevent a relapseVaillant 1996, p 252 and 385. and in crisis intervention until patients are strong enough to heal themselves.Vaillant 1996, p 384. If natural forces are dominant in the healing process, then treatment should aim to strengthen and support these natural forces, Vaillant argued. The alcoholic needs support in making the required personality change. Thus, achieving long-term sobriety usually involves # finding a substitute dependency, such as group attendance; # experiencing negative consequences of drinking, such as legal problems or a painful ulcer; # new, close relationships and social support; # a source of inspiration and hope such as a religious group. Vaillant argues that an important contribution health professionals can make is to explain alcoholism to patients as a disease,Vaillant 1996, p 366 and 378. which encourages the patient to take responsibility for their problem without debilitating guilt, in the same way that a diabetic becomes responsible for proper self care when they become aware of their condition.Vaillant 1996, p 385. Alcoholics Anonymous Vaillant, who is a non-alcoholic Trustee of AA, made the effectiveness of AA one of the key questions to be investigated in his research.Vaillant 1996, p 10. Vaillant argues that AA and other similar groups effectively harness the above four factors of healing and that many alcoholics achieve sobriety through AA attendance. However, he also notes that the ‚Äúeffectiveness of AA has not been adequately assessed‚ÄùVaillant 1995, p 255. and that ‚Äúdirect evidence for the efficacy of AA‚Ä¶ remains as elusive as ever.Vaillant 1995, p 265. For example, if an alcoholic achieves sobriety during AA attendance, who is to say if AA helped or if he merely went to AA when he was ready to heal?Vaillant 1995, p 253. Vaillant 1996, p 158. In the Clinic sample, 48% of the 29 alcoholics who achieved sobriety eventually attended 300 or more AA meetings,Vaillant 1995, p 257. and AA attendance was associated with good outcomes in patients who otherwise would have been predicted not to remit.Vaillant 1995, p 268. In the Core City sample the more severe alcoholics attended AA, possibly because all other avenues had failed‚Äîafter all, AA meetings are rarely attended for hedonistic reasons.Vaillant 1996, p 262-263. The implication from all three samples was simply that many alcoholics find help through AA.Vaillant 1995, p 388. Book reviews Vaillant‚Äôs academic peers saw The Natural History of Alcoholism as ‚Äúobjective, scholarly, and factual,‚ÄùSaunders, 1984 ‚Äúwise‚Äù and ‚Äúcomprehensive‚Äù,Goodwin, 1984 an ‚Äúoutstanding and highly recommended text‚Äù,Mendelson, 1996 and ‚Äúone of the few [longitudinal studies] and by far the most thorough and scientific.‚ÄùRoyce, 1983. James Royce wrote that Vaillant \\"cites innumerable studies and examines opposing viewpoints on every issue,\\" but that this objectivity made the book harder to read for the general reader since the conclusions were difficult to extract. There were varying opinions on the book's readability. According to David N. Saunders ‚ÄúThe book is hard to follow because so much research material is included.‚ÄùSaunders, 1984. The New York Times advised that the casual reader should skip over most of the technical discussion,Lehmann-Haupt, 1983. whereas The National Review noted only an ‚Äúoccasional thicket of psycho- statistical jargon.‚ÄùTeachout, 1984. Royce wrote that Vaillant failed to summarize new (in 1983) research findings on alcohol's interaction with the brain, and that Vaillant had not quoted some notable researchers who have argued for the disease model of alcoholism.Royce 1983. Saunders held that more discussion of the treatment issues was needed and noted that many of the measurements made before Vaillant took over the studies were very crude. Perhaps the sharpest critic of Vaillant's work was controlled drinking proponent Stanton Peele. In a 1983 review in The New York Times, Peele wrote that \\"The results of this research do not provide ready support for the disease theory of alcoholism. ... [For example, Vaillant] finds strong evidence in the inner city group for sociocultural causality in alcoholism.\\"Peele, 1983 In his book Diseasing of America Peele claimed that \\"Vaillant emphatically endorses the disease model... He sees alcoholism as a primary disease... However, Vaillant's claims are not supported by his own data.\\"Peele 1989, p68. Other reviewers held the opposite, that Vaillant did not see alcoholism as a disease. Addiction researcher James E. Royce wrote that \\"Vaillant avoids a simplistic medical model of alcoholism, pointing up instead its complexity as a socio-psycho-biological illness.\\"Royce, 1983 David N. Saunders of the School of Social Work, Virginia Commonwealth University, wrote that Vaillant \\"maintains that alcoholism is both a disease and a behaviour disorder.\\"Saunders 1983 In his summary at the end of the book, Vaillant in fact wrote that \\"Alcoholism can simultaneously reflect both a conditioned habit and a disease; and the disease of alcoholism can be as well defined by a sociological model as by a medical model.\\"Vaillant 1995, p 376 [original, 1983 text] Footnotes References *Bower, Bruce (1993). \\"Alcoholics offer surprises in long run\\" (review of The Natural History of Alcoholism Revisited).

History Discovery III came into being in 1987 as a result of increased tour traffic to the Riverboat Discovery. Due to increased passenger numbers, the company frequently had to turn away potential guests due to the limited capacity of Discovery II, their primary tour boat. As a result, in 1986 Captain Jim Binkley and his three sons began planning for the construction of a third sternwheeler for the company, which would be named Discovery III. Plans for Discovery III were finalized by the fall of 1986, and the Binkley family hired the Nichols Brothers Boat Builders, Inc. to build the superstructure of the boat's hulls and decks. Construction began in the late fall of 1986 at the Nichols Brothers shipyard in Whidbey Island, Washington. Construction of Discovery III was completed 8 months later, in early May 1987. The boat was christened May 9, 1987, in Langley, Washington, and afterward was taken by barge north to the mouth of the Yukon River at St. Marys, Alaska.Madonna, James. 1999.

History Live In Tokyo was the only live record to be released by the Hughes Turner Project. The album was recorded at the Shibuya Club Quattro in Tokyo, Japan on May the 17th and 19th 2002 on the first leg of their tour to support their debut album HTP. The set-list comprises four songs from the HTP album as well as other songs from both Hughes and Turner‚Äôs back catalogues including Deep Purple, Rainbow and Black Sabbath numbers. For the most part the two sing their own songs solo, only performing duets on the HTP songs. For the Japanese leg of tour the pair were joined by native musicians Akira Kajiyama (guitar), Toshio Egawa (keyboards) and Yoshihiro Kudo (drums). While Kajiyama had contributed some guitar solos to the HTP album, the others had not taken part in its recording and this is the only Hughes Turner Project release they appear on. The European version of the album included the studio track Against The Wall, which had originally been released as the bonus track on the Japanese version of HTP.

It consists of thousands of pieces of quartzite laid in the shape of a large bird. Although it is most often referred to as a hawk, scholars do not know exactly what type of bird the original builders intended to portray. Only two such effigy mounds have been found east of the Mississippi River. The other, known as Rock Eagle, is also located in Putnam County, approximately thirteen miles to the northwest. () The physical condition of Rock Hawk is far below that of its 'sister' site. Viewers must use a degree of imagination to see a bird ‚Äî let alone a hawk ‚Äî in the remains. Scholars do not know if there was greater degradation of the Rock Hawk site, greater preservation or reconstruction at Rock Eagle (which is by far the more famous of the two and a greater 'attraction'), or a combination of these or other factors. Current archaeology suggests that the site was built between 1,000 and 3,000 years ago by Woodland Indians. These Native Americans may have been part of the Adena or Hopewell cultures, although it is more likely that they represented a unique group. To protect the site, access to the mound is prohibited, and it is surrounded by a tall fence. The Georgia Power company manages the area. It maintains an easily accessible parking area near the mound, as well as a network of hiking trails and other recreational amenities in the area. Visitors are permitted to visit the mound free of charge. The site is located along Wallace Dam Road, off State Route 16, several miles east of Eatonton, near the shores of the manmade Lake Oconee.

Background and history Nicky Jam was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts to a Dominican mother and Puerto Rican father. While in Massachusetts, he developed an affinity for hip-hop, specifically East Coast acts Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch and LL Cool J. When Nicky Jam was ten years old, his family moved to the R√≠o Hondo suburb of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Nicky Jam initially experienced culture shock upon moving to Puerto Rico, having never spoken Spanish before arriving to the island. Despite the difficult start, he quickly made friends in his neighborhood and after spending time in the streets as a middle schooler, was inspired to pursue a musical career. He also used Caribbean hip-hop and reggaeton as a way to help him polish his Spanish-language skills. He originally went by the moniker \\"Nick MC\\", but changed it to Nicky Jam after a neighborhood homeless man gave him the unsolicited comment, ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt Nick MC, you're Nicky Jam\\". While working at the Pueblo Xtra discount grocery store at age eleven, he passed time by rapping about the items he was bagging, which impressed a customer who invited him to record with a local indie label. He subsequently signed a contract without reading it and received no advance money for his recordings. He recorded and released ...Distinto A Los Dem√°s in 1994 at age thirteen He endured a difficult breakup with his girlfriend shortly after the album's release and the emotional pain of the experience led him to try cocaine for the first time at age fifteen. Nicky Jam reflected on the experience by saying: \\"[I thought], 'why am I going to take care of myself? My dad didn‚Äôt handle his drug problems. My mom did drugs too, so why not me?' I mean, I had drugs all around me, and the foundation of everything is your home. It's your family.\\"  Track listing  # \\"Distinto A Los Dem√°s (Feat.

Adjacent is the Lele'iwi Beach Park.  History  The name Richardson comes from its original owners, Elsa and George Richardson, whose home still stands there. George Richardson was the former Chief Detective of the County of Hawaii, and received the land as a gift of gratitude from the Malo family. In 1920, when the entire Malo family was stricken with typhoid fever, Elena, the least severely afflicted of them all, walked to the home of George Richardson on Reeds Bay to seek help. Richardson, a part-Hawaiian originally from Kohala, regularly fished up and down the Keaukaha coastline in his boat and had become a close friend of David Malo's. When Elena showed up on his doorstep with the terrible news, he immediately put her on board his boat, the fastest means of transportation then available, and returned to the Malo home. There he gathered up the rest of the family and headed for Hilo and the hospital. In spite of these valiant efforts, two of the children died. After the family returned home to convalesce, Richardson continued to look in on them and see to their welfare by bringing medicine and other necessities. Malo felt deeply indebted to Richardson, believing that without his help he might have lost his entire family. When he was fully recovered, Malo suggested that Richardson build a home on the Malo property if he wished, and that he consider the land as his own. Richardson accepted the offer, and in the early 1920s constructed a large house on the property. Malo helped design the structure, recommending the large doors at the front and back of the house to provide a corridor for the periodic inundations by high winter surf and tsunami. This plan did actually save the building on a number of occasions when the ocean flooded through the house rather than carrying it away.  Location  Monk Seal at Richardson Beach Today the beach is a public park, and the home is occupied and operated as the Richardson Ocean Center. Richardson Beach is the only beach in the Hilo area with black sand and green sand. Monk Seals and turtles frequent this area as well. It is located near the end of Kalanianaole Avenue at coordinates , where Leleiwi Street leads to an undeveloped coastal access area known as Lehia Park.

She also studied abroad in the University of Paris (Nanterre) and the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva. She began her economic career in 1998 as an economist at Nikko Citigroup Securities, and then worked for JPMorgan Securities and finally as chief economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in Japan. While being economist in the financial industry, Sato also served as a member of the Industrial Structure Council of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), a member of the Working Group on Taxation Problems of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), an advisor to LDP‚Äôs committee on fiscal reconstruction, as well as providing policy recommendations to members of the Bank of Japan‚Äôs Policy Board, and other ministries, including the Cabinet Office, of the Japanese government.  Political career  Sat≈ç was elected to the House of Representatives for the first time in 2005, as part of a group of candidates of Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) hand-picked by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. Sato was sent to the constituency of Seiko Noda, the Gifu 1st district, with Noda having left the LDP after opposing Koizumi's plan to privatize Japan Post. Noda prevailed in the district, but Sato won a seat through the proportional representation list. Sato and Noda publicly made amends prior to the 2009 general election, in which Sato was assigned to run for a different seat, the Tokyo 5th district. In the wake of the overwhelming victory of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) in the 2009 general elections, Sato also lost the race in the Tokyo 5th district, but was elected to the House of Councillors in 2010. After serving almost five years in the House of Councillors, LDP sent Sato back to the House of Representatives to run for the Osaka 11th district in the 2014 general election, in which she won. In December 2012, Sato was appointed to the Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Economy, Trade and Industry, to formulate the growth policy for ‚Äúthe Abenomics,‚Äù at the time Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took over the government from DPJ. In October 2018, Sato was appointed as the State Minister for Internal Affairs and Communications, to handle Japan‚Äôs telecommunications policy in such cutting-edge areas as 5G, IoT, big data, and artificial intelligence (AI), as well as broadcasting and the Japan Post group.

He graduated from the University of Virginia with a degree in economics. Professional career Koshansky was selected by the Colorado Rockies in the 6th round (170th overall) in the 2004 Major League Baseball Draft. 2004 After getting drafted, Koshansky played for the Class A Tri- City Dust Devils. He played in 66 games and batted .234 with 12 home runs. His strikeout numbers were a problem though as he ranked second in the league with 84. 2005 Koshansky began the season with the Class A Asheville Tourists. He played 120 games for the Tourists, in which he batted .291 with 36 home runs in 453 at bats. He was promoted to the Double-A Tulsa Drillers on August 23. He played 12 games for them in which he batted .267 with 2 home runs. His performance earned him Baseball America's Rockies Minor League Player of the Year Award. He was second in the league to Brandon Wood in home runs, was third in extra base hits, fourth in total bases, and was fifth in RBIs. He was also awarded the South Atlantic League Hitter of the Week Award on two occasions. 2006 In , Koshansky played for the Double-A Tulsa Drillers. He was selected as the Rockies Minor League Player of the Year again when he hit .284 with 31 home runs in 132 games for Tulsa. He set the Drillers franchise record for RBI with 109\\\\. He was also second in the league in home runs and slugging percentage. He also played in the Future's Game at PNC Park in Pittsburgh. In the game, he hit a two-run home run to help lead the U.S. team over the World team, 8‚Äì5. Following the season, he was named Baseball America's 13th best prospect in the Texas League and was also named the best power hitter in the Rockies minor league organization. 2007 Koshansky began with the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox. Through 136 games, he batted .295 with 21 home runs and 99 RBI. His strong performance earned him a callup to the Colorado Rockies on September 1 when rosters expanded. He made his major league debut on that same day against the Arizona Diamondbacks as a pinch hitter in the ninth inning against Brandon Lyon. He grounded out to end the game. 2008 On August 12, , Koshanksky hit for the cycle for the Sky Sox for the second time that season; he also hit for the cycle on May 24. He became the first player in Sky Sox history to hit for the cycle twice in one season and the first player in the minors to do it since 2006.\\"Koshansky gets back on his cycle.\\" August 13, 2008.

Other contenders and their claims are discussed, but only those made under controlled conditions and measured by outside observers. Pilots during World War II sometimes claimed to have reached supersonic speeds in propeller-driven fighters during emergency dives, but these speeds are not included as accepted records. Neither are speeds recorded in a dive during high-speed tests with the Supermarine Spitfire, including Squadron Leader J.R. Tobin's 606 mph (975 km/h, Mach 0.89) in a 45¬∞ dive in a Mark XI Spitfire (date unknown) and Squadron Leader Anthony F. Martindale's breaking 620 mph (998 km/h, Mach 0.92) in the same aircraft in April 1944.The Spitfires That Nearly Broke The Sound Barrier, BBC Flight Lieutenant Edward Powles' 690 mph (1110 km/h, Mach 0.96) in Spitfire PR.XIX PS852 during an emergency dive while carrying out spying flights over China on 5 February 1952 is also discounted. This would otherwise be the highest speed ever recorded for a piston-engined aircraft.Spitfire Timeline Propeller versus jet propulsion High-bypass turbofan. The front fan is an enclosed propeller providing air thrust while the turbojet behind provides exhaust thrust. Aircraft that use propellers as their prime propulsion device constitute a historically important subset of aircraft, despite inherent limitations to their speed. Aircraft powered by piston engines get virtually all of their thrust from the propeller driven by the engine. A few piston engined aircraft derive some thrust from the engine's exhaust gases, and there are certain hybrid types like the Motorjet that use a piston engine to drive the compressor of a jet engine, which supplies the primary thrust (although some types also have a propeller powered by the piston engine for low speed efficiency). All aircraft prior to World War II (except for a tiny number of early jet aircraft and rocket aircraft) used piston engines to drive propellers, so all Flight airspeed records prior to 1944 were necessarily set by propeller-driven aircraft. Rapid advances in first liquid-fueled rocket engine-powered aircraft ‚Äì with a 1004 km/h record set in October 1941 by a German example ‚Äî and axial-flow jet engine technology during World War II meant that no propeller-driven aircraft would ever again hold an absolute air speed record. Shock wave formation in propeller-driven aircraft at speeds near sonic conditions, impose limits not encountered in jet aircraft. Jet engines, particularly turbojets, are a type of gas turbine configured such that most of the work available results from the thrust of the hot exhaust gases. Turbofans, both the high-bypass versions used in all modern commercial jetliners, and the low-bypass versions in most modern military aircraft, produce a combination of jet thrust from the exhaust of burnt fuel, and air thrust from what amounts to an internal propeller. High-bypass turbofan engines achieve most of their thrust from a fan driving air backwards through the engine casing, and driven by a gas turbine, which also contributes jet thrust via its exhaust. The two are in one large engine casing with the fan (propeller) at the front and the jet engine behind, with both turbine exhaust and fan-driven air exiting the rear of the engine casing. Turboprop engines are similar, but use an external propeller rather than an internal fan (propeller) inside an engine casing. The hot exhaust gas from a turboprop engine gives a small amount of thrust, however the propeller is the main source of thrust.

Ritchie. McDonnell XF-88B experimental fighter Probably the fastest aircraft ever fitted with an operating propeller was the experimental McDonnell XF-88B, which was made by installing an Allison T38 turboshaft engine in the nose of a pure jet-powered XF-88 Voodoo. This unusual aircraft was intended to explore the use of high-speed propellers and achieved supersonic speeds.\\"NASA History pages.\\" NASA. Retrieved: 4 September 2007. This aircraft is not considered to be propeller-driven since most of the thrust was provided by two jet engines. XF-84H \\"Thunderscreech\\" An oft-cited contender for the fastest propeller- driven aircraft is the XF-84H Thunderscreech. This aircraft is named in Guinness World Records, 1997, as the fastest in this category with a speed of 623 mph (1,002 km/h, Mach 0.83).Young 1997, p. 137. While it may have been designed as the fastest propeller-driven aircraft, this goal was not realized due to its inherent instability.Hendrix 1977, p. 408. Quote: The XF-84H never achieved its designer's dreams of being the first propeller-driven aircraft to attain supersonic flight. In fact, it never flew over 450 kt indicated, since at that speed, it developed an unhappy practice of 'snaking', apparently losing longitudinal stability. NOTE: 450 kt=518 mph This record speed is also inconsistent with data from the National Museum of the United States Air Force, which gives a top speed of 520 mph (837 km/h, Mach 0.70),\\"XF-84H Fact sheet.\\" USAF.

A similar jacket used by the United States Army Air Corps/United States Army Air Forces was usually called the A-2 jacket. Usage The G-1 remains a current uniform-issue item in naval aviation for officer and enlisted aviation personnel on flying status in the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Coast Guard (i.e., Naval Aviator, Naval Flight Officer, Naval Flight Surgeon, Naval Aircrewman, etc.) and was featured as the leather flight jacket worn by Tom Cruise in the film Top Gun. Development More technically, the jacket may be considered the U.S. Military flight jacket developed in 1947 and used in the Korean War, since the term \\"G-1\\" was not used as a label for this fur-collared military-issued jacket until after World War II. However, the term \\"G-1\\" has come to be used for this style of naval leather flight jacket. Prior to the end of World War II, and starting in 1940 when it was officially named by the U.S. Navy, the jacket had the military spec number of M-422. Operational use This jacket was brought to use by the U.S. Navy in the 1930s, and standardized by the Navy in 1940 as the M-422A. In 1943 this jacket, named by the Army Air Forces and the Navy as the ANJ-3 (Army Navy Jacket 3), replaced the iconic Army Air Forces A-2 jacket, the most famous of U.S. Military jackets, hence the name of ANJ-3 (vs. A-2). The M-422A replacement of the loved and famous A-2 was, however, in the form of a non-fur-collared version of the \\"G-1\\", currently referred to for obvious reasons as the G-2. In 1988, the U.S. Air Force reinstated the A-2 jacket for all USAF flight crew personnel. For a very brief period from 1979 until early 1981, issuance of the G-1 to new USN, USMC, and USCG flight crew personnel (i.e., officer flight students and newly designated enlisted Naval Aircrewman) was discontinued as a budgetary economy action, with those personnel being issued summer weight green Nomex flight jackets identical to those issued to their U.S. Air Force counterparts. Replacement of worn-out G-1 jackets for extant Naval Aviation personnel was also discontinued during this period. This action was reversed by Secretary of the Navy action in early 1981, and those USN, USMC, and USCG flight-crew personnel who had not received G-1 jackets were issued one retroactively. Modifications to USN, USMC, and USCG uniform regulations in the 1990s reduced the type and number of permissible insignia on the G-1, but concurrently permitted wear of the G-1 jacket off base with service uniforms. Commercial exploitation Commercial versions of the jacket have been available on the consumer market. Official military suppliers which also sold similar spec jackets to the public include Cockpit USA, Cooper Sportswear, Orchard M/C, Brill Bros, Schott, and Excelled. After the success of the 1986 film Top Gun, shopping-mall leather stores carried a variety of G-1 variants. These are new production and come in goatskin and cowhide varieties stamped USN, USCG, or USMC. Jackets are offered by many companies for the civilian market, including US Authentic Mfg. Co., Lost Worlds, Gibson and Barnes, Eastman, US Wings and Bill Kelso Mfg. Specifications The military specifications under which the naval flight jackets were made, in the order of latest to earliest, are *MIL-J-7823E (AS) 1971 *MIL-J-7823D (WP) 1966 *MIL-J-7823C (WEP) 1962 *MIL-J-7823B (WEP) 1960 *MIL-J-7823A (AER) 1961 *MIL-J-7823 (AER) 1951 *55J14 (AER) 1947 *AN-J3A 1943 *AN 6552 1943 *M-422A 1940 *M-422 1940 The first Navy designation of \\"G-1\\" came under the 55J14 specification. The earlier jackets were constructed of goatskin and had a real mouton collar. Current model issue jackets (although there are exceptions) are constructed of cowhide and have a synthetic collar.

Wilstein's stories and columns led to revelations that resulted in Congressional hearings, drug-testing in the major leagues for the first time, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ban on androstenedione, and the federal Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004. His work was cited as pivotal by former Sen. George Mitchell in his 2007 report to the commissioner of baseball on steroids in the sport, after a 20-month probe, and was chronicled in the books Game of Shadows and Juicing the Game, and detailed in the ESPN the Magazine series, ‚ÄúWho Knew?‚Äùhttp://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=steroids#=8 In 2009, the Seattle chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America nominated Wilstein for the Hall of Fame's J.G. Taylor Spink award \\"for meritorious contributions to baseball writing.\\" In 2010, Wilstein was featured in filmmaker Ken Burns' PBS baseball documentary, \\"The Tenth Inning.\\" Wilstein is the author of \\"The AP Sports Writing Handbook,\\" (McGraw-Hill, 2001), which is used as a primary text in many college journalism classes. Wilstein continues to provide commentary about developments in the ‚ÄúSteroid Era,‚Äù although he retired from the AP in 2005. Major League Baseball's \\"Steroid Era\\" The use of steroids by players had been only hinted at until Wilstein‚Äôs story on August 21, 1998, when McGwire and the Chicago Cubs‚Äô Sammy Sosa were closing in on Roger Maris‚Äô 1961 record of 61 homers‚Äîa chase that captivated the country. After Wilstein saw the bottle of andro in McGwire‚Äôs open locker while covering the chase, McGwire first denied using it, then admitted he‚Äôd been taking it for more than a year when confronted by Wilstein‚Äôs colleague at the AP, Nancy Armour. McGwire commented, \\"Everybody that I know in the game of baseball uses the same stuff I use.\\" Wilstein's story focused on the disparity of steroid rules in different sports. Andro, sold at the time as an over-the-counter supplement that boosted testosterone levels, was allowed in baseball but not in the Olympics, the NFL, pro tennis and all college sports. Shot putter Randy Barnes, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist and world record-holder, had recently drawn a lifetime ban for using andro, reported Wilstein, who had written extensively about steroids in the Olympics since the mid-1980s. \\"The ensuing AP news story led to renewed scrutiny of the use of 'andro' and other substances by major league players,\\" the Mitchell Report said. \\"... commissioner (Bud) Selig and others in baseball have said that this incident more than any other caused them to focus on the use of performance-enhancing substances as a possible problem.\\" Wilstein had witnessed an episode of ‚Äúroid rage‚Äù by Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson after a preliminary heat at the 1988 Seoul Olympics and watched from the finish line as Johnson beat Carl Lewis in the 100-meter final. Johnson soon lost his gold and was sent home in disgrace after testing positive for an anabolic steroid. Andro, Wilstein wrote in the story about McGwire, ‚Äúis seen outside baseball as cheating and potentially dangerous.‚Äù The story set off a controversy that has gone on for more than a decade of follow-ups by Wilstein and those who joined in about steroids and the related sports and social issues, among them McGwire's former ‚ÄúBash Brother,‚Äù Jose Canseco, in his tell-all books, and reporters covering the BALCO federal investigation in San Francisco. McGwire was the first among numerous stars on various teams - including pitcher Roger Clemens, sluggers Barry Bonds, Alex Rodriguez and Rafael Palmeiro, and former MVP Ken Caminiti‚Äîwhose reputations and records were tainted as revelations appeared about their alleged or admitted performance-enhancing drug use. Washington Post baseball writer Thomas Boswell in 1988 and the Los Angeles Times‚Äô Bob Nightengale in 1995 had touched on the baseball steroids issue, but without specifics were largely ignored. ‚ÄúInstead of sparking a wave of follow-up articles or investigations to ferret out the details of steroid use in baseball ‚Ä¶ sports writers essentially left the story alone,‚Äù Editor & Publisher writer Joe Strupp wrote in a 2006 report headlined, ‚ÄúSports writers say they dropped the ball on steroids in major league sports.‚Äùhttp://www.allbusiness.com/services/business-services-miscellaneous- business/4703295-1.html Strupp noted in an earlier E&P; report in 2006 that ‚ÄúWilstein‚Äôs discovery marked the first real press probe into which substances and supplements baseball players were using, and what effect they were having on their accomplishments, abilities and health.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut then a funny thing happened,‚Äù Strupp wrote in his account of the media's response. ‚ÄúInstead of being praised for discovering a questionable act by a baseball star in the middle of a record-breaking season, Wilstein was vilified.‚Äù Wilstein \\"noticed a bottle of androstenedione and opened up a can of worms,\\" USA Today baseball columnist Hal Bodley wrote in 2005. \\"This was baseball's feel-good story that no one, including Selig and the union, wanted tainted by a performance- enhancing supplement few of us knew anything about.\\" On January 11, 2010, Wilstein's suspicions and Jose Canseco's allegations of McGwire's steroid usehttp://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/national_and_world/story/986852.html were confirmed by Mark McGwire in a statement to and interview with the Associated Press and later interviews with Bob Costas and others by McGwire. Upon the news, many sports columnists and media spoke of Wilstein's vindication and CNN.com asked Wilstein to provide his views in an op-ed piece. Wilstein wrote that McGwire should be banned from Major League Baseball for life and that his acts hurt baseball more than those of Pete Rose. Personal life Wilstein graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1970 with a political science degree and began his career in journalism a year later working for United Press International as a sports writer from 1971 through 1978. Journalism awards His awards include the National Headliner Award for a feature on boxer Jerry Quarry‚Äôs brain damage, the John Hancock business writing award for coverage of the 1987 stock market crash, and three AP Managing Editors awards for features on injured New York Jets player Dennis Byrd, illegal sports gambling‚Äôs ties to organized crime, and former Los Angeles Dodger Glenn Burke‚Äôs struggle with AIDS. Wilstein won a record 20 AP Sports Editors awards for his work covering the Olympics, Super Bowls, World Series, college football bowl games, the Grand Slam of tennis, sports business, race and gender in sports and other issues.

It was originally built by the Wallis family, who lived in the cottage for three generations. Tours of the cottage are available to hear about these early British colonists and their descendants, and the garden is open daily during daylight hours. Nairn Street Cottage is classified as a \\"Category 1\\" (\\"places of 'special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value'\\") historic place by Heritage New Zealand. Construction The cottage was built in 1858 and is located on Nairn Street in the suburb of Mount Cook, Wellington. The Cottage was built in a late Georgian style and is similar to other houses built from that time through to about 1870. The Cottage was built by William Wallis who arrived in New Zealand in September 1857 with his wife Catherine. The Wallis family William and Catherine were newly-weds who undertook an arduous seventeen-week journey by ship to arrive in New Zealand. Like many immigrants they came in search of a better life. Unlike many immigrants, Wallis purchased the Nairn Street site only after he viewed it. He chose the location specifically because there was a stream at the bottom of his town-acre site. Wallis was aware of the necessity of a safe water supply after the 1855 Wairarapa earthquake had created tsunami that swamped Wellington town's water supply leading to several deaths from typhoid. William had been apprenticed as a carpenter on The Crystal Palace in London. He also built hospitals in the Crimean War, which allowed him the skills and capital necessary to emigrate to the comparatively new colony. The cottage is almost entirely built of native New Zealand timber and was built by hand. His original tool chest remains in the cottage collection. The Wallis family had 10 children altogether, but after their seventh child the family relocated to a larger house, which William also built, next door. Descendants of the Wallis family remained in the cottage until the late seventies when the Wellington City Council earmarked the cottage for demolition so that council flats could be built in its place. The Council took the building under the Public Works Act in 1974 from Winifred Turner, a granddaughter of William and Catherine and the last person to live in the cottage. Only the tenacity of Winifred Turner saved the cottage and ensured that its historical value was recognised. Museum: 1980‚Äìcurrent The Colonial Cottage Museum Society campaigned to save the cottage from demolition, and established the cottage as an educational museum in 1980. Nairn Street Cottage offers guided tours of the house and gardens. Each tour begins with a run through of the Wallis family's history and the significant events that occurred around the world during the 127 years that the Wallis family lived in Nairn Street Cottage. All of the items within the cottage, with some exceptions, date from between 1850 and 1880. Several items belonged to the family, others were donated from other settler families, while others have been loaned or purchased. Tours, group tours, and education visits are available at the museum. In 2018 the cottage was temporarily closed and refurnished. The reopening signified a shift in focus ‚Äì originally the cottage focused solely on William and Catherine Wallis; the refurbishment saw a wider focus on the different generations of the Wallis family from 1830 to 1970.

He was a professor of political science at Stockholm University from 1935 to 1946, and executive editor of the newspaper Dagens Nyheter from 1946 to 1959. Herbert Tingsten was born in J√§rf√§lla, Stockholm County, the son of city servant Karl Tingsten and his wife Elin Bergenstjerna. He finished his doctoral thesis in 1923 while working as secretary in the Swedish parliament's Committee on the Constitution. As a political scientist his main fields included constitutional history, constitutional law and the history of ideas. Tingsten changed his political views several times during his life. In his early youth he was a conservative and later a radical left-wing liberal. During the 1920s he joined the Swedish Social Democratic Party and was on the left-wing faction of the party. In 1941 he wrote Den svenska socialdemokratiens id√©utveckling (\\"The Ideological Development of the Swedish Social Democrats\\"), where he criticized the party for not fulfilling the marxist goals of nationalizations of the private industry. However, after reading Friedrich Hayek's The Road to Serfdom in 1944, Tingsten became a convinced believer in a free market economy and in 1945 he left the Social Democratic Party. He was one of the original participators of the Mont Pelerin Society, founded in 1947. Tingsten was an early opponent of Nazism, which he warned against during the early 1930s, as well as of the threat of Communism. During his time as executive editor of Dagens Nyheter, Tingsten argued for Swedish membership in NATO. He also supported Israel. In a number of books and publications, Tingsten anticipated some of the major issues in the political developments of the 20th century, such as the rise of fascism, apartheid in South Africa, the transition of socialism into social democracy as well as the need for democratic vitality in Western societies. Tingsten had a deep erudition in both Anglo-Saxon and Continental European science and literature. He created the concept of political behaviour in his 1936 book, pioneering the analysis of election statistics.

These antibodies are involved in sclerosis and are strongly associated with thrombotic forms of lupus. As a result AAHA are strongly implicated in autoimmune deep vein thrombosis. Also, it was proposed that AAHA is responsible for lupus anticoagulant. However, antiphospholipid antibodies bind phospholipids at sites similar to sites bound by anti-coagulants such as PAP1 sites and augment anti-coagulation activity. This contrasts with the major, specific, activity of AAHA, defining a subset of anti-cardiolipin antibodies that specifically interacts with Apo-H. AHAA only inhibits the anti-coagulation activity in the presence of Apo-H and the AAHA component of ACLA correlates with a history of frequent thrombosis. This can be contrasted with lupus anticoagulant which inhibits agglutination in the presence of thrombin. A subset of AHAA appear to mimic the activity of lupus anticoagulant and increase Apo-H binding to phospholipids. These two activities can be differentiated by the binding to Apo-H domains, whereas binding to the 5th domain promotes that anti-coagulant activity binding to the more N-terminal domains promotes lupus anticoagulant-like activities. structure of Apolipoprotein H AAHA interferes with factor Xa inhibition by Apo-H increasing factor Xa generation. However, like Apo-H the Lupus anticoagulant inhibits factor Xa generation. AAHA also inhibited the autoactivation of factor XII while at high AAHA concentrations, factor XIIa activation increases at levels comparable to Apo-H that cause inhibition of factor XIIa activation. A synchronized inhibition of factor XII autoactivation by Apo-H and AHAA has been suggested. Genetics The haplotype HLA-DR4-DQ3 appears to play a role in the pathogenic AAHA production. The alleles primarily recognized are HLA-DR53 (DRB4*01), DRB1*0402, DQA1*03, and possibly DQB1*0302. All of these alleles are in linkage disequilibrium in the DRB4*01:DRB1*0402:DQA1*0301:DQB1*0302 haplotype, also called DR4-DQ8 and also the DQA1:0303:DQB1*0301 haplotype, DR4-DQ7.3. However in European Americans which reflects a broad area of Europe in which the original studies were conducted only DR4(0402)-DQ8 was found, indicating that the entire haplotype is involved. HLA-DR7 may also be associated with these antibodies and the common haplotype association is the HLA-DR53 serotype.

History The camp was founded in 1904 by Harry O. Gillet, Elementary School Principal at the University of Chicago Laboratory School. At the urging of Lab School parents, property on Plum Lake was purchased, removing the boys from Chicago and immersing them in the north woods, where they could experience a summer of physical activity, wilderness and fellowship. Star Lake, adjacent to Plum, was the end of the line for a northern Wisconsin branch of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul railroad. Until 1922, the only transportation into the area was by rail and water. Boys were dropped at Plum Lake Station by the \\"Camp Special\\" (originating at Union Station in Chicago) and ferried to the opposite shore. William J. Monilaw, Lab School instructor, bought the camp from Gillet in 1914. The former Drake University and University of Missouri athletic coach (football, track & field), oversaw the camp until 1959, creating the physical and philosophical structures still in place today. Under his leadership, the camp experience grew to include athletic training, character building, and wilderness trips. Today's trip program includes sailing and sea kayaking excursions through the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, canoeing in the Minnesota Boundary Waters, and hiking in the Porcupine Mountains, Isle Royale National Park, and Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. Alumni of Camp Highlands include Senator William Proxmire, Cold War strategist and Ambassador to Russia George F. Kennan, Secretary of the Navy and Cold War Presidential Advisor Paul Nitze, and Heisman Trophy winners Jay Berwanger and Nile Kinnick. Berwanger spent the summer prior to winning the first trophy at Camp Highlands in 1935. Kinnick spent the summer of 1938 at the camp and won the trophy in 1939. Actor Bruce Dern was a camper. Photographer Ray Metzker was on the staff in the early 1950s; he taught photography. More recent alumni include comedian John Roy, philosopher A.J. Julius, photographer Mario Sorrenti, professional basketball player Steve Goodrich, and comedian and television star Dave Coulier (Full House). Camp Highlands has been owned by former camper Mike Bachmann and his wife Sharon since 1969.

The Nenana is a tributary of the Tanana River, which is part of the Yukon River drainage in the central interior region of the state. Flowing northward from headwaters at the Cantwell Glacier in the Alaska Range, the Teklanika drains an area widely visited by tourists to Denali National Park and Preserve. The park's only road crosses the river at milepost 31 and a National Park campground is located on its eastern bank at milepost 29. On its course, the river travels north from the core Alaska Range as a braided river, becoming rapid and narrow as it traverses through the Primrose Ridge, braiding again through the Stampede Trail valley, narrowing again through the Tekla Ridge before ultimately meandering through a complex series of oxbow turns and lakes across the southern Tanana River valley. The river is crossed by the Denali Park Road and the Stampede Trail, and was heavily prospected in the early 20th century for the many coal, gold, and platinum deposits found along its banks. The name derives from the Lower Tanana (Athabascan) words meaning \\"water-amulet river\\". Popular culture In the book Into the Wild, the Teklanika River is referred to as the Rubicon for American adventurer Christopher McCandless. Since then, the river has proven an often deadly obstacle to many hikers attempting to reach the bus where McCandless camped- out and later died of starvation. In August 2010, a Swiss hiker, Claire Ackermann, drowned in an attempt to cross the river while tied off to a rope that was strung by previous hikers between trees on both shores. While she drowned on state land, her body was pulled ashore by her French boyfriend a short distance downriver. That point was on Denali National Park land, triggering a dispute between Park Rangers and State Troopers as to jurisdiction. In June 2020 the bus used by McCandless was removed because of public safety concerns. The 1940s bus was taken to the remote trail in 1960 and used as accommodations by a road crew, according to Denali Borough Mayor, Clay Walker. In 2019 a newlywed Belarusian woman drowned trying to cross the swollen river on her way to the site. A stranded Brazilian had to be rescued in April 2020 and five Italians were rescued in February 2020, with one suffering from severe frostbite. In total 15 bus-related search and rescue operations for visitors to the bus were carried out between 2007 and 2019. It was air-lifted by a US army Chinook helicopter. On September 24, 2020, the Museum of The North at the University of Alaska (Fairbanks) announced it became the permanent home of McCandless' 'Magic Bus 142' where it will be restored and an outdoor exhibit will be created.

Recounting the Biblical story of Jonah and the fall of Nineveh, the play is a noteworthy example of the survival of the Medieval morality play style of drama in the period of English Renaissance theatre. Date The play dates from late 1589 or early 1590. Waldo F. McNeir, \\"The Date of A Looking Glass for London,\\" Notes and Queries 2 (1955), pp. 282-3. Performance The premier production of A Looking Glass may have been staged by Queen Elizabeth's Men, the company that acted many of Greene's plays; the play's Clown may have been portrayed by Queen's Man John Adams.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 328. The play is known to have been acted by Lord Strange's Men on 8 March, 1592, and remained in the dramatic repertory for many years. It may have been acted at N√∂rdlingen in Germany in 1605.Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 280 n. 6; Vol. 3, p. 328. Publication A Looking Glass was entered into the Stationers' Register on 5 March 1594 by the printer Thomas Creede, and was published later that year in a quarto printed by Creede and sold by the stationer William Barley. This was one of the notable instances in which Creede the printer acted as a publisher who then farmed out his work to a bookseller -- a reversal of the usual relationship in Elizabethan publishing. Creede issued a second quarto in 1598, which was also sold by Barley; a third quarto followed in 1602, printed by Creede and sold by Thomas Pavier. A fourth quarto appeared in 1617 from Bernard Alsop, who took over Creede's business in that year.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 328. One extant quarto of A Looking Glass possesses markings and notes that equipped the text for service as a prompt book for an early production. The quarto shows the text was updated for the 1603 accession of King James I, altered to reflect changes in English law, and adapted to the London audience; but except for the addition of a missing line, the text was not corrected for the errors and corruptions that are so common in the dramatic texts of the period.Charles Read Baskervill, \\"A Prompt Copy of A Looking Glass for London and England,\\" Modern Philology 30 (1932), pp. 29-51. Use of a printed text as a prompt book is rare but not unprecedented in the era; such a text may have provided the copy for the First Folio text of A Midsummer Night's Dream.G. Blakemore Evans, textual ed, The Riverside Shakespeare, Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1974; p. 247. Authorship Both the 1594 Stationers' Register entry and the title page of the first edition attribute the play to Lodge and Greene. Some individual scholars have tried to assign shares of the play to the two different collaborators, though no consensus judgement has been reached. The Biblical portions of the play depend directly and heavily on the text of the Bishops' Bible; some critics have judged this dependency to be suggestive of Lodge more than Greene. Synopsis The opening scene shows King Rasni of Nineveh just after his victory over Jeroboam, the \\"king of Jerusalem\\". Monstrously vain and arrogant, Rasni relishes the sycophantic praise of his courtiers and tributary kings; he proclaims that \\"Rasni is god on earth, and none but he\\". The only dissenting voice comes from the King of Crete, who protests against Rasni's planned incestuous marriage with his sister Remilia. The protest is fruitless: Rasni deprives the Cretan king of his crown, bestowing it upon the upstart flatterer Radagon. The prophet Oseas is lowered over the stage by an angel; seated on a throne, Oseas functions as observer and chorus, commenting upon the play's action and applying its lessons to contemporary English life. Subsequent scenes in the main plot alternate between the court of Rasni and Remilia, and scenes showing an usurer and his victims -- primarily the spendthrift young gentleman Thrasybulus and the virtuous but poor Alcon, both of whom have loans forfeited to an unscrupulous moneylender. The two men try to obtain justice from the law courts, but find that the law is corrupt ‚Äî the judge is a pawn of the usurer. (The serious scenes of the main plot are interspersed with comic subplot scenes, devoted to showing common people in the common sins of drunkenness, gluttony and disorder.) Rasni and Remilia prepare a sumptuous wedding before their court ‚Äî which is prevented when a thunderstorm rises and Remilia is killed by a bolt of lightning. Rasni rejects the implication of divine wrath; in place of his sister, he takes Alvida, the wife of the king of Paphlagonia, as his lover. Alvida poisons her husband, a deed that Rasni praises. Jonah enters in the third act, as the play portrays his flight to Tarsus and Joppa to avoid the divinely-ordered mission to warn Nineveh of its sinful ways. Jonah's actual swallowing by the whale is not depicted directly... but the fourth act opens with him being \\"cast out of the whale's belly upon the stage\\" (which must have made a striking special effect). Jonah then accepts his divine mission and heads toward Nineveh. Having failed to obtain justice in the courts, Alcon appeals to his son, who is none other than Radagon, the fast-rising courtier. But Radagon is contemptuously dismissive of his poor family, now that he has ascended to wealth and power. Alcon's wife curses Radagon -- and immediately he is consumed by \\"a flame of fire\\". Rasni's magi define this as a purely natural phenomenon, once again ignoring the portents of divine retribution; they pass off a sign in the heavens (a hand brandishing a flaming sword) the same way. Alvida attempts to seduce the King of Cilicia, another of Rasni's clients; she faints when Rasni catches her. By Act V, Alcon and his family are reduced to thievery to survive. Jonah arrives at Nineveh, preaching repentance; his preaching is so powerful that even the most corrupt are affected. Sinners who fast and repent -- even Rasni and Alvida -- are forgiven. Jonah ends the play alone on the stage, applying the moral lessons of the play to the lives of Londoners and Englishmen.

These pre-production plastic pellets are created separately from the user plastics they are melted down to form, and pellet loss is incurred during both the manufacturing and transport stages. Commonly referred to as nurdles, these plastics are released into the open environment, creating pollution in the oceans and on beaches. Description Plastic resin pellets are classified as primary source microplastics, meaning that they were intentionally produced at the size ranging from 1‚Äì5 mm in diameter.GESAMP (2015). ‚ÄúSources, fate and effects of microplastics in the marine environment: a global assessment‚Äù (Kershaw, P. J., ed.). (IMO/FAO/UNESCO- IOC/UNIDO/WMO/IAEA/UN/UNEP/UNDP Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection). Rep. Stud. GESAMP No. 90, 96 p. Approximately 60 billion pounds (27 million tonnes) of nurdles are manufactured annually in the United States. One pound of pelletized HDPE contains approximately 25,000 nurdles (approximately 20 mg per nurdle). They are typically under in diameter. Environmental impact Nurdles on a beach in southwest France, 2011. Nurdles are a major contributor to marine debris. During a three-month study of Orange County beaches researchers found them to be the most common beach contaminant. Bathing beaches in East Lothian, Scotland have been shown to be covered with E. coli and Vibrio biofilms, according to a 2019 study. Waterborne nurdles may either be a raw material of plastic production, or from larger chunks of plastics. A major concentration of plastic may be the Great Pacific garbage patch, a growing collection of marine debris known for its high concentrations of plastic litter. Nurdles that escape from the plastic production process into waterways or oceans have become a significant source of ocean and beach plastic pollution. Plastic pellet pollution that has been monitored in studies is mainly found in the sediments and beach areas and is usually polyethylene or polypropylene, the two main plastic polymers found in microplastic pollution.GESAMP (2015). ‚ÄúSources, fate and effects of microplastics in the marine environment: a global assessment‚Äù (Kershaw, P.

GESAMP No. 90, 96 p.2007, chapter 9, Nurdles have frequently been found in the digestive tracts of various marine creatures, causing physiological damage by leaching plasticizers such as phthalates. Nurdles can carry two types of micropollutants in the marine environment: native plastic additives and hydrophobic pollutants absorbed from seawater. For example, concentrations of PCBs and DDE on nurdles collected from Japanese coastal waters were found to be up to 1 million times higher than the levels detected in surrounding seawater.Mato Y: \\"Plastic resin pellets as a transport medium for toxic chemicals in the marine environment\\", \\"Environmental Science & Technology\\" 35(2), pages 318‚Äì324, 2001 Plastic microbeads used in cosmetic exfoliating products are also found in water. Incidents 2020 USA - New Orleans - On August 20th, a 40 foot shipping container full of nurdles fell off the CMA CGM Bianca ship into the Mississippi River. A 40 foot shipping container can contain 25 tons of nurdles, which can range from millions to billions of individual plastic resin pellets. The CMA CGM Bianca broke free from its wharf due to a thunderstorm. No official clean up took place. Hazardous material spills are in coast guard jurisdiction, but nurdles are not classified as hazardous material. The Department of Environmental Quality does not find it clear as to who is responsible for cleaning up the spill. 2018 USA - Pennsylvania - Semi-truck crash leading to release of bright blue colored nurdles into Pocono Creek, and the waterways of the Lehigh Valley. 2017 South Africa - Durban - Nurdle spill of about 2 billion nurdles (49 tons), from a shipping container in Durban Harbor, requiring extended cleanup efforts. \\"The South African Association for Marine Biological Research (SAAMBR) has sent out an urgent appeal for beach users along the entire South African coast to try and assist in collecting as many of these nurdles as possible.\\" These nurdles have also been spotted washing up on the shore in Western Australia. UK - \\"The Great Nurdle Hunt\\" occurring from June 2-5th, 2017 - across the United Kingdom drew attention to the issue of plastic pellet pollution. A program started by Fidra, a Scottish environmental charity, sourced information on nurdles from citizens across the region using shared photos to better understand the makeup of pollution across beaches in the UK. The nurdle hunts occurring earlier in 2017 determined that 73% of UK beaches had nurdle pollution. 2012 USA - San Francisco Bay Coastal Cleanup from multiple nurdle spills. In Hong Kong, after being blown by Typhoon Vicente on 24 July 2012, some containers belonging to Chinese oil giant Sinopec which were carrying over 150 tonnes of plastic pellets were blown into the sea, washing up on southern Hong Kong coasts, such as Shek O, Cheung Chau, Ma Wan and Lamma Island. The spill disrupted marine life and is being credited with killing stocks of fish on fish farms.  Current progress and solutions  The plastic industry has responded to the increased interest and concern for plastic pellet loss and pollution sources. Operation Clean Sweep was created by SPI: The Plastics Industry Trade Association in 2001 and joined by the American Chemistry Council with the goal of zero pellet loss for plastic manufacturers. This voluntary stewardship program provides its members with a manual which guides them through ways in which they can reduce pellet loss within their own facilities and provides the necessary training. In 2008, California passed a ‚Äúnurdle law,‚Äù which \\"specifically names pre-production plastic pellets (nurdles) as a pollutant\\". Actions for creating awareness  On April 11, 2013 in order to create awareness, artist Maria Cristina Finucci founded The Garbage Patch State at UNESCO ‚ÄìParis in front of Director General Irina Bokova. It is the first of a series of events under the patronage of UNESCO and of Italian Ministry of the Environment. In September 2019, billionaire philanthropist Andrew Forrest appeared in a TED talk promoting radical change to the economics of plastic recycling via an initiative supported by his Minderoo Foundation called #noPlasticWaste. If the price of newly manufactured fossil fuel plastic is raised above the price of recycled plastic, then the vast oversupply of waste plastic will become commodity plastic, correcting the problem from the ground, and ocean, up. Andrew proposes creating a fund to pay for the cost of plastic recycling with the money generated from this price increase.

There has been demand for imagery of nude celebrities for several decades and it is a lucrative business exploited by websites and magazines. Types include authorized images, such as film screenshots, copies from previously published images, such as shots from magazines or stills or clips from movies, to unauthorised images such as celebrity sex tapes and paparazzi photos capturing unintentional or private scenes, and faked or doctored images. There has been a commercial demand for images of nude celebrities for many decades. Playboy magazine was known for offering celebrities large amounts of money to appear nude in its magazine, and more downmarket pornographic magazines search far and wide for nude pictures of celebrities taken unaware -- for example, when they are bathing topless or nude at what the subject thought was a secluded beach, or taken before the individual was well known. Paparazzi-produced photos are in high demand among sensational magazines and press. In some countries, privacy law and personality rights can lead to civil action against organizations that publish photos of nude celebrities without a model release, and this restricts the availability of such photos through the print media. On the Internet, the difficulty of identifying offenders and applying court sanction makes circulation of such photographs much less risky. Such photographs circulate through many online photo distribution channels such as Usenet and Internet forums, and commercial operators, often in countries beyond the reach of courts, also offer such photos for commercial gain. Copyright restrictions are often ignored. In some cases, when the depicted person is young and the photo is an actual photo, nude media of celebrities may fall under the purvue of child pornography laws, a legal regime with harsh penalties for distribution. When such photos are faked or doctored, the media is classified as simulated child pornography. History There has likely been interest in nude images of celebrities for as long as artistic nude imagery and pornography has existed. One of the more famous examples is Playboy's inaugural December 1953 issue that featured photos of Marilyn Monroe from a 1949 photo session as its first Playmate of the Month. The commercialization, promotion, and organized supply of nude celebrity images can be traced to another men's magazine, High Society, and the efforts of its first female Editor, Gloria Leonard. This began as a feature that showcased risqu√© photos of celebrities like Jodie Foster and Goldie Hawn, usually lifted from film stills, and became a spin-off venture of High Society called Celebrity Skin magazine in 1986. Over its 25-year run, Margot Kidder, Ann- Margret and Barbra Streisand unsuccessfully attempted to sue the magazine after it published nude photos of them. Yet another magazine earned additional notoriety for its publication of nude photographs of models who at the time were not celebrities, but later attained fame. Penthouse magazine published nude photos in its September 1984 issue of a young adult film actress, Traci Lords (later found to be underage at the time),Lords, Traci Elizabeth. Traci Lords: Underneath It All. New York: HarperCollins, 2003. and Vanessa Williams, then-Miss America, that caused her to be stripped of her crown. Types of nude celebrity media  Nude celebrity media falls into six main categories: * Film screenshots: Many actors and actresses have done nude or partially nude scenes in non-pornographic mainstream films. Screenshots from these films are circulated widely and can usually be recognized by the low picture quality (from video). Increased popularity of broadband internet access makes possible the distribution of actual video clips and higher quality images, usually copied from DVDs. Often screenshots of these scenes are displayed in several frames as tiles. * Paparazzi photographs: Occasionally, celebrities are photographed in revealing real-life situations. The most common scenario is a woman sunbathing topless, usually on a beach, yacht or by a pool. The photos are usually taken from a distance and rarely reveal more than breasts, although some celebrities have been photographed fully nude. Other types of paparazzi images of nude celebrities include 'nipple slips', in which low cut dresses, lack of a bra, an accidental fall of clothing or camera flash glares may reveal a celebrity's nipples. A final form is the increasingly frequent occurrence of an \\"upskirt\\" shot of female. Most such images show underwear, but some situations (such as celebrities exiting cars) have resulted in snapshots which are claimed to show genitalia. * Nude photo shoots: Mainstream sex magazines such as Playboy or photographic art magazines such as Black And White routinely feature nude shoots of celebrities. Some celebrities have modeled for nude photographs prior to becoming famous. Such images are often later redistributed in digital form by the publisher, or by a third party. * Stolen private materials: Private sexual photographs of celebrities are sometimes leaked online. This usually occurs after a hack on their cell phone or e-mail. * Photos or videos released online by recipients: They are also sometimes released online by a former lover/spouse. Videos of celebrities performing sexual acts are also often leaked and are known as celebrity sex tapes. * Fake or doctored photos: Many images found on the Internet and in yellow journalism are fake images, primarily made with various image editing techniques. These typically combine the most recognizable features of a celebrity, such as their face, with the nude body of a suitable lesser-known pornography actor. Unlike other forms of nude media of celebrities, faked photos can be produced with little effort or resources and do not require access to the celebrity, making them a popular option for amateurs. Another form of doctoring celebrity photos is known as \\"Celebrity X-Ray\\". This technique involves the use of digital image editing software to modify photos of celebrities dressed in skimpy, sheer or see-through material, in order to reveal what is hidden or obscured beneath the cloth.

A major theme of the march was family unity and what it means to be an African American woman in America. The women of the march called for three things: repentance for the pain of black women caused by one another, and the restoration and resurrection of African American family and community bonds. Overview The march was founded and formulated by Phile Chionesu, a grassroots activist, human rights advocate, Black Nationalist/Freedom Fighter, and owner of an African crafts shop; she was not associated with any national black organizations. After several months of underground organizing, Chionesu asked Asia Coney to join her, making her the third National Co-Chair. The march was envisioned and intended to help bring social and economic development and power throughout the black communities of the United States, as well as to bring hope, empowerment, unity and sisterhood to women, men and children of African descent globally regardless of nationality, religion, or economic status. A major theme of the march was family unity and what it means to be an African American woman in America. The women of the march called for three things: repentance for the pain of black women caused by one another, and the restoration and resurrection of African American family and community bonds. The march included scheduled hours of prayer and speeches. The day was filled with prayer, music, and inspirational speeches. These events were meant to promote positive change. The march started from the Liberty Bell and ended at the steps of the Philadelphia Art Museum. Speakers at the event included Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the ex-wife of Nelson Mandela; Congresswoman Maxine Waters; Sista Souljah; Jada Pinkett Smith; Attallah and Ilyasah Shabazz, the daughters of Malcolm X; and Dr. Dorothy Height. A message was read from Assata Shakur from her exile home of Cuba. The march has been considered a social phenomenon due to its unconventional and unique way of organizing. It has influenced several mass gatherings by demonstrating a grassroots approach that had not been employed before. These women were able to use different methods of spreading information via media coordinators like BWN NJ Delegate Stacey Chambers, Alpha Kappa Alpha, and, by word of mouth, fliers, black-run media, the Internet, and a network of women's organizations. The Million Woman March was the launching pad for the development of the first global movement for women and girls of African descent throughout the Diaspora. Attendance Estimates of attendance for the march vary widely. The Philadelphia police gave no official estimates, but were preparing for up to 600,000 people. However, a study provided by the University of Pennsylvania in addition to aerial footage, photos, and other research data and information obtained from news and other sources, indicates that the gathering drew at least 500,000 people. Police sources gave numbers varying from 300,000 to 1 million. The attendees came even despite cold temperatures and light rain. Organizers estimated an attendance of 2.1 million. Phile Chionesu suggested there were more than 2.5 million people. \\"The rally brought together women from across the country ‚Äì some wearing jeans and sweat shirts, others in festive African garb.\\" There were signs throughout the march saying, \\"I am one in a million\\" and \\"Black Women: No more AIDS, abuse, addiction\\". Supporters also bought buttons, T-shirts, hats and flags with march logos. Mission The mission of the Million Woman March was for African American women to be self- determined.Alex-Assensoh, Y. M., & Hanks, L. J. (2000). Black and Multiracial Politics in America. New York City: New York City Press. The march was also intended to draw attention to statistics that marginalize African American women. Research has shown that 94 of 1,000 African American teenage girls are victims of violent crime. African American women are eighteen times more likely to get AIDS than white women. In 1996, African American men earned thirty dollars more than African American women per week, while, African American women were paid forty dollars less than white women per week. From these statistics, African American women and supporters wanted to take a stand, and part of the protest was because of inequalities like these. The Million Woman March has continued its mission under the direction of the founder and national offices. Since the march, over 50 conferences, over 100 forums, online radio broadcasts for 12 years, and many social justice protests for women and African American females have taken place.

E. Dionne, was a French Canadian naturalist and taxidermist. He is considered the first professional French Canadian ornithologist. Dionne was a self-taught scientist and wrote several books on the natural history of Quebec, including the first field guide to the province's mammal fauna; he was a well-respected scholar and became a fellow of the American Ornithologists' Union. Biography Dionne was born in 1846 to a modest rural family in Saint-Denis-de-la-Bouteillerie, near Kamouraska, the eldest of six boys and five girls born to Eus√®be Dionne and Am√©lie Lavoie. His father was a cobbler and farmer but the couple attached considerable importance to education, and Charles-Eus√®be displayed a thirst for knowledge from a young age, which was first noticed by his aunt Philom√®ne. Philom√®ne Dionne was the first to notice his affinity for natural history. Dionne captured and stuffed his first specimen at 14. After he had completed his elementary study, Philom√®ne was the one who paid so he could benefit from private classes, where he came across a natural history book, an incident he would delight in recount in his later years, even though he could not remember the title. At Laval Dionne travelled to Quebec City in 1865 and, with the help of his cousin Z√©phirin, who worked there, found work at the S√©minaire de Qu√©bec. His predisposition was rapidly noticed and, having benefited from personal teaching sessions with Thomas-√âtienne Hamel, he was promoted from cook to a position at Universit√© Laval's (then administrated by the seminary) faculty of law. He became friend with historian and librarian Charles-Honor√© Laverdi√®re, and acquired from him scholarly techniques and instinct, all the while developing his knowledge and becoming an admirer of L√©on Abel Provancher. He truly began to develop his natural history collections at that time. Unfortunately, his first attempts were of poor quality. It is possible that he acquired the basis for the techniques that would make his later fame from William Couper, a naturalist that resided in Quebec City during that period. His knowledge in the various fields of natural sciences grew steadily thanks to the studies he did of his specimens, and the volumes he accessed through the university's library. He also followed classes at Laval and the Acad√©mie Commerciale of the Brothers of the Christian Schools. Having acquired knowledge of Latin and English, he could access a further wealth of knowledge. In 1873, Dionne was promoted deputy librarian to assist Laverdi√®re, who couldn't keep up with the work. Laverdi√®re died soon after and Dionne mourned a fellow academic and friend. Marriage and the zoological museum Dionne prowled the public markets for specimens, and attracted for himself the nickname of \\"Dionne l'empailleur\\" (\\"Dionne the stuffer\\"). He came to meet a fellow countryman, Guillaume-Wilfrid Pelletier, brother of his future wife Marie-√âm√©lie, which he married on May 6, 1879; the couple had no children. The couple settled in an apartment on the second flour of Guillaume-Wilfrid's grocery. Dionne would gain further fame by regularly exposing his beautiful pieces in the front window of the store over the following decade. Pelletier, in return for the visibility, helped Dionne in his acquisitions. He died in July 1908. Dionne's major interests over the course of his career were ornithology, entomology and taxidermy, although he wrote little about entomology. His renowned skills and amiable predisposition made him a prime candidate to become assistant-curator to Fran√ßois-Xavier B√©langer at Laval's zoological museum. He was possibly more competent on the whole than B√©langer, though the later had dedicated his later life to the museum. In 1882, upon the death of the curator, Dionne was appointed in his place. He would help turn the collection into one of the finest in the province. That same year Dionne published his Les oiseaux du Canada and traveled in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence with J.-U. Gregory, of the Quebec City Marine Bureau, with the aim of helping build ichtyological collections, for which Gregory would thank him. Dionne would refer several times to this expedition in his book. By 1887, his personal entomological collections had grown to over 1,500 specimens; the museum's counted over 16,000 of insects and animals. Dionne talented taxidermy was again noticed when he exposed nearly four hundred specimens at the 1887 provincial fair, where he collected two prizes. That collection, or most of it, would be acquired by Dominique- Napol√©on Saint-Cyr in 1889 and form the basis of the zoological collections of the Mus√©e de l'Instruction Publique (now part of the Mus√©e de la Civilisation collection). Dionne subsequently remained the main taxidermist for the museum under Saint-Cyr's successors, and it was curator Victor-Alphonse Huard who would later suggest his candidacy to the Royal Society. Member of the American Ornithologists' Union In 1889, Dionne completed and published (possibly having been spurred by a dispute with Newfoundland ornithologist Montague Chamberlain) a reorganization of his first book into a Catalogue des oiseaux de la Province de Qu√©bec avec des notes sur leur distribution g√©ographique (\\"Catalogues of the birds of Quebec with notes on their distribution\\", generally referred as the Catalogue des oiseaux de la Province de Qu√©bec, or just Catalogue). The perceptive and up-to-date (it used the American Ornithologists' Union classification), if short on overall information, ouvrage garnered good reviews from specialists such as Elliott Coues and Charles Foster Batchelder. Future president of the Union Jonathan Dwight noticed a very recent and subtle publication of his being taken into account and visited Dionne in 1891 to check on it. Dionne turned out to be right, and the two men struck up a friendship. This friendship and the one Dionne struck with Ruthven Deane in 1893 when he was delegated by Laval to Chicago for the opening of the Field Museum of Natural History were instrumental to his election that year as fellow of the AOU. In 1902, Laval granted him an honorary Master of Arts degree. Between 1903 and 1907 he edited, with the help of Walter-Fournier Venner, a journal that aimed to compete with the Huard-edited Naturaliste Canadien, the Observateur Naturaliste. He wrote most material in the journal under various pseudonyms or anonymously, and although it is likely Huard knew about some of these articles, he might have never known about others. Between 1912 and 1924 there were several attempts spearheaded by Huard to have Dionne elected to the Royal Society of Canada Academy of Science, but all failed. This has often been blamed on racism on the part of the primarily English-speaking scientific section (Huard at the time was the sole French-speaking member, L√©on Abel Provancher and other scientists had been elected to the Academy of Arts and Humanities as writers to get around this problem), but a turn in recognition from the \\"learned amateurs\\" of the 19th century to the formal academics cannot be entirely discounted. Despite his large knowledge and numerous contacts, Dionne overall rarely travelled outside his home city, and even less frequently left the country, although he travelled to New York City in 1911 and toured Europe in 1912. In 1919 he was involved in the foundation of the Soci√©t√© L√©on-Provancher d'Histoire Naturelle du Canada. Dionne died of illness in Quebec City on 25 January 1925, a mere few days after Laval granted him an honorary Doctor of Science degree (he commented of it \\"They should have waited after my death.\\"). He had had his right leg paralysed for some times after a nasty wound infection in 1919, and this was probably linked to his death. Written works Dionne's first major publication was his 1882 Les oiseaux du Canada (\\"The Birds of Canada\\"), which he dedicated to Provancher. It replaced a smaller, mostly outdated book published in 1860 by James MacPherson Le Moine. Les oiseaux du Canada, while well received in the French community, received mixed reviews from English-language scholars, particularly Montague Chamberlain, who deplored \\"its utter worthlessness as an authentic work\\". The precise amount of personal jealousy (Chamberlain was preparing his own Catalogue of Canadian Birds) and scientific concern (Dionne's work only truly covered Quebec, and used the soon-to-be obsolete classification of Coues) is difficult to assess. Coues himself, according to Dionne, wrote to commend his work. The year 1902 saw the publication of Les mammif√®res de la province de Qu√©bec (\\"The Mammals of the Province of Quebec\\"), which was a commercial success and the first comprehensive French-language books about mammals in the province. Les oiseaux de la province de Qu√©bec was his major work and came out in 1906, garnering praise from Quebec and abroad for being up-to-date and comprehensive. It premiered French terminology in Canada for ornithology and synthesised ornithological knowledge from a variety of sources, as well as providing consistent French names for all species. Dionne was particularly interested in geographical distribution of birds, and this was reflected in the book's excellent coverage of that topic, thanks to Dionne's extensive notes and collected observations. The book would remain the only one to cover the province's avifauna so extensively for a long time, and was one of the first, if not the first North American state-based such book. In 1910, a paper on the spiders of Quebec was published separately. In addition to his books, Dionne published a number of papers in The Auk and the Naturaliste Canadien, as well as most material published in the three issues of his Observateur Naturaliste. Influence and legacy Alongside figures like L√©on Provancher and Marie-Victorin, Dionne was a driving force in making natural sciences, and particularly birds, of interest in a time when such research was not considered very important. His work was widely circulated in French Canada for years after his death. In 2005, Qu√©becOiseaux, the province's federation of ornithological groups, began issuing a yearly prize named after him. He had a reputation of openness and readiness to help amongst learned and laymen alike. Provancher named one species of ichneumon after Dionne, Tryphon dionnei, now called Monoblastus dionnei. Dionne's taxidermy work was appreciated and widely distributed, and his observations are important in tracing trends in bird population evolutions over time, such as those of the passenger pigeon. It is possible that he prepared one of the last specimens of the species.

A History of the Corruptions of Christianity. 2 vols. Birmingham: Printed by Piercy and Jones; London: Printed for J. Johnson, 1782. Summary Priestley's major argument in the Institutes is that the only revealed religious truths that can be accepted are those that also conform to the truth of the natural world. Because his views of religion were deeply tied to his understanding of nature, the text's theism rests on the argument from design. Many of Priestley's arguments descended from 18th- century deism and comparative religion.Schofield, Vol. 1, 174; Uglow, 169; Tapper, 315; Holt, 44. The Institutes shocked and appalled many readers, primarily because it challenged basic Christian orthodoxies, such as the divinity of Christ and the miracle of the Virgin Birth. Priestley wanted to return Christianity to its \\"primitive\\" or \\"pure\\" form by eliminating the \\"corruptions\\" which had accumulated over the centuries. The fourth part of the Institutes, A History of the Corruptions of Christianity, became so long that he was forced to issue it separately. Priestley believed that the Corruptions was \\"the most valuable\\" work he ever published.McLachlan, 261; Gibbs, 38; Jackson, 102; Uglow, 169. Schofield, Priestley's major modern biographer, describes the work as \\"derivative, disorganized, wordy, and repetitive, detailed, exhaustive, and devastatingly argued.\\"Schofield, Vol. 2, 216. The text addresses issues from the divinity of Christ to the proper form for the Lord's Supper. Thomas Jefferson would later write of the profound effect that Corruptions had on him: \\"I have read his Corruptions of Christianity, and Early Opinions of Jesus, over and over again; and I rest on them... as the basis of my own faith. These writings have never been answered.\\"Qtd. in Gibbs, 249. Although a few readers such as Jefferson approved of the work, it was generally harshly reviewed because of its extreme theological positions, particularly its rejection of the Trinity.Schofield, Vol. 2, 216‚Äì223; Thorpe, 106‚Äì108; Holt, 133‚Äì39.

Community service day Voluntary Community service days are very popular in the US corporate culture. Often, employees are getting paid for working for a local NGO that cooks food for the homeless. Subbotnik In the former Soviet Union, subbotniks were days of voluntary unpaid labor. Transferred working day In the Soviet Union, modern Russia, and Hungary, the Friday following a public holiday that falls on Thursday and the Monday before one that falls on Tuesday are transferred to Saturdays to make longer runs of consecutive nonworking days. In this case the \\"bridge\\" Monday or Friday is treated as a Saturday in terms of time tables and working hours and the related \\"working Saturday\\" is treated as a normal work day. Over the two work weeks concerned, work is done on nine days with one work week running for six days and the other one for three. Employees always have the option of taking a day from their personal vacation allowance and using it to avoid working on the \\"working Saturday\\". Some employers and many education institutions treat the working Saturday as a regular one (giving a \\"free\\" day off in the former case). For example in 2007 Russia held working Sundays on 28 April, 9 June, and 29 December in lieu of 30 April, 11 June, and 31 December, respectively.Working Saturdays in Russia in 2007 This practice requires work on Saturday which is forbidden in Jewish law (Shabbat). For this reason, Jews are sometimes offered the alternative of taking the \\"Working Saturday\\" off as an unpaid day. In reality the working Saturday is a day of low productivity due to a tired and resentful workforce. Thus it is often used for corporate team building activities and people often go home in the mid-afternoon. A number of shops follow their usual Saturday opening hours, closing early or not at all opening. Poland In Poland, there was a six-day workweek (48 working hours a week) till the 1970s. In 1972, the communist government started a long-term process of switching to a five-day workweek. It started with one vacant Saturday per month (46 working hours per average week) and citizens were promised to be given more. The delays in introducing more vacant Saturdays were one of many sources of 1980s unrest in Poland leading to creation of the Solidarity movement. After the fall of the communist regime in 1989 there was still one Working Saturday per month accompanied by roughly three Vacant Saturdays (42 working hours per average week). It wasn't until the late 1990s that a five-day workweek was finally declared (reduced to 40 hrs/week). Romania In Romania, there was a six-day workweek until 1990http://legislatie.just.ro/Public/DetaliiDocumentAfis/894. Initially there were an average of 48 working hours a week, but in 1982 and 1985 the communist government formally reduced the working hours to 46, and subsequently 45. http://www.stiri-economice.ro/productivitatea-muncii-comunism.html In some areas a reduced workweek (sƒÉptƒÉm√¢nƒÉ redusƒÉ de lucru) was permitted, involving 1-2 extra work hours from Monday to Friday in exchange for a free Saturday, but this was only about flexibility of working program, not a real process of switching to a 5-day workweek. Unions in Romania were not independent, but obeyed the Communist Party, so they were not interested in fighting for workers rights. More than that, the censorship banned any information about 5-day workweek (even this measure was implemented in USSR since 1967). The process of transition to 5-day workweek started on 19 March 1990http://legislatie.just.ro/Public/DetaliiDocumentAfis/894 with 2 free days a month, usually Saturdays. The same law stated that the term for finalizing the transition is the end of 3rd trimester (i.e. 30 September 1990).

Pyper was born in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. In 1896 and 1897, he was a missionary for the LDS Church in the Eastern States Mission of the church. From 1898 to 1929, Pyper was the manager of the Salt Lake Theatre. (The theatre was torn down in 1929.) As theatre manager, Pyper kept an extensive collection of photographs of performers; the collection is currently held by the J. Willard Marriott Library at the University of Utah. A talented singer, Pyper was the leading tenor in the Salt Lake Opera Company for many years. He was a member of and the manager of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. In 1911, Pyper managed a 6000-mile American tour for the choir, wherein they performed in Madison Square Gardens and at the White House for U.S. President William Howard Taft. In 1929, Pyper became the chair of the LDS Church's Pageant Committee, which produced the performance The Message for the Ages as a celebration of the church's centennial. At the age of 80, Pyper was a technical advisor to the producers of the 1940 Hollywood film Brigham Young; Pyper had known Young prior to his death in 1877.Church News, July 12, 2003. In 1918, Pyper was asked by church Apostle and general Sunday School superintendent David O. McKay to be his second assistant. Pyper served in this capacity until 1934, when McKay was released and Pyper was called as the fifth general superintendent of the Deseret Sunday School Union. Pyper was the first general superintendent of the LDS Sunday School who was not also an apostle of the church. Pyper's assistants were Milton Bennion and George R. Hill, both of whom went on to serve as general Sunday School superintendents. In 1890 and 1891, Pyper was an associate editor of The Contributor, a periodical targeted at Latter-day Saint adolescents. Beginning in 1910, Pyper became the editor of The Juvenile Instructor, the LDS Church Sunday School's official periodical. When the Juvenile Instructor folded and was replaced by The Instructor, Pyper became the first editor of the new publication, a position he held until his death. Pyper is the author of the 1930 book Stories of the Latter-day Saint Hymns, their Authors, and Composers. He composed the music to \\"Does the Journey Seem Long?\\", a hymn written by Joseph Fielding Smith which is included in the 1985 English-language LDS Church hymnal as hymn #127.

The mall opened on October 11, 1979 and connected two pre- existing structures ‚Äì the freestanding Montgomery Ward on its south side and Laurel Shopping Center to the north.\\"Laurel Centre Expansion Under Way,\\" The Washington Post, June 30, 1978, p. F1. The mall closed permanently on May 1, 2012.  History  The Laurel Centre Mall was developed by Shopco Inc. and included two anchor stores, Montgomery Ward and JCPenney, with a third anchor, Hecht's, added in 1981. The Montgomery Ward store opened for business on April 16, 1969 as a stand-alone business.\\"Ward to Open Fifth Area Store in Laurel,\\" The Washington Post, Times Herald April 13, 1969, p. 138. Montgomery Ward's entered a long-term lease for a $1.60/sf, which was to be offset by higher rates charged to satellite shops drawing on the anchor. It would be ten years until the JCPenney store opened in 1979, with the Laurel Centre expansion, creating a traditional enclosed mall. The Hecht Company moved its store from its previous location in the Laurel Shopping Center. In 1991, the mall received a $2 million face lift and update.\\"Laurel Centre Gets Makeover,\\" The Washington Post, March 21, 1991, p. MD1C. Though it was small in comparison with most malls today, Laurel Mall had two levels and, when it opened, had modern innovations such as a slowly rotating two-story island in the middle of a fountain known as the \\"Carousel\\" with room for seven kiosks on the bottom and a stage on top. Time Out Tunnel arcade had a location near the main entrance on the second level. Other features at the mall were a glass-sided walkway over a roadway and parking lot and an enclosed bridge between JCPenney and Woolworth's at the Laurel Shopping Center. The food court \\"Inner Circle\\", later changed to \\"Circle Eatery\\", was located at the mall's south end. Here the mall split into a one level mezzanine section to accommodate Montgomery Ward, which had no second floor. Connecting it all were Maryland's shortest escalators at the time, one rising to a height of only 13 steps. A double-door elevator transported customers between the three levels and to a management office in the basement. On November 1, 1980, Congresswoman Gladys Noon Spellman collapsed at a campaign appearance at the Laurel Mall after suffering an incapacitating heart attack. She represented the 5th congressional district of Maryland from January 3, 1975 to January 3, 1981. By the 2000s, the Mall had been in decline. In 2001, anchor store Montgomery Ward went out of business, and JC Penney vacated the mall in 2002. Around the same time, the expansion and renovation of the nearby Mall in Columbia added restaurants and movie theaters to its existing tenants. Big-box stores at U.S. Route 1 and Maryland Route 198 opened and expanded offerings over the decade. As a result, business at the Laurel mall dwindled. A Burlington Coat Factory occupied most of the former Montgomery Ward space, and Macy's replaced Hecht's in 2006. On two occasions, sections of the aging parking decks had crumbled and fallen onto the parking lots below, resulting in their closure. In January 2012, Macy's announced it would close five underperforming stores with final clearance sales beginning January 8, and would run through early spring, including the Laurel Mall location, which left Burlington Coat Factory its last remaining anchor store. During this phase, the mall advertised its transformation with cryptic messages printed across some of the shuttered store fronts, such as \\"Don't judge a book by its cover\\", \\"Looks can be deceiving\\", \\"Beauty is more than skin deep\\", \\"If nothing ever changed, there'd be no butterflies\\", and \\"It's what's inside that counts\\".  Redevelopment  In 1991, the mall removed its wood-finished floors and store fascias, and updated with modern pastel colored Formica panels. The floor was redone with a cream colored marble, and the revolving center shops were replaced with a blue painted steel stairway and security desk. In 2006, the mall fell into receivership and was sold to Somera Capital Management, which owns and operates many malls across the nation, for $31 million. Somera hired General Growth Properties to redevelop the space. Renovation plans were unveiled to the public on January 30, 2007, at Laurel City Hall. The plans included a new anchor, a 16-screen Regal Theaters with stadium seating, a two-story bookstore, a new food court, restaurants with sidewalk dining (including Mimi's Cafe), new national and regional shops, a new parking deck, a redesigned exterior of bricks and stones, and a new interior. The redesigned mall was to be renamed \\"Laurel Commons,\\" and was to have been accompanied by luxury apartments and a grocery store on the mall property. The first phase of the project was scheduled to begin construction in 2009. General Growth Properties filed bankruptcy protection, and construction never started, to the dismay of the City Council and Mayor, who threatened to withdraw the $16 million tax break. Greenberg Gibbons Commercial (GGC) took partial ownership and began managing the mall on March 1, 2011. GGC also unveiled new plans for the redevelopment of the mall, to include demolition of most of the existing mall with the exception of Macy's and the rear parking structure. The new plans called for an open air multi-use shopping center which would include a movie theater, health club, restaurants, and a residential area. The mall would also receive a new name, \\"Laurel Town Center.\\" Construction was scheduled to begin in approximately 18 months from the time that the new plans were announced in March 2011. The mall closed on May 1, 2012. Burlington Coat Factory remained open, pending final agreements regarding redevelopment of the site. Additionally, a branch of the United States Post Office remained open, although the Postal Service had already targeted the Laurel Main Branch for closure. On August 14, 2012, the city of Laurel hosted a groundbreaking ceremony to begin destruction of the current mall. As of October 12, 2012, all of the parking garage on the Rt 1 side of the mall has been demolished, and interior demolition of the mall has begun. The Burlington Coat Factory (former Montgomery Ward) building was demolished in July 2013; it was the only remaining portion of the former mall. Towne Centre at Laurel under construction in 2014 The new center, named Towne Centre at Laurel, includes a relocation of Burlington Coat Factory, along with new stores and restaurants, including Harris Teeter, Sports Authority (closed 2016), Party City, Panera Bread, Moe's Southwest Grill, Buffalo Wild Wings, Old Navy, Outback Steakhouse, and Regal Cinemas. Construction was completed, and the Towne Centre at Laurel opened in 2014.

He was an early associate of Henry Ford, one of the first employees of the Ford Motor Company, and the chief contributor to the design of the Model T. After leaving Ford, he began his own automobile company. Early career Wills was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1878, the youngest child of John C. and Angelina S. Wills. His first name Childe was taken from the poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimage by Lord Byron. Wills hated the name, however, and always went by his middle name Harold or his initials instead. By 1885, the family had moved to Detroit, Michigan, where Wills finished his schooling. Wills seemed to have an equal interest in commercial art and mechanical engineering; he learned a considerable amount about the latter from his father, a railroad mechanic.Hemmings Motor News: Childe Harold Wills, retrieved July 23, 2009 When Wills was 17, he began a four-year apprenticeship as a toolmaker at the Detroit Lubricator Company, where his father worked. At the same time, he took night courses in metallurgy, chemistry and mechanical engineering. After serving his apprenticeship, he moved on to the Boyer Machine Co., later the Burroughs Adding Machine Co., becoming chief engineer in 1901, when he was only 23. Ford Motor Company However, Wills was strongly attracted to automobiles, and in 1899 approached Henry Ford, offering to work for him part-time. Wills worked with Ford in the early mornings and late evenings at the Detroit Automobile Company, of which Ford was superintendent. The Detroit Automobile Company was reorganized in 1901 as the Henry Ford Company, and by 1902, Wills was working for Ford full- time, helping him build his 999 and Arrow racers. When Ford started Ford Motor Company in 1903, Wills went along as chief designer and metallurgist. Although Wills was too poor to afford stock in the new company, Ford offered Wills 10% of Ford's own dividend. At Ford, Wills hired Peter E. Martin in 1903. He worked hand-in-hand with Ford on the early Ford models. When Ford planned mass production of cars, Wills saw the importance of lightweight, strong, nickel- chrome vanadium steel to the mass production process. Ford tasked Wills with determining how to produce the necessary quantities of steel. Wills eventually found a mill to produce it, and in 1907 Ford used the alloy in the production of his Model N at the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant. Wills also contributed heavily to the design of the Ford Model T. Wills is credited with designing the planetary transmission used in the Model T and the detachable cylinder head as well as (with his early interest in commercial art and calligraphy) the calligraphy of the script \\"Ford\\" logo that is still in use today. Wills also was given charge of the production of the Liberty engine during World War I. In 1904, Wills married Mabel Preston. Henry Ford was the best man at their wedding. The couple had a son in 1906 who only survived an hour. They then had two daughters. Virginia was born in 1908, and Josephine in 1910.Naldrett (2017), pp. 30, 34 In 1914, Wills married Mary Coyne. He had two sons with Mary: John Harold and Childe Harold Jr. Although Ford and Wills began as friends, over time the relationship between the two grew frosty, exacerbated by Charles E. Sorensen's dislike for Wills. In 1919, as Ford began buying out his minority shareholders, Wills demanded an accounting of the profit-sharing he had accrued. Ford ultimately provided Wills with a $1.5 million severance package. In addition, Wills had amassed another $4 million from his own shrewd investments in steel firms. After Ford With his capital, Wills started his own automobile firm, Wills Sainte Claire. He built a factory just north of Detroit scouting the area on his yacht the Tashmu and docking it there in summer months, and incorporated and re-platted the surrounding area of the town of Marysville, Michigan. He moved the town from its original location, to where the town park, and the Chrysler Plant are today. The first automobile model, the Gray Goose, debuted in 1921. It was a sensation, but its $3000 cost led to low sales, and the company lost money. Although Wills still supported his factory, the company lost money every year, and Wills shut the doors in 1927. Chrysler bought the plant in 1933. Wills went on to join Ruxton and eventually consulted at Chrysler as a metallurgist. His various patents also provided a steady income. In 1940, Wills suffered a stroke and died a short time later at Henry Ford Hospital. He is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery, Detroit, Michigan. References  External links  *C.

It is published by Springer Science+Business Media and was established in 1971. The founding editor was Emile Zuckerkandl, who remained editor-in-chief until the late 1990s. In 1994, the journal became associated with the then existent International Society of Molecular Evolution. Scope In a 1998 editorial, Zuckerkandl stated that he wanted the journal to \\"insure that this field be covered in its broadest sense\\" by publishing research that is of broad interest to the field of molecular evolution that it helped define, as well as to biology in general. To this end, Zuckerkandl stated that the journal does not cover research either on practical applications of molecular evolution, or articles \\"whose focus is very restricted and that do not lead to valuable insights beyond their narrow topic\\". However, he looked forward to coverage of new, rapidly developing areas of molecular evolution such as molecular developmental biology and work connecting molecular evolution to higher levels of biological organization. In 1999, under the new joint editorship of Martin Kreitman, Takashi Gojobori, and Giorgio Bernardi, the journal made explicit its focus on \\"the fundamental issues in molecular evolution\\", to the exclusion of molecular phylogenetics (the purview of several other molecular evolution journals, most significantly Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution), except in cases that have \\"a special significance and impact\\".Giorgio Bernardi; Takashi and Martin Kreitman, Editorial, Journal of Molecular Evolution, vol. 48 (1999), p. 1 An editorial by Niles Lehman, editor-in-chief at the time, in 2013 stated a refocus of the journal‚Äôs aims towards its original scope with the inclusion of an emphasis on the mechanisms of evolution. ‚ÄúStudies performed using computational, chemical, in vitro, and experimental evolutionary methods, and those that target species-independent phenomena such as ribosomal function, genetic code evolution, and regulatory processes will occupy more of the journal space than before, with the consequence that work that is organism-, lineage-, or gene-specific will require a broader impact to be considered for publication.\\" Zuckerkandl Prize In 2001, the publisher established the yearly Zuckerkandl Prize for the best paper from the journal, in honor of Emile Zuckerkandl.Giorgio Bernardi; Takashi Gojobori; and Martin Kreitman, Editorial, Journal of Molecular Evolution, vol. 52 (2001), p. 1  References   External links  * Category:Evolutionary biology journals Category:Springer Science+Business Media academic journals Category:Publications established in 1971 Category:Monthly journals Category:English-language journals ","title":"Journal of Molecular Evolution"},{"id":"13086883","text":"Ollie Johnson (born May 11, 1949) is an American former professional basketball player.

Although Zheng Zhilong was a real person the company as it is portrayed in the novel is fictional and not an actual historical organisation. According to the book Iquan's Party was the Zheng clan's trading fleet, which in general referred to Zheng Zhilong's armed merchant enterprise, more specifically this was made up of the Five Mountain Merchants and Five Seas Merchants responsible for trade, Zheng's household forces () and an intelligence division known as the Hongmen Tiandihui (). Development Early period Initially Iquan's Party was a simple trading enterprise plying the Japan-China Southeast Asian trade routes. In addition it operated a business providing security to trading ships, ships that had paid a protection fee would fly a flag indicating that protection. The enterprise was initially led by Li Dan who was a leader of the Chinese merchant community in Japan, at this time Zheng Zhilong was the youngest member of the Society of the Twenty Eight Brothers. By 1625 Zheng Zhilong had become the leader of a group of eighteen birth and oath brothers known as the Eighteen Zhis (so called because all eighteen shared Zhi as a generational name). Middle period During this period Zheng temporarily left the organisation, turning to outright piracy in Taiwan under Yan Siqi. When this pirate grouping dissolved some of its members continued to follow Zheng Zhilong, this becoming the core of his personal navy. Late period Later, in 1628, Zheng accepted the authority of the Ming government, the Eighteen Zhis splitting into pro and anti Ming factions. From this time onwards Zheng worked to suppress smuggling, apprehending even those who in previous days were oath brothers, at one time presenting to the court papers relating to \\"The arrest of Zhengyi Guan by Zheng Zhilong\\" documents created to show that he had washed his hands of his previous life of brigandage. Militarily in addition to expanding his existing naval forces, Zheng created land forces. However, because official resources were lacking, Zheng's army were closer to being household retainers rather than of being true professional soldiers; their role being to protect the group's trade by providing security both at sea and ashore. Income from the group's trade activities went back into the maintenance of its military, the relationship with the government being similar to modern outsourced private military contracts rather than being part of the official Ming military. Iquan's Party would be inherited by Koxinga, and under his leadership the development of the trade arm of the organisation would become ever more intricate whilst the military arm was effectively unified. Koxinga founded the Kingdom of Tungning with these forces. They fought in the Sino-Dutch conflicts in the Battle of Liaoluo Bay and Siege of Fort Zeelandia.

He was re-elected in the 1910 election, when he finished first of eleven candidates, but this two year term was truncated by Edmonton's amalgamation with Strathcona, which meant that Lundy had to seek re-election in the February 1912 election. He did, and won another two year term. He did not re-enter politics at this term's conclusion. While an alderman, he chaired the parks and industries committee and was instrumental in the design, acquisition, and development of the 50 Mile River Drive.

The dish can still be found on the menus of retro diners and American home-style restaurants. It is especially common in the regions of Pennsylvania and the Midwest with a strong German culture, although there is nothing exclusively German about the dish. Beef liver and onions is still widely popular in Latin America (, ), where it is often eaten along with tortillas or rice.

He is the twin brother of Christopher Alden, also an opera director in the revisionist mold. The two brothers have covered much of the same repertoire in their long careers, but whereas Christopher's operatic settings place greater emphasis on his characters' emotional range, David's protagonists are more broadly caricatured and his productions far more politically charged. Another distinguishing feature between them is that David has been more active in Europe throughout his career, having enjoyed a particularly close creative partnership with Sir Peter Jonas for more than two decades, at both the English National Opera and the Bavarian State Opera. Early life David Alden and his identical twin Christopher were born into a show business family closely tied to Broadway. Their father was the playwright Jerome Alden, and their mother was the ballerina Barbara Gaye, who danced in the original productions of On the Town and Annie Get Your Gun with Ethel Merman. As eight- year-olds, they listened at home to recordings of Gilbert & Sullivan operettas, and as teenagers in the mid-'60s, they frequently bought standing room tickets at the Metropolitan Opera. By age 13, both had decided they wanted to direct opera. David studied at the University of Pennsylvania and like his brother, launched his directing career with Opera Omaha in the 1970s. In 1976, he visited Europe where he immersed himself in the cultural stream of contemporary opera directors the likes of Giorgio Strehler, Harry Kupfer, Hans Neuenfels and Ruth Berghaus. Theirs was a generation of direct heirs to the Expressionist movement and, in particular, to Bertolt Brecht. For Alden, the exposure was a revelation that unlocked intense passions he had long wanted to express in musical theater. His first European production in the late ‚Äò70s was a Rigoletto for Scottish Opera that, he says, was assailed by the critics because \\"in England, it was still very early to speak directly to the audience with the style I was attempting and place passion and schizophrenia on the stage.\\"General Director Peter Jonas talks to stage director David Alden (1994) In 1980, Alden was tapped by the Metropolitan Opera to replace the late Herbert Graf in its restaging of Wozzeck as well as the revivals in 1985 and 1988. As John Rockwell noted in The New York Times, \\"Alden's staging‚Ä¶ (is) indebted to Expressionist films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, full of stark silhouettes and lurching zombies.\\" Powerhouse years at English National Opera In 1984, Peter Jonas -- formerly artistic director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra -- was named to succeed the Earl of Harewood as general director of English National Opera. Together with music director Mark Elder and stage director David Pountney, they became the ruling \\"Power House\\" triumvirate that re-invigorated the artistic direction of ENO with a series of modernist interpretations of classic operas as well as productions of newly commissioned operas. That year, David Alden staged a controversial ENO production of Tchaikovsky's Mazeppa that became emblematic of the new era. At the end of Act II when the hero Kochubey and his friend Iskra are dragged to the executioner's block, Alden shocked his audience with a gruesome chainsaw massacre that set the tone for the bloody mad scene in Act III and forever enshrined his production in the minds of London opera goers as \\"the Chainsaw Mazeppa\\" that \\"became a sort of shorthand for the entire Jonas project -- brutal, uncompromising, unmissable, the ultimate succ√®s de scandale.\\" Neither Mazeppa nor Simon Boccanegra, Ballo in Maschera - or any of the other power house productions have been preserved on videotape. Over the next decade, Alden continued in his role as provocateur and key collaborator of the ENO Power House with Giuseppe Verdi's Simon Boccanegra and Un ballo in maschera, George Frideric Handel's Ariodante, Hector Berlioz' La Damnation de Faust, Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde and more recently, a 2006 production of Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek's Jen≈Øfa that won an Olivier Award for Best New Opera Production. Bavarian State Opera In 1993, Peter Jonas became intendant of the Bavarian State Opera, and from then to his departure in 2006, he made David Alden productions a mainstay of his tenure. Those included a Handel series with Ariodante, Orlando, Rinaldo and Rodelinda; Claudio Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea and Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria; Richard Wagner's Tannh√§user and Der Ring des Nibelungen; Francesco Cavalli's La Calisto, Verdi's La forza del destino, Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades and Alban Berg's Lulu. At the 2006 Munich Opera Festival, the Staatsoper made the extraordinary gesture of reviving eight of those productions to celebrate its association with Alden. In addition, he was awarded a special Bavarian Theater Prize for Individual Artistic Achievement in recognition of his artistic contributions to the Bavarian State Opera. Directing career in Europe and the U.S. In Europe, Alden has also produced operas for Welsh National Opera, Vienna Volksoper and Komische Oper Berlin. He staged a new production of Thomas Ad√®s' Powder Her Face for the Aldeburgh Festival and has mounted operas in Cologne, Frankfurt, Antwerp and Graz. In 1995 he directed in Tel Aviv the world premi√®re of Josef Tal's Joseph ‚Äì a Kafkaesque story about modern society's norms and illusions. In 2009 Alden directed Francesco Cavalli's 'Ercole Amante' for the Dutch National Opera in Amsterdam (De Nederlandse Opera) to much critical acclaim and is returning with the same artistic team to stage H√§ndel's 'Deidamia' in which will premiere March 15, 2012. Alden's collaborations with American companies include operas for Lyric Opera of Chicago, Metropolitan Opera, Houston Grand Opera and the Spoleto Festival USA. He created the American premieres of Siegfried Matthus' Judith for Santa Fe Opera and Karol Szymanowski's King Roger for Long Beach Opera, a production so deconstructionist that the reviewer for The New York Times reported \\"the opera still awaits a true American premiere.\\" In 1990, he mounted the world premiere of William Bolcom's cabaret opera Casino Paradise at the American Music Theater Festival in Philadelphia, and in 1992, he co-directed -- with his brother Christopher -- the three Mozart/Da Ponte operas in a production for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra led by Daniel Barenboim. For film and television, Alden has directed Franz Schubert's Die Winterreise with Ian Bostridge and Julius Drake, Kurt Weill's Die sieben Tods√ºnden and a documentary on the life of Verdi for BBC Television. Several of his stage productions have been filmed for wider video release. Opera as political theater David Alden's opera settings are known for their expression of rage at the human condition. He has also been in the forefront of presenting opera as a running commentary on current or near current historical and political affairs. His 1988 production of Berg's Wozzeck for Los Angeles Opera was recast as a Vietnam era tale of moral corruption where \\"Wozzeck and his cronies are Green Berets packing machetes and M-16s\\", where \\"the Captain is a cigar-chomping skinhead in backpack and fatigues\\" and in whose \\"dreamlike escapes from reality... Wozzeck comes home to his girlfriend Marie after a hard day of defoliating forests and hunting Viet Cong. Clearly, Alden's apocalypse is here and now.\\" His first production of Richard Strauss' Salome in 2006, presented in Lithuania, eschewed the biblical timeframe of Oscar Wilde's original for a more contemporary, Soviet era setting exposing \\"fifty years of occupation, suppression and persecution\\" with Herod portrayed as a debauched \\"dictator who senses the approach of the end of his regime.\\"A Long Fuse And though Alden's Munich staging of Rinaldo in 2000 pre-dated September 11 and George W. Bush's Iraq War, he had the timely insight to move the opera's action from the medieval Crusader era of Torquato Tasso's Gerusalemme liberata to the modern day Middle East and to \\"[make] it something of an American Radical Religious Right Crusade...[putting] a self-promoting contemporary Protestant Christian Evangelist center stage.\\"David Alden's Post- Modernist 'Rinaldo'  References  External links *David Alden Intermusica Biography Category:American opera directors Category:Living people Category:1949 births Category:Musicians from New York City Category:University of Pennsylvania alumni ","title":"David Alden"},{"id":"13087071","text":"Wisteria Lodge may refer to: * Wisteria Lodge (Reading, Massachusetts), a historic house * \\"The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge\\", a Sherlock Holmes story ","title":"Wisteria Lodge"},{"id":"13087073","text":"Eric Asimov (born July 17, 1957) is an American wine critic and food critic for The New York Times.

As chief wine critic, he writes two columns, \\"The Pour\\" and \\"Wines of the Times\\" (or occasionally \\"Beers of the Times\\"), both of which appear in the paper on an alternating bi-weekly schedule. In March 2006, Asimov began writing a wine blog, also titled \\"The Pour\\".Eric Asimov. \\"Easy to Pour\\", The New York Times, March 14, 2006. Asimov has also done freelance work for other publications, including Food & Wine Magazine, Details, Martha Stewart Living and Sommelier Journal. Between 1999 and 2004, Asimov had a daily spot on The New York Times- owned radio station WQXR (at around 8:25 AM) during which he critiqued food and wine. When he became chief wine critic of The New York Times in 2004, he reduced his time on WQXR to a weekly spot on wine. After The New York Times sold the station to WNYC, the new ownership eliminated many WQXR features. Mr. Asimov's name is not listed as a host on the current [2018] station list of hosts.

It was the third of seven episodes aired in the series' first season, called The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode first aired on 8 May 1984. Plot Briarbrae House  The episode opens on a rainy night. A frantically crying man (Percy Phelps) is carried into his home by a few men while his fianc√©e (Annie) and her brother (Joseph Harrison) watch over him worriedly. The titles follow. The scene changes to the drawing room at the residence of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson at 221B Baker Street Holmes is busy with a chemical experiment pertaining to a case he is investigating when Dr. Watson enters the room with a letter he has received from his childhood friend, a senior at school and a brilliant academician, Percy Phelps. Holmes reads the letter handed to him by Dr. Watson in which Percy states that after completing his education he obtained an appointment at the Foreign Office where he was able to win a position of trust and honor, and that a misfortune has occurred which has ruined his career and reputation. He requests Dr. Watson to get Holmes to meet him so that he may get his assistance in the matter. Holmes deduces from the writing that it is of a woman and that she is of an exceptional nature, and agrees to accompany Dr. Watson to Phelps‚Äô home, Briarbrae House in Woking. Scene changes to the garden of Briarbrae House where Joseph Harrison comes across Holmes and Dr. Watson as they are walking in. Holmes deduces from the monogram on Harrison's jacket chain that he is not a member of Phelps family. Inside the house, in Phelps‚Äô sick room Holmes and Dr. Watson are greeted by Phelps himself and his fianc√©e Annie by his bed side. Theft of the treaty The scene changes to Lord Holdhurst's office as Phelps starts narrating the incidents of the evening of 23 May, when he was summoned by Lord Holdhurst in his office. Lord Holdhurst entrusts Phelps with the task of creating a copy of a document - a naval treaty signed between England and Italy. He also tells Phelps that the job has to be done very carefully and while making sure that the contents are not leaked, as the Russian and French embassies are out to pay an immense sum of money to know the contents of the document. He suggests Percy to stay back after office, so that everyone has left and then work on copying the document and specifically asks him to keep both the original document and the copy locked in his desk drawer and hand it over to personally the next morning. In answer to Holmes question as to the nature of the document, Percy tells him that the document defines the position of Great Britain towards the triple alliance in the event of the French fleet gaining ascendency over Italy in the Mediterranean. Phelps returns to his office, waits till his colleague Charles Gorot leaves for the day and then starts copying the document page by page. Back in the present times, Phelps tells Holmes that that evening he intended to join Harrison on the 11‚ÄôO clock train back to Woking but was not able to, because the document, written in French, was very long. Scene changes back to Phelps‚Äô office where, after a while of working on the document, Phelps rings the bell to summon commissionaire to get him a cup of coffee. The bell is answered by a woman who says he is the commissionaire's wife. She leaves after saying she will wake the commissionaire to prepare the coffee. Phelps resumes working on the document but since the coffee does not arrive for a while, leaves his room, with the original and the half-finished copy on his desk, to go down and check on the commissionaire. He finds that the commissionaire had dozed off and while he is apologizing for that, to both their surprise, a bell rings in the commissionaire's room. The commissionaire is confused as to the ringing of the bell and upon asking tells Phelps that that bell is from the room in which he was working. Phelps, realizing that the documents are lying unprotected on his desk, rushes up the stairs to his room and finds that the original document has disappeared from his desk. Back in the present time, Phelps tells Holmes that he did not pass anyone on the stairs while going up. He gets upset and breathless out of anxiety, while narrating the incident. While Watson reviews a rough chart of the building that Phelps has drawn, Phelps goes on to state there are two stairs that lead up to Phelps‚Äô office, and since he went up using one of those stairs when he heard the bell and didn't meet anyone on his way up, the thief must have used the other staircase that opened up on Charles street, and that it was impossible for the thief to lay concealed anywhere in the passageway and all the other doors were locked. Phelps tells Holmes that he distinctly remembers hearing the three quarters of the Big Ben, indicating that the time was quarter to 10. He tells Holmes that he and the commissionaire took the other stair and went out on Charles Street but it was raining (since 7 that evening) and there was no one to be seen on the street. A policeman who they met around the corner tells them that hasn't seen leave the building for a quarter of an hour except the commissionaire's wife. Phelps relapses into a bout of breathlessness while talking and they have to leave him to rest for a while. Meanwhile, Holmes asks Joseph Harrison about his occupation and finds out that as the eldest son, he is expecting to inherit his father's business and that he also doubles in stocks and shares. Harrison tells him that he was not planning on meeting Phelps on the evening of the incident, and that he did not know of Phelps intention of joining him on the train back to Woking. Phelps continues his narrative after he is feeling better. He tells them that after discovering the theft they search the commissionaire's home (since his wife was seen leaving the building around the time the theft occurred) but find no trace of the document. Phelps says that he has no recollection of what happened after this since he was delirious and was escorted to his home by a doctor living in his neighbourhood and who was fortunately traveling by the same train as the one to be taken by Phelps at the time (the 11.40 train to Woking). Investigations at the Foreign Office Holmes and Watson discuss the matter among themselves as they walk to a cab which they take to the Foreign Office. In the Foreign Office, they meet inspector Forbes tells them they have cleared both Tangier, the commissionaire and Gorot, Phelps colleague. He admits that he has no idea who rang the bell and why. Holmes and Watson then meet Lord Holdurst in his office where he tells them that he is certain no one overheard him giving Phelps instructions about the document and that no one even knew of the task assigned to him. With this information Holmes deduces that the person who took the document from Phelps‚Äô office, came across it unexpectedly. In answer Holmes‚Äô question as to whether the effects of the leakage of the contents of the document have been seen, Lord Holdhurst replies that he hasn't seen any such effects and says that he would certainly get to know if any of the agencies were to get to know about the document. Back at Baker Street, Holmes tells Watson that he intends to do nothing more that evening unless he got an answer to the cab enquiry he has made to know if any cab driver left any one at or near the Foreign Office on the evening of the incident. Burglary at Briarbrae House & Holmes' plan At Briarbrae House, Phelps refuses to take his sleep medication and tells Annie that he will sleep without medication as he has got new hope since Holmes has taken up the case. As Phelps is sleeping without his medication, he is woken up later that night to see the silhouette of someone trying to enter his room through the window. Noticing that Phelps is awake, the person flees before he is able to take a look at the face. The next morning Phelps informs Holmes and Watson of the intrusion from the previous night. While Watson, Harrison and Phelps are outside discussing the matter, Holmes rushes to talk to Annie who is sitting in Phelps‚Äô sick room and tells her to enact a plan that evening. He asks her to remain in the same room all day and to lock the room from the outside when she leaves to go to bed. He then asks Phelps to come with him and Watson to London and spend the night there. On their way to Woking station, Holmes suddenly gets out of the carriage after giving Watson instructions to take Phelps to Baker Street and remaining there and tells them that he expects to join them at Baker Street by breakfast time the next morning. Holmes spends the day in the countryside and returns to Briarbrae later in the evening and sees Annie still in Phelps room, reading. Holmes' nocturnal adventures at Briarbrae House  Scene changes to Baker Street and it is the morning of the following day. Holmes has returned as expected and there is a handkerchief tied to his left hand, presumably because he has hurt himself. Mrs. Hudson brings in the breakfast in a tray of covered dishes. Phelps refuses to eat anything but Holmes asks him to help him by serving him some breakfast since his hand is hurt. Phelps lifts the lid off a dish and finds, to his immense surprise and joy, a scroll of paper which turns out to be the stolen treaty. Holmes, while eating his breakfast tells Phelps and Watson that the previous night he waited outside Phelps' window while Annie locks the door as instructed and leaves to go to bed. Later that night a person sneaks into the room through the window and Holmes follows the person inside. It is revealed that he person is Harrison. He has crept into the room to retrieve the document which he has hidden in underside of the sofa. After a struggle between the two, in which Holmes‚Äô hand is injured by Harrison's knife, Harrison escapes the scene. Watson is surprised that Holmes let Harrison get away, but Holmes tells him that he has wired Harrison's details to the police, but also says that it is better for Lord Holdhurst and Phelps‚Äô sake that he is not caught and that the matter never reaches the police court. Holmes says that Harrison was under heavy debt due to the money he lost in the stock market, giving him the motive for the theft. On the night of the theft, as Harrison got free earlier than expected he goes to Phelps‚Äô office intending to join him on the return train. He goes in by the side entrance (the one that opens up on Charles Street) and seeing no one in Phelps‚Äô room rings the bell. But after he rings the bell, he sees the treaty on the desk and realises that it is very important state document. So he steals it, goes back to Woking and stores it in the underside of the sofa in his room, intending to sell it at a later time. Just as he finishes hiding the document, Phelps‚Äô voice is heard outside the house as he is brought home in a delirious state. Harrison has to move out of his room as it is turned into a sick room for Phelps, and since after that time there is always someone present in the room, he is not able to retrieve the document. Holmes reasons that since the attempt to break in was made on the same night that the hired nurse was not present in Phelps‚Äô room, the person must have been someone who knew the household well and hence knew that the nurse would be not be present in the room that night. But since Phelps had slept very lightly that night due to not having taken his sleeping draft, the attempt failed. Holmes explains further that on the previous day he increased Harrison's anticipation by asking Annie to stay in the room all day. By following him into the room later that night, he allows Harrison himself to show him the hiding place of the document instead of having to rip up the whole room searching for it. In reply to Watson's question as to why Harrison used the window instead of the door to enter the room, Holmes says that he did that to make it look like the job of a burglar and if necessary effect an escape across the courtyard.

Plot Eleven-year-old girl, Jody, is adopted by a loving couple, Don, and Barbara Mitchell. Jody develops an obsession with her father and paranoia and jealousy about others spending time with him. This leads her to become psychopathic and so envious of his relationships with other people she sets out to remove these people from her father's life. Jody kills her principal, Mrs. Hemp, when the latter suggests that Jody may need to be placed in a state-run boarding school, where she will only see her father on weekends, because of her behavior problems the past school year. Jody goes to the school when only Mrs. Hemp is there and tricks her into standing on a chair to retrieve a book from a high shelf. Jody then pushes the chair out from under her principal, and proceeds to tip the bookcase over onto her prostrate form. Don and Barbara's marriage is becoming strained because of Don's constant spoiling of Jody and the fact that Barbara has to be the breadwinner since Don is working as a toy designer but his projects are not selling. Barbara vents her frustrations to various people, who tell her to divorce Don and take custody of Jody. Jody's maternal grandmother, Jacqueline, is one of the first to do so and, in response to this, Jody pours drain cleaning fluid into Jacqueline's juice one day when Jacqueline is at their house for brunch. She tries to trick Jacqueline into drinking by toasting her father as a great toy designer, but Jacqueline refuses to drink to this. So, later, Jody goes to her house and suggests playing a game of hide-and-seek with her so they can grow closer. Tricking Jacqueline into going upstairs and playing a cassette of her crying for help, Jody shoves her grandmother down the stairs. Jacqueline survives the fall, but goes into a coma. She is later killed in the hospital when Jody sabotages her ventilator after waking up from her coma. Later, Jody kills her mother's friend, Rachel, as Jody had overheard Rachel advising Barbara to consider divorcing Don. During the course of the film, Jody's adoptive cousin, Karen, a college student who has been staying with the family for the summer, becomes suspicious of Jody's behavior. She begins investigating Jody's past, despite Barbara's insistence that she mind her own business, and discovers that as a toddler, Jody witnessed the murder of her biological father by her biological mother, and that she had been removed from her previous foster home when her foster father was convicted of fraud after his wife was killed by being a nag, suspiciously similar to that of Jody's recently deceased adoptive grandmother. This causes Karen to alert social services. At the end of the film, Jody pushes Barbara over the edge of a balcony upon discovering that she is on the verge of finding out about Jody's crimes, but this does not kill her. When the social worker arrives at Jody's home, Jody bludgeons him with a heavy meat tenderizing mallet, then tries to pin it on Karen. Don, who was at a toy convention, returns home to tell Barbara that she no longer has to be breadwinner as he successfully sold a design for a lot of money, only to find the body of the social worker and his wife injured on the ground. Karen calls 911 and Barbara tells Don everything. Jody begins crying, saying that everyone is against her and begs Don to comfort her and love her, but Don, now knowing what his adopted daughter is capable of, refuses to comfort her, completely disgusted by her actions, and pushes her away, practically disowning Jody as his daughter. Don and Karen then continue to comfort Barbara while ignoring Jody, who still cries over the fact that Don doesn't love her and that everyone is against her, failing to realize the true reasons why. The movie closes with Jody's crying and the sound of police sirens in the background, giving implication to Jody's potential fate of being arrested or institutionalized.

It is composed of thirteen chapters, each written by a different Miami- area writer. It was originally published as a serial in the Miami Herald's Tropic magazine, one chapter per issue, and later published as a single novel. Its title is a reference to the literary hoax Naked Came the Stranger. The book was conceived of and edited by Tom Shroder, then editor of Tropic. Dave Barry came up with the first chapter, which was then handed to the next writer, and so on until Carl Hiaasen had to tie all the loose threads together in the final chapter. Each chapter was written on deadline for publication in the magazine. The plot involves three crime-solving characters from three of the writers' previous, non-parody, mystery/thriller works - Les Standiford's John Deal, Paul Levine's Jake Lassiter, and Edna Buchanan's Britt Montero - coming together to help an elderly environmentalist and her granddaughter investigate the mystery behind a package delivered by a precocious Miami-area manatee named Booger. All proceeds from the novel were donated to charity.  Contents and Authors   Chapter One: Booger  :by Dave Barry Two petty thugs, Hector and Phil, after retrieving a mysterious package from a courier off the coast of Cuba, begin arguing over the wheel of their skiff, and collide with \\"Booger\\", a manatee that favors the waters near Coconut Grove. Their package goes flying off the boat and snags on Booger's hide.  Chapter Two: The Big Wet Sleep  :by Les Standiford John Deal takes a shortcut to avoid a traffic jam in Coconut Grove, swerves to avoid a man standing in the road, and his car plunges into the ocean. Deal is saved from drowning by Booger, who nudges him to the surface and into the care of Marion McAlister Williams, a 102-year-old local matron. The package gets snagged on Deal, and Marion hauls them both onto shore.  Chapter Three: Biscayne Blues  :by Paul Levine Deal consults with attorney Jake Lassiter about suing the City of Miami for whiplash, but they are interrupted by Hector, who Deal has noticed following him. Deciding that the package must be valuable, Lassiter insists on having Marion's granddaughter, Fay Leonard (a dive shop operator) retrieve it. When they open it, they are shocked to find a sealed refrigeration unit containing what appears to be Fidel Castro's severed head.  Chapter Four: The L.A. Connection  :by Edna Buchanan Hector and Phil kidnap Fay and demand the package in return. Lassiter calls news reporter Britt Montero, needing help to confirm the identity of the head before they trade it for Fay's life.  Chapter Five: The Old Woman and the Sea  :by James W. Hall Booger, distressed by Fay's abduction, swims to the waters near Marion's home, where she cuts away a variety of debris snagged on his hide, including an identical silver package. When Phil sheepishly admits to Hector that Fay is his ex-wife, they let her go with instructions to retrieve the package from Marion.  Chapter Six: Heading to Havana  :by Carolina Hospital CIA agent Mike Weston visits Havana and informs a government functionary that the \\"heads\\" have gone missing. The official demands that they be recovered within 48 hours, or \\"the deal is off\\" and \\"Fidel will stay put.\\" When Fay returns to Marion, they open the second canister and see what appears to be another severed head resembling Castro's.  Chapter Seven: The Lock & Key  :by Evelyn Mayerson Fay calls Britt for help, and they meet with Jake. After checking the city morgue for headless bodies, Britt remembers that one of Castro's former lovers, Lilia Sands, lives in Miami, and is rumored to have saved a lock of his hair, which could be used for a DNA comparison.  Chapter Eight: Strange Fish  :by Tananarive Due After giving them the hair, Lilia receives a phone call advising her that Castro is on his way to Miami. Marion floats up dead, apparently drowned. While Britt is comforting Fay, the elderly fisherman who found Marion passes Fay a key that was clutched in her palm.  Chapter Nine: South Beach Serenade  :by Brian Antoni John Deal, having won a $9.2 million settlement from the City of Miami, has taken a tropical vacation to Havana, and happens to spot Weston in conversation with Hector, exile politician \\"Big Joey G.\\", and Juan Carlos Reyes, a Miami millionaire who aspires to become President of Cuba as soon as Castro is dead. Britt reluctantly has lunch with Hollywood actor Dash Brandon, who is \\"researching\\" a role as an undercover agent masquerading as a news reporter. Britt is shocked to hear from Brandon that a fake Castro head is a prop in his upcoming film and has gone missing, but he received a call saying he can retrieve it at an exclusive club in South Beach that evening. At the gala opening of the club, a DJ holds up what looks like Fidel Castro's head on a platter. Outside, Juan Carlos Reyes and an anti-Castro paramilitary group storm into the club, having been tipped that a high-ranking Cuban official is going to be there. They inadvertently let the clamoring crowd into the club, under which the glass dance floor breaks and dumps dozens of hapless guests, and the head, into a pool filled with real sharks. With the key, Fay opens Marion's safe deposit box and is stunned to find nearly a million dollars in cash, along with a note from Marion, admitting that she traded the head she found to some \\"bad people\\". N.B. Juan Carlos Reyes is first mentioned in Chapter Four, and was originally introduced in Edna Buchanan's novel Act of Betrayal.  Chapter Ten: Dance of the Manatee  :by Vicki Hendricks Booger remembers the night Marion was killed while swimming with him, accosted by two men who hauled her out of the water and demanded the head, then killed her when she said it was already gone. Unable to save her, Booger seized a piece of coral in his mouth and gouged the hull of their boat, sure that he will recognize it the next time he sees it. Hearing a radio report that a manatee has been injured, Fay and Britt jump aboard Fay's boat and speed to the scene, but are kidnapped at gunpoint by Hector and Joey G.  Chapter Eleven: Where Are You Dying Tonight?  :by John Dufresne Marion's funeral is attended by most of the characters who have previously appeared, including Marion herself (in ghost form). N.B. Dufresne opens the chapter with the line, \\"Call me Booger...\\", a spoof on Moby-Dick's opening line, \\"Call me Ishmael.\\"''  Chapter Twelve: The Odyssey  :by Elmore Leonard Coconut Grove police officer Joe Sereno observes two crime scene cleaners at work in a hotel room where two males were gruesomely killed. Looking out the window, Sereno sees a man that strongly resembles Castro (except without the trademark beard) lounging by the hotel's pool.  Chapter Thirteen: The Law of the Jungle  :by Carl Hiaasen Fay, Britt, Lilia, and the last remaining Castro head are taken to Juan Carlos Reyes's yacht off Bimini by Hector (during the boat ride, Joey G. accidentally chokes to death on conch salad). Reyes has a DNA expert compare a lock of hair taken from Lilia's home to a sample from the head, and is overjoyed when the two match. He has Fay and Britt held incommunicado in the Bahamas while he returns to Miami to triumphantly announce Castro's death and his own candidacy as Cuba's next President. In actuality, the two heads belonged to two of Castro's doubles, and were to be used in a deal brokered by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter: in exchange for a comfortable retirement in Miami, and access to top-flight medical care, Castro agreed to fake his own death and leave office. Since it was absolutely essential that the heads be kept secret until they were ready to be used, the CIA paid Marion $1 million to get back one, and ensured that the other ended up with Reyes. The DNA samples match because the dead double was also one of Lilia's lovers, and she saved a lock of his hair just as she did the real Castro's. The CIA has already eliminated Hector and Agent Weston (the two bodies found in the previous chapter) to ensure the plot remains secret. Unfortunately, Castro calls off the deal after taking a short walk on Miami Beach that ends with him being knocked down and mugged (by a man whom Castro recognizes, from the tattoos on his hands, as an ex-convict that Castro himself released from prison and sent to Miami during the Mariel boatlift). Even more harrowing than the crime itself is Officer Sereno's blithe assertion that such incidents are commonplace in South Florida. Declaring that \\"Miami [is] too damn scary,\\" Castro reunites with Lilia and returns to Cuba. Juan Carlos Reyes's televised rally to display the head is interrupted by a live broadcast from Havana, in which the real Castro appears. The crowd turns on Reyes, declaring him a fraud. In terror for his life, Reyes runs away and jumps into Biscayne Bay, carrying the head. As with John Deal, Booger is below Reyes in the shallows of the Bay, but this time, Booger has been lulled by a romantic encounter with a female manatee and so does not intervene to save Reyes from being run over by a reckless tourist boat, reflecting, \\"every mammal for himself.\\" External links *Dave Barry talks about the origin of the story Category:1996 American novels Category:American mystery novels Category:American thriller novels Category:American comedy novels Category:American satirical novels Category:Collaborative fiction Category:Novels by Dave Barry Category:Novels by Carl Hiaasen Category:Novels by Elmore Leonard Category:Miami Herald Category:Novels first published in serial form Category:Works originally published in American magazines Category:Novels set in Florida Category:Parody novels ","title":"Naked Came the Manatee"},{"id":"13087166","text":"The Empty House may refer to: Novels * The Empty House (novel) ‚Äî a 1974 suspense novel by Michael Gilbert Short Stories * The Adventure of the Empty House ‚Äî a Sherlock Holmes story ","title":"The Empty House"},{"id":"13087173","text":"is a railway station on the Osaka Metro Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi Line and Sennichimae Line in Nishi-ku, Osaka, Japan.

J. Thomson discovered the isotopes of neon using mass spectrometry. The mass recorded by a mass spectrometer can refer to different physical quantities depending on the characteristics of the instrument and the manner in which the mass spectrum is displayed. Units The dalton (symbol: Da) is the standard unit that is used for indicating mass on an atomic or molecular scale (atomic mass).Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (2019): The International System of Units (SI), 9th edition, English version, page 134. Available at the BIPM website. The unified atomic mass unit (symbol: u) is equivalent to the dalton. One dalton is approximately the mass of one a single proton or neutron. The unified atomic mass unit has a value of .Fundamental Physical Constants from NIST The amu without the \\"unified\\" prefix is an obsolete unit based on oxygen, which was replaced in 1961. Molecular mass Theoretical isotope distribution for the molecular ion of caffeine The molecular mass (abbreviated Mr) of a substance, formerly also called molecular weight and abbreviated as MW, is the mass of one molecule of that substance, relative to the unified atomic mass unit u (equal to 1/12 the mass of one atom of 12C). Due to this relativity, the molecular mass of a substance is commonly referred to as the relative molecular mass, and abbreviated to Mr. Average mass The average mass of a molecule is obtained by summing the average atomic masses of the constituent elements. For example, the average mass of natural water with formula H2O is 1.00794 + 1.00794 + 15.9994 = 18.01528 Da. Mass number The mass number, also called the nucleon number, is the number of protons and neutrons in an atomic nucleus. The mass number is unique for each isotope of an element and is written either after the element name or as a superscript to the left of an element's symbol. For example, carbon-12 (12C) has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Nominal mass The nominal mass for an element is the mass number of its most abundant naturally occurring stable isotope, and for an ion or molecule, the nominal mass is the sum of the nominal masses of the constituent atoms. Isotope abundances are tabulated by IUPAC: for example carbon has two stable isotopes 12C at 98.9% natural abundance and 13C at 1.1% natural abundance, thus the nominal mass of carbon is 12. The nominal mass is not always the lowest mass number, for example iron has isotopes 54Fe, 56Fe, 57Fe, and 58Fe with abundances 6%, 92%, 10%, and 2%, respectively, and a nominal mass of 56 Da. For a molecule, the nominal mass is obtained by summing the nominal masses of the constituent elements, for example water has two hydrogen atoms with nominal mass 1 Da and one oxygen atom with nominal mass 16 Da, therefore the nominal mass of H2O is 18 Da. In mass spectrometry, the difference between the nominal mass and the monoisotopic mass is the mass defect. This differs from the definition of mass defect used in physics which is the difference between the mass of a composite particle and the sum of the masses of its constituent parts. Accurate mass The accurate mass (more appropriately, the measured accurate mass) is an experimentally determined mass that allows the elemental composition to be determined. For molecules with mass below 200 Da, 5 ppm accuracy is often sufficient to uniquely determine the elemental composition. Exact mass The exact mass of an isotopic species (more appropriately, the calculated exact mass) is obtained by summing the masses of the individual isotopes of the molecule. For example, the exact mass of water containing two hydrogen-1 (1H) and one oxygen-16 (16O) is 1.0078 + 1.0078 + 15.9949 = 18.0105 Da. The exact mass of heavy water, containing two hydrogen-2 (deuterium or 2H) and one oxygen-16 (16O) is 2.0141 + 2.0141 + 15.9949 = 20.0229 Da. When an exact mass value is given without specifying an isotopic species, it normally refers to the most abundant isotopic species. Monoisotopic mass The monoisotopic mass is the sum of the masses of the atoms in a molecule using the unbound, ground-state, rest mass of the principal (most abundant) isotope for each element. The monoisotopic mass of a molecule or ion is the exact mass obtained using the principal isotopes. Monoisotopic mass is typically expressed in daltons. For typical organic compounds, where the monoisotopic mass is most commonly used, this also results in the lightest isotope being selected. For some heavier atoms such as iron and argon the principal isotope is not the lightest isotope. The mass spectrum peak corresponding to the monoisotopic mass is often not observed for large molecules, but can be determined from the isotopic distribution. Most abundant mass Theoretical isotope distribution for the molecular ion of glucagon (C153H224N42O50S) This refers to the mass of the molecule with the most highly represented isotope distribution, based on the natural abundance of the isotopes. Isotopomer and isotopologue Isotopomers (isotopic isomers) are isomers having the same number of each isotopic atom, but differing in the positions of the isotopic atoms. For example, CH3CHDCH3 and CH3CH2CH2D are a pair of structural isotopomers. Isotopomers should not be confused with isotopologues, which are chemical species that differ in the isotopic composition of their molecules or ions. For example, three isotopologues of the water molecule with different isotopic composition of hydrogen are: HOH, HOD and DOD, where D stands for deuterium (2H). Kendrick mass The Kendrick mass is a mass obtained by multiplying the measured mass by a numeric factor. The Kendrick mass is used to aid in the identification of molecules of similar chemical structure from peaks in mass spectra. The method of stating mass was suggested in 1963 by the chemist Edward Kendrick. According to the procedure outlined by Kendrick, the mass of CH2 is defined as 14.000 Da, instead of 14.01565 Da. The Kendrick mass for a family of compounds F is given by :Kendrick~mass~(F) = (observed~mass) \\\\times \\\\frac{nominal~mass~F}{exact~mass~F}~. For hydrocarbon analysis, F=CH2. Mass defect (mass spectrometry) The mass defect used in nuclear physics is different from its use in mass spectrometry. In nuclear physics, the mass defect is the difference in the mass of a composite particle and the sum of the masses of its component parts. In mass spectrometry the mass defect is defined as the difference between the exact mass and the nearest integer mass. The Kendrick mass defect is the exact Kendrick mass subtracted from the nearest integer Kendrick mass. Mass defect filtering can be used to selectively detect compounds with a mass spectrometer based on their chemical composition. Packing fraction (mass spectrometry) Francis William Aston won the 1922 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his discovery, by means of his mass spectrograph, of isotopes, in a large number of non-radioactive elements, and for his enunciation of the whole number rule. The term packing fraction was defined by Aston as the difference of the measured mass M and the nearest integer mass I (based on the oxygen-16 mass scale) divided by the quantity comprising the mass number multiplied by ten thousand: :f=\\\\frac{M-I}{10^4\\\\ I} . Aston's early model of nuclear structure (prior to the discovery of the neutron) postulated that the electromagnetic fields of closely packed protons and electrons in the nucleus would interfere and a fraction of the mass would be destroyed. A low packing fraction is indicative of a stable nucleus. Nitrogen rule The nitrogen rule states that organic compounds containing exclusively hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, and the halogens either have an odd nominal mass that indicates an odd number of nitrogen atoms are present or an even nominal mass that indicates an even number of nitrogen atoms are present in the molecular ion. Prout's hypothesis and the whole number rule The whole number rule states that the masses of the isotopes are integer multiples of the mass of the hydrogen atom. The rule is a modified version of Prout's hypothesis proposed in 1815, to the effect that atomic weights are multiples of the weight of the hydrogen atom.

His most famous moment was calling \\"GOLD, GOLD for Australia, GOLD\\" during the men's 4 √ó 100 metres medley final in the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games. Biography Early life and career May was born in Melbourne on 14 February 1928. His family moved to Sydney when he was three and he was raised in Coogee, a southern suburb of Sydney. Despite losing an eye in an accident at the age of six, he was considered talented at cricket, rugby league and surfing. May got into some trouble as a youth, culminating in his arrest and week-long detention. He attended Sydney Boys' High School, where he made the school's cricket and rugby union teams, but left at the age of 14. May was given the nickname \\"Nugget\\" during his youth due to his stocky body type, a name he was known by throughout his life. After leaving school May worked various jobs during World War II whilst continuing to play cricket, as well as being an active member of the Coogee Surf Life Saving Club. He moved to the suburb of North Curl Curl in Sydney's north with his mother in 1949, where he joined the Freshwater Surf Life Saving Club, before finally working as a clerk at an insurance company from his mid 20s. Broadcasting career In 1957 May was invited by his friend and ABC sports broadcaster Dick Healey to join him as a commentator of a surf lifesaving event. The following year he was employed by the ABC as a trainee broadcaster, where he remained as a full-time employee until 1984. During the men's 4 √ó 100 metres medley final at the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games, May's commentary for 2UE culminated in the exclamation \\"GOLD, GOLD for Australia, GOLD\\". The feat was significant it was Australia's first gold medal in eight years, after not winning any at the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games, while the government wanted the Australian team to follow America's lead in boycotting the Games. May's call of the race was notable for not hiding his support for the Australian team, as opposed to objective commentary that was the norm of the time. In the time since the event, May has become better associated with the win than the four swimmers who competed, with the swimmers themselves describing May as the fifth member of the relay team. May commentated a total of eleven Olympic and eleven Commonwealth Games during his career. Besides the Olympics, May called a wide variety of sports including harness racing, surf life-saving, cricket and rugby. His career in sports broadcasting continued following his official retirement from the ABC in 1984.Norman May on George Negus Tonight\\"Norman May Remembers his Early Days in ABC Television\\" Awards and recognition May received a Medal of the Order of Australia in 1983 and an Australian Sports Medal in 2000. Also in 2000, he was awarded an Olympic Order, and in 2003 he received an Australian Sports Commission Media Awards - Lifetime Achievement Award. May was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2004 and appointed a Member of the Order of Australia on 26 January 2009. His 'Gold Gold Gold: 4 √ó 100 Metres Men‚Äôs Medley Relay' race call was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia registry in 2010. Legacy May's contribution to Australian sports broadcasting has been held in high regard both during and after his career, with ABC broadcasters such as Jim Maxwell, Drew Morphett and Gerard Whateley considering May a mentor. He was particularly noted by Maxwell for his ability to speak without the benefit of an autocue. Death May died in Sydney on 11 September 2016, aged 88.

The city of Minneapolis designated a district bordered by Franklin Avenue, Fourth Avenue South, 26th Street East, and First Avenue South. A smaller district, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, includes seven mansions along and near 22nd Street East.  Overview  The development in the area was spurred by the desire of prominent families to move away from the central business district and to build larger and more elegant homes along what was the edge of town. Development began around the early 1870s and continued through about 1930. The houses within the district represent a number of popular architectural revival styles. The park itself is named for a now-demolished mansion known as Fairoaks. Built in 1884 by E. Townsend Mix, Fairoaks was one of the grandest Twin Cities mansions of its era. The house itself had 40 rooms and sat on a lavishly landscape lot two square blocks in size. It was built for William D. Washburn, a lawyer who moved to Minneapolis in 1857 and amassed a fortune in the family milling business. Washburn lived in the house until his death in 1912, at which point he willed the mansion to the Minneapolis Park Board. The park board ultimately found the mansion too expensive to maintain, so it was demolished in 1924. The Minneapolis Institute of Art building is located immediately south of the park. The site was formerly occupied by the Dorilus Morrison house, built in 1858 by a lumberman who moved from Maine and became a businessman in Minneapolis, as well as the city's first mayor. Clinton Morrison agreed to donate the old family estate to the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts. The house was demolished in 1911, and the Minneapolis Institute of Art, designed by the New York firm of McKim, Mead, and White was completed in 1915. The neighborhood surrounding the mansion district is now home to many young professionals and artists. Mansions in the district Eugene Merrill House The Eugene Merrill House from the southeast The Eugene Merrill House, at 2116 Second Avenue South, was built in 1884 by banker and lawyer Eugene Merrill, to designs by William Channing Whitney (1851‚Äì1945). The Merrill House is the oldest mansion in the district. Its rusticated red sandstone, bold massing, polygonal tower and characteristic clustered fenestration are marks of the Richardsonian Romanesque architectural style. It is now owned by Rhett A McSweeney and is the offices of McSweeney/Langevin. Gale Mansion The Gale Mansion from the southwest The Gale Mansion, at 2115 Stevens Avenue South, was built in 1912 to designs in the Renaissance Revival style by Ernest Kennedy of Minneapolis. In 1855, the tract had been purchased for $50. Water company records indicate that several smaller houses once occupied the Stevens Avenue site.Gale Mansion history The owner, Edward Chanary Gale, was the son of Minneapolis pioneer real estate broker Samuel Gale. His wife, Sara Bell Pillsbury, was a daughter of Governor John S. Pillsbury. The house, now owned by the American Association of University Women, is faced in Bedford limestone. Many modern features were part of the design: a central vacuum- cleaning unit, a kitchen at ground floor level, rather than secreted in the basement, an intercom system. The house was centrally heated with a coal furnace; the decorative fireplaces were infrequently used. In the garden stands a fountain with the sculpture Boy with a Duck by Frederick MacMonnies. . Alfred F. Pillsbury House The Alfred F. Pillsbury House from the southeast The Alfred F. Pillsbury house, at 116 22nd Street East, was designed by prominent local architect Ernest Kennedy and built in a Tudor Revival style and faced with locally quarried limestone with a dense, craggy look. Alfred F. Pillsbury, the only son of John S. Pillsbury, was an art collector who collected a number of Chinese jades now on display at the Minneapolis Institute of Art. Charles S. Pillsbury House The Charles S. Pillsbury House from the south The Charles S. Pillsbury House, at 100 22nd Street East, is also in the Tudor Revival style. The house features a polygonal conservatory, bas-relief carvings, and two statues of lions guarding the entrance gate. Charles S. Pillsbury was the son of Charles Alfred Pillsbury, the founder of the Pillsbury Company. The house is now owned by an organization that provides services for the blind. John Crosby House The John Crosby House from the northeast The John Crosby House, at 2104 Stevens Avenue South, was built in 1904 for John Crosby, cofounder of the Washburn- Crosby Company, which later became General Mills. The house was designed in Colonial Revival style by William Channing Whitney. Caroline Crosby House The Caroline Crosby House from the west The Caroline Crosby House, at 2105 First Avenue South, was built by the daughter of John Crosby. The house is a brick Georgian Revival structure. The house now serves as headquarters for the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. Luther Farrington House The Luther Farrington House from the east The Luther Farrington House, at 2100 Stevens Avenue South, is also in the Georgian Revival style. The building is currently known as the Hartwell Center for Mentoring, named after John and Lucy Hartwell (also related to the Crosby family) who purchased the building and donated it to the Minneapolis Jaycees, which in turn sold it to Bolder Options, a locally based youth mentoring program.  George H. and Leonora Christian House / Hennepin History Museum  The George H. and Leonora Christian House The Hennepin History Museum was formerly the George H. and Leonora Christian House. It was designed by local architects Hewitt and Brown using Renaissance Revival elements such as a balustraded roof. George Christian was the manager of the Washburn-Crosby milling company in the 1860s and helped to perfect the \\"new process\\" of milling hard spring wheat to make a pure white flour. This process made Minneapolis flour highly competitive with flour from other mills. The building now houses the Hennepin History Museum. The building is not listed on the National Register, but is part of the local historic district. Before the project was finished Christian, his wife, and his son died, leaving Carolyn (also spelled Caroline) McKnight Christian, the younger Christian's widow, seven servants, and three foster children as the only occupants for the next forty years.

He was the chairman of the MƒÅori Students Association, and then was a founder of NgƒÅ Tamatoa. He was strongly involved in supporting Tino Rangatiratanga, the revival of the MƒÅori language, and the MƒÅori protest movement in general. He was the son of the All Black Everard Jackson, and grandson of New Zealand national rugby league team representative Frederick Stanley Jackson. He played representative rugby union for Wellington in 1959 and 1960, and was a New Zealand MƒÅori trialist. He was active from 1968 against apartheid, particularly New Zealand tours of South Africa. In the 1970s Jackson was one of the founding members of NgƒÅ Tamatoa, a Maori activist group. During this period he and NgƒÅ Tamatoa were influenced by the works of the American Black Panther Party members such as Eldridge Cleaver and Stokely Carmichael.

This circumstance can make it imperative for the defense to get the lead runner out because the offense can score without a hit if there is a man at third base with fewer than two outs. The play's name derives from the wheel-like rotation of the infielders. The wheel play is a unique bunt defense in that the play is designed to get the lead runner out at third. Most bunt defense strategies give the priority to making sure the team gets one out at first. The play begins with the shortstop breaking to cover third base. As the pitch is thrown, the third and first basemen rush toward home plate to be able to field the bunted ball as quickly as possible while the second basemen runs to cover first base. Additionally, the pitcher moves to back up the fielder on the side his pitching momentum carries him towards. Ideally for the defense, if the ball is bunted, it goes directly to one of the charging fielders only a few feet past home plate. If it is bunted right at a fielder, the play is to throw to the shortstop (covering third base) for the tag or force out if permitted by the existence of a trail runner. The offense may try to defeat the wheel play in one of several ways. If the offense suspects the defense will put on the wheel play, and sees the shortstop break for third too early or too late, it may send the runner(s) on a straight steal. If the shortstop leaves early, the runner on second will take a \\"walking lead\\" off the second base bag, and can be most or all of the way to third when the catcher takes the pitch. If the shortstop leaves too late, the man on second runs with the expectation that the shortstop cannot acquire position to take the throw on the steal. The key for the defense is for the pitcher to use the inside pickoff move once, or a few times, to keep the runner at 2nd from straying toward third too early and perhaps picking him off. Either way, the effort by the catcher to throw to a moving target, the shortstop opens the possibility of an error, permitting additional advancement on the bases. Additionally, a man on first takes second without contest, as it will be uncovered. But if the shortstop has the play timed right, the runner from second will be caught stealing, generally with ease. Alternately, the offense can send the runners towards the next base while instructing the hitter to use a \\"butcher boy\\" swing‚Äîshow a bunting stance as the pitcher begins his delivery, but twist back and swing in full as the pitch arrives. The objective is to put a batted ball into the vacated middle of the field and produce a multiple base advance by the runners. However, because the hitter is moving so much, and since hitters called upon to bunt are often among the weakest hitters on the team, it is unusual for the \\"butcher boy\\" swing to yield the requisite batted ball, and more common for it to result in a swinging or fouled strike. That event subsequently limits a hitter's options as the at-bat proceeds, especially if he now has two strikes, which often nullifies a bunting strategy (A ball bunted foul with 2 strikes, results in a called 3rd strike). Defenses generally do not rely on the wheel play in bunt situations where the bunter is deemed a good enough hitter to be able to execute the \\"butcher boy\\" swing. Instead, the third baseman and shortstop will hold their positions, and the defense will rely on the pitcher to field the ball, and concede an advance to third if the bunt is well executed. One of the earliest recorded instances of the wheel play being used in the major leagues was when it was executed by the Pittsburgh Pirates against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 14, 1960, resulting, as reported by The Pittsburgh Press, in \\"an electrifying double play [...] that had the 36,775 fans screaming.\\"Biederman, Les. \\"Pirates Soar to 'Biggest' Lead\\". The Pittsburgh Press. August 15, 1960. Retrieved 22 February 2015. Several Pirate players and coaches said they had never seen the play before, but the Pirate players who executed the play attributed the original idea to former Cubs manager Charlie Grimm, who they thought used it in 1950.

There are two main categories of horse harness: (1) the \\"breaststrap\\" or \\"breastcollar\\" design, and (2) the collar and hames design. For light work, such as horse show competition where light carts are used, a harness needs only a breastcollar. It can only be used for lighter hauling, since it places the weight of the load on the sternum of the horse and the nearby windpipe. This is not the heaviest skeletal area; also heavy loads can constrict the windpipe and reduce a horse's air supply. By contrast, the collar and harness places the weight of the load onto the horse's shoulders, and without any restriction on the air supply. For heavy hauling, the harness must include a horse collar to allow the animal to use its full weight and strength. Harness components designed for other animals (such as the yoke used with oxen) are not suitable for horses and will not allow the horse to work efficiently. Putting harness on a horse is called harnessing or harnessing up. Attaching the harness to the load is called putting to (British Isles) or hitching (North America). The order of putting on harness components varies by discipline, but when a horse collar is used, it is usually put on first. History Throughout the ancient world, the 'throat-and-girth' harness was used for harnessing horses that pulled carts; this greatly limited a horse's ability to exert itself as it was constantly choked at the neck.Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 305. A painting on a lacquerware box from the State of Chu, dated to the 4th century BC, shows the first known use of a yoke placed across a horses's chest, with traces connecting to the chariot shaft.Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 310. The hard yoke across the horse's chest was gradually replaced by a breast strap, which was often depicted in carved reliefs and stamped bricks of tombs from the Han Dynasty (202 BC ‚Äì 220 AD).Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 308‚Äì312. Eventually, the horse collar was invented in China, at least by the 5th century.Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 319‚Äì323.Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 22‚Äì23. Parts Complete breastcollar harness and bridle, laid out Parts of the harness include:Harness parts *A collar to allow the horse to push against the harness with its shoulders and chest. Two main alternative arrangements (with some intermediate types): **A horse collar (or full collar). A padded loop fitting closely around the horse's neck, pointed at the top to fit the crest of the neck. Used for heavier pulling, especially when used without a swingletree or whippletree. **A breastcollar. A padded strap running around the chest from side to side. Used for light work, or for somewhat heavier work it is used together with a swingletree evenly on each step without rubbing. *Hames (if a full collar is used). Two metal or wooden strips which take the full force of the pull, padded by the collar. *Breeching . A strap around the horse's haunches allowing it to set back and slow a vehicle, usually hooked to the shafts or pole of the vehicle (also known as thill). Used for a single horse, a pair, or in a larger team, only for the wheelers (the animal or pair closest to the vehicle). The leaders in a team do not have breeching, as they are in front of the shafts or pole and so cannot slow the vehicle. Breeching may also be omitted in fine harness, or when the cart is very light or has efficient brakes on the wheels. *Traces. The straps or chains which take the pull from the breastcollar or hames to the load. *Harness saddle or \\"pad\\". A small supportive piece of the harness that lies on the horse's back, not the same as a riding saddle. *Girth. A strap that goes firmly around the girth of the horse to attach the harness saddle. * Belly-band. A strap that goes more loosely under the belly of the horse, outside the girth. Prevents the shafts rising up, especially on a two-wheeled vehicle (where weight on the rear of the cart may tip the front up). * Back band. A strap going through the harness saddle to join the belly band either side. Takes the weight of the shafts or pole. In cart harness it is replaced by a chain running in a groove in the harness saddle, hooked to the shafts either side. ** Sliding back band. In a two-wheeled vehicle, the shafts are fixed to the vehicle to hold it level. On a side-slope, one shaft will be higher than the other, and in this case the back band is normally allowed to slide sideways through the harness saddle, so the horse can walk upright without strain on the harness. ** Fixed back-band. In a four-wheeled vehicle, the shafts or pole must be allowed to hinge up and down, to allow the horse and vehicle to pass over hillocks and dips. Often the shafts are independently hinged, and on a side-slope these will each hinge to follow the horse, and a sliding back band is not needed. However, if a sliding back band was used with independent shafts it might allow one shaft to ride up higher than the other, and so for such shafts the back-band is normally fixed to the harness saddle. On other four-wheeled vehicles, the two shafts hinge together, and a sliding back band is needed as for two-wheeled vehicles. * Surcingle. A term used within certain light fine harness designs to describe the combination of a light girth and harness saddle. *False martingale. A strap passing between the front legs, from the centre of the collar to the belly band, to hold the collar in position. Called \\"false\\", because unlike a true martingale it does not attach to the bridle or have any influence on the horse's action. *Crupper. A soft padded loop under the base of the tail, to keep the harness from slipping forward. *Back strap. A strap attached by looping through the crupper D at the rear of the saddle / pad or surcingle to attach the crupper *Shaft tugs, or just tugs. Loops attached to the back band to hold up the shafts of a vehicle in van or fine harness (not needed in cart harness, which attaches to hooks on the shafts). Two types: **For two-wheeled vehicles the tugs are stiff leather loops, fitting fairly loosely around the shafts (which are rigidly attached to the vehicle), to allow flexibility as the animal and the vehicle move against each other. **For four-wheeled vehicles with independently hinged shafts, the tugs (Tilbury tugs) are leather straps buckled tightly around the shafts so they move with the animal. *Terrets. Metal loops on the saddle and collar to support the reins. The bridles of the rear animals of a large team may also have terrets to take the lines of the animals to the front of them. *Reins or Lines. Long leather straps (occasionally ropes) running from the bit to the driver's hands, used to guide the horses. In teams of several animals these may be joined together so the driver need hold only one pair. Harness bridle *Bridle: When working in harness, most horses wear a specialised bridle that includes features not seen in bridles used for riding. These usually include blinders, also called blinkers or winkers, behind and to the side of the horse's eyes, to prevent it from being distracted by the cart and other activity behind it. Harness racing horses sometimes have a shadow roll on the noseband of the bridle for the same purpose. *Bits for harness (often a Liverpool bit, but the Wilson snaffle is also popular) may be similar to those used for riding, particularly in mouthpiece, usually operating with a curb bit and adjustable leverage to help balance the effect of the reins on different horses in a team. The bridles of the rearward horses in a team (the wheelers in a four-horse team, and both wheelers and centre horses in a six-horse team) often have rings at each end of the browband, through which the lines of the forward horses pass. *Some horses pulling lighter vehicles, particularly at horse shows and other public exhibitions, may have an overcheck to assist them in holding a desired head position, and for safety reasons (to avoid the horse's head and neck going under the shaft in a stumble). In some cases a specially designed running martingale may also be added. A looser overcheck may also be used in a working harness to prevent the horse grazing. The overcheck hooks to a pedestal on the harness saddle. *Horse brasses. Brass plaques mounted on leather straps, used for decoration, especially on working harness. Made in a very wide range of designs. Types Show harness Show harnesses for light cart driving have a breastcollar instead of a horse collar and are made with strong but refined-looking leather throughout, usually black and highly polished. In draft horse showing and combined driving, horse collars are seen, but harness leather is still highly polished and well-finished. Carriage or van harness A combined driving team in carriage harness Lighter weight but strong harness similar to show harness, used for pulling passenger vehicles such as buggies or carts, or other lighter loads. The traces attach either to the shafts of the vehicle or to the vehicle itself, and the harness may have either a horse collar or a breastcollar. Racing harness Racing harness The racing harness, like the show harness, is a breastcollar harness. Horses are hitched to a very lightweight two-wheeled cart, called a sulky. Most race harnesses incorporate a running martingale and an overcheck. Sometimes harness racing horses are raced with an \\"open\\" bridle, one that does not have blinkers. Specialized equipment, called pacing hobbles, are added to the harness of race horses who pace in order to help them maintain their gait.Harness racing equipment Cart or wagon harness Harness for pulling heavier vehicles always has a horse collar. The traces are often made of chain and attach to loops on the shafts of the vehicle. A chain attached to the shafts may be passed over the saddle to carry their weight.Miller W C, Practical Animal Husbandry, Oliver and Boyd 1959 ed, p 313 Reins are of rope or leather, depending on region of the world. Plow harness Plow Harness Similar to cart harness but without breeching, used for dragged loads such as plows, harrows, canal boats or logs. This style is also used on the leaders in a team of animals pulling a vehicle. The traces attach to a whippletree behind the horse and this then pulls the load (or in larger teams may attach to further whippletrees). There are two main plow harness types: the New England D-Ring and the Western harness. The New England D-Ring makes use of a metal D shaped ring that allows for a ninety degree angle to be maintained at the junction of the front trace and the hames regardless of the height of the implement being pulled. The Western harness does not provide this flexibility but has other useful characteristics such as a strap that runs from the britchen to the collar which stops the pull from riding up and hitting the horses in the face when descending a steep incline.

It is based on the 1993 novel by John Grisham. The film was filmed in Memphis, TN and released in the United States on July 20, 1994.  Plot  Eleven-year-old Mark Sway and his little brother, Ricky, are smoking cigarettes in the woods near their home when they encounter mob lawyer W. Jerome Clifford. Clifford tells Mark that he is about to kill himself to avoid being murdered by Barry \\"The Blade\\" Muldano, the nephew of notorious mob kingpin Johnny Sulari. Ricky becomes catatonic after witnessing the suicide and is hospitalized at Saint Peter Charity Hospital. Authorities ‚Äì and the mob ‚Äì realize that Clifford may have told Mark where a Louisiana senator, murdered by Muldano, is buried. Mark meets Regina \\"Reggie\\" Love, a lawyer and recovering alcoholic, who agrees to represent him. They quickly run afoul of \\"Reverend\\" Roy Foltrigg, a celebrated and vain US Attorney who is using the case as a springboard for his political ambitions. In the meantime, it is revealed that Sulari never authorized Muldano to kill the senator and wants Muldano to uncover how much the boys know. Muldano is also ordered to move the body, but currently he is unable to because it is buried in Clifford's boathouse, and police are still on the property investigating his suicide. Foltrigg continues to use legal means to get Mark to reveal where the body is hidden, while Sulari orders Muldano to kill the children and Reggie. He also orders the body to be moved once the investigation at Clifford's home is concluded. Mark is threatened in a hospital elevator by Mafia member Paul Gronke, and is unable to talk to Foltrigg. Mark and Reggie go to New Orleans to confirm that the body is on Clifford's property. Reggie intends to use this information to broker a deal with Foltrigg to get Ricky specialized medical care and place the family in the witness protection program. Reggie and Mark arrive at Clifford's house the same night as Muldano and his accomplices. They are digging up the body, but a melee follows when Mark and Reggie are discovered. Muldano and the others flee after Reggie trips the neighbors' alarm. Foltrigg agrees to Reggie's demands in exchange for information about the body's location. Before the Sway family leaves to restart their lives under new identities, Mark and Reggie share a heartfelt goodbye. While Muldano gets angry at his fellow mob members for messing up, Sulari becomes fed up with Muldano and plans to deal with him. With the body recovered, Foltrigg is a lock-in for the media headlines he craves, and mentions that he intends to run for governor.

College career The top university basketball programs weren't yet recruiting African-American players, but Wesley was recruited by programs in the Midwest. Wesley was quoted, \\"It's not that we weren‚Äôt capable, or good enough academically. We just weren‚Äôt recruited. There was a segregated system, and it was tough. Fortunately, I was recruited by several schools out of the midwest and that's where I chose to go.\\"http://www.cavsnews.com/20080331-1074.php The 6'11\\" center chose to attend the University of Kansas and play for its storied program and became a two-time, unanimous selection, All-American. In his first varsity season as a sophomore in 1963‚Äì64, Wesley averaged 10.5 points per game (ppg) and 5.9 rebounds per game (rpg). In his junior year, he became a dominant center, with a career-best 23.5 ppg and 8.8 rpg for the 17-8 Jayhawks.http://sidearm.sites.s3.amazonaws.com/kuathletics.com/documents/2013/6/21/mbballtimestats.pdf In his senior season of 1965‚Äì66, Wesley averaged 20.7 ppg and a career-best 9.3 rpg as the Jayhawks won the Big 8 championship and were 23-4 overall. In the postseason, Wesley unwittingly found himself in a position that one day inspired the movie 'Glory Road. In the 1966 Midwest Regional Finals in Lubbock, Texas, the #4-ranked Jayhawks were in a tight game with #2-ranked Texas Western, now the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP).

California was annexed by the United States and was admitted to the Union as the thirty-first state on September 9, 1850. Biography Moses Rodgers, who was born into slavery in Missouri, came to California in 1849. He became prominent during the Gold Rush as a successful mining engineer, making a lucrative career excavating gold in mines he owned in Hornitos in Mariposa County. He was regarded as intelligent, and his professional opinion was important. He quickly became known as an expert in the state, and investors went to him for advice regarding mining claims. He became so expert at it that in post-Civil War he was appointed superintendent of several mines (Mount Gaines Mine & Washington Mine). The stockholders of these mines seem to have been both blacks and whites. Rodgers's best known mine, for which he was a stock-holding superintendent, was the Washington Mine, which he established in 1869. It was a successful operation, which also employed Chinese workers. There were years when this mine took out over half a million dollars in gold. The Washington Mine was, in the mid-1880s, one of the area's largest, employing over 30 men.Washington Mine Five main shafts and over 10,000 feet of underground workings brought the gold/silver ore to the surface where it was handsorted and then sent by wagon to the mine's concentration mill.

The battle led to an uprising in Kiev that briefly deposed Grand Prince Iziaslav. That incident supposedly shows the power of the Kiev veche and how common people gathering influenced princely politics in Kievan Rus' (particularly in Kiev as well as Novgorod the Great.) The Cumans/Polovtsy/Kipchaks were first mentioned in the Primary Chronicle as Polovtsy sometime around 1055, when Prince Vsevolod drew up a peace treaty with them. In spite of the treaty, in 1061, Kipchaks supposedly breached the earthworks and palisades constructed by Princes Vladimir (d. 1015) and Yaroslav (d. 1054) and defeated an army led by Prince Vsevolod that had marched out to intercept them. Following the unsuccessful Battle on the Alta River near the city of Pereiaslavl, Iziaslav and Vsevolod fled back to Kiev and their unwillingness to arm the general populace to march out and fight the raiders led to an uprising in the city. A veche (public assembly) was convened on unknown initiative in the marketplace and the people there demanded arms to fight the Kipchaks. When these were not forthcoming, they ransacked the house of voivode Konstantin.Lavrent'evskaia Letopis' (Povest Vremennikh Let), in Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisei, Vol. 1, cols. 170-1; Boris D.

Sdobnikov (Moscow, Foreign Language Publishing House. 1959), 198-199. The Kievans freed Prince Vseslav of Polotsk, who had been imprisoned earlier by Iziaslav, Vsevolod, and Sviatoslav, and placed him on the Kievan throne in hopes that he could stop Kipchaks. Iziaslav, for his part, fled to his father-in-law, Boleslaw II of Poland, who provided him a military support with which Iziaslav returned to Kiev the following May (1069) and took back the throne. In Iziaslav's absence, Prince Sviatoslav managed to defeat a much larger Cuman army on November 1, 1068 and stem the tide of Cuman raids. A small skirmish in 1071 was the only disturbance by the Cumans for the next two decades. Thus, while the Battle of Alta River was a disgrace for Kievan Rus', Sviatoslav's victory the following year relieved the Cumans' threat to Kiev and Chernigov for a considerable period.

She became the first artist to depict New Zealand's flora in depth, the first official artist of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, and the second woman to become an associate of the Linnaean Society. Biography Corpse flower, Amorphophallus titanum by Matilda Smith. Plate from Curtis's Botanical Magazine, 1891. Smith drew this plant during its first blooming at Kew Gardens in 1889. Matilda Smith was born in Bombay, India, on 30 July 1854, but her family emigrated to England when she was a small child. Her interests in botany and botanical art were fostered by her second cousin Joseph Dalton Hooker, whose daughter Harriet would also go on to become a botanical illustrator. Hooker was then the director of Kew Gardens and a talented draughtsman in his own right, and he brought Smith into the Gardens to train as an illustrator. Smith especially admired the work of Walter Hood Fitch, who was then the lead artist for Curtis's Botanical Magazine. Despite her limited artistic training, Hooker encouraged her to show the magazine her own work, and in 1878 it first published one of her drawings. A dispute over pay between Fitch and Hooker‚Äîfor whom Fitch had been preparing illustrations for several books‚Äîled to Fitch's leaving the long-running magazine in 1877. One consequence was that Smith rapidly became a key illustrator at the magazine, at first working alongside Harriet Anne Thiselton-Dyer. In the period 1879‚Äì1881, each issue included some 20 of her drawings, and by 1887 she was almost the sole illustrator for the magazine. In 1898, she was appointed the magazine's sole official artist. Over the forty- odd years between 1878 and 1923, Smith drew more than 2,300 plates for the magazine‚Äîonly 600 fewer than Fitch, although she received much less recognition for this achievement in her own lifetime. As late as the mid 20th century, art teacher Wilfrid Blunt, in his book The Art of Botanical Illustration, dismissed her as an artist of inferior skills, praising her faintly for her charm, her work ethic, and her usefulness in creating a record of otherwise unpictured plants. In this he follows a pattern first noticeable in the Victorian era of progressively devaluing botany and botanical art as women entered the field professionally. Other authors, however, both now and in her own day, have admired the clarity and precision of her drawing, and her four decades of employment at the center of the British botanical world testifies to a continuing value for her skills. In the course of Smith's long association with Kew Gardens, she created 1,500 plates for volumes of Icones Plantarum, a monumental survey of Kew's plants then being edited by Hooker. Beginning with Plate 1354, she was the sole artist for this series, with funds being provided to keep her in this role for as long as she chose to do it. She also made reproductions of plates missing from incomplete volumes in Kew's library, and she became the first botanical artist to extensively depict the flora of New Zealand. She was especially admired for her ability to create credible illustrations from dried, flattened, and sometimes imperfect specimens. Her exceptional contributions to Kew Gardens led to her being designated the first official botanical artist of Kew Gardens in 1898. In 1921, the year she retired from Kew, she was named an associate of the Linnean Society‚Äîonly the second woman to have achieved this honor. She was also awarded the Silver Veitch Memorial Medal of the Royal Horticultural Society for her botanical draughtsmanship generally and for her contributions to Curtis's Botanical Magazine in particular. The plant genera Smithiantha (in the family Gesneriaceae) and Smithiella (viz. Smithiella myriantha, a synonym of Pilea myriantha) were named in her honor. Smith died in 1926 and is buried in Richmond Cemetery.  Publications illustrated by Smith  * Cheeseman, T. F. (1914) Illustrations of the New Zealand flora. Wellington, John Mackay.

History The church building was originally built and housed a Lutheran congregation under the name of the Peace Lutheran Church.Lutheran Church of Peace - Lutheran Churches of Chicago - ELCA Archives The building was put up for auction as Peace Lutheran consolidated its parish with a number of other Lutheran congregations on Chicago's Northwest Side. The congregation of St. John of Rila, Wonderworker which had formed in February 1996 was looking for a church of its own as it had been celebrating services in the Holy Cross Chapel at St. Andrew Greek Orthodox Church in Chicago. After winning the highly competitive auction, the first services at the new beautiful church were celebrated on February 7, 1999.OCA - Parish Listings Today, St. John of Rila is an extremely important center for Bulgarians in Chicago because of the specificity of national churches in America to function not only as a place of worship, but also as an important social center devoted to maintaining the language, culture and tradition of the Bulgarian diaspora through Sunday schools and social gatherings.Pogorzelski, Daniel and Maloof, John: Portage Park, Arcadia Press, 2008, p. 69 In October 2003, Princess Marie Louise of Bulgaria toured the church.

In 2008, the Church underwent a renovation. The sanctuary, which was previously located at the west end of the church, was moved to the east end to fulfill the requirement for Bulgarian Orthodox Churches.

Liu was famous for being one of the most corrupt officials in Chinese history and the emperor in all but name for some time. He was the leader of the \\"Eight Tigers\\", a powerful group of eunuchs who controlled the imperial court. Liu Chin is from the area of Xingping, a county in Shaanxi province, approximately 30 miles west of Xi'an prefecture. A son of Tan () lineage, when he was made a eunuch under the aegis of a eunuch official named Liu, he appropriated that surname. Plotting against the emperor The Zhengde Emperor's dissolute lifestyle placed a heavy burden on the people of the empire. He would refuse to receive all his ministers and ignored all their petitions whilst sanctioning the growth of the eunuch community in the imperial palace. Liu made some reforms such as encouraging widows to remarry, a move which went against the Neo-Confucianism views of the time.(In Chinese) Remarriage of widows to alleviate the burden on the peasantry : a rarely known eunuch reform in ancient China (ÂØ°Â¶áÂÜçÂ´ÅÂÜúÊ∞ëÂáèË¥üÔºö‰∏≠ÂõΩÂè§‰ª£È≤ú‰∏∫‰∫∫Áü•ÁöÑÂ§™ÁõëÂèòÊ≥ï) Many officials and other eunuchs opposed Liu ‚Äì the Prince of Anhua rebellion of Zhu Zhifan was a failed attempt to assassinate Liu and seize power.

The Zhengde Emperor did not believe this report at first but took it seriously enough to consider expelling Liu to Fengyang County in Anhui Province. Zhang's discovery of many weapons in Liu's houses sealed his fate. Death The emperor ordered Liu executed in Beijing by death by a thousand cuts over a period of three days, a process that resulted in Liu being cut 3,357 times. According to witnesses, angry onlookers bought a piece of his flesh for one qian (the smallest available currency at the time) and consumed it accompanied with rice wine.

Early life Meredith was born at Poyston Lodge, Pembroke, Wales, the youngest son of George Meredith and his wife, Sarah Westall Hicks. He was descended in a direct line from the last kings of Wales. His father saw service in the royal marines during the Napoleonic wars, and later decided to emigrate to Van Diemen's Land (later called Tasmania). He arrived at Hobart with his father, wife and family on 18 March 1821 and became one of the best known of the early pioneers. Charles assisted his father in farming in Tasmania for some time. In 1834 Meredith went to New South Wales and took up land on the Murrumbidgee River after being denied a grant of land by Lieutenant-Governor George Arthur. He visited England in 1838 and on 18 April 1839 married his cousin, Louisa Anne Twamley. On his return to Australia he spent two years in New South Wales, but it was a depressed period and he made heavy losses. He then went to Tasmania, and in 1843 was appointed a police magistrate at Port Sorell in the north-west. Political career Meredith became a member of the original Tasmanian Legislative Council and was elected for Glamorgan in the first house of assembly in 1856. He was colonial treasurer in the Thomas Gregson ministry for two months in 1857, and held the same position in the James Whyte ministry from January 1863 to November 1866. He was opposition leader 1862‚Äì63 and November 1866‚Äì72. He held the lands and works portfolios in the Frederick Innes cabinet from November 1872 to August 1873, and was again colonial treasurer in the Thomas Reibey ministry from July 1876 to August 1877. In total, he was in parliament almost 24 years and was a member of the executive council for 17 years. Late life and legacy Meredith resigned his seat on account of ill-health in 1879, and died at Launceston, Tasmania, on 2 March 1880. His wife and children survived him. Meredith was one of the few Tasmanians whose name has been publicly commemorated; a mountain range in north-east Tasmania is named for him and a fountain in his memory was erected in the Queen's domain, Hobart, in 1885.

Nagl (born 1966) is a retired Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army. He is former president of the Center for a New American Security and current headmaster of The Haverford School. Nagl is an expert in counterinsurgency and has published two books on military strategy. Education and military career Nagl was raised in Omaha, Nebraska, where he graduated from Creighton Preparatory School in 1984. He then attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, where he studied international relations and graduated near the top of his class in 1988. As a newly commissioned second lieutenant, he was chosen as a Rhodes Scholar and studied international relations at St John's College, Oxford, earning his MPhil in 1990. Entering the Armor Branch of the US Army, Nagl led a tank platoon in the 1st Cavalry Division during the Gulf War. After returning from the Middle East, he commanded A Troop of the 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment in the 1st Armored Division in B√ºdingen, Germany. Nagl later returned to Oxford to earn his DPhil at St Antony's College in 1997. At Oxford, his focus was on counterinsurgency. Nagl's doctoral dissertation was a comparative study of the British and American militaries as they dealt with insurgencies in Malaya and Vietnam, respectively. While at Oxford, he wrote several book reviews in a variety of military journals, focusing initially on the history of armored warfare, and later on the Vietnam War and guerilla warfare. In 1997, Nagl was appointed as a social sciences professor at West Point. While teaching at West Point, he was affiliated with the Strategic Studies Institute at the United States Army War College for which he co-authored a book on military professionalism in 1999. He later received the George C. Marshall Award for being the top graduate of the US Army Command and General Staff College in 2001. A revised version of his dissertation was published in 2002 as Learning to Eat Soup with a Knife, titled after an observation made by T. E. Lawrence about the challenges of fighting guerilla forces. He served as Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans for the 24th Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kansas. Nagl deployed to Iraq in 2003 as the operations officer of the 1st Battalion, 34th Armor Regiment, 1st Infantry Division stationed near Khaldiya. While in Iraq, he was profiled in the New York Times Magazine in January 2004. After returning from Iraq, Nagl served as military assistant to Paul Wolfowitz, then Deputy Secretary of Defense, and Wolfowitz's successor, Gordon England, until 2006. While he was military assistant to Wolfowitz and England, Nagl co-authored the new United States Army and Marine Corps Counterinsurgency field manual as part of a team overseen by Generals David Petraeus, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and James N. Mattis, the former commander of United States Central Command. In 2006, Nagl was given command of the 1st Battalion, 34th Armor Regiment to help train Embedded Training Teams, small groups of American soldiers tasked to develop the Afghan National Army and Iraqi security forces. Post-military career Nagl retired from the Army and in 2008 became a fellow at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) in Washington D.C.. Many commentators, including CNAS fellow Andrew Exum and retired Marine Colonel Thomas X. Hammes, lamented his retirement because they saw it as a significant loss for the Army. There was some speculation that Nagl retired because he had been passed over for promotion or otherwise sidelined by the military, as happened to H.R. McMaster, because of his advocacy of counterinsurgency, which had fallen out of favour with senior commanders by 2008. However, Exum confirmed on his Abu Muqawama blog that Nagl was not eligible for promotion to Colonel in 2008 and argued that Nagl could have greater influence on defense policy outside the military, particularly if he were given an opportunity to serve in the Department of Defense by a future administration. Left to right, Peter Bergen, John Nagl and Daniel R. Green, discussing Nagl's new book, Knife Fights: A Memoir of Modern War in Theory and Practice, at the New America Foundation, 27 October 2014 After CNAS's founders, Kurt M. Campbell and Mich√®le Flournoy, left CNAS to serve in the Obama administration, Nagl was named CNAS's president in February 2009 and served until January 2012. Nagl remains a non-resident senior fellow of CNAS. While at CNAS, he co-authored several reports on a wide range of issues, including counterinsurgency, Islamist extremism and the future of the American military. While he was still in the Army, Nagl wrote a report in 2007 for CNAS which advocates for the creation of a permanent Army advisory corps, a proposal that he argued for in an op-ed in the New York Times. His proposal for an advisory corps was favorably cited by American historian Max Boot in a New York Times op-ed about ways to modernize the State Department and the American military. In January 2011, he and CNAS chief executive officer Nathaniel Fick wrote an op-ed in the New York Times supporting the Obama administration's troop surge and reporting on its early successes. In April 2011, he wrote favorably about President Obama decision to name Leon Panetta, then director of the CIA, as Secretary of Defense, and General David Petraeus, then commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, with whom Nagl had worked on the new Army/Marine Corps counterinsurgency manual, as director of the CIA, noting the increasingly intertwined nature of the relationship between the intelligence and defense establishments in the United States. Nagl served on the Defense Policy Board, which advises the Secretary of Defense, Deputy Secretary of Defense and Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. He is also a life member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He taught in the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University in 2009 and is a visiting professor in the war studies department at King's College London. In January 2012, he was named the inaugural Minerva Chair at the US Naval Academy, where he joined the history department at the Naval Academy and conducted research on the relationship between culture and warfare. He taught a course on the history of counterinsurgency to midshipmen at the Naval Academy. Dr. Nagl is an Advisory Board Member of Spirit of America, a 501(c)(3) organization that supports the safety and success of Americans serving abroad and the local people and partners they seek to help.https://spiritofamerica.org/staff/dr-john-nagl Already notable in military circles, his public profile was further raised with an interview on Comedy Central's The Daily Show on August 2007. He was also interviewed with fellow counterinsurgency experts Lewis Sorley and Conrad Crane on the Charlie Rose show about the similarities between counterinsurgency during the Iraq and Vietnam Wars in March 2006. Nagl was appointed as headmaster of The Haverford School in august of 2012. In October of 2016, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that according to court documents, Nagl had found marijuana in his son's backpack and, as punishment, had confiscated it along with the boy's cellphone. Two days later, he discovered the items missing from where he had hidden them, and found his son using the phone in a bathroom of the family home. When he attempted to take back the phone, the son refused to hand it over; as Nagl took the phone from his son's hands, the boy \\"re-engaged in a physical altercation\\" so Nagl \\"put his son in a choke hold to end the altercation quickly.\\" Nagl's attorney, Robert Keller, told the Inquirer that \\"the facts showed that the parent took appropriate steps to discipline a child who was acting inappropriately\\" and that Nagl was \\"hoping to return [as headmaster] as quickly as possible.\\" He was re-instated later that week, and has since continued his work as headmaster. On October 20, 2016, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, District Attorney John Whelan wrote in a one-paragraph statement that there was \\"insufficient evidence\\" to proceed with prosecution and that a charge against Nagl had being dropped. In 2020, Nagl encouraged military action if Donald Trump refuses to leave office at the expiration of his constitutional term https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2020/08/all-enemies- foreign-and-domestic-open-letter-gen-milley/167625/ Personal life Nagl is currently the 9th Headmaster of The Haverford School.

It is on the western shores of Pittwater in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, beside Currawong Beach, and near Coasters Retreat and Palm Beach. The population was 36 at the ; the median age was 66, with an average of 0.3 children per family and an average of 2 people per household. The population was 301 at the , 2016 census data are available from mid-2017 and 103 in 2006. Currently there are 55 permanent residents in 27 properties, with many additional residents occupying properties throughout school holidays and weekends. Great Mackerel Beach is frequently referred to as Mackerel Beach or [Great] Beach, although the spelling \\"Mackerel\\" is becoming standard. Nearby Currawong Beach is sometimes called Little Mackerel Beach. Mackerel is surrounded on three sides by the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, with a beach leading to the water Pittwater. The suburb of Currawong Beach adjoins to the south. T and offers residents a year round holiday lifestyle, isolated from the hustle and bustle of the city, yet only a 10-minute boat ride back to \\"the mainland\\". The beach is soft golden sand and is ideal for swimming as the southern end becomes deep quite quickly and the northern end has a lovely large sandbank which gradually protrudes into the water Great Mackerel Beach Reserve. Pittwater Council. Pittwater.nsw.gov.au. Retrieved on 2012-02-01. Geography The Mackerel valley was formed by a creek that flows from within the National Park, passing through sub-tropical rain forest and mangroves to exit at the north end of the beach where a sand delta has been formed. The sand on the beach is the result of sandstone flowing down the Hawkesbury River Hawkesbury River and is soft and golden. History Mackerel was originally a dairy farm settled in 1823 by a John Clark who sold it on to Martin Burke who is known as \\"The Father of Pittwater\\". Subdivision of Mackerel took place in 1920 and since then over 100 houses have been built. Originally most of the houses were fibro shacks built as fishermen‚Äôs cottages and weekenders. However much development has occurred since and now Mackerel has a large variety of homes ranging from some of the original shacks to waterfront mansions. Housing At the 2016 census there were 105 dwellings. of which none were apartments, with an average of 2.2 people per occupied dwelling. There are no shops. Mackerel Beach is largely considered a \\"holiday home haven\\", but it is increasingly seen as a beachside suburb, although access to central Sydney CBD requires a boat (private, ferry, water taxi) followed by a 43km road journey. Median property price fluctuates (statistically, due to the small number of properties), but was around A$550,000 in 2013, significantly higher than the figure for all of NSW. Facilities The Northern Beaches Council says \\"there are no public facilities at Mackerel Beach\\". Electricity and telephone (and hence Internet) connection are available, but there is no water supply and no sewerage - houses have water tanks to collect rainwater for all purposes, and septic tanks. Residents' rubbish is collected twice weekly from containers at the wharf. Transport Great Mackerel Beach has no road access and no roads or vehicles; Google Maps shows no roads into Mackerel Beach. Mackerel Trail, and the trails in Mackerel Beach, are not suitable for motor vehicles. access is by the Palm Beach Ferry, water taxi, or private boat. Access to Sydney is normally by a short boat (private or ferry) trip to Palm Beach, then a 43km journey by car or bus. Cars may be left parked near the ferry terminal at Palm Beach. Public facilities There are no public facilities for use by visitors or residents at Great Mackerel Beach, including shops, toilets, barbecue or picnic facilities, or availability of drinking water. There is a public telephone booth near the wharf. Residents' rubbish is collected twice weekly, but there is no public facility. Limited shopping facilities are available via a short boat ride to Palm Beach, and there are more comprehensive shops in the surrounding area. Recreational boating While many residents have boats, there are no moorings available for visiting recreational boating at Great Mackerel Beach, including no Commercial/Club (orange) or Courtesy (pink) moorings. Visiting recreational boats may not tie- up on Great Mackerel Beach Wharf. Private (yellow) moorings may not be used by non-owners and may not be sublet or traded in any way. Community MBA The Mackerel Beach Association is a group of about sixty five property-owners who represent the wider community (especially with Council) on issues such as parking, garbage collection and other issues of import to the community. Pet animals Due to its position bordering the Ku-ring-gai National Park, pet dogs have historically been prohibited from Mackerel Beach, as they are at The Basin and Currawong and other communities positioned along the western foreshores of Pittwater. Mackerel Beach is a Wildlife Protection Area (WPA); a major concern is protection of indigenous wildlife.Pittwater Council: Wildlife Protection Areas and Dogs in Public Areas ‚Äì Mackerel Beach, 17 December 2007 In 2007 some residents asked the MBA for a leash-free area on the south end of the beach. This was rejected by the MBA at the AGM; the residents then raised the request with Pittwater Council, which decided to run a six-month trial of a Public Dog Exercise Area (PDEA) at the north end of the beach. Many residents disagreed with this decision. The area defined by the PDEA prohibited dogs from being walked past the northernmost house, as this region constitutes part of Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, home to many native mammals, reptiles and bird species. In 2008 the National Parks and Wildlife Service submitted a report to Pittwater Council that advised against a PDEA at Mackerel Beach. In December 2009 Pittwater Council resolved to permanently allow dogs off leads at Mackerel Beach between the public wharf north to the last house/National Park boundary, at certain times and with restrictions. The regulations are difficult to enforce in sparsely-populated and isolated Mackerel Beach. A man was injured by an attack from a dog on a leash in 2012. Comments to this article complain that residents and day-trippers allow dogs off-leash without restriction, and that no action is taken. Cats are prohibited in WPAs; Pittwater Council banned pet cats from Mackerel Beach due to their impact on the native wildlife.

Buddhist ethnic groups such as the Lepchas, Bhutias, Sherpas, Yolmos, Gurungs, and Tamangs celebrate new year called Losar in January/February, Maghe Sankranti, Chotrul Duchen, and Tendong Lho Rumfaat. The Kiranti Rai people (Khambus) celebrate their annual Sakela festivals of Ubhauli and Udhauli. Deusi and Bhaileni are songs performed by men and women, respectively, during the festival of Tihar. All these provide a \\"regional distinctness\\" of Darjeeling's local culture from the rest of India. Darjeeling Carnival, initiated by a civil society movement known as The Darjeeling Initiative, was a ten-day carnival held yearly during winter that portrayed the rich musical and cultural heritage of Darjeeling Hills as its central theme. Every year, cultural festivals are held in the town of Darjeeling and its surrounding areas. The people of Darjeeling consume a diverse variety of foods. Each ethnic group has its own distinct traditional food. A popular food in Darjeeling is the momo, a steamed dumpling containing chicken, mutton, pork, beef or vegetables cooked in a doughy wrapping served with a watery vegetable soup and spicy tomato sauce/chutney. Indigenous fermented food products such as gundruk (fermented and dried leafy vegetable), kinema (fermented soybean), and sinki (fermented and dried raddish) are consumed by the people. Wai-Wai is a favorite packaged snack of Darjeeling hills comprising noodles that are eaten either dry or with soup. Hard chhurpi, a type of hard cheese made from cow or yak's milk, is another popular mini- snack that is both nutritious and masticatory. Soft chhurpi, a traditional soft cheese, is consumed along with green vegetables as savoury dishes, used as filling for momos, ground with tomatoes and chillies for chutney or made into a refreshing soup. A type of noodle called thukpa, served with soup and vegetables/meat, is extremely popular in and around the hills of Darjeeling. There are a number of restaurants offering a variety of traditional Indian, Continental and Indian Chinese cuisine to cater to tourists. Tea is the most popular beverage, procured from the famed Darjeeling tea gardens, as well as coffee. Chhang or jaanr is a local alcoholic beverage made from fermented millet, maize or rice.

January 13, 1978, p. 2C; retrieved July 25, 2013. Healy's shows (from the late 1970s onward) took the form of him reading headlines, with the clicking sound effect of a teleprinter in the background. In response to his own headlines or comments, Healy would then play one of his many favorite audio clips, such as \\"That's a bunch of bull,\\" \\"That's just plain poppycock\\" (President Richard Nixon), or \\"Jim Healy, you've got a weak show\\" (by a Howard Cosell mimic), followed by the genuine Cosell drop \\"Who Goofed I've got to know.\\" and \\"Jim Healy that's your lowest shot ever!\\" Among his sound effects was a high pitched smirking laughtrack, sounding like, \\"Mee-hee-hee-hee...\\" (Norm Sherry, then manager of the California Angels). Perhaps the most notorious‚Äîand among the most frequently played‚Äîclip in Healy's collection was a post-game tirade by then-Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda, after Dave Kingman, playing for the Chicago Cubs, hit three home runs to beat the Dodgers.The Daily Gazette (Schenectady, N.Y.). \\"Jim Healy, host of sports program\\" (Obituary). Associated Press, July 24, 1994, p. B8. Retrieved on July 25, 2013. Lasorda's rant started out: \\"What's my opinion of Kingman's performance!? What the &@*$% do you think is my opinion of it?\\" Among other Healy-isms: *He used the term \\"zops\\" as slang for dollars.Leggett, William. / \\"Between the Clacks, the Facts\\".

His KMPC show was famous for going over its 30-minute time limit. Healy would stay on the air as the top of the hour approached, then warn his listeners about the impending \\"dreaded six o'clock tone\\", and continue his program. During his late career, one of Healy's favorite clips came from then-University of Miami defensive end Jerome Brown, captured on tape when Brown led his fellow Hurricanes out of a pre-1987 Fiesta Bowl dinner with opponent Penn State, saying: Did the Japanese go and sit down and have dinner with Pearl Harbor before they bombed 'em? Any reference to Japan or the Japanese on Healy's show would result in a replay of Brown's remark. When Brown died in a car accident on June 25, 1992, Healy announced Brown's death during his 5:30 p.m. PDT broadcast ‚Äî and never played the \\"Pearl Harbor\\" clip again. Death Healy died July 22, 1994, at age 70 from complications of liver cancer. He was survived by his wife and son, Patrick, a newscaster on KNBC-TV in Los Angeles.
