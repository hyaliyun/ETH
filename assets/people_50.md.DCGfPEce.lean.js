She was lost on 25 November 1804, but without loss of life. First contract Duke of Clarence served the Royal Navy under contract from 12 June 1794 until 11 November 1801. She was of 65 tons (bm), and carried eight 3-pounder guns. Second contract Duke of Clarence served from 14 June 1803 until her loss on 25 November 1804. From early 1804, Lieutenant John Harper commanded her for many months on the Jersey and Guernsey station. He had transferred from the hired armed cutter Admiral Mitchell. From 1803 on Africaine maintained a blockade at Hellevoetsluis where there were two French frigates. One day while Africaine was maintaining this blockade, the French general at Scheveningen had four boys shrimping in Africaines jolly boat fired upon. Captain Thomas Manby of Africaine immediately seized sixty fishing boats that he then sent to Yarmouth. This cost The Hague its supplies of fish for some weeks. (In late 1799 Britain and The Netherlands had agreed to leave, within limits, each other's fishing boats unmolested.Marshall (1832), Vol. 3, Part 2, p.315.) In July 1807 Africaine was awarded prize money for sundry fishing boats captured in May 1803. She shared the prize money with Duke of Clarence. On 26 September 1804 Duke of Clarence left Portsmouth with a convoy for Guernsey. On 5 October 1804, the brig Polante, arrived at Portsmouth. Polante had been sailing from Lisbon to \\"Charleburg\\" when Duke of Clarence detained her.Naval Chronicle, vol. 12, p.506.

His replacement was Lieutenant Nicholas Brent Clements. Loss Clements received the mission to take Duke of Clarence to patrol between the Minquiers and Chausey to meet a boat bringing intelligence from France. On 24 November 1804, Duke of Clarence sighted a large French lugger and set off in chase, with the hired armed cutter Albion joining in. The lugger's crew ran their boat on shore near Granville, Manche. Duke of Clarence sent a boat in to examine the lugger, which turned out to have a cargo of oysters and cider. As Duke of Clarence awaited her boat's return she hit a submerged rock with the result that she started to fill with water. Clements gave up on any attempt to recover the lugger as Albion came up to rescue him, his officers, and crew. On 8 December the Lisbon packet arrived at Portsmouth with news of the loss of Duke of Clarence. The report stated that she had been lost off the coast of Portugal about a month earlier. Lieutenant N. Clements, his officers, and crew had been saved, but with the loss of all their possessions.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 12, p.505.

The plant has a total of five machines with capacity to generate 21.32 MW power each. Though the station is still known as diesel power plant, it has been using low sulphur heavy stock (LSHS) -- a residual fuel processed from indigenous crude, provided by IOC‚Äîin place of diesel. LSHS is in semisolid form. It is heated by steam to make it liquid form. When melts it becomes the same form of diesel. The transfer of diesel to LSHS is done by a three valve mechanism(first diesel, then a mixture of diesel and LSHS, then LSHS). *Number of Cylinder : 18 *Type of Cylinder : V type *Engine capacity : 18000 cc/cylinder *Engine power : 30,000 bhp *Fuel used : Diesel (for starting), LSHS(low sulphur heavy stock) =Electrical section= The engine is coupled with an alternator. The alternator consists of a stator and a rotor and the entire assembly is under one case. Switchgear of 220 kV, 25000 A is used to control the supply.

Description Eucalyptus annulata is a mallee that grows to a height of and can form a poorly developed lignotuber the canopy can grow up to about wide. It has an oily grey-green to red-brown smooth bark and angular branchlets with pith oil glands. The leaves are glossy green with a blade that is narrowly lanceolate and are long and wide. It blooms between June and December producing inflorescences with yellow-white-cream flowers. Each simple, axillary conflorescence is composed of three to seven flowered umbellasters on narrowly flattened or angular peduncles. The cylindrical or conical or rostrate buds have a calyx calyptrate that sheds early. Fruits that form later have a hemispherical shape with a flat disc flat and exserted valves with a width of . Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist George Bentham in 1867 as part of the work Orders XLVIII. Myrtaceae- LXII. Compositae published in Flora Australiensis. The type specimen was collected by George Maxwell from around the Salt River. The species name annulata is taken from the latin word annulatus meaning marked with a ring or ringlike which refers to the disc of the fruit. E. annulata is part of the Eucalyptus subgenus Symphyomyrtus section Bisectae sub-section Glandulosae. It is related to the gimlets (series Contortae) by the similar habit and type of bark as well as the large exserted valves of the fruit. It is most closely related to two mallet species E. protensa and E. extansa both of which are found in the north-eastern part of its range. Distribution It is found extending inland along the south coast of the Great Southern and Wheatbelt region of Western Australia between Albany, Western Australia, Ravensthorpe and Gnowangerup where it grows in sandy-loamy-clay soils. Cultivation The plant is sold commercially in seed form and, like most Eucalypts, germinates easily. It prefers a full position and will tolerate light frost and drought once established. It is grown in gardens as a shade tree or as an informal screen or windbreak.

It lies west of Virginia State Route 45 and includes Farmville, Virginia. Farmville Basin Diagram from Virginia DMME Extent The Farmville Basin lies in Virginia spreading North from Farmville, through Cumberland from modern day Cumberland State Forest to Briery Creek with a little bit in Buckingham. Farmville Basin Geology The combined continents of Africa and the Americas split apart from the combined continent of Pangea during the Triassic Period. A small rift was opened in the Farmville area into which water flowed and allowed for wetland life. The wetland life was later covered with sediment forming clay, and the pressure formed soft, Bituminous coal over hundreds of millions of years. Coal beds in the Triassic Basin near Richmond and Farmville were formed 205 to 245 million years ago, when Pangaea was splitting up rather than colliding. In the Triassic Basin, pressure to convert organic plant material into coal came from just the weight of overlying sediments, without tectonics. That is why the local coal is bituminous, rather than semi- anthracite. Farmville Basin Mining Coal was mined in the Briery Creek Watershed near Prince Edward Courthouse from as early as 1834 and by the Piedmont Mining Company in the 1860s. Daddow and Bannon, in 1866, described seven or eight coal seams ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 feet thick every 300 feet. They also reported that natural anthracite in some places. The individual seams were irregular and contained sulfur and other impurities. So mining was not as efficient as in the mountains of Virginia with huge seams. Clays for Brick Making Triassic Clays are not so abundant but the clays of the Farmville Basin show some plasticity. Certain ones like those tested from Farmville would do for the manufacture of hollow brick. The clay was a good red color at the surface but had too much mica a few feet down. Some clays in the basin make bricks as hard as steel. Some brick making was done in the basin the 1870s.

Community, State, and Market on the North Atlantic Rim: Challenges to Modernity in the Fisheries. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 32, 294. is a term that was used for fish merchants or landowners that enjoyed special privileges along the coast of Northern Norway from the second half of the 1700s onward. Store norske leksikon: nessekonge. Kennedy, John Charles. 2006. Island Voices: Fisheries and Community Survival in Northern Norway. Delft: Eburon, p. 25. The term nessekonge itself goes back centuries earlier, to the Viking era, referring to local chieftains that held power over a peninsula.Olson, Julia Ann. 1997. The Cultural Politics of Fishing: Negotiating Community and Common Property in Northern Norway. Dissertation. Stanford, CA: Stanford University, p. 55. Their privileged status refers to their having received special permission from the king to engage in trade. There are believed to have been 200 to 300 privileged traders' centers or fishing villages from Br√∏nn√∏ysund in the south to Vard√∏ in the north. The privileged traders experienced their peak from the second half of the 1800s to 1910. After this, the development of fishing fleets and public transport by steamship made fishermen less dependent on the local fish buyers, and catches could then be traded wherever the best profit was to be had. The privileged traders enjoyed a dominant economic, social, and political position in the local milieu. They controlled the local trade, fresh fish purchases, and fish processing, and they often owned the local estate. They sought to supply the locals with all the goods they needed from elsewhere, and this sales monopoly resulted in no room for competition. They covered needs ranging from food and fuel to boats and finished log houses. Often the sale of goods and purchases of fish happened at the same time, so that trade was more of a barter and the privileged trader profited from both the purchase and sale. Because there was little money in circulation, not only these exchanges were kept in written account books, but also the residents' other expenditures were recorded in the books maintained by the privileged trader; for example, taxes or costs of medical treatment. Fishermen‚Äôs dole-fish (the share of the catch they were entitled to)Palgrave, R. H. Inglis. 1895‚Äì1899 (reprinted 1987). Palgrave's Dictionary of Political Economy. London: MacMillan, p. 625. was also often handled by the privileged trader, and so he acted as a bank in many ways. This also applied to loans‚Äîboth for working capital for fishing, as well as consumer loans for houses and land, equipment, and boats. There was often little chance of the debt being paid off. The privileged traders secured the debts by having the borrowers pledge their property as security. If the people could not repay their debt, this could lead to foreclosure or forced sale and the loss of their boats, houses, or other property, which was their source of livelihood. Practice varied on how the debt was enforced; some allowed the old owners to remain on the farm as tenants, whereas others evicted them and brought in new residents. Often the privileged traders had not only a trade monopoly, but also political power, such as mayor or other offices, which often undermined the municipal system. The best-known privileged trader was Erasmus Zahl of Kjerring√∏y,Baumgartner, Walter. 1997. Knut Hamsun.

Cries of pain are music for his banquet.\\" Nick's (David Giuntoli) strength has been increasing after his zombification. On a date with Rosalee (Bree Turner), Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) proposes that she move in with him, to which she accepts. They also run into Sam (George Mount), an old friend of Monroe and his wife Kimber (Ashley Whittaker). That night, a Blutbad runs in the woods and climbs onto a tree where his stomach is bloating and then explodes. While Nick and Hank (Russell Hornsby) investigate the death, Renard (Sasha Roiz) receives a call from Sebastien (Christian Lagadec), his spy. He tells him that the police couldn't find anything on Eric's desk but he found a note that may lead to Frau Pech's location but finds Adalind (Claire Coffee) there. The next day, another victim is found in a tree with the same characteristics. Investigating the dead woman's car, Nick and Hank find that she and the Blutbad went to the same restaurant, Raven & Rose, before dying. They visit the restaurant to find the chef boss, Graydon Ostler (Dan Bakkedahl) yelling at his employees, all of them are Bauerschwein. Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) suggests to Nick that the victims could have died of gastric dilatation volvulus and Nick deduces that as the chefs were Bauerschwein and the victims were Blutbaden, these killings may be because of their old feud. Nick is finally moving out of Monroe's house and Monroe, Rosalee, Juliette, Hank and Bud (Danny Bruno) throw a party to celebrate. However, during the celebration, Monroe gets a call from Kimber, who states that Sam may have gone missing. Nick discovers that Sam is a Blutbad and also ate at Raven & Rose. Rosalee finds that the disease is the result of the V√∂llige Verzweiflung, a disease that causes their victims to burst their insides out. If the food is eaten raw, nothing will happen; but if the food is cooked, it is a toxin to the Blutbaden. Sam is found by Nick, Hank and Monroe and his stomach explodes, killing him. Deducing Ostler is responsible, Monroe goes to kill him. Nick manages to get Ostler to confess when Monroe and a pack of Blutbaden arrive at the restaurant to kill him. Ostler signs a written confession in the precinct and Renard looks at it and says, \\"This little piggy went to jail.\\" Reception =Viewers= The episode was viewed by 4.88 million people, earning a 1.3/4 in the 18-49 rating demographics on the Nielson ratings scale, ranking third on its timeslot and eight for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Blue Bloods, 20/20, Last Man Standing, Hawaii Five-0, MasterChef Junior, Undercover Boss, and Shark Tank.

'A Dish Best Served Cold' begins with Nick on a treadmill at the doctor's office. 'No matter how fast I had you running, your heart rate and your blood pressure barely moved,' says the doctor. 'Has there been any change in your diet or lifestyle recently?' That's the cue for a flashback of Nick getting gobbed in the face by a blowfish dude. While the 11-year-olds of every age in the audience are celebrating this reminder of one of the show's all-time greatest gross-outs, there's a cut to a restaurant scene that's a shipper's delight: Monroe telling Rosalee that Nick is moving out of his house, and delicately raising the possibility that she move in with him.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.0 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"The age old rivalry between the Blutbad and the Bauerschwein continued on Grimm Season 3 Episode 3, and what better way for a Bauerchwein to get back at a Blutbad than by literally blowing them up from the inside out with a serious case of indigestion?\\" References External links  Grimm (season 3) episodes 2013 American television episodes ","title":"A Dish Best Served Cold"},{"id":"51314898","text":"Haven is an extinct town in Grant County, in the U.S. state of Washington.

In June 2012, media reporting of people using K2 for the purposes of tax avoidance was followed by the United Kingdom's Prime Minister David Cameron characterising the scheme as \\"morally wrong\\". Later that year the UK government began to introduce legislation to deter people from using such schemes.  Operation  The K2 scheme was promoted by a Kirkcaldy-based accounting firm, Peak Performance. The scheme involved companies having their main operations in the UK and shell companies offshore. An employee of the UK company would quit their job and then be rehired by the offshore company to the UK. The offshore company would pay a lower salary than the person was originally on but would additionally loan them a large sum of money. Those loans would then be written down as tax liabilities to reduce the amount of tax payable.  Controversy  On 19 June 2012, The Times published an investigation into individual tax avoidance, estimating that around 1,100 people had been using the K2 scheme to avoid making tax payments totalling around ¬£168million. The Times report named comedian Jimmy Carr as the K2 scheme client who was largest beneficiary of these arrangements, claiming that he was sheltering ¬£3.3million and only paid 1% tax through using the scheme. That evening, Carr was challenged on the matter at a show in Royal Tunbridge Wells. When an audience member told him he didn't pay tax, Carr responded with \\"I pay what I have to and not a penny more.\\" Speaking to ITV News, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron called the scheme \\"morally wrong\\". Carr responded and issued a series of statements on his Twitter account; he apologised for using the scheme stating it was a \\"terrible error of judgement\\" and that he had ceased using the K2 scheme. The Herald reported that the accounting firm promoting the scheme may have taken around 15% in commission. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS) said they would investigate the K2 scheme and Peak Performance. HMRC crackdown HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) viewed K2 as a scheme for aggressive tax avoidance. In 2012, HMRC stated that they would be investigating how to challenge the scheme, stating if it worked technically, they would challenge it in court. In December 2012, the UK Government introduced the 2013 Finance Bill, which included a General Anti-Abuse Rule (GAAR) and a residency test, measures to deter people from using schemes like K2. In October 2013, Cameron announced an intention to publish a register of the owners of shell companies. In January 2014, having stopped using the K2 scheme, analysis of the accounts of Carr's company FN Good Limited suggested that corporation tax payments of around ¬£500,000 were now being made. In March 2016, The Herald reported that firms running schemes like K2 had disappeared.

Founded in 1961 from the mergers of three older congregations, it has a membership of over 800 households. The early members of the synagogue were immigrants from Prussia or Poland. Because of this, the synagogue was often called \\"Polisha shul.\\" Despite the synagogues nickname, it leaned for towards the German styles of Judaism, rather than the Polish one. Neveh Shalom is the second oldest Jewish congregation in the Pacific Northwest and the oldest Conservative congregation on the West Coast.CNS 150: A Pictorial Look at Where We Came From, Neveh Shalom website. Accessed May 16, 2019. History Neveh Shalom was originally a congregation named Neveh Zedek. The first Rabbi of Neveh Zedek was Julius Eckman. Julius Eckman was born in San Francisco. Julius would go on to become a Rabbi at Beth Israel. Although, he soon left the church because he believed Reform Judaism strayed too far from tradition. After he left Beth Israel he traveled to Neveh Zedek. He stayed there for three years. In 1886 the synagogue had difficulty finding a Rabbi. Because of this, a Hazzan named Robert Abrahamson served as Cantor and Rabbi. In 1889 the synagogue had constructed a cemetery. Around this time the synagogue also started to conduct sermons in English. Previously the synagogue had exclusively spoken in German. In 1902 the congregations Neveh Zedek and Talmund Torah would merge, resulting in Neveh Zedek. In 1904 the synagogue constructed a new building, because the old one was too small for the congregation size. The same thing occurred again in 1911. In 1921 Neveh Zedek joined the Conservative movement. Two years later in 1923, an arson set fire to the synagogue. Although, the synagogue was built on the same site. Throughout the 20's the synagogue would struggle to find a Rabbi. So it relied on Abraham Rosencrantz, a Cantor and Interim Rabbi. Abraham Rosencrantz would serve as Rabbi until he died in 1936. In 1937, Charles Sydney took over as Rabbi. He would remain in that position for fourteen years, from 1937 to 1951. Another Rabbi named Phillip Klienman would serve at the synagogue from 1937 to 1956. After World War 2 an influx of Jewish refugees from the Holocaust resulted in the Neveh Zedek's teachings shifted into becoming more traditional. In 1950 the synagogue's attendees had grown beyond what the building was capable of holding. So, they constructed a new building. In 1953 a new Rabbi named Joshua Stampfer arrived at the synagogue. Joshua Stampfer created a Jewish preschool which would later turn into Foundation School. A year later, in 1954, a man named Major Pruitt would come to the synagogue as a non-Jew. Despite that he decided to learn everything he could about Judaism. While at the synagogue he organized weddings, barmitzvahs, kept track of yahrzeits, and he would oversee the synagogue's kosher kitchen. In 1961 Neveh Zedek merged with Ahvahai Shalom to form Neveh Shalom. In 1965 the religious schools run by the synagogue grew. The schools taught adult classes on traditional and modern Judaism. The schools also began to explore issues from a Jewish perspective. The Rabbi would also lead book discussions. Another thing that occurred in 1965 was the completion of the construction of the synagogue's current building. the 1960s, the congregation would host Robert F. Kennedy, Chaim Potok, and Abraham Joshua Heschel as speakers at it. Kennedy would specifically speak in 1968 during his presidential campaign. In 1967, a woman named Min Zidell became the first woman to serve as a member of the board. Later in 1976 a woman named Carolyn Weinstein would become the first female executive director of the synagogue. Also in 1967, women officially became equal to men within the law of the synagogue. In 1993 Rabbi Stampfer retired from his position. He was succeeded in 1993 by a Rabbi named Daniel Isaak. Issak had an associate Rabbi named Bradley Greenstein. Daniel would serve as the Rabbi of the synagogue until 2015. In 2008 the synagogue engaged in a major remodel. By 2009 the synagogue largest Conservative synagogue located in Oregon.

She was known as \\"The Queen of Beale Street\\" as she sang in clubs on Beale Street, Memphis, Tennessee, for over 40 years. She also had a successful touring and recording career, and appeared in a number of films. Early life Wilson was born in Fort Worth, Texas, United States, the youngest in a family of six children. Her mother was a maid, her father was self-employed, and Wilson grew up picking and chopping cotton - work she later described as hot and unpleasant. Wilson's upbringing was filled with music, from two quite different sources - her mother, a deeply religious woman, only allowed her children to listen to gospel music, as she believed that all other music was \\"the devil's music\\". Wilson's mother was the choir director at their family church, and when she was 7 years old Wilson began singing in her mother's choir. On the other hand, Wilson's father loved blues and Wilson listened with him to blues musicians, which had a strong influence on her future career. Wilson met B.B. King for the first time when she was 14; King offered to be her godfather, and the two became close. When she was 15 years old, singer Shirley Caesar heard Wilson singing at church and invited her to tour with her as a backing singer. The following year, Wilson moved to Chicago, where she became a church choir director and sang gospel. She later returned to Texas and started singing jazz. Career Wilson moved to Memphis, Tennessee, in 1972, and started working as a kindergarten teacher in the Memphis City School system. She also began performing regularly in clubs on Beale Street, including The Peabody, Club Handy and Club Royale, with musicians such as Ray Charles, Isaac Hayes, and the Four Tops. When B.B. King opened his B.B. King's Blues Club, she was given a weekly residency there, and when he later opened a restaurant, Itta Bena, she also became a regular performer there. As Wilson's career developed, she toured the United States and internationally, and performed at blues and jazz festivals in Europe, Asia and New Zealand. She performed at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and for President Clinton and Vice-President Gore, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Rainier III of Monaco and his son Prince Albert. Wilson also performed on cruise ships and river cruises, and at parties and corporate events. Some of the bands which she performed with were the Hot Cotton Jazz Band, Buck Bubbles Express, the Unknown Band, the King Beez, B. B. King All Stars, Ms. Ruby‚Äôs Band and the Detroit People‚Äôs Band. In the 1980s, Wilson spent some years living in Los Angeles and performed with Joan Rivers and Sharon Gless. In 1976 she was offered her first record contract, with Malaco Records. Her first album, Ruby Wilson, was released by Malaco in 1981, and she released a further nine albums in her career. Two, Cake Walking Babies (1988) and Outstanding In Their Field (1989) were recorded with the Hot Cotton Jazz Band. Film appearances Wilson appeared in several films, including The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996), The Chamber (1996), Cookie's Fortune (1999) and Black Snake Moan (2006) as well as in television commercials. Recognition and honors In 1992, after 20 years of singing in Beale Street clubs, local TV station WMC-TV gave her the title \\"Queen Ambassador of Beale Street\\"; two years later this was amended to \\"The Queen of Beale Street\\". In 2006, Wilson received the Memphis Sound Award for Best Entertainer; in 2010, she was inducted into the Black Business Directory's African-American Hall of Fame. In 2012, Wilson was offered space to exhibit items from her career, and later that year the Ruby Wilson Museum was opened. It displays memorabilia including awards, outfits and photographs. In 2013, Wilson received a W.C. Handy Heritage Awards Lifetime Achievement Award. The Beale Street Walk of Fame includes a brass note recognising Wilson's contribution to the street's music. Personal life Wilson was married four times. Her first husband was a gospel entertainer from Chicago. Her fourth husband was B.B. King's road manager. Later years and death Wilson suffered a stroke in 2009, and was unable to speak for four months. She received speech therapy and physical therapy and eventually recovered enough to return to acting and singing. She suffered a heart attack in 2016, and after several days in a coma died on August 12, aged 68. She was survived by four children, twelve grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.

Harvey, and Udo Kier. The film is an homage to and parody of giallo, a cinematic and literary subgenre originating in Italy and popularized through films like The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, Torso, Deep Red, and A Lizard in a Woman's Skin. The film was shot on-location in Winnipeg, Manitoba and Kenora, Ontario, and premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. It was released on home video and VOD platforms on September 8, 2015, and received mixed-to-positive reviews. Plot Film editor Rey Ciso works on cutting director Francesco Mancini's latest giallo/poliziotteschi film Tarantola with his beautiful assistant Bella. Once an acclaimed, up-and-coming editor, Rey lost his right- hand fingers in a freak accident and is now handicapped by a prosthetic wooden hand. After hours, an unknown killer sneaks into the studio and kills lead actor Claudio Calvetti and his girlfriend Veronica while they view a workprint of the film. Actress Margarit Porfiry stumbles upon Veronica's hanging body and is stricken with hysterical blindness. Her husband, Police Inspector Peter Porfiry, interviews studio employees. Claudio's co-star Cal Konitz has his dreams of a larger role in the film are dashed when Mancini introduces Cesare, a lookalike stand-in to replace Claudio. Meanwhile, Police Chief O'Connor pressures Porfiry into closing the case, since Margarit is his daughter. Porfiry begins suspecting Rey, since the victims' fingers were crudely severed in much the same manner as Rey's. Porfiry interviews Mancini, and learns that Rey was once instituted in an asylum. Back at the studio, Cesare is murdered in the shower and his fingers are severed. With Cesare dead, Francesco instructs Rey to re-cut the film to make Cal the new star. Porfiry questions Rey about his time in the asylum, and Rey recounts how his start in the business as an editor for acclaimed art house director Umberto Fantori, Bella's father, whose debut film The Mirror and the Guillotine earned him critical acclaim and introduced him to his wife, star Josephine Jardin. When his wife was fired by Mancini on her next film, the pressures of editing Fantori's next project, the world's longest film, mounted and Rey accidentally cut off his own fingers in a fit of madness. What Rey doesn't tell him is that he's found what appears to be footage of the murders, taken by an unknown third party. The interview over, Rey returns to work in the editing suite with Bella, where she confesses her love for him, but Rey resists her because he is married. Porfiry, meanwhile, is introduced to Cal's girlfriend Jasmine, who reveals that the two were once lovers. Porfiry remains oblivious to the bladed instruments in Cal's car. That night after another argument with his wife, Rey has a vision of a dark man with bright blue eyes stalking him from the shadows in his room. Porfiry, meanwhile, infiltrates the asylum where Rey was institutionalized, and meets the director Dr. Casini. Casini tells Porfiry that Rey attempted to kill his assistant Giuseppe, who is now a patient at the asylum himself, his head mysteriously wrapped in bandages. Casini explains to Porfiry Plato's Allegory of the Cave; of men who spend their entire lives believing shadows on the wall to be living, breathing beings. Porfiry returns him to find that Margarit now has a seeing-eye German Shepherd named Rolfie. After the two make love, the killer breaks into their home and traps Porfiry outside of his room, separated from Margarit. Porfiry break the door down using an axe, but the killer throws Margarit in the way as a body shield, killing her. Porfiry stages the scene to exonerate himself, cutting off Margarit fingers and feeding them to Rolfie. Giancarlo arrives and holds Porfiry at gunpoint, but the Porfiry feeds him alcohol and confuses him into supporting Porfiry's narrative about the incident. O'Connor berates Porfiry over Margarit's death, and the killer calls him at the station to taunt him. Porfiry convinces O'Connor into supporting a plan where Giancarlo goes undercover as the new editor on Tarantola. Rey meanwhile, has been suffering from blackouts and hallucinations, and finding a bloodied shirt in his editing suite, begins to suspect himself as the killer. Mancini fires him and replaces him with Giancarlo, Rey dejectedly returns home to find Josephine obsessively watching Cal's demo tape. Burning the bloodied shirt in the kitchen sink, Rey begins having strange, otherworldly visions involving Bella; glimpsing a Lovecraftian netherworld filled with massive film reels and boiling tar. Bella meanwhile, finds the footage of the murders. Watching it, she is murdered by the killer; an act echoed in Rey's vision. He rushes to the studio, but arrives too late. Trying to complete the film without any prior filmmaking knowledge, Giancarlo is beset by venomous tarantulas in the editing suite and is disemboweled by the killer. Over-schedule and over-budget, Mancini rehires Rey to finish the film, Rey revealing that he'd already completed his assembly cut before being fired. Mancini is ecstatic and the film is saved. Porfiry, convinced Rey is the killer, confronts Father Clarke, who tries to tell him his conviction is misguided. He explains an old, Roman-era superstition that editors were believed to be bridges to the netherworld. Cal, learning that Rey has cut him from the film completely, threatens to kill Rey with a chainsaw. Rey points out that Cal blinks incessantly whenever he tries acting, which lets Rey know that Cal's bluffing. Cal leaves in a huff, but vows to still have his revenge. He tells Porfiry that Rey is a madman, and Porfiry mentions his suspicion that Rey may have ties to the occult, telling Cal that the best way to get to Rey is through his wife. Rey returns home to a ransacked living room with only the television intact. Viewing Cal's demo reel, the Betamax tape suddenly comes to life and begins breathing. Cal kidnaps Rey and forces him to watch him rape Josephine despite Rey's pleas, but Josephine reveals that she's been having an affair with him and plans to leave Rey. That night, Jasmine and Cal are killed during sex by a chainsaw. While researching the occult at the library, Porfiry is beset by tarantulas. Porfiry brings his findings to Father Clarke, insisting that Rey is the killer. Clarke retorts the Rey is a righteous man, who volunteered to fix the masonry in the broken church bell tower years ago, allowing the bell to keep ringing. Porfiry stumbles across Porfiry's dead body, and enraged brakes into Rey's home and finds occult literature and a film reel filled with severed fingers. Taking this as confirmation of Rey's guilt, Porfiry sets out in search of Rey. Rey is struck by another vision, crawling out of his editing machine covered in tar with bright blue eyes, thus matching the appearance of the killer in his dreams. Porfiry chases Rey by car over a cliff. Rey flees on foot and makes his way to Mancini's mansion, but Porfiry catches up and holds him at gunpoint. Porfiry shoots Rey, but upon turning around is shocked to find Josephine performing an occult ritual; sacrificing Mancini and revealing herself as the true killer. Josephine proclaims herself an incarnation of Death, Porfiry tries to shoot her but she causes his gun to backfire, blowing off the fingers on his right hand. Rey lights his wooden hand on fire and grabs Josephine, setting her ablaze and killing her. In the aftermath, Porfiry reveals that Cal confessed to killing Cesare for a better part in the film, and the two go their separate ways on good terms. The next day, Porfiry returns to work at police station, but quickly becomes confused by strange incongruities surrounding him. Dr. Casini is the staff psychiatrist and Jasmine is his nurse, Josephine and Rey were never together, Giancarlo is alive and a full Inspector who solved the case, and Porfiry's injuries are now only minor. Confused, Porfiry rushes to the church to speak to Father Clarke, who tells him that the belfry has remained damaged and the bell hasn't rung in over 100 years. Porfiry runs to the top of the tower, and digging through the damaged masonry finds a skull atop a stack of film reels. Examining the frames, he sees a reflection of himself repeating the same actions. Horrified, Porfiry screams, realizing that he is in another dimension, a camera pull-back revealing him to be in the studio editing machine. In a post-credits scene, Rey returns home to his wife; in this reality Bella.

It was founded in the 19th century in St Austell, and is now owned by the conglomerate Froneri based in Yorkshire. The company has achieved national prominence in the UK with its television advertising that promotes the Cornish language. From June 2013 to June 2014, Kelly's produced around 14¬Ω million litres of clotted ice cream. During the same period, the company announced that it was the sixth largest ice cream manufacturer in Britain and forecast projected sales at ¬£23 million for 2016. History =Local history= A Kelly's ice cream van parked at Polzeath in 2014 The company was established as an ice cream and fish and chips business by Joseph Staffieri in the late 19th century after he migrated from Italy to St Austell. His son-in-law, Lazero Calicchia took over the business in 1918, using a horse and cart to distribute ice cream around Cornwall. The mobile business is still in operation, with vans regularly travelling to beaches and landmarks around the county. The family name was changed to Kelly (with the company name following suit) in the 1930s, moving to Bodmin in the 1970s. The ice cream became popular at agricultural shows and has been a fixture at the Royal Cornwall Show since 1947. The ice cream has been produced from milk and clotted cream farmed and pasteurised from a nearby dairy farm at Trewithen. =National success= Having become a popular ice cream in Cornwall, R&R; Ice Cream (now Froneri) announced a buyout of the company in 2008 to enable the product to be distributed nationally. The merger was completed in 2010 and allowed the product to be stocked in national supermarkets such as Tesco, though the company still tightly controls who is allowed to sell the ice cream. Kelly's continue to run the ice cream van fleet independently of R&R.; As part of the takeover, they have invested more in various \\"scooping parlours\\" that sell ice cream over the counter around Cornwall, including refurbishment of the buildings. As of 2016 Kelly's had at least 49 parlours spread across the county. From June 2013 to June 2014, Kelly's produced around 14.5 million litres (3.2m imp gal; 3.8m US gal) of their clotted ice cream. The same year, the company announced it was the sixth largest ice cream manufacturer in Britain. After a projected record sales of ¬£23 million forecast for 2016, the company announced it would invest ¬£2 million at its Bodmin factory, on the Walker Lines Industrial Estate, in order to increase output. Promotion of Cornish The company is a strong supporter of the Cornish language. In May 2016 it invested ¬£2 million with the advertising agency Isobel for a prominent television and online advertising campaign. The advert was the first shown on national British television to make use of Cornish, featuring a man attempting to sell ice cream in a field of cows at Millbrook. It was shown on prime time television, including breaks in Britain's Got Talent. After central Government funding for the Cornish language ceased in 2016, company representatives protested outside the Houses of Parliament. Following the advert's success, councillors in Cornwall hoped that the company's profits could be re-invested into local schemes helping to revive the language. The Cornish Language Partnership's Mark Trevethan said that while the adverts were entertaining, they made a serious point about the importance of language and the celebration of local culture.

Tea importers were required to submit samples of their product for comparison with the standard samples kept at the customhouses.

The story details John Wood's attempts to recover his mummified leg from Shannon Whisnant, after Whisnant found the leg in a grill purchased at a storage unit auction. Plot In 2004, John Wood and his father, Tom, are involved in a plane crash in Tom's Cessna. Tom is killed and John's leg must be amputated below the knee. John‚Äîcelebrating a year of sobriety after an addiction to drugs in his youth‚Äîblames himself for the crash, even though his brother and nephew assure him that the crash wasn't his fault. John requests that the hospital return his amputated leg to him, intending to turn it into a shrine to his father as a way of coping with his grief. John is surprised when, rather than return his leg and foot bones, the hospital gives him his entire amputated leg, including the flesh and muscle. John makes several failed attempts to skin the leg himself before deciding to mummify it. The leg ends up in a barbecue grill in John's storage shed, undergoing a primitive mummification process. John relapses into drug addiction after he begins drinking beer while taking the painkillers prescribed to him after his surgery. He spends the rent money for his storage shed on drugs, and the shed is put up for auction by its owner. The shed is purchased by Shannon Whisnant, a local entrepreneur. When he discovers the leg, Whisnant sees it as an opportunity to fulfil his lifelong dream of being a rich and famous television personality. Whisnant begins spreading news of the leg in the local media, calling himself ‚ÄúThe Foot Man‚Äù and expressing his desire to create a roadside attraction using it. When John learns of this, he makes contact with Whisnant to try and get the leg back. Whisnant agrees only to return ownership of the leg to John on the grounds that John allow him to display the leg, with both men collecting a profit. John initially agrees in an attempt to get Whisnant to turn the leg over to him, intending to renege on the agreement later. When Whisnant learns of this, he refuses to turn the leg over and begins going on local radio to make fun of John and mock Tom's death. Whisnant reveals that, as a child, his father was one of the few people in town not employed by Tom Wood's furniture business, and that he has always resented never being invited to birthday parties at John's house. Whisnant's friends and family indicate that his desire to be a beloved celebrity stems from the severe physical and emotional abuse he suffered at the hands of his father. Both men become fixated on the leg to the extent that it interferes with their personal lives. Depression over the incident leads John further into drug abuse, and he ends up homeless and living under a bridge. Whisnant becomes obsessed with marketing himself to the local community as ‚ÄúThe Foot Man,‚Äù spending money on shirts, fliers, and other promotional merchandise for a business venture that doesn't exist yet. His wife tells him that she is considering divorcing him due to his behavior; Whisnant retorts that he will be happy and productive once he is famous and has his own television show. In 2006, Judge Mathis learns of the feud between the men and agrees to have them on his show. Mathis chastises Whisnant for his behavior and orders him to return the leg to John, but tells John that he must reimburse Whisnant $5,000 for the cost of the storage shed. Noticing that John has arrived to court high on drugs, Mathis offers to help him get treatment. John agrees and Mathis pays for him to go to a rehab facility. John successfully recovers from his addictions, returns to work, and gets engaged. An area vet agrees to taxidermy the leg for him, and John completes the memorial to his father. Whisnant remains bitter over the loss of the leg and continues trying to make himself a local celebrity. He is hired to appear on a reality television show, but gets into an argument with the producers when he learns that aspects of the show are staged. He finally concludes that the barbecue grill he found the leg in is cursed, and decides that he can only lift the curse by throwing it into the ocean. The film ends with Whisnant going on talk radio to announce his candidacy for President of the United States in the 2016 Presidential Election.  Aftermath  Whisnant continued to promote himself as \\"The Foot Man\\" for the next ten years, selling merchandise, appearing on podcasts, and attempting to sell a book of essays. In 2014 he was arrested after employees saw him driving around a Wells Fargo brandishing a .38 revolver; he was later released into the care of a local hospital for unspecified reasons. After years of struggling with morbid obesity, Whisnant suffered a fatal heart attack in November 2016. He was memorialized by Film School Rejects, on whose podcast he appeared after the film came out.  Reception  , the film had a 98% \\"certified fresh\\" rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes.

The budgeted cost of the construction was given as 33.325 million. Background In the past, access to the town of Aƒüƒ±n from the city of Elazƒ±ƒü was provided by the Karamaƒüara Bridge, an ancient Roman arch bridge situated about from the town. The historic bridge was dismantled, and its ashlar masonry was moved to the Elazƒ±ƒü Museum before the Keban Dam was completed and its reservoir created in 1974. For a period of about 40 years following the establishment of the reservoir, the town was disconnected from the provincial center, and was accessible only by ferry boats across the lake. The newly built bridge is also named the \\"Aƒüƒ±n (Karamaƒüara) Bridge\\" in remembrance of the previous Roman bridge which no longer exists.

She is considered to be a \\"tireless defender\\" of Panamanian heritage ethnography. Biography =Early life= Reina Torres de Ara√∫z was born on October 30, 1932, in Panama City. She studied at the Normal School in the Veraguas Province, and later went to the Lyceum for Young Ladies and finally got her degree at the National Institute in Panama City. De Ara√∫z studied philosophy and majored in anthropology at the University of Buenos Aires, where she earned her doctorate in 1963. She also received titles from the university as their anthropologist, ethnographer, professor of history and technical museums. De Ara√∫z's doctoral thesis published in 1962, was on Panama and Colombia's culture and their inhabitants, and is considered an important reference on the subject. She was fluent in five languages, including Ancient Greek and Latin. =Career= Reina Torres de Ara√∫z Anthropological Museum, Panama City. De Ara√∫z focused on the study of the characteristics of indigenous Panamanians in their own environment, through field visits in jungles and mountains of Panama in a theoretical and documentary research work that allowed her to create a written and photographic record that detailed the idiosyncrasy, religious beliefs, sports games, dances, songs and music of these peoples. The preservation of the indigenous peoples of Panama became her main focus throughout her professional life. She was the professor of anthropology at the National Institute and the University of Panama. With the latter she founded the Center for Anthropological Research and promoted the creation of the National Commission of Archaeology and Historic Monuments. This commission was the seed of the National Historical Heritage and was created within the National Institute of Culture, where De Ara√∫z served as its director for a decade. In the period she was in charge of the National Historical Heritage, De Ara√∫z promoted the adoption of Law 14 of May 5, 1982, which dictates and manages the custody, conservation and management of the Heritage of the Nation. De Ara√∫z was elected UNESCO's Vice President of the World Heritage Committee and worked in the Coordination of the Multinational Technical Committee on Culture. In her career as a teacher and researcher, in 1974, the Panamanian Academy of History formally distinguished her as a Full Member of the institution, the first Panamanian woman to receive this honour. She promoted the creation of several museums such as the Museum of the Archaeological Park El Ca√±o in the Cocl√© Province, the Museum of the nationality of the Villa de Los Santos, the Museum of Colonial Religious Art, the West Indian Museum of Panama, the Museum Natural Science and History Museum of Panama. =Struggle to preserve Panamanian heritage= De Ara√∫z denounced the illegal removal of archaeological evidence from the sites where there were remains of indigenous cultures. She wrote to several American museums, personally requesting that Panamanian archaeological evidence be returned to their original sites. In 1979, two years after the Torrijos‚ÄìCarter Treaties were signed, the then Governor of the Panama Canal Zone, Harold Parfitt ordered the removal of the locomotive 299, part of the first transcontinental railroad (Panama Canal Railway), and the locomotive was sent to an industrial museum in New Jersey. The locomotive had previously been included in the national heritage and its donation to the museum in New Jersey had been negotiated only a year earlier, when the treaties were in force. The situation angered De Ara√∫z, who had made it known to the Zonian authorities their intentions to keep the locomotive in Panama. She described the actions of Parfitt as \\"a flagrant violation of all international instruments on the heritage of humanity, and is painfully, at this moment we are close to the implementation of the Treaty, an effective denial statements joint ratification of the total Panamanian sovereignty.\\" Personal life De Ara√∫z during the Trans-Darien expedition. She met Professor Amado Arauz in 1958 while conducting research on the native peoples in the Dari√©n Province. They were married on 30 December 1959, and had three children. Soon after their marriage, they departed via the first crossing by car from Panama to Bogot√° called \\"Trans-Darien Expedition\\" in which they spent four months and twenty days in the Darien and Choco jungles. Final years At the beginning of the 1980s, her eldest son Oscar died from a form of advanced cancer. Shortly after her son's death, De Ara√∫z was diagnosed with breast cancer, a disease of which she battled with for the next two and a half years. She died in the morning of February 26, 1982, at the age of 49. During the final stage of her illness, De Ara√∫z continued to work hard. Her last pieces of work were on the selection of parts of the Museum of Chitre and writing the pages of her new book \\"The New Edinburgh Darien\\"; she did not live to see her work completed.

From 1912 to 1918 he served in the High Seas Fleet of the German Imperial Navy. From just before the start of the First World War to its end, he wrote a personal war diary. Because the diary comprehensively represented the internal situation in the fleet from the perspective of a normal sailor, it has been documented in full length by the enquiry commission of the German Weimar Republic parliament (Reichstag) in its investigation report.

He was a catholic tinsmith and a member of a Christian trade union, and he received the basic education of a worker. However, he was well-read and interested in many things. As a journeyman he had come as far as Veneto and South Tyrol. He constantly educated himself further. From 1912 until November 1918 he served in the German Imperial Navy. Most of that time, i.e. from shortly before the outbreak of World War I in 1914 until March 1918 he was deployed on the SMS Helgoland from the I. Squadron, in the beginning as a seaman and later as seaman first class. In a diary entry from 1916, he noted that he still hadn‚Äôt managed to become a seaman first class due to always frankly stating his opinion. However, in March 1918 he mentioned that he had become a seaman first class by then; probably on the occasion of being transferred to SMS Wittelsbach.

(WUA) Huck, Pieken und Rogg established an exhibition titled: \\"Die Flotte schl√§ft im Hafen ein (The fleet fells asleep in the harbour)\\", presenting Stumpf's notes alongside another diary. In the exhibition catalogue they explain that Stumpf's six notebooks cannot be regarded as diaries in a strict sense, but that the books contain transcripts, which have been written on the basis of lost diary records. The transcripts show several corrections in another handwriting that can be attributed to an editing for the publication in 1927 (see below). Stumpf was appointed special expert for the navy activities by the enquiry commission. Diary content Almost every day Stumpf noted down his experiences, observations and assessments in his war diary. He read several books, various newspapers and discussed the political and military developments in detail with his environment, which is reflected in corresponding thoughts and comments in his diary. Initially Stumpf was conservative, and identified himself with the war aims of the Central Powers. He repeatedly described the general enthusiasm at the beginning of the war which was also shared by him. Soon, however, the perceived unfair treatment by the officers brought him to view the war from a different perspective. He repeatedly described that the \\"officer caste\\" would receive a high war allowance besides their already good salary, that they would live in abundance during the war, while the sailors would suffer great hardships. In addition, the officers would humiliate the crews, exert a senseless drill and would constantly invent new methods of bullying the crews. Only during battles, such as in the Battle of Jutland, the sailors and stokers felt taken seriously and treated properly by the officers. However, there were but few of these battles, because the largely inflexible strategy of the German Navy was based on a misinterpretation of the English approach. This catastrophic military-strategic planning,Rahn. W. (Hrsg.), Deutsche Marinen im Wandel, R. Oldenbourg Verlag, M√ºnchen, 2005. which centered on a large naval battle against England near Heligoland, found its reflection in Stumpf's diary when he noted: \\"We all had to realize gradually that even a victorious naval battle will not guarantee Germany access to the open sea.\\"Horn, D. (Ed.), War, Mutiny and Revolution in the German Navy ‚Äì The World War I Diary of Seaman Richard Stumpf, Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, New Jersey (USA), 1967, S. 163. Arrogance accompanied by strategic inability caused Stumpf to wish that one day the officer caste could be forced to take on an honourable profession and perform a useful activity. The sailors wished to be able to pay back the officers the constant humiliations and harassments that these could perpetrate under the protection of the strict military discipline. In Stumpf's final analysis, only the officers would have an interest in the continuation of the war, while soldiers and workers had to risk their lives and take great deprivations for the Junkers, \\"walking safes\\" and military aristocracy (he views the priests as officers in plain clothes). The fact that soldiers and workers also had a democratic voting legislation denied, caused special bitterness for Stumpf. Around mid-1917 Stumpf wrote that the sailors wanted peace as quickly as possible, and the opinion would prevail that only the officers and war profiteers want to continue the war. In another entry he wrote that it was the officer caste that had driven Germany into the war. When in February 1917, one morning a pamphlet of the left-wing party USPD appeared on board, this caused great excitement. Stumpf wrote that this leaflet contained along with much truth, a motley mixture of silly platitudes and phrases. Many sheets seem to have been handed over to the superiors, according to Stumpf's perception. The unrest in the German Navy in the summer of 1917 also found its reflection in Stumpf's diary. He described the events in detail and then noted: \\"If, in the past, someone had told me that it would be possible for people to be sentenced to jail or executed in Germany without having committed a crime, I would have looked upon him as a fool.\\"Stumpf, R., Warum die Flotte zerbrach ‚Äì Kriegstagebuch eines christlichen Arbeiters, Hrsg.

In some text passages, Stumpf talkes of the \\"Jew Liebknecht\\" when he means the member of parliament for the SPD and the later USPD- and KPD-member Karl Liebknecht. Conservative and right-wing extremist politicians (many naval officers were ideologically close to the latter),Mehnert, G., Evangelische Kirche und Politik 1917-19, Droste Verlag, D√ºsseldorf, 1959.Kuhl, K., Die Rolle der deutschen Seeoffiziere w√§hrend der Ereignisse im Oktober/November 1918, Literaturstudie, 2013, S. 12. Retrieved 17. Nov. 2014, from: . claimed that Liebknecht was a Jew, in order to exploit anti-Semitism against the leftist movement. This claim lacked any validity. Karl Liebknecht's family came from Saxony and had a Protestant- Christian background. Karl Liebknecht was born in 1871 in Leipzig and baptized as a Protestant in St. Thomas Church. A great-uncle of the father was a Protestant pastor. On the occasion of the unrest in the Navy in summer of 1917 Stumpf sees the labour leader in a different light: \\"Now I gradually realize why some people fight the military and its system with such determination. Poor Karl Liebknecht! How sorry I feel for you now!\\"Horn, D. (Ed.), War, Mutiny and Revolution in the German Navy ‚Äì The World War I Diary of Seaman Richard Stumpf, Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, New Jersey (USA), 1967, pp. 352 f. Stumpf also addressed once the commandment of the Bible, \\"Thou shalt not kill\\" and revealed some pacifistic tendencies, but time and again he expressed clearly conservative views when he ranted about the \\"perfidious Albion\\" (England) or against France's rapacity, when he showed satisfaction that England had finally to sacrifice rivers of blood, and he wanted to combine the last forces for the defence of the fatherland. Stumpf's inner conflict is expressed among others in the following entry at the end of the diary: \\"... why did we have to have such criminal, conscienceless officers? It was they who deprived us of all our love for the Fatherland, our joy in our German existence, and our pride for our incomparable institutions. Even now my blood boils with anger whenever I think of the many injustices [...].\\"R. Stumpf: Warum die Flotte zerbrach ‚Äì Kriegstagebuch eines christlichen Arbeiters. Hrsg. W. Dittmann, Verlag J.H.W. Dietz Nachfolger, Berlin, 1927, S. 208.Horn, D. (Ed.), War, Mutiny and Revolution in the German Navy ‚Äì The World War I Diary of Seaman Richard Stumpf, Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, New Jersey (USA), 1967, p. 419. At the end of the war Stumpf followed, albeit reluctantly, the red flag of revolution: \\"To the thunderous applause of the mob, the huge Imperial flag was lowered and the red flag of liberty, equality and fraternity rose up over the barracks. I could no longer resist and was swept along by the mass hysteria.\\"Stumpf, R., Warum die Flotte zerbrach ‚Äì Kriegstagebuch eines christlichen Arbeiters, Hrsg. Dittmann, W., Verlag J.H.W. Dietz Nachfolger, Berlin, 1927, S. 213.Horn, D. (Ed.), War, Mutiny and Revolution in the German Navy ‚Äì The World War I Diary of Seaman Richard Stumpf, Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, New Jersey (USA), 1967, p. 427. But Stumpf's inner conflict was revealed again when the armistice conditions became known. He exclaims, \\"That's what you get for your god damn brotherhood of nations.\\"Horn, D. (Ed.), War, Mutiny and Revolution in the German Navy ‚Äì The World War I Diary of Seaman Richard Stumpf, Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, New Jersey (USA), 1967, S.428. But when the fleet had to be surrendered later, Stumpf expressed relief that these instruments of destruction disappeared from German waters. Testimony before the enquiry commission of the German Weimar Republic parliament (Reichstag)  In one of the enquiry commission's hearings Stumpf had a discussion with Adolf von Trotha, who was Chief of Staff of the German Imperial High Seas Fleet at the end of the First World War. Trotha had primarily initiated the planned fleet attack against England (operation-instruction no. 19). The advance was prepared without the knowledge and against the clearly expressed orders of the government. These intentions of the Navy command had led to the sailors' mutiny off Wilhelmshaven and the rebellion in Kiel. Trotha tried to portray Stumpf's allegations as individual cases. Stumpf answered he still had the feeling that two different worlds were facing each other, separated by a Chinese wall. In preparation for the discussion he had interviewed Fritz Betz who also served on board the SMS Helgoland. Betz explicitly confirmed that the vast majority of naval officers in the High Seas Fleet humiliated and abused the sailors and stokers with constant harassment and offensive remarks.WUA, Reihe 4, Bd. 10,1: Gutachten der Sachverst√§ndigen Alboldt, Stumpf, v. Trotha zu den Marinevorg√§ngen 1917 und 1918, 1928. Publication of the diary  Stumpf wrote his diary out of personal interest so as to have a reminder of his war memories. When in the beginning of the 1920s an intense debate about the stab-in-the-back myth began, Stumpf realized that his diary could contribute to the elucidation of the role of naval officers, and he handed it to Joseph Joos of the Centre Party (Germany), who recognized the value of the records and ensured they were read before the enquiry commission of the German Weimar Republic parliament (Reichstag). Book edition of the publisher J.H.W. Dietz Nachfolger, Berlin (Germany) 1927. In 1927 the USPD-MP Wilhelm Dittmann published an abbreviated version under the title: \\"Warum die Flotte zerbrach ‚Äì Kriegstagebuch eines christlichen Arbeiters (Why the fleet broke up - war diary of a Christian worker)\\"Stumpf, R., Warum die Flotte zerbrach ‚Äì Kriegstagebuch eines christlichen Arbeiters, Hrsg. Dittmann, W., Verlag J.H.W. Dietz Nachfolger, Berlin, 1927. Dittmann added a preface, in which he stated that not any outside revolutionary influences have led to the disaster but the conditions in the fleet itself. He also added headings and a table of content. In 1967 Daniel Horn, then assistant professor of history at Douglas College, Rutgers State University of New Brunswick in the US state of New Jersey, translated the diary into English and published it in full length. He added an introduction, many explanatory notes and an index. He restored as far as possible the anonymous names. Horn, born in Vienna (Austria), encountered the diaries in the context of his research on the unrest in the Imperial Navy and the German Revolution.Horn, D., German Naval Mutinies of World War I, Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, New Jersey (USA), 1969. Assessments of the diary  Daniel Horn evaluated the historical significance of the diary in his introduction by listing the reasons which led the enquiry commission of the German parliament to include Stumpf's diary as the only personal memory in its report: While the other persons giving testimony before the enquiry commission were officers and politicians, anxious to defend or substantiate their actions respectively their position, Stumpf was a worker, who had served as a common sailor in the Navy and his records mirrored his feelings and views at that time, without being influenced by the discussions which ensued later. Stumpf intended to keep a private diary. However, through his active and intensive involvement in the discussions of the sailors and stokers not only of the SMS Helgoland but also of many other ships as well as through his keen sense of the moods of his comrades, Stumpf expressed the general mood as well. Thus the diary constitutes an invaluable historical source of the individual but also the collective mentality of the lower ranks in the Imperial Navy.Horn, D. (Ed.), War, Mutiny and Revolution in the German Navy ‚Äì The World War I Diary of Seaman Richard Stumpf, Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, New Jersey (USA), 1967. According to Horn the diary provides a coherent explanation, not only why the conscripted sailors mutinied against their officers, but also why Germany lost the war, why the German empire collapsed and why it was overthrown by revolution. Sailors and stokers rebelled because they suffered from hunger and deprivation, because they were abused by their officers, because they wanted peace and because they were denied democratic rights. The officers tried to extent the duration of the war lacking any sympathy with their subordinates, in order to enforce imperial aspirations and annexations. The sailors and stokers viewed the continuation of the war as being only in the interest of the officers who were not the least considerate but on the contrary deliberately harassed them. Horn could think only of two other publications that can be compared with Stumpf's diary: firstly Joachim Ringelnatz' work \\"Als Mariner im Krieg (as mariner at war)\\",Ringelnatz, J., (B√∂tticher, H.) Als Mariner im Krieg, Karl H. Hensel Verlag, 1955. which Horn, however, views as not nearly as authentic, stirring, and poignant. Secondly Horn refers to the memories of Willy Sachse,Sachse, W., (Antinautikus), Deutschlands revolution√§re Matrosen, Verlag Karl Schulzke, Hamburg, 1925. however, according to Horn, Sachse lost credibility by later published opposite statements e.g. in his work \\"Rost an Mann und Schiff (rust on man and ship)\\". Huck, Pieken and Rogg see echoes of a classic drama as the diary describes hubris (arrogance) and fall of the world power ambitions of the German Empire manifested in the naval armaments. The diary also describes the erosion of the Wilhelmine class society in the Imperial Navy. Indeed, the person of Richard Stumpf reflected the fact, that the well trained workers who literally starved for education (as can also be seen in the working-class youth of that time) and constantly continued their education, did no longer want to be treated as children or animals by whippersnappers with a limited intellectual horizon, who sometimes found only access to their officers posts through the money of their parents. The time during and after the Weimar Republic  The information regarding this period is mainly based on Daniel Horn's studies. In an essay written in 1978, he describes that he received documents on Richard Stumpf from the Stumpf family (probably from Stumpf's son Hans, who had emigrated to the United States in 1950The German newspaper \\"Sonntagspost\\", 31 August 1974 (Schw√§bische Post): Das Tagebuch des Richard Stumpf (The diary of Richard Stumpf).). Horn had these documents passed on to the archive of the Rutgers University Library. Meanwhile, the documents (or parts thereof) had been detected in the archive of the Leo Baeck Institute.Archive of the Leo Baeck Institute (2009). Guide to the Daniel Horn Collection, 1881-1976, AR 6411. Retrieved 10 August 2016, from: . After the end of World War I Stumpf was unemployed and stayed in Neunkirchen near Nuremberg (Germany). In 1919 he joined the Freikorps to fight the Bavarian council government. He was persuaded by the argument, that this would be the desire of the government in Berlin and the diocese. Not yet having taken part in any actual fighting, he witnessed a massacre of members of the Catholic Journeymen Association of St. Joseph. The Freikorps members confined them to a cellar and threw hand grenades into it. Thereafter Stumpf left the Freikorps. Finally he concluded that the government forces lost about 18 men, while they killed about 5,000 men. According to Stumpf it was mainly cold-blooded murder. In 1921 Stumpf married Anna Birzle and for the time being they stayed with his sister. From 1922 to 1924 he worked as a polisher in a metal factory in Nuremberg. This enabled him to start an own household, and their four sons were born. In 1925 Stumpf attended meetings of the left-liberal German Democratic Party and through the intervention of the Nuremberg Mayor Hermann Luppe he got a job in his old profession and a flat. He started to write and publish on navy-historical and political issues, whereby he also criticised the rise of the Nazis. One of his articles came to the attention of Dr. Joos, who then conveyed a contact to the enquiry commission of the parliament. The commission was looking into the issues of who caused WWI, who were to blame for its continuation, and who for the German defeat. A longer stay in Berlin followed on the occasion of being appointed expert witness. Thereafter Stumpf worked again in his old profession and continued his literary activity. With the advent of Nazism Stumpf tried to enhance international understanding with France on the basis of common religious beliefs. Under the dictatorship of the Nazis his diaries were burned and he was, according to his son Richard, denied adequate jobs.Statement of his son Richard Stumpf in a letter to the navy- historian Dieter Hartwig, sent from Oberkochen (Germany), 2004.German newspaper \\"Sonntagspost\\", 31 August 1974 (Schw√§bische Post): Das Tagebuch des Richard Stumpf (The diary of Richard Stumpf). After the unemployment due to the global economic crisis Stumpf finally found a job as a hostel warden of the \\"Mainzerhof\\" of the Kolping Society in Heiligenstadt in Thuringia (Germany). There he spent the entire time of the Second World War. Because of his age and a bad rheumatism he was not enlisted, but he had to do occasional military work and guard services. After the Second World War, he continued to live in the Heiligenstadt, which now belonged to the Soviet occupation zone. He became a policeman and participated in actions to arrest Nazis and their surrender to the authority. He became a member of the anti-fascist committees and joined the Christian Democratic Union (East Germany) in 1946, the successor party to the Catholic Centre Party (Germany), to which Stumpf was close because of his religious affiliation. He had known the President Jakob Kaiser from his apprenticeship period in Nuremberg. Stumpf hid his service pistol, which he was given as a warden., when the Soviet troops marched into Heiligenstadt. It was later discovered, and a tenant of a house belonging to the Kolping restaurant was subsequently arrested. As Stumpf learned of this, he surrendered himself to the authorities, although a death sentence was possible for such offenses. He was abused, but was released in March 1946. Under the German Democratic Republic regime, he was arrested after the uprising of 17 June 1953 and accused of anti-democratic activities: he had established relationships with Jakob Kaiser who stayed in West Berlin and given information to the bishop in Fulda on the occupying power and other organisations. During the detention period, he wrote another diary of his last period of life, which is probably stored in the above-mentioned archive of the Rutgers University in New Jersey (USA) or the similarly mentioned archive of the Leo Baeck Institute. The case was closed and Stumpf was discharged without conviction. At the instigation of his eldest son Lothar, Stumpf was rehabilitated in 1993. In November 1953 Stumpf received permission upon request to adorn the war memorial in the Heinrich-Heine park in memory of the dead soldiers. When in the following year, the graves of dead Soviet soldiers were desecrated, Stumpf was suspected and arrested for anti-Soviet activities. He was however, released after lengthy interrogations because of proven innocence. Stumpf died 23 July 1958. Reception of the diary in post-war Germany In the official GDR historiography Stumpf's diary was not mentioned. It was not until the late 1970s, that it was described in publications of the military journalist Robert Rosentreter.Among others in: Rosentreter, R., Blaujacken im Novembersturm ‚Äì Rote Matrosen 1918/1919 (Blue jackets in the November storm ‚Äì red sailors 1918/1919), Dietz Verlag, Berlin, 1988. Also in West Germany historians recognized it relatively late. Wilhelm Deist mentioned the diary at various points of his historical work, for the first time in 1966 in his publication \\" Die Politik der Seekriegsleitung und die Rebellion der Flotte Ende Oktober 1918 (The politics of the Maritime Warfare Command and the rebellion in the fleet in late October 1918)\\".Deist, W., ‚ÄòDie Politik der Seekriegsleitung und die Rebellion der Flotte Ende Oktober 1918‚Äò, Rothfels, H. & Eschenburg, T. (Hrsg.), Vierteljahrshefte f√ºr Zeitgeschichte, Deutsche Verlagsanstalt Stuttgart, 4. Heft, 1966. Available under: . In a later lecture Deist described the disturbing influence the evacuation of Flanders at the beginning of October 1918 had on the sailors. This had been clearly indicated in Stumpf's diary. Because now an important base for the U-boat warfare had to be abandoned, the sailors and stokers realized definitely that the war was lost.Deist, W., ‚ÄòDie Ursachen der Revolution von 1918/19 unter milit√§rgeschichtlicher Perspektive (The reasons for the 1918/19 revolution from a military-historical perspective)‚Äò, Wilhelmshavener Museumsgespr√§che, Texte zur Geschichte der Stadt, Band 2, Die Revolution 1918/19 ‚Äì 70 Jahre danach, Vortragsveranstaltung der Stadt Wilhelmshaven on 28 and 29 October 1988, bearbeitet und herausgegeben von Norbert Cred√© im Auftrag der Stadt Wilhelmshaven, Stadt Wilhelmshaven, K√ºsten Museum 1991. In 1992, the Freiburg (Germany) historian and peace researcher Wolfram Wette published contributions to the history of everyday routine of war in the German military since the early modern period and included extracts from Stumpf's diary.Wette, W. (Hrsg.), Der Krieg des Kleinen Mannes ‚Äì Milit√§rgeschichte von unten (The war of the little man ‚Äì military history from below), M√ºnchen, Z√ºrich, 1992. Since the early 1990s, Stumpf's diary has also been presented in the educational exhibition of the Naval Academy M√ºrwik (introduced by naval historian Dieter Hartwig in form of a colour copy of the original) and it is discussed in naval history classes. In 2014, the German Navy Museum in Wilhelmshaven devoted Stumpf a major exhibition: Die Flotte schl√§ft im Hafen ein ‚Äì Kriegsalltag 1914-1918 in Matrosentageb√ºchern (The fleet falls asleep in the harbour ‚Äì everyday war-routine 1914-1918 in sailors' diaries). Impressively constructed exhibits generated easily interpreted statements from Stumpf's diary alongside notes from a typescript of Carl Richard. This diary was discovered in 2013. Richard also served on board the SMS Helgoland. Publications  * Stumpf, Richard, Warum die Flotte zerbrach: Kriegstagebuch eines christlichen Arbeiters. Hrsg. Wilhelm Dittmann, Verlag J.H.W.

Pilgrims travelled from miles around and wore many paths down to the cross. Description Detail of the cross face The cross is made of granite with a band of quartz and stands high and is wide. The west face bears a crucifixion, while the east face bears two very worn human heads, both bearded and one perhaps wearing a mitre.

The Romanesque complex of churches includes Sant Pere, Sant Miquel and Santa Maria (San Pedro, San Miguel and Santa Mar√≠a). They are situated at the confluence of Vallparad√≠s and Monner (now Park Vallparad√≠s), the most important artistic area of the city, which is noted for Catalan Romanesque art. It was the site of the former Diocese of Egara, an old Visigoth nucleus, in the 5th-8th centuries.  History  The three churches were built near the old Roman √âgara (whose remains are still preserved), which was the seat of the Bishop of √âgara around the year 450 and lasted until the Saracen invasion in the 8th century. The episcopal group adhered to the ancient Byzantine model of three churches: San Pedro, Santa Maria and San Miguel. After a long construction process, the current churches, of Romanesque design, were completed in present form during the 11th and 12th centuries during the Visigoth era. In the 12th century, Santa Mar√≠a served as an Augustinian canonry till 1392. The church of San Pedro de √âgara, home of the parish, lost its parish status in 1601 and became part of the new bishopric of Terrassa, currently the Terrassa Cathedral. In the 19th century, San Pedro regained its status of parish church. Architects, archaeologists and historians, including Francisco de Paula Villar, Llu√≠s Muncunill i Parellada, Josep Puig i Cadafalch, Josep de Calassan√ß Serra i R√†fols, and Jordi Ambr√≤s continued research on the monuments at different times during the 20th century, in order to discover the episcopal history and that of the Roman √àgara. The work was highlighted by Puig, who made a thorough study of all historical restorations and excavations in Santa Maria and San Miguel. Puig also dealth with the reconstruction of the complex by adding a pool surrounded by eight central columns. Pere Antoni Ventall√≥ i Vintr√≥ analyzed the constructive elements within San Miguel before the interventions by Puig. The site was declared a national monument in 1931, and a Bien de Inter√©s Cultural landmark in 1985. The set of churches forms one part of the six sections of Terrassa Museum.

He was undefeated in three races as a two-year-old in 1972, including the Dewhurst Stakes and was regarded as a major contender for the British Classic Races. He failed to win in three starts in the following year and was retired to become a breeding stallion in Australia. He had some success as a sire of winners. Background Lunchtime was a \\"tall, strong\\" chestnut horse with a white star and a white socks on his hind feet, bred in the United Kingdom. He was sired by Silly Season, a top-class American-bred horse who won the Champion Stakes in 1965. Lunchtime was the first foal of his dam Great Occasion, a moderate racehorse who won one minor race from five starts. She was descended from a relatively obscure branch of Thoroughbred family 7-f which also produced the Coronation Stakes winner Katies and Minnesota Mac who sired Mac Diarmida. During his racing career, Lunchtime was owned by Colonel R D Poole and was trained at Seven Barrows near Lambourn in Berkshire by Peter Walwyn. Racing career =1972: two-year-old season= On his first racecourse appearance Lunchtime started the 11/10 favourite for the Goldings Maiden Stakes, for previously unraced horses over six furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse in September. He never looked in any danger of defeat, took the lead two furlongs out and won very easily. On his next appearance he ran in the Clarence House Stakes over the same distance at Ascot Racecourse in which he was opposed by the National Stakes winner Hunter's Path. He drew away from his rivals in the final furlong to win by four lengths, with Timeform commenting that the winning margin \\"could easily have been doubled\\". Lunchtime ended his season with a run in Britain's most prestigious two-year-old race, the Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in October. Ridden by Pat Eddery he started 11/8 favourite in what appeared to be a sub-standard field. He took the lead a furlong and a half from the finish and won by two and a half lengths from Draw The Line, with Hubris taking third ahead of Father Christmas. Lunchtime entered the winter of 1972 as the ante-post favourite for both the 2000 Guineas and The Derby. =1973: three-year-old season= On his first run as a three-your-old, Lunchtime started odd-on favourite for the Greenham Stakes (a trial race for the 2000 Guineas) over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse in April. In a major upset, he sustained his first defeat as he was beaten a length into second place by the 16/1 outsider Boldboy with Mon Fils in third place. On 5 May, Lunchtime contested the 175th running of the 2000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile course and finished unplaced behind Mon Fils. He was stepped up in distance for the Predominate Stakes over one and a half miles at Goodwood later in May and was equipped with blinkers for the first time. He finished fourth of the nine runners behind Buoy. Plans to run the colt in The Derby were abandoned and he was retired from racing. Assessment In the 1972 Free Handicap, a ranking of the best two-year-olds to race in Britain, Lunchtime was assigned a weight of 128 pounds, placing him joint-fourth behind the filly Jacinth and the colts Noble Decree and Ksar. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 123, ten pounds behind Jacinth and seven pounds behind the French colts Targowice and Simbir. Walwyn believed that Lunchtime was the best two-year-old he had ever trained. In the following year Timeform gave him a rating of 112 and commented that he was \\"a good horse at his best, but never the top-class one his reputation had him to be\\". Stud record At the end of his racing career, Lunchtime was exported to become a breeding stallion in Australia. His offspring included Snippets who won the AJC Sires Produce Stakes, Oakleigh Plate and The Galaxy before becoming a very successful sire. Lunchtime died in Australia on 11 October 1991.

Organe des Comit√©s r√©publicains du canton de Sceaux et de Villejuif and was mayor of Malakoff from 1893 to 1896.  ¬´ Le Trousset ¬ª  His most famous work is the Nouveau dictionnaire encyclop√©dique universel illustr√©, or R√©pertoire des connaissances humaines, nicknamed \\"le Trousset\\", published in Paris between 1885 and 1891, adorned with more than 3,000 engravings. This work, which paid tribute to Pierre Larousse with whom he worked, tried to complete all knowledge. Trousset joined hundreds of foreign correspondents to his company. He sold the book by subscription, the buyers paying when all volumes had been received. Success was at the rendezvous.  Works  * Le livre universel : r√©pertoire des connaissances utiles.

The comedy of intrigue, also known as the comedy of situation, is a genre of comedy in which dramatic action is prioritised over the development of character, complicated strategems and conspiracies drive the plot, and farcical humour and contrived or ridiculous dramatic situations are often employed.Merriam-Webster (1995, 261) and Pavis (1998, 65). Characterisation tends to be defined only vaguely and the plot gives the illusion of dynamic, constant movement.Pavis (1998, 65). The German philosopher Hegel argued that characters pursue their aims in such comedies via the use of deception.Paolucci (1978, 101). The genre was first developed in the theatre of classical Rome by Plautus and Terence.Law (2011, 120). Examples of comedies of intrigue include Niccol√≤ Machiavelli's The Mandrake (1524), the anonymous Italian play The Deceived Ones (1531), Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice (c. 1596) and \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\", Thomas Heywood's The Wise Woman of Hoxton (c. 1604), Moli√®re's Scapin the Schemer (1671), and the plays of Aphra Behn and Thomas D'Urfey.Cohn (1998, 234), Hochman (1984, 251), and Pavis (1998, 65).

The Seven Heavenly Virtues, also known as , is a Japanese anime television series animated by Bridge that aired from January 26 to March 30, 2018. It is an adaptation of Hobby Japan's media franchise , which primarily consists of a series of fantasy figures. Plot Lucifer, one of God's archangels, is denounced for rebelling against the Almighty's will and cast out of Heaven. She is forced into a brief stopover by crashing into a high school's church, where a young girl, Maria Totsuka, witnesses her arrival. After Lucifer has infused the girl with a part of her angel's blood, she continues her fall into the depths of Hell, where she is met by Leviathan, the aspiring minor Demon Lord of Envy. Soon after, Lucifer is challenged by the Seven Sins, the ruling Demon Lords of Hell, led by Belial. Bundling their powers, the Seven Sins overcome Lucifer and seal away her angelic powers by fitting her with a cursed Garb of Punishment, thereby turning her into a Demon Lord. Swearing revenge on her defeaters, Lucifer returns with Leviathan to Earth, where she turns Maria into her immortal slave. With her two sidekicks in tow, Lucifer sets out to defeat the Seven Sins one at a time in order to sunder their powers imbuing her Garb. Characters =Main characters= ; : :Formerly the first of the Archangels of Heaven and the former leader of the Seven Heavenly Virtues, she was denounced and cast out of Heaven for her rebellion against the will of God, who seeks the destruction of both mankind and Hell for their inherent (but inevitable) corruption. After battling the Seven Mortal Sins for the first time, she is cursed by Belial with the Garb of Punishment, a barbed tattoo- like body-chain empowered by the Seven Sins which inhibits her angelic powers and torments her with constant pain and blood-letting. But while Lucifer's immense pride was the cause for her fall from Heaven, it also proves to be her strongest weapon against both the predations of the Seven Sins and the power of God. ; : :A shy, soft-spoken teenage human girl who has worshipped Lucifer all her life when she was still an angel. She initially encounters Lucifer during a brief stopover in the middle of her descent to Hell. Maria becomes Lucifer's servant when Lucifer rips out her heart, granting her immortality and eternal youth; and though initially unwilling, Maria becomes gradually quite taken with her new mistress. In the final episode, it is revealed that Lucifer has been aware of Maria's dedication to her, which is the primary reason why Lucifer rebelled against God's decision to destroy humanity and why they were destined to meet in the first place. ; : :The aspiring Demon Lord of Envy, she becomes instantly infatuated with Lucifer upon the latter's arrival in Hell and makes herself into the fallen angel's sidekick. She is therefore continuously jealous of Maria because she receives the better part of Lucifer's attention, though the two are quite capable of working together if it serves Lucifer's interests. She has the ability to control water and water creatures. =Supporting characters= ; : :The Demon Lord of Vanity, and the ruler of the Seven Mortal Sins until Lucifer's arrival. Her most distinguishing feature are her heterochromatic eyes, of which the left one is ruby red while the right one sports a golden iris. She was once part of the Byrndale family, a once prestigious clan, which Belial wished to return to its former glory, and also an angel herself under the name before she attempted to gather more followers for God by appearing before the humans and thereby proving God's existence to them. However, her presumptuous attempt backfired when the humans instead allowed themselves to fall to the Seven Sins, and for this blunder she was sentenced and banished to Hell. Ultimately, she attempts to betray Hell and her subordinate Sins in order to be reinstated as an angel. ; : :Representing Wrath, Satan is a fiery, red-headed Demon Lord whose main task is to judge the souls of the dead at the threshold of the Gates to Hell, and sentence the deserving to eternal damnation. While she has a hair-trigger temper, she also has a sense of honor and a love for cute and innocent things; for this reason she is especially fond of Beelzebub. She uses an ax in combat and has armies from all over the world serving as her followers. ; : :As the representation of Sloth, Belphegor is the laziest and most easy-going of the Mortal Sins, sporting cat-like features like white hair and a claw-equipped tail (which she often uses as a third hand since she's usually too lazy to move her arms), as well as two tiger-striped antelope-type horns. Her favorite hobbies are surfing, engaging in games inside the Internet and exchanging messages with Astaroth, with whom she is good friends because of their very similar moods. She uses a morning star when engaging in hand-to-hand combat, and gains followers by running a popular MMORPG. ; : :The Demon Lord of Greed who attempts to employ every opportunity to make a winning, specializing in real estates and the sale of home-brewed magical potions. Her greed is partially founded by the actions of her unnamed husband, who saddled her with 500,000 children and a load of debts on her shoulders. Mammon's weapons of choice are bottles of dangerous chemicals. Her base of operations is in London. ; : :Despite her slight figure, she is the most voracious of the Seven Sins, as well as perhaps the friendliest of them. She is physically distinguished by one single horn, similar to an alicorn, growing from the center of her forehead. Her motive for becoming a glutton was not out of pure self-indulgence, but to find a way of achieving happiness through eating and sharing that discovery with others. She attracts followers by sponsoring large feasts for the most hedonistic eaters. Her base of operations is in Paris. ; : :As the representative of Lust, she is the most lecherous of the Seven Sins. She takes up residence in Miami and works around the clock to attract followers, hosting orgies at the beach during the day and pole dancing for her nightclub attendees at night. Owing to her lascivious nature, she is equally attracted to both women and men. ; : :The Demon King of Melancholy, who spends most of her time as a very popular musician in Earth's virtual world. Though quite the braggart under this pretense, she is very sociophobic and tends to easily lose her nerve, and therefore uses her music to communicate her emotions. ; : :Maria's playful, flirtatious schoolmate and best friend. She does not share Maria's talent and therefore does not believe in the existence of angels and demons. ; :Leviathan's sidekick monster, who appears (and commonly disguises itself) as a stuffed toy with bat wings and a gas mask. =The Seven Heavenly Virtues= ; : :The Archangel responsible for denouncing Lucifer before God and then casting her to Hell, and therefore the new leader of the Seven Heavenly Virtues. She struck a deal with Belial, demanding the release of all souls tormented in Hell in exchange for delivering Lucifer for eternal torment, but betrays the Demon Lord of Vanity in the end because her unswerving loyalty belongs to God. Despite this, she retains feelings for Lucifer, but ends up becoming her mortal enemy. :In the Seven Heavenly Virtues spin-off, Michael chooses a random human as her candidate human and trains him like a soldier to fight the demons himself. Even so, Michael develops a fondness for her human when he cooks omelettes, her favorite meal, for her. ; : :Heaven's intelligence officer. After choosing an office worker as her Messiah candidate, Uriel begins stalking him 24/7, which eventually gets him fired. Then, she decides she has fallen in love with him and moves in with him. ; : :A mother-type figure who uses every tool in her arsenal - particularly her massive breasts - to comfort others. When comforting her Messiah candidate, her sadistic tendencies emerge. Whenever Sariel sneezes, she inadvertently releases her destructive power and can level several buildings. ; : : A hard-working inventor and Metatron's sister. Sandalphon chooses a student as her candidate and tries to help him study for a test using her inventions. She is also friends with Belphegor, the Demon Lord that embodies the Sin opposite to Sandalphon's Virtue. ; : : A clumsy nurse and Sandalphon's sister. Metatron chooses a young man in the hospital as her candidate and tries to nurse him back to health. Though timid on the surface, she is more than willing to use her body to service others, but turns into a sexual sadist whenever she touches a needle. ; : : A fan of the gyaru culture and sugary foods. Raphael befriends a pastry student and helps him sell his goods in the street. Coming to the conclusion that being the Messiah will prevent the human from achieving his dream of becoming a master pastry chef, Raphael erases the young man's memories of her. ; : : Head of the Angelic Morals Committee. Gabriel zealously tries to get rid of all immorality, going so far as to yell at random couples in the street. She moves in with her candidate in order keep him from doing anything she deems immoral.

It originated in the West of England in the counties of Herefordshire and Gloucestershire. Description Hogg described the apple as medium-sized, oval, with a distinctive fleshy, curved stalk of about three-quarters of an inch in length: the skin was yellow with a soft red flush, deeper on the sunward side.Hogg, R. The Apple and its varieties, p.210 The tree itself was large and vigorous, forming large branches in the manner of a pear tree.Marshall, W. The rural economy of Gloucestershire, v2, 1789, p. 255 The varieties' name was popularly supposed to refer to the stalk's resemblance to the head of a woodcock; but Thomas Andrew Knight, who described and illustrated the apple in his Pomona Herefordiensis, surmised that its name was originally that of the person who first raised the variety. In Welsh the Woodcock was known as afal coes y dryw or afal coeshir y gwin, both names referring to the fruit's distinctive stem.Pughe, A dictionary of the Welsh language, 1866, p.45 History The Woodcock was noted by writers as far back as the 17th century, making it one of the earliest described varieties. John Evelyn described it as one of the principal \\"Gloucestershire cider-fruit\\" in his work Sylva.Evelyn, Sylva, 1670, p.64 John Philips, in Book 2 of his poem Cyder (1708), described how juice of the Woodcock was blended with that of other apples to create \\"a pleasurable Medly\\".

It was the first feature directed by the TV veteran filmmaker George Schaefer. Plot In Washington, D.C., police captain Frank Matthews's career is on the rise, having just been appointed consultant for a powerful U.S. senator. His domestic life, however, is questionable. He suspects his wife of having an affair with an old flame. One evening, after appearing at a political function in Baltimore, Matthews decides not to return home until the following morning. The next day, he is informed by authorities that his wife has been discovered shot to death while in bed with her lover, who was also killed. Soon, Matthews is made aware that his own colleagues, the police, have made him the prime suspect in the case. Pendulum also features a side-plot involving a death-row inmate, Paul Sanderson, convicted of rape and murder, who is set free due to a legal technicality. Sanderson had been originally tracked down and arrested by Matthews, who views these circumstances as a grave injustice. Ironically, now that Captain Matthews is a suspected murderer, he hires Sanderson's lawyer, Woodrow Wilson King, to represent him. For the remainder of the feature, these two storylines intersect until the film reaches its violent conclusion.

It was first recorded by Shirley Bassey backed with a 54 piece orchestra, produced by de Paul and released as a single in 1986. It was her last single for the independent British record label Towerbell Records and, unusually, the song starts with the chorus rather than a verse. As well as a stand-alone single in its own right, the song was recorded to promote the London Tourist Board. A promotional video was made that featured Bassey's daughter Sharon and grandson Luke as well as de Paul and it was premiered at the Royal Albert Hall, with songwriter de Paul in the audience. Bassey performed \\"There's No Place Like London\\" in 1986 as part of her ‚ÄúLive from the Piccadilly‚Äù show as well as on the 1987 Royal Variety Performance,Diamonds Are Forever - Shirley Bassey: A Celebration of My 50 Years as Her Greatest Fan by Mary Long () and ironically for her \\"Shirley Bassey Live\\" in Berlin in honour of 750 years of Berlin in 1987. It is considered as one of Bassey's defining, signature songs and is listed as part of her essential repertoire alongside other Bassey classics. It was released for the first time on CD to tie-in with the UK held Olympic Games in 2012 on the Warner/Chappell album, Olympic Tracks. It is listed in the BBC music database which catalogues songs they play. Speaking about the recording of the song in an interview, de Paul said \\"we wrote..\\"There's No Place Like London\\", and the Tourist Board liked it, and then we thought of an artist and I thought of Shirley Bassey. So I approached her and asked her to sing it and she really liked the song - that's the way round it came, it didn't come that I wrote for her I just had the song and said would you sing it. And she was great.\\" It is still one of the most played Bassey songs on BBC radio and is listed on their Bassey website. Two different live Bassey performances of the song appear on the Odeon Entertainment DVD, Shirley Bassey On TV, released in 2010. De Paul recorded a version of the song with a whole host of celebrity friends to celebrate Capital Radio's twentieth anniversary in 1993 under the name 'Lynsey and friends', which was produced by de Paul and released as a single in the UK. It was the winning record for the LBC London Parade, and went on sale to raise money for the Variety Club of Great Britain. According to the CD sleeve, the friends included Frankie Vaughan, Patti Boulaye, Gareth Hunt, Kenny Lynch, Rula Lenska, Gwen Taylor, Lionel Blair, Lorraine Chase, Pam St. Clement, Harry Fowler, Polly James, Larry Adler, Rose Marie, Victor Spinetti, Gorden Kaye and the St Joan of Arc School Choir. It was covered and released by drag queen diva La Voix (real name Chris Dennis), star and semi- finalist of Britain's Got Talent and Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie, as a track on the 2018 album, Hello.https://www.whosampled.com/La-Voix-(Singer)/No- Place-Like-London-Town/ Drag Queen Tiffaney Wells also has covered the song.https://www.qxmagazine.com/bar-event/tiffany-wells-double-bill/ \\"There's No Place Like London\\" has also been recorded as an instrumental version by the Tony Evans Orchestra on his album of the same name, as well as by the artist Ameritz. Being in the style of a slow fox-trot, it has become a ballroom dancing standard. The song was also performed by \\"Hills Angels\\" as part of a musical sketch in episode No. 2 of the 18th season of the Benny Hill Show in 1988 and released internationally on DVD in 2011. The lyrics sing the praises of London, England, the birthplace of de Paul as well as the adopted home of Gerard Kenny, and featured the lyrics \\"Take Paris in the spring, take New York in the fall, but I'd leave them behind, for the best of them all\\". In 2012, Gerard Kenny was interviewed by Radio Warwickshire about writing this and other songs. In the interview he revealed how he and de Paul wrote the song and how proud he was to hear Bassey sing it at the Royal Variety Performance in front of Queen Elizabeth II, who clearly liked it and was part of the spontaneous standing ovation that Bassey received. A show entitled No Place Like London after the song \\"There's No Place Like London\\", featuring singers Brunie Riley and Milko Foucault-Larche singing the songs of Shirley Bassey and Engelbert Humperdinck, is currently on tour with dates in Australia. The song is mentioned an article entitled \\"Iconic Landscapes: The Lyrical Links of Songs and Cities\\" that appeared in the academic publication in the journal Focus on Geography, a peer-reviewed, full-color quarterly journal with numerous articles written by well-known academic and professional geographers.

It was originally ordered by JSAT Corporation, which later merged into the SKY Perfect JSAT Group. It has a mixed Ku band and C band payload and operated on the 128¬∞E longitude until it was replaced by JCSAT-3A. Satellite description The spacecraft was designed and manufactured by Hughes on the HS-601 satellite bus. It had a launch mass of , a dry mass of and a 12-year design life. When stowed for launch, its dimensions were . With its solar panels fully extended it spanned , and its width when its antennas were fully deployed was . Its power system generated approximately 5 kW of power thanks to two wings with four solar panels each. It also had a single NiH2 battery composed of 30 cells and a 200Ah charge. It would serve as the main satellite on the 128¬∞E longitude position of the JSAT fleet. Its propulsion system was composed of an R-4D-11-300 LAE with a thrust of . It also used had 12 bipropellant thrusters for station keeping and attitude control. It included enough propellant for orbit circularization and 12 years of operation. Its payload is composed of four octagonal antenna fed by twelve 36 MHz and sixteen 27 MHz Ku band plus twelve 27 MHz C band transponders for a total bandwidth of 1,296 MHz. The Ku band transponders have a TWTA output power of 63 Watts while the twelve C band transponders have 34 Watts of power. History On 1993, Japan Communications Satellite Company and Satellite Japan Corporation merged to form Japan Satellite Systems Inc. (JCSAT). That same year, JCSAT ordered JCSAT-3, a third satellite from Hughes, but this time using the HS-601 platform. In 1995, JCSAT obtained a license for international service, and thus became a regional operator. On August 29 at 00:53:00 UTC, an Atlas IIAS launching from Cape Canaveral LC-36B successfully launched JCSAT-3 into orbit. It was positioned into the 128¬∞ East slot. On April 20, 2004, JSAT ordered a second satellite from Lockheed, JCSAT-10. Based on the A2100AX platform, it would have a C band and Ku band payload and was expected to replace JCSAT-3 at the 128¬∞East slot after its planned 2006 launch. On October 11, an Ariane 5 ECA launched JCSAT-10 along Syracuse-3B into a transfer orbit. Upon successful deployment at 128¬∞East longitude, it was renamed JCSAT-3A. On March 2007, JCSAT-3 was retired and decommissioned.

He performances using new technology such as projection mapping, Kinect, motion capture and robotics and programming which he invented himself. He integrates dances, sounds and images into the performance, highlighting boundaries between human and machine, reality and virtual. He was also a researcher and invited composer at IRCAM. He is currently assistant professor at Tokyo University of the Arts}.  Biography  After he studied composition and piano in Japan, he moved to the United States to continue his studies at New England Conservatory in Boston. He preceded his post-graduate studies at Technical University Berlin and HDK in Berlin, Germany. Under Dieter Schnebel, professor of experimental music, Suguru Goto started his practices in mixing various representations : sound, dance and image. After having pursued his research in IRCAM and Paris University in France, he has been living in Paris for more than 20 years. In 2009, Suguru Goto was invited to Venice Biennale and His work \\"RoboticMusic\\" was played there.[1] In 2016, his first book ‚ÄúEmprise[2]‚Äù was published in Tokyo. Suguru Goto explains the history and development of computer and electronic music in pursuing movements, since Romantic music. At the same year, his CD ‚ÄúCsO‚Äù was published from Athor Harmonics, in Tokyo. To celebrate these publications, Suguru Goto cooperated with three artists; Antoine Schmitt, Lucio Arese and Patrick Defasten to the performance, using sounds of \\"CsO\\". This performance was played in March 2016 in Tokyo. He studied composition with Lukas Foss and Earl Brown in U.S.A, and with Robert Cogan at New England Conservatory and Dieter Schnebel in Berlin, Tristan Murail and Philippe Manour at IRCAM, Paris.  Selected works  * SuperPolmÔºöThis is Virtual Musical Instrument. Instead of string, it comes with sensors and eight-button keyboard which can change the sound and the pitch. * RoboticMusic : This performance involves 5 robots musicians. These robots are able to exceed the physical limits of humain being, e.g. being able to play at a first tempo that can not be marched as well as being able to playing very complex pieces. * CsOÔºöCsO means \\"One composes a body without organs\\" and is related to the project \\"artificial body and real body\\". It's a visual and sound montage which includes the textes of Mille Plateaux of Deleuze and Guattari and the radio piece of Antonin Artaud : Pour en finir avec le jugement de Dieu.The video image shows real and 3D virtual bodies but the body of the performer is present and can transform its images in real time. * Augmented Body and Virtual BodyÔºöThe performance involves robots which play musical instruments, in this the danser will where the robotic suit which will control the robots music performance though the dances mouvements. * netBody * L'homme transcende * Cymatics * DualiÔºöUsing the controllers of gestures, Wifi and programming which make sounds in real time, this performance is made up of images, dance and music.

Design and development The Eden was designed as an intermediate cross country glider. The design has progressed through six generations of models, the Eden, Eden 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, each improving on the last. The models are each named for their approximate wing area in square metres. The manufacturer claims a glide ratio of over 10:1 for the Eden 6. Operational history Reviewer Ziad Bassil described the Eden 6 in a review, \\"the Eden 6 is a new breed of Mac Para gliders. There‚Äôs something different in the making. The glide angle is the best you can get. The climb rate is very good! The handling is pleasurable. The Eden 6 is fast! For sure, it‚Äôs a small step over the Eden 5 in piloting but ok for an experienced B pilot looking inside the high B category!\\". J√ºrgen Karthe reviewing the Eden 6 concluded, \\"The Eden 6 is a great wing, giving enormous pleasure. Its the \\"Bird of Paradise\\" in 6th generation. A switch from Eden 5 to 6 should differ only in the higher performance of the new sail. The new Mac Para Eden 6 has an overall balanced and manageable basic characteristic and provides a great, safe feeling in the flight (fly in peace). Even in turbulent conditions, the wing retains largely stoic and does not detract from the good feeling of flight. The glide of the Eden 6 is at the top of the current B segment. The manufacturer claims a glide ratio of 10+. This seems to be no dreamy optimism, but is according to our experience, corresponding to the reality.\\" Variants =Eden 2= ;Eden 2 23 :Extra small-sized model for very light pilots.

His most famous work is as a co-author of the screenplay for the MGM's film Operation Crossbow. Life Dermot Edward Quinn made his first film at the age of sixteen, and at seventeen directed and photographed a documentary film about bottling whisky. A year later he went to Munich to take a course at a photographic school. During World War II he was commissioned to carry out specialised photographic work for the intelligence services in the Middle East. After the War Quinn worked for a short time in his family business while writing film stories on the side. His work attracted the attention of the Rank Organisation in 1949, when he left the family firm to become a full-time scriptwriter. After a year with Rank he joined the Douglas Fairbanks Company, where he became assistant story editor and later story editor helping to turn some eighty television films as well. He also worked for the British Picture Corporation and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, for whom he co- scripted the spy thriller Operation Crossbow together with Emeric Pressburger and Ray Rigby, and scripted several documentaries. In 1973, Quinn partially quit screenwriting and moved to the South of France with his wife and son to pursue a career as a novelist. In the following years he published three thrillers. Despite lukewarm reviews, the first and the last were dramatised as part of Thames Television's suspense series Armchair Thriller, in 1978 and 1980 respectively.

Prior to his current position, he was a deputy commander in the Sukhumi battalion and an advisor to the President of Abkhazia. Early life  Beslan was born on 23 December 1967. In 1985 he graduated from the Sukhumi High School. From 1986 to 1988, Eshba served in the armed forces of the USSR. He graduated from the State Institute of Agriculture () in 1992 with a specialty in engineering and technology. Eshba is married with two children.  Career  During the War in Abkhazia (1992‚Äì1993), Eshba was a member of the guard service of the supreme organs of the state authority of Abkhazia and its officials. In post-war campaigns, he held the post of deputy commander in the Sukhumi battalion. He was the deputy commander of the 4th Sukhumi Brigade in the Kodori operation of 2008. President of Abkhazia Vladislav Ardzinba assigned Eshba to head the Renaissance Foundation of Abkhazia in Moscow from 1994 to 1995. His mission was to supply humanitarian aid to the republic. Eshba headed the state company Abkhaztop from 1998 to 2005, then served as Chairman of the Board of the Universal Bank from 2007 to 2010. Since 2008, Eshba has served as a member of the board of directors of ZAO Aquafon-GSM. Since 12 February 2018, he has been the head of the sociopolitical organization Apsadgyl.  Political career  Eshba advised the president of Abkhazia on economic issues from February 1996 to February 1999. From August 2010 to September 2011, Eshba was the assistant to the head of the government of the Republic of Abkhazia. He then served as Deputy of the People's Assembly in the Parliament of the Republic of Abkhazia. Beslan Eshba was elected to the People's Assembly of Abkhazia in the 2012 elections. Eshba had not originally run in the election but stood as a candidate in the rerun election of constituency number one. The rerun was necessitated after the original election was declared invalid because the turnout had failed to surpass the threshold of 25 percent. He defeated four candidates to win the first round with 56.61 percent of the vote (1,932 out of 3,413 votes). On 30 April 2013, President Alexander Ankvab appointed Eshba Vice Premier. Following the May 2014 revolution against Ankvab, Eshba resigned on 3 June 2014. Acting President Valeri Bganba accepted his resignation that same day. On 16 June 2014, an initiative group promoted Eshba for president campaign. He was denied registration on 15 July 2014, because, according to the linguistic commission, he was not sufficiently fluent in the official state language. Abkhazian law requires that presidential candidates be tested for proficiency in the state language. Eshba was elected as the Chairman of Apsadgyl () on 16 August 2015, following its transformation into a sociopolitical organization. On 12 August 2016, Eshba was once again appointed to the post of Vice Premier after the number of vice premiers in the Government of President Khajimba was increased from one to three. Due to his appointment, Apsadgyl's executive committee replaced him with former Culture Minister Nugzar Logua on 6 October 6, 2016.

The Oklahoma Historical Society used her photos of the Murrell Home to restore that building, which is now a museum. Trained as a teacher, Cobb worked as a florist in Texas before returning to Oklahoma to spearhead the restoration of the Murrell Home. Early life Jennie Fields Ross was born on December 26, 1881 in Tahlequah, Cherokee Nation, Indian Territory to Fannie D. (n√©e Thornton) and Robert Bruce Ross. She was named after her father's mother, Jennie Fields and was a great- granddaughter of Cherokee Chief John Ross. Her father was treasurer of the Cherokee National Council and served in other tribal administration capacities, as well as farming on the Ross homestead near Park Hill. During her teenage years, Ross spent much time among the various Ross relatives in Park Hill. The family lived in the \\"Hunter's Home,\\" now known as the Murrell Home, and Jennie, an amateur photographer, took photographs of the house, surrounding areas and her school mates. She began taking pictures around 1896 and continued until around 1903, developing her photographs in a closet at the Murrell Home. The images \\"defied the stereotypical photographic views\\" of Native Americans at the time, showing that the Cherokee were educated, fashionable, and proud of their culture. Ross attended school at the Cherokee Female Seminary, which had been rebuilt in 1889 and may have graduated in 1900 or 1902. Career Cherokee Female Seminary students stroll along boardwalk that led from school into Tahlequah, photograph by Jennie Ross Cobb, ca. 1902, collection of the Oklahoma Historical Society After completing her own studies, Ross became a teacher at the Cherokee school in Paw Paw. She married Jesse Clifton \\"J. C.\\" Cobb in 1905 and they subsequently had one child, a daughter named Jenevieve in 1906. In 1928, the family moved to Arlington, Texas and by the early 1930s, Cobb was running a floral shop business called the Flower Market. J.C. was an engineer in the oil business. After his death in 1940, she and Jenevieve worked together in the florist shop. Cobb was involved with the rose garden in Arlington's Meadowbrook Park. She and Jenevieve worked with the Arlington Garden Club to help them win an award from Woman's Home Companion in a contest. Jenevieve died on August 8, 1945 in Arlington and Cobb took her two grandchildren, Jennifer and Cliff Biggers, to raise. In 1952, Cobb left Arlington and returned to Oklahoma to help restore the Murrell Home. Armed with her photographs from the turn of the century and her memories, Cobb assisted restoration experts to creating a more accurate version of the home. Pilings which indicated a wrap-around porch had once been there were shown to be a later addition and not restored. She supervised gathering furnishings and artifacts from Ross family members and other Cherokee families, overseeing the opening of the museum. Death and legacy Cobb died from a heart attack on January 19, 1959 at a hospital in Tahlequah and was buried beside her husband and daughter at Rose Hill Cemetery in Arlington, Texas. Cobb is often credited with being the first, first woman, or one of the first, Native American photographers in the United States. The Oklahoma Historical Society maintains the Jennie Ross Cobb Collection of photographs, which has toured in several exhibitions through the years, such as the 1995 Photographers in Petticoats: Oklahoma Territories 1890-1907 exhibition at the Pioneer Woman Museum in Ponca City and a traveling exhibition called Our People, Our Land, Our Images: International Indigenous Photography, curated by Hulleah J.

It is located on the eastern boundaries of the borough near lake Au√üenalster. Geography Harvestehude borders the quarters of Rotherbaum, Eimsb√ºttel, and Hoheluft-West, all within the Eimsb√ºttel borough, as well as Hoheluft-Ost, Eppendorf, and Winterhude in the neighbouring Hamburg-Nord borough. Harvestehude is located on a Geest ridge west of the Au√üenalster. To the north the canal of Isebekkanal separates Harvestehude of Hoheluft-Ost and Eppendorf. History The name is derived from the former name of the local St. John's Monastery, Herwardeshude, which had been located in Altona near today's street and small stream of Peperm√∂lenbek at least since 1246. Herward was a common name in the 12th and 13th century, so it is assumed that the name means a stockyard near a ferry dock (Hude), which was founded by a man called Herward. Later, in 1295, the monastery moved to today's Harvestehude area, transferring the monastery's name to the new area. Hamburg history writer Otto Beneke noticed that the place was also called Herbstehude by some, which was according to him indeed correct, because Herbst (autumn) translates to Harvest in Low German.Otto Beneke: Das alte Harvestehude. In: Hamburgische Geschichten und Sagen, Hamburg 1886, p. 27 In 1530, the monastery was demolished, and the area came under municipal administration. Other than the name suggests, the church of St. John's Harvestehude, which was built 1880-82, is today located in the neighbouring Rotherbaum quarter.

Its units fought at Gallipoli and in Palestine during World War I, and in Normandy and North West Europe during World War II. It continued in the postwar Territorial Army until 1961. Artillery Volunteers 1859-1908 The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle, Artillery and Engineer Volunteer Corps composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Spiers, pp. 163‚Äì8. A number of Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVCs) were raised in Glasgow and its suburbs in Lanarkshire. The 1st Administrative Brigade Lanarkshire Artillery Volunteers was formed, with headquarters at Glasgow, on 6 March 1860, comprising the following AVCs of one battery each: Becket, Appendix VIII.Grierson, pp. 143‚Äì5.Litchfield & Westlake, p. 105.Army List, various dates. * 1st Corps accepted for service on 30 December 1859 * 2nd Corps accepted for service on 30 December 1859 * 3rd Corps accepted for service on 30 December 1859 * 4th Corps (1st Northern) accepted for service on 6 December 1859 * 5th Corps (2nd Northern) accepted for service on 27 December 1859 * 6th Corps (3rd Northern) accepted for service on 27 December 1859 * 7th Corps (1st Eastern, Gallowgate) accepted for service on 10 January 1860 * 8th Corps (Ironmongers) accepted for service on 10 January 1860 * 9th Corps (2nd Eastern) accepted for service on 30 January 1860 * 10th Corps (Calton Artisans) accepted for service on 16 February 1860 * 11th Corps (Maryhill Artisans) accepted for service on 5 March 1860 * 12th Corps (Western) accepted for service on 12 May 1860 * 13th Corps (Hillhead and Dowanhill) accepted for service on 24 July 1860 * 14th Corps accepted for service on 26 July 1860 * 15th Corps (Partick), accepted for service on 2 November 1860 The 4th, 5th, 6th, 10th, and 11th were artisan corps, the men of which paid 2s. 6d. entry money, and 30s. for their uniforms, the remaining expenses being met by outside subscriptions, and the first four being assisted from the Glasgow Central Fund. The 1st Corps was formed, it is said, at the suggestion of Prince Albert, made at the opening of the Loch Katrine waterworks on 14 October 1859, that Glasgow should form some artillery. Mr John Wilkie, a leading lawyer of the city, took the matter in hand, and so many members joined the corps that from the outset three batteries could be formed, which were numbered the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. These were entirely self- supporting, the honorary members paying ¬£5 each, on enrolment, to the funds, and the effective members subscribing 10s. each annually and buying their own uniform and belts at a cost of ¬£4 a-head. The remaining corps were raised on similar principles. In 1862, the brigade was consolidated as the 1st Lanarkshire Artillery Volunteers of fifteen batteries, which retained their former numbers. The 1st Lanarkshire had a number of different buildings in various Glasgow locations, including 260 St. Vincent Street in the 1870s, and 98 Sauchiehall Street in the 1890s. By the early 20th Century the unit possessed an orderly-room, officers' and serjeants' club, and headquarters (HQ) at 8 Newton Terrace, Sauchiehall Street. The corps had five separate drill halls in different parts of the city, each with harness rooms, gun-sheds etc. for two batteries. The Maryhill drill hall accommodated all the ammunition waggons when not in use in the batteries.Osborne, pp. 278-9. For over 30 years, the corps carried out its annual practice at Irvine, from Bogside Camp, and as a rifle-range it used that at Darnley belonging to the 1st and 3rd Lanark Volunteer Rifle Corps. =Royal Garrison Artillery= In 1882 all the AVCs were affiliated to one of the territorial garrison divisions of the Royal Artillery (RA) and the 1st Lanarkshire AVC became part of the Scottish Division. In 1889 the structure was altered, and the corps joined the Southern Division. In 1899 the RA was divided into separate field and garrison branches, and the artillery volunteers were all assigned to the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA). In 1902 their titles were changed, the unit becoming the 1st Lanarkshire Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers). In 1900, the whole corps volunteered its services for South Africa. This was not accepted, as Artillery units weren't required. However, 62 members of the corps, including Lieut. J. C. Clark, served in various capacities in South Africa during the war. 16-Pounder RML gun manned by Artillery Volunteers. =Position artillery= The AVCs were intended to serve as garrison artillery manning fixed defences, but a number of the early units manned semi-mobile 'position batteries' of smooth-bore field guns pulled by agricultural horses. Up to 1865, the only guns on which the Lanarkshire batteries were drilled were 32-pounder smoothbores, but on 13 December of that year, a sixteenth battery was raised and equipped as a field battery with four 6-pounder smoothbore field-guns. (The 17th Battery was formed as a garrison company in 1868.) At that time the position batteries were not officially supported by the War Office (WO).Beckett, pp. 178‚Äì9.Litchfield and Westlake, pp. 3‚Äì6. In 1876, the 1st Corps won the Queen's Prize at the annual National Artillery Association competition held at Shoeburyness.Litchfield & Westlake, p. 189. The 'position artillery' concept was revived in 1888 when some Volunteer position batteries were reorganised to work alongside the Volunteer infantry brigades. The 1st Lanarkshire was nominated to operate two position batteries, each of four 16-Pounder Rifled Muzzle Loading guns and two wagons. The two batteries were manned by the personnel of four garrison batteries (including the former 16th). In 1900, the strength of the corps was increased to twenty batteries. As a result, eight more 16-pounder RML batteries were issued to it, and the whole corps was reorganised into ten position batteries, numbered 1st to 10th. These were divided into five brigades. As the corps was then entirely of position batteries, it was in 1901 styled a \\"position artillery corps\\", and in 1902 \\"heavy artillery\\". However, despite the new issue of equipment, harness was only provided for three batteries, making five in all. It wasn't until 1905 that harness for the remaining five was issued. In November 1905 the Army Council agreed an experiment to convert some RGA Volunteers to a field artillery role. The 1st Lanarkshire RGA (V) was one of the units chosen to be re-equipped with Ehrhardt quick-firing (QF) guns, but a change in government early the following year put a stop to the experiment. Instead, the new Secretary of State for War, Richard Haldane, embarked on a thorough-going reorganisation of all the Army's auxiliary forces.Beckett, p. 246. In 1907-8, the 16-pounder guns were replaced by 15-pounder Breech Loading guns, which had been converted into quick-firers. The corps was the only one in Scotland composed entirely of heavy batteries. Territorial Force 15-pounder gun, issued to TF field batteries. The Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908Beckett, pp. 247‚Äì53.Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. and the personnel of the 1st Lanarkshire RGA were distributed to two new units of the Royal Field Artillery (RFA):London Gazette 20 March 1908.Litchfield, pp. 287‚Äì9.

World War I =Mobilisation= The Lowland Division had been attending annual camp on the Ayrshire coast when the order to mobilise was received at 17.25 on Tuesday August 1914. Mobilisation began the following day at unit drill halls. On 12 August the division was ordered to concentrate at Bedford and entrainment began on 15 August. Concentration was completed by 17 August and the division formed part of First Army (Home Forces) in Central Force. On the outbreak of war, units of the Territorial Force were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. On 15 August the WO issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. Then on 31 August the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate batteries, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. =1/III Lowland Brigade= 18-pounder field gun preserved at the Imperial War Museum. 1/III Lowland Brigade was re-armed with 18-pounder guns and served with the Lowland Division (52nd (Lowland) Division from May 1915) in Egypt and Palestine.

Interwar years In 1920 the 3rd and 4th Lowland brigades reformed as a single 3rd Lowland Brigade, which was redesignated as the 80th (Lowland) Brigade, RFA, the following year when the TF was reconstituted as the Territorial Army (TA). It became a 'Field Brigade, RA', when the RFA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery in 1924, and its subtitle was changed to 'Lowland ‚Äì City of Glasgow' in 1937.

Once finished, it will connect Greater Kinmen Island and Lieyu Island. History On 28 February 2010, this project of constructing the bridge was approved by Council for Economic Planning and Development of the Republic of China. On 9 January 2011, President Ma Ying-jeou traveled to Kinmen to host the groundbreaking ceremony. The bridge construction commenced in 2013. But, on 29 June 2016, the construction work was suspended when the Government of the Republic of China terminated the contract with Kuo Teng Construction Co., the construction company who had been building the bridge, due to the poor construction management which had caused the project to be seriously behind schedule. During Augusts 2016, the Taiwan Area National Expressway Engineering Bureau invited new contractor companies to complete the remaining project. The bureau announced the tender winner on 31 August 2016. Work resumed on 28 December 2016 and now is expected to be completed by 25 September 2020. However in February 2017, Public Construction Commission Minister Wu Hong-mo had requested the bridge completion date to be moved earlier to the end of 2019. In August 2019, the last pile of the bridge was installed and the bridge is expected to be completed by mid 2021. Architecture The bridge will link Jinning Township on Greater Kinmen Island and Lieyu Township on Lieyu Island. It will span over 5.4 km in length and supported by five towers, each with separation distance of 280 meters. The bridge surface will have a width of 15 meters, which will consist of two lanes for vehicles, one lane for pedestrian and one lane for bicycle. Budget A total of NT$7.39 billion was originally budgeted for the bridge construction, in which NT$3.96 billion came from the central government and NT$3.43 came from Kinmen County Government. After repeated delays, the budget blew out to about NT$9 billion. Performance bond from Kuo Teng Construction Co. was taken to cover the extra cost incurred. However, there is still a shortfall of NT$500 million.

He competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, in the men's beach volleyball tournament.  Career  =Indoor volleyball= Nikia Lyamin started playing volleyball at the Children's and Youth Sports School of Olympic Reserve No. 4 in Nizhny Novgorod, under the guidance of his father Andrey. After finishing the sports school in 2002, Lyamin moved to the local team \\"Dinamo-UVO\\", a club in the highest Russian league. In 2004, he played three season in the farm team and two more seasons in the main team for Dynamo Moscow. Dynamo Moscow became champions at the 2007‚Äì08 Russian Volleyball Super League, but Lyamin due to low game practice quit the club. Lyamin moved to Nizhny Novgorod and became captain of Guberniya, which went on debuting in the B-division of the highest national league. In the two years, Guberniya could enter the Super League, and in the 2012‚Äì13 it became one of the leading clubs in Russia. Guberniya qualified for the CEV Cup, and in March 2014 it became runners-up there. In Guberniya, Lyamin played as middle blocker, whereas in Dynamo he was mainly outside hitter, and sometimes libero. =Beach volleyball= In May 2014, Lyamin discovered beach volleyball and debuted at the national championships. Lyamin with partner Ivan Chirkin, who were both members of the club \\"Kasimov\\", took gold in the regional stage in Moscow and were 9th in the first main stage of the championships in Anapa. Lyamin quickly started playing outside Russia. In early July, he and Ruslan Bykanov won silver at the Eastern European Championship in Roki≈°kis and debuted at the Gstaad Grand Slam in 2014. The Russian duo did not show great results at this and the following two tournaments, so Lyamin teamed up with Dmitry Barsuk. In August, Lyamin left Guberniya and fully concentrated on beach volleyball. His goal was to qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics. The new duo competed on three tournaments, qualifying in Stare Jablonki and S√£o Paulo and winning bronze at the Xiamen Open. In the new 2015 season, Lyamin injured his shoulder and in May underwent surgery, making a break in his career six months long. He revived in December, and with Barsuk became runners-up at the Riga tournament of the Eeast European Championships. Following their successful partnership, Lyamin/Barsuk qualified for the Olympics in Rio-de-Janeiro. The coaching staff of Barsuk and Lyamin supported this decision. In 17 July, the duo took the bronze medal at the Russian Championships in Sochi. At the Olympics, the Russians won two of three matches in their group. They defeated 2015 World Championships bronze medallists, Brazilians Oliveira/Salgado. They lost in the quarterfinals to the Italians Daniele Lupo and Paolo Nicolai in a tight game, 18‚Äì21, 22‚Äì20, 11‚Äì15. After the Olympic Games, Barsuk retired from international career. In 2017, Lyamin's new partner became Viacheslav Krasilnikov, who formerly played with Konstantin Semenov. On 18 February, the new duo won their first joint title, winning at the Kish Island Open. Lyamin and Krasilnikov entered the semifinals of the 2017 Beach Volleyball World Championships, but they lost to Austrians Clemens Doppler and Alexander Horst. They eventually won the bronze medal after winning Christiaan Varenhorst and Maarten van Garderen, from the Netherlands.

He was descendant of Thomas Angell. Emerson learned agriculture and mechanics from his father. He began studying dentistry in 1846 under mentorship of people in the community due to the lack of any formal education available at that time. He eventually practiced in Rhode Island, New York City and San Francisco. Dentistry Emerson first published a paper on expansion of palate in San Francisco Medical Press (SFMP) in January 1960. This initial paper described the expansion of palate with deciduous teeth which was later followed by another paper on the permanent teeth dentition in SFMP. His first paper was a case report which focused on a 14-year-old patient with a posterior Crossbite. Emerson fitted this patient with an appliance in his maxillary arch and gave patients instructions to turn screw everyday. Emerson claimed that expansion was achieved in 2 weeks by separation of maxilla along the Midpalatal suture . Dr. Angell faced much criticism from people in the field of dentistry at that point.

Biography  Having learned the violin at age nine in his hometown, he moved to the capital aged fifteen to join the Conservatoire de Paris. He then continued his training by joining the orchestra of the Op√©ra- comique and followed lessons of musical composition with Leborne Carafa and thanks to a grant from the General Council of the C√¥te d'Or.Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si√®cle by Pierre Larousse volume 6 (1870) page 188. The article of this dictionary gives 1821 as birth date for this musician. He founded a chamber music quartet with violinist Jules Mercier (died 1868) and played his first compositions in Dijon (le Ren√©gat, 1849, le Bandolero,1850, Feu mon oncle, op√©ra bouffe, 1851, le Joujou) before giving his first works in Paris. His many works include C'√©tait moi, operetta in 1860, Astaroth op√©ra comique in 1861, la Vip√©rine operetta in 1866, Napol√©on devant les peuples, cantata in 1867, Grand Duc de Matapa op√©ra bouffe in 1868, le Pantalon de Casimir, one-act operetta in 1873, Le Miroir magique, f√©erie-ballet in 3 acts, in 1876.Documents BNF His works, especially his op√©ras comiques, had some success. Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis said about the premiere of the Grand-duc de Matapa, 16 November 1868 at the Th√©√¢tre des Menus-plaisirs: \\"the music of Mr. Debillemont pleasantly caresses the ear.

The film won National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Gujarati at the 64th National Film Awards. Plot The film begins with a checkpoint on the outskirts of Ahmedabad. Two constables are investigating an elderly man and a speeding car knocks out the checkpoint, killing constables and seriously injuring the man. Some time later, Raju Bambani (Pratik Gandhi) arrives at the scene, stunned. Raju is a driver by day and bootlegger by night and aims to start his own travel agency with his mentor, Patil (Ragi Jani). Raju is employed by the former lawyer and industrialist Amitabh Shah (Asif Basra) and drives around his son, Tanmay (Kavi Shastri). Raju's sister teaches Tanmay's friend, Shaily (Kimberley Louisa McBeath), Garba. Raju acts as a guide for her and shows her around in the city and falls in love with her. While driving Tanmay around, Raju also learns about sour relationship between Tanmay and his father and Tanmay's problem with his business partner, Mark. When Tanmay finds out about Raju's growing closeness with Shaily, he pulls out of his guarantee for the loan that Raju required for his travel agency. During Navratri, Shaily goes to Garba with Raju and learning about this Tanmay asks Shaily to drive away with him and if she doesn't comply he threatens that he'll ruin Raju's future. Shaily reluctantly complies, Raju follows them on his scooter. The car eventually meets the accident and Raju arrives at the scene some time later. The next day, the police begins the investigation in the case and finds Raju's scooter near the scene of the accident, including the illegal liquor bottles he's carrying. The police threatens to file a case against Raju for Prevention of Anti-Social Activities (PASA), unless he co- operates in hit and run case, but Raju claims ignorance about the event as he arrived at the scene late. The police inspector asks for a bribe of 15 lakhs to ignore PASA case against him. Raju also finds out that the elderly man injured during the accident is one of his regular customers, Pritam Parikh (Kenneth Desai). Raju and Patil manage to gather bribe amount to get rid of PASA case against him. During the investigation, police find CCTV footage, showing Tanmay driving the car minutes before the accident. Amitabh Shah offers the bribe of 2 crores to frame Raju instead for the crime, he also succumbs to threats allegedly from Tanmay's business partner, Mark and gives him 50 million. When the case reaches the court, Pritam Parikh's son Parth Parikh agrees to fight the case for Raju. Parth highlights the shoddy investigation and conspiracy to frame Raju. The court dismisses chargesheet against Raju and asks the police to reinvestigate the case and file the chargesheet again, summoning Tanmay, who is missing since the accident. After the acquittal, Raju confides in Parth about the events of the night. Raju reveals that when he reached the site of the accident, it was in fact Shaily who was driving the car and Tanmay had died during the car crash. To save Shaily, she's asked to leave the country; they get rid of Tanmay's body and threaten his father as Mark to create the impression that he has absconded. Raju defends himself saying he took the actions to save himself. Raju reunites with Shaily in Paris.

Portions of the farm designated for different uses are set off from each other by a variety of stone walls, barbed wire fencing, and split rail fencing. The farmland is a mix of open meadow, woodlots, and cropland. The farmstead includes an 1805 Cape style house, and three barns built in the 1940s. The house was extensively altered at the same time, mainly on the interior, which was apparently gutted. with The core of the farm was acquired in 1801 by James Raymond, who moved to Woodstock from Middleborough, Massachusetts, and was the likely builder of the surviving farmhouse. In 1830 Raymond deeded the property to his son Isaac, who was responsible for its significant enlargement, adding uplands to the north. The Raymonds operated what was essentially a diversified subsistence farming operation, which was continued with tenant farmers operating under lease to absentee owners after the Raymonds sold the property. In 1940, Thomas Crocker III purchased the farm, and transformed it into a gentleman's farm, modernizing the house and replacing the surviving farm buildings with new Colonial Revival structures. A lowland portion of the farm near Route 12 was later sold to the Vermont Land Trust, and is now part of National Park Service-owned property hosting the Appalachian Trail.

He comes from a long line of traditional Zapotec weavers, and the family still is dedicated to this art. Although Gutierrez grew up with the craft and worked looms starting at age 12; at age 18, he went to work in the United States, staying for ten years. Upon returning to Oaxaca, he rediscovered his heritage and the importance of weaving and has since worked to create and promote the making of wool rugs using traditional materials and techniques. In particular he promotes the use of natural dyes, in which his sister Juana specializes. Gutierrez divides his time between Oaxaca and California, not only to sell his family's wares but also to speak and research about weaving and Zapotec culture. This has included a collaboration with the National Museum of the American Indian (Smithsonian). Background thumb Gutierrez was born and raised in Teotitl√°n del Valle, which is known for its weaving, especially wool throw rugs. About 75% of the town's population is involved in weaving in some way. The town depends on the income from the rugs and the tourists the industry attracts. It has a history extending back before the arrival of the Spanish, but its recent success has caused economic and environmental conflicts. Gutierrez is one of eleven children born to Amado Gutierrez and Andrea Contreras, Zapotec speakers and weavers whose lineage in the craft goes back farther than anyone remembers. He began weaving at age twelve, learning from his father, but he also took classes with Vergilio G√≥mez and Carlomagno Pedro Martinez, who encouraged Porfirio to find his own style. The family is relatively traditional. Porfirio's generation is bilingual Zapotec and Spanish, although the following generation mostly speaks Spanish. Their lack of Spanish limited the parents‚Äô ability to market their rugs. When an economic downturn hit the area, Porfirio left Teotitl√°n to migrate to the United States. From age 18 to 28, he lived in Southern California, which has a large population of people from Oaxaca and other southern states. Current work Entrance to family home/workshop in Teotitl√°n del Valle During his time in the United States, Gutierrez did not weave, so when he returned to Teotitlan, the weaving and the culture behind it was a kind of rediscovery. He reorganized the family workshop, with the main operations in Teotitl√°n and a small studio in Ventura, California, called Indigenous Design Studio. In Teotitl√°n, Porfirio works mainly with his sister Juana and her husband, and revolves the workshop around the use of natural dyes, which Juana specializes in. This workshop revolves the central patio of the family home, where areas are set off for dying, drying, weaving and exhibition. Grinding ingredients such as indigo and cochineal on a metate, Juana's skills have allowed her to create a much wider variety of tones than were achieved by her ancestors, able to create about 40 basic colors, with an infinite number of variations. The workshop doubles as an education center, where visitors get a tour and demonstration of techniques. Porfirio himself works as an advocate, educator, researcher and cultural ambassador as well as weaver, with speaking engagements in the United States. In both Mexico and the United States, Gutierrez advocates for the use of natural dyes, rather than the synthetics used by almost all other weaving families due to ease of use and cost. Only about a dozen families work with natural dyes. Chemical dyes pollute the water and vapors can cause health issues. His work is important to him not only to make a living but also to maintain contact with his roots. He says that all of his pieces have a story to tell, often related to his ancestors and Zapotec heritage. Zapotec symbolism. ‚ÄúWhen I say I am Porfirioan Guti√©rrez, this means nothing. It‚Äôs no responsibility at all, but at the moment I say, I am a native of Teotitl√°n, descendent of the Zapotec civilization, this brings forth a very large responsibility.‚Äù thumb Since 2012, Gutierrez has been doing research work on Zapotec textiles and natural dyes, along with ancient symbols from the Zapotec culture. In 2016, he was selected for the Artist Leadership Program of the National Museum of the American Indian (Smithsonian) . This permitted him to study the institution's colecctions, up to 200 years old, at the Cultural Center in Suitland, Maryland. Part of the program is a grant to work and share what he learned with his community. In 2016, Gutierrez initiated a community workshop in Teotitlan. The aim of the workshop is to teach selected young people between the ages of 18 and 26 traditional dying and weaving techniques so that they do not die out. Although the family business still is based in Teotitlan, Gutierrez divides his time between his hometown and a small studio he has in Ventura, California. It contains a loom, where he works and sells the rugs and tapestries as works of art, using large bundles of yarn dyed by his sister. Indicating design process on the loom Gutierrez is a master weaver whose work has been featured in publications, museums and art galleries in the United States, Europe and Latin America. These include The Work of Art: Folk Artists in the 21st Century, an honorary mention at Contemporary Indigenous Arts Biennale sponsored by CONACULTA and pieces in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian and Bowers Museums. His work has toured in the United States, England, Egypt, Norway, Denmark and Canada, along with his native Mexico. Porfiro's works have been exhibited mostly in the United States, especially in California in institutions such as the Santa Fe International Folk Art Market, the National Museum of the American Indian, the Museum of Ventura County, the Maloof Foundation for Arts and Crafts, the Mexican consulate in Oxnard, the Casa Dolores in Santa Barbara and the Santa Barbara Arts Gallery. Outside the U.S., his works have appeared in Ecuador, Peru and Toronto, In Mexico, exhibition include those at the Museo Nacional de Culturas Populares in Mexico City and the Casa de Cultura in Puebla. His first exhibition in Oaxaca was in 2016 at the family's compound. Process Sister demonstrating dyeing process at the workshop The Gutierrez family workshops primarily make rugs and tapestries, but also make smaller items such as coasters and mats. Various members of the family weave and do other tasks, but Porfirio supervises the development of all pieces. Although his mother spins some of the yarn they use, most is bought from another town, so the process most often begin with dyeing. They exclusively use natural dyes made from ingredients sourced from Oaxaca, such as cochineal, tree moss, pomegranate, Mexican tarragon and indigo. The weaving is done on pedal looms, with the wool yarn wound on bobbins and woven through cotton/wool blend threads. A 3x5 foot rug can take several weeks to produce. The largest pieces can take as long as eight months. The family produces both purely traditional designs and more original ones, which themselves do not stray too far from the family's Zapotec roots. Influences in textile designs include pre Hispanic fretwork, glyphs, elements from new archeological finds. Most are sold in the United States, through institutions such as museums. The more innovative designs are popular in California. Each piece is unique and often in a variety of vibrant and earth tones.

The film is directed by Ben Fong, who also directed the television series, and stars Catherine Chau, Gregory Wong, Ng Man-tat and Kate Yeung. The film was released on 4 August 2016. Plot The invention of smart phones has accelerated the decline in print journalism, which online journalism has been replacing. Two years after the death of Kenny Wong and the departure of editor-in-chief Alma Wong, Smart Post is facing a direct challenge from Flash Post, whose online articles receive considerable click rate on its first date of publication. Fong Ying (Catherine Chau), Smart Post's interim editor-in-chief, is warned by CEO Chong Nga-yuen (Justin Cheung) that the newspaper will be forced to shut down if it loses in the competition with Flash Post. On her first day as photojournalist, Mallory Mak (Kate Yeung) comes across the award-winning photo \\"The Starving of Sudan\\" and discusses the ethics behind photojournalism with her colleague and boyfriend Lok Ka-fai (Gregory Wong). Young entrepreneur Ko Yin-yan is interviewed at the television station C99. Seven years ago, he raped and murdered a 17-year-old girl but was acquitted of all charges after he bribed a key witness. Although the witness admitted to giving false testimony later, Ko was unable to be charged again owing to the principle of \\"double jeopardy\\", which forbids the prosecution to press the same charge against the same person again. Furious at seeing the murderer of her daughter remain at large, Tam Yui-chi (Ng Man-tat) has long been under hunger strikes protesting the government's slow progress in abolishing double jeopardy despite professional recommendations, but his solo actions have been constantly ignored and at one point mocked by Lok, who told him he can never gain any media attention unless he has a mass support group or he commits a crime. Seeing Ko's visit to the television studio as a chance, Tam, a technician at C99, detonates explosives and takes Ko hostage along with several colleagues of his. Tam demands the Chief Executive, Lo Kin- kuen, to meet with him before midnight, otherwise he will kill all the hostages and himself. He then sends a voice message to his wife Chim Sui-wah (Mimi Kung) informing her of his action, which triggers her cardiac attack and causes her minibus to crash at a high speed. Mak and Lok witness Chim's accident along with many journalists near the scene. Although Lok acts fast to discover Chim's mobile phone and to establish her relation with the hostage- taker, Flash Post overtakes Smart Post in sending the push notification of the breaking news. Fong decides to gain back click rate by asking Lok to break into the studio and to conduct a live online interview with Tam via a handheld transceiver. After Tam discloses the story of her daughter to the public, the interview is cut short by the police. Flash Post's Fung (Ben Yeung) and Zhong Kaiqi (Jeana Ho) follow suit but intentionally provoke Tam to make him assault Ko while broadcast live. Lok traces the threatening messages in Chim's phone to Ko's father, a Guangzhou tycoon with a close relation with Lo, whom he confronts in person. Blaming himself for instigating Tam's action, he questions Fong's order to publish online the secretly-filmed video and instead takes it to the government Information Coordinator (Deon Cheung) to demand Lo's immediate intervention. Lo initially refuses, but agrees to send a delegate to negotiate after Fong reveals Ko's uncle is the legislator delaying the law reform regarding double jeopardy. The preliminary talk between Tam and Lok as Lo's delegate goes well, and Tam releases four of the hostages. However, after seeing the photos of his wife's corpse published by Flash Post, a desperate Tam cuts the connection with the police and sets off the explosives to kill some of the hostages. Amidst a public uproar against Flash Post, Zhong resigns from the newspaper and Mak vows to take photojournalism back to the right cause. Smart Post's infographic video goes viral on social media and online forums, and attracts thousands to flood into the streets outside C99 station. Half an hour before the deadline, knowing about the mass of people gathering outside in support of him, Tam surrenders to the police. Although Smart Post loses in terms of click rates by a narrow margin to Flash Post, whose editor-in-chief has just resigned, Fong is indifferent to this but summarises journalists' attitude with Kevin Kelly's message on the Whole Earth Catalog: \\"Stay hungry.

Insurance claims, especially in long-tailed lines such as liability insurance, are often not paid out immediately. Claims adjusters set initial case reserves for claims; however, it is often impossible to predict immediately what the final amount of an insurance claim will be, due to uncertainty around defense costs, settlement amounts, and trial outcomes (in addition to several other factors). Loss development factors are used by actuaries, underwriters, and other insurance professionals to \\"develop\\" claim amounts to their estimated final value. Ultimate loss amounts are necessary for determining an insurance company's carried reserves.

Awards are given to amateurs, professionals, juniors and companies. Entries in the Cornish pasty category must be made in Cornwall with traditional ingredients and techniques, but far more freedom is allowed in the \\"open savoury\\" category. Background The pasty originated in the 14th century as a food that miners could take underground. There is some dispute over whether the first pasties were from Devon, crimped on top, or from Cornwall, crimped on the side. Since 2011 a pasty must be made in Cornwall to carry the label \\"Cornish Pasty\\". Pasties have been carried to many other parts of the world by Cornish immigrants, some of whom have developed unusual variants. The World Pasty Championships are an annual event sponsored by the Cornish Pasty Association and held at the Eden Project. As of 2016 there were categories for Cornish Pastry and for Open Savory broken into Professional, Amateur, Junior (15 and under) and Company sub-categories. History The first World Pasty Championships were held on 3 March 2012 at the Eden Project, a park near St Austell, Cornwall. Entrants came from the UK, US and Australia. The 102 pasties that were entered were evaluated by a panel of 21 judges based on taste, texture, appearance, crimp and technical expertise. The open savoury amateur winner was a pasty with wild rabbit poached in cider-soaked leeks, with peas and lemon zest. In 2015 the 88-year-old mother of John Lethbridge, a Cornish sea shanty singer with the Fisherman's Friends, won the Cornish Pasty Amateur title. She had been making pasties since she helped her mother as a child. Mrs. Lethbridge uses the traditional potatoes, swede and onion, sliced thinly and placed in layers. She always uses beef skirt for the meat. At the 2015 event an empanada submitted by the miner Jorge Pereira from Chile won the open savoury category. The traditional Chilean pasty had beef, onion, hard-boiled eggs, olives and sultanas. Entrants also came from Canada and the US. The Open Savoury Professional category was won by a smoked haddock, white wine and mustard pasty. One of the entries was a huge pasty in the shape of half a globe, with the crust showing the oceans, seas and continents. The diameter globe was the work of the head chef of the Eden Project. At the 5th annual championship, held on St Piran's Day 2016, a baker from Canada, won the Pasty Ambassador prize. Matt Grant originated in England, where his mother taught him how to make a pasty. He now runs a pasty company in Arnprior, Ontario. Other entries included an eclectic range of fillings, including a haggis, neeps and tatties pasty, a pulled pork, sweet potato, shallots and cheddar pasty, and a Mumbai pasty with onion, sweet potato, green peas, cauliflower and undisclosed spices. Altogether there were more than 200 entries. The event included comedy and music performances.

She currently lives in the Midwestern US. Career Dennard focused on writing for publication upon leaving her PhD program. Her debut novel Something Strange and Deadly was released in July 2012, followed by its sequel A Darkness Strange and Lovely, released in July 2013, and Strange and Ever After in July 2014. A Dawn Most Wicked, a prequel novella to the series, was published a month before the second title of trilogy in 2013. The Something Strange and Deadly series is set in Philadelphia during the time of the 1876 World Fair while an army of the dead is plaguing the city. Eleanor Fitt, the 16-year-old protagonist, finds out during a zombie attack that her brother has been taken hostage. She takes on the quest to get him back, enlisting the aid of the city's outcast supernatural defense force, called Spirit-Hunters. A Darkness Strange and Lovely continues the story as Eleanor escapes to Paris, only to find that it also has been overrun with the Dead. She must dig deeper into the dark secrets of the city and its magic to keep her Spirit-Hunter friends and herself alive. Strange and Ever After ends the series in 19th century Egypt, where she tracks down her kidnapped friend taken by an evil necromancer, and uses her power to pay the price that will end the darkness once and for all. The prequel, A Dawn Most Wicked, tells the story of Daniel, a future member of the Spirit-Hunters, prior to the events in book one, and how the Spirit-Hunters began. Daniel gets a new beginning working on a boat, where he meets Jie and Joseph, who become his Spirit-Hunter teammates. Ghosts give the crew horrible nightmares and threaten to put the boat out of business, and Daniel must find the cause and destroy the evil behind it to save the boat and his friends.

Life  She was the daughter of Nicola Perotti, a lawyer and member of the Parliament, and a Greek marchioness. As a liberal- spirited woman, she wrote for a number of magazines and newspapers under the pen name Voluntas, meaning \\"willingness\\". Throughout her life, she devoted herself to charitable endeavours, including the establishment of the first professional school for girls in southern Italy, created for the daughters of sailors in Bari. She was President of Catholic Associations, of the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, as well as director of the Italian Red Cross, and during the 1915-1918 war she was President of the Civil Assistance Committee that worked to provide assistance to soldiers and their families. In 1871, she became a friend of Giuseppe Mazzini and went to visit him in the fortress of Gaeta, where he was being held as a political prisoner. Fourteen letters document the continued interaction between Mazzini and Fulvia Miani Perotti, who had become his friend and benefactor. When Mazzini went into exile, Fulvia and her husband Gaetano Perotti (a Piedmontese officer in the army of the Kingdom of Italy) remained faithful to Mazzini by refusing to give information to governmental agents, which resulted in the end of Perotti's army career.

In contrast to traditional museums, community museums are commonly multidisciplinary, and may simultaneously exhibit the history, social history, art, or folklore of their communities. They emphasize collaboration with ‚Äì and relevance to ‚Äì visitors and other stakeholders, and as a result, often appear more overtly political than other museums. History = Origins = In the United States, the emergence of community museums in the 1960s and 1970s has a direct correlation with the greater social movements of the time. Noting that their histories and cultures were largely absent from mainstream museums, activists and civic leaders from minority communities began to open their own museums in an attempt to have their identities and stories told. Moreno, M.-J. (2004). Art Museums and Socioeconomic Forces: The Case of a Community Museum. Review of Radical Political Economics, 36(4), 506‚Äì527. In the context of the African American community, this lack of representation prompted individuals to open small, locally focused museums, many of which provided early models for contemporary community museums. As they grew in stature and wealth, some museums started to stray from their mission and commitment to local communities and began tackling broader global issues. In the past few years, an emphasis on returning museum focus to local community history and culture has helped differentiate the community museum from every other type of museum. Burns, Andrea A. From Storefront to Monument : Tracing the Public History of the Black Museum Movement. = Professionalization = During the 1960s and 1970s, community museums tended to be created and run by activists rather than museum professionals. One notable example of such an activist is John Kinard, the founding director of the Anacostia Community Museum. Although Kinard lacked experience in the museum setting, he used his connections within the community to learn on the job.Autry, Robyn. (2017). 'The rats are still with us': Constructing Everyday Life at the Anacostia Museum in Washington, DC. Museum and Society. 14. 163. However, as community museums grew in size, they often hired historians or museum professionals to guide their curation, collections management, and fundraising. Starting in the late 1970s, The Anacostia Community Museum began to create specialized internal departments and emphasize expert credentials in its hiring process. Autry, Robyn. (2017). 'The rats are still with us': Constructing Everyday Life at the Anacostia Museum in Washington, DC. Museum and Society. 14. 168. Similary, after taking over as director of the Wing Luke Museum in 1983, Kit Freudenberg directed staff to rigorously clean, catalogue and research the museum's artifacts, \\"many of which had been placed in boxes or marked with masking tape.\\" Methods Community museums are marked by their blend of traditional museum methods with methods commonly associated with community organizations and community arts projects. They often practice participatory methods, involving their audiences in various processes, particularly exhibition development and public programming. These practices are varied. The Wing Luke Museum conducts outreach at the beginning of exhibition projects, convenes advisory committees composed of audience members at various stages in the curatorial process, and has even hired full-time community organizers to join their staff. The Brooklyn Historical Society has accepted exhibit proposals from audience members and trained them in curatorial skills to co-create exhibits. These methods distinguish geographically specific museums like the Anacostia Community Museum from local history museums, which may exclude non-museum professionals from their curatorial processes. While such methods require more labor from museum staff than traditional curatorial methods, writer and museum director Nina Simon has argued that they make museums more inviting and relevant to audience members.

It purportedly is based on an unspecified short story by Honor√© de Balzac. It was produced by Playboy Enterprises and originally aired in an edited 80-minute version on the Playboy Channel; an uncut English-dubbed version was released on DVD in 2006. Plot When wealthy art collector Jacques (Emiliano Redondo) visits a Parisian brothel operated by Madame Lili (Mandy Rice- Davies), he recognizes one of the prostitutes as Venus (Josephine Jacqueline Jones), a black Martinican woman. In a flashback, Jacques remembers introducing Venus to a gifted but impoverished sculptor, Armand (Jos√© Antonio Ceinos), who persuaded Venus to become his art model and lover. Armand grew increasingly obsessed with Venus and the statue of her that he was working on. To help Armand pay rent, Venus took work as a model for a dressmaker, Madame Jean (Helga Lin√©). Several of Madame Jean's customers became enamored with Venus, among them Marie (Karin Schubert), a wealthy woman whose husband was often absent. Venus earned so much as a model that Armand accused her of being a prostitute. Eventually Armand's obsession, jealousy and growing violence drove Venus away and she moved in with Marie as a kept woman. When Marie's husband Pierre returned home during a society ball, he discovered Venus in his home and ordered her to have sex with Louise (Florence Gu√©rin), a 17-year old rural girl he had seduced with wealth. Pierre then invited several party guests to rape Louise, leading Venus to flee the house and return to work for Madame Jean. Venus later crossed paths with Louise, who had become a prostitute at Madame Lili's brothel. Louise persuaded Venus to join her in working for Madame Lili. In the present, Jacques tells Venus that Armand finished his statue of her, but refuses to sell it despite being destitute and quite ill. After Venus begs him to help Armand, Jacques goes to Armand's studio, forces money on Armand and takes the statue of Venus over Armand's protests. Jacques then buys Venus and Louise's contracts from Madame Lili and takes both women to his house in Spain, where he installs the statue. Armand, having suffered a severe breakdown, follows them to Spain to take back both Venus and the statue at gunpoint. When Venus refuses, Armand shoots her and then kills himself. Armand's last words are to ask Jacques to take care of \\"her\\", leaving it unclear whether he meant the injured Venus or the statue. Cast Reception The film has received mixed reviews based on its 2006 DVD release, with reviewers praising its artistic ambition but criticizing the uninspired performances of the lead actors. David Carter of Film Fanaddict noted the film's \\"obviously higher than average production values\\" and the \\"high level of elaborate costuming\\" while observing that its downbeat ending \\"makes BLACK VENUS standout from the crop of very similarly themed films made at the time.\\" Christopher Armstead of Film Critics United praised the \\"high production values and over all skill of the filmmakers behind the camera\\" and noted the \\"lush and extravagant\\" costuming and \\"meticulous\\" set design contributed to a \\"well executed production,\\" while also stating the poor acting of the leads prevented Black Venus from qualifying as a good film. Donald Guarisco of AllMovie described the film as \\"entertaining trash\\" with acting \\"bad enough to be genuinely entertaining.\\" Cliff Wood of 10,000 Bullets called the film \\"an interesting curiosity at best that has some really good moments and some not so great moments that tend to overshadow the rest of the film.\\"  References  External links  1983 films 1980s erotic drama films American sexploitation films Films based on works by Honor√© de Balzac Films set in Paris Softcore pornography Films scored by Gregorio Garc√≠a Segura American erotic drama films American films 1983 drama films ","title":"Black Venus (1983 film)"},{"id":"51318228","text":"is a Japanese rugby sevens player.

Description and habitat A medium-sized chiton, oval and very flat, with head and tail valves much reduced in size. Wavy grooves run lengthwise along the central areas of the valves, which can be cream through yellow to light olive-green. These are often coated in pink coralline algae and other small growths, much like the rocks the animal lives around, giving it a cryptic disguise. The girdle is wide, usually a reddish brown, and distinguished by many fine bristles along the margin and larger tufts of bristles at the sutures. Usual length is from 45-62mm, making it one of the larger chitons found in New Zealand. Although an extremely slow moving species, P. biramosa exhibits homing behaviour after moving around at night.

The center opened its doors on June 22, 2013 during its parent organization Arch Development Corporation's annual festival Lumen8Anacostia. The building stands on 9,300 square feet and has five galleries and boutiques along with a short term exhibition gallery called Blank Space SE.  History  The building in which the Anacostia Arts Center currently resides was originally purchased by the Margolis family in the 1930s. The family was well-known at the time for owning a great deal of property in the area. 1231 Good Hope Road encompassed three buildings at the time, one of which was leased to the discount retail chain Woolworth for much for the 20th century. In the 1980s Woolworths across the country started struggling financially and in May 1999 the Anacostia location went out of business. As a result, the Margolis grandchildren sold the property. Arch Development Corporation bought the site with a 15-year loan from BB&T; bank and after three years of fundraising, in 2002 Arch began construction 1231 Good Hope Road to create a job training center for local residents. In 2011 the space transitioned the lower level of the building to a small business incubator. Community residents reacted negatively to the job training center as many believed Anacostia did not need another social service agency. In response to this outcry, the upper level of the building also became an incubator for small business in January 2013. The Anacostia Arts Center in its current form opened on June 22, 2013. Parent organization Arch Development Corporation also funded the Honfleur Gallery, which opened in 2007, so that it and the Anacostia Arts Center could serve the Ward 8 artistic community. In 2015 over 25,000 people came to either the Anacostia Arts Center or Honfleur Gallery.  References  Arts centers in Washington, D.C.

As 1500 students from mid and north Cornwall already spent between an hour and two hours each-way on a bus to reach the Truro College campus every day, the building of a new campus or college further north in Cornwall would reduce the time these students needed to spend travelling. This led to a consultation period, where Truro and Penwith College sought the views of the local community and received feedback and input from parents and students who might be hoping to attend the proposed college.

It is the national pageant that elects the Bangladesh representative to Miss Asia Pacific International and Miss Earth. Miss Bangladesh USA is emerged as the first pageant for Bangladeshi women in almost two decades and is the first organization to be sending a Bangladeshi representative to Miss Asia Pacific International and Miss Earth. The current titleholder for Miss Bangladesh US is Marjana Chowdhury of New York.  History  The Miss Bangladesh USA Contest was first organized in 2015 and was held on a social media platform via Facebook. The organization was founded by Hiam Amani Hafizuddin who herself competed in various pageants including local preliminaries in the Miss Illinois regions of the Miss America organization and was a 2016 National Finalist for Miss World America. Seeing that there had been no pageants present for Bangladeshi women, Hafizuddin created the Miss Bangladesh USA pageant to provide Bangladeshi American women with a platform to inspire social change, promote education, showcase talents, and celebrate Bangladeshi heritage and culture. In the first year, women were evaluated on their resume, social platform, and ability to engage people on multimedia outlets. The first ever Miss Bangladesh USA became Sumaira Ahmed of Boston with the platform of raising awareness for Neuromyelitis optica, an autoimmune disease that she had been diagnosed with. In the second installment of Miss Bangladesh USA, the pageant evolved into a live stage show. Miss Bangladesh USA 2016 was held at Northeastern Illinois University on August 6, 2016. Eight contestants from across the United States competed in private interview, platform speech, cultural wear, talent, evening sari and on stage question. Miss Bangladesh USA 2016 was held as a two division pageant, featuring Miss Bangladesh USA Teen for the first time. Prior to the competition, the Miss Bangladesh USA organization joined in franchise with Asia's largest and oldest beauty pageant, the Miss Asia Pacific International pageant. It was decided that the winner of Miss Bangladesh USA would represent Bangladesh at Miss Asia Pacific International for the first time. This would also be the first time in over a decade that Bangladesh would be represented at an international Beauty pageant. In 2016, a contestant of the Miss Bangladesh US pageant, Lamiya Haque, became the first candidate to represent Bangladesh at the 2016 Miss Asia Pacific International pageant. The 2016 winner of Miss Bangladesh USA Marjana Chowdhury represented Bangladesh at the 2018 Miss Asia Pacific International competition and became the first Bangladeshi woman to place in the top 20 of an international beauty pageant.

Public response to the painting was immediate and positive. It was praised in Niva and several other periodicals, including ' (Sparks), a satirical magazine. The exhibition catalog sold out and the painting was reproduced as postcards; black and white, color prints and hand-painted versions (which are valuable collectors' items). The current whereabouts of the original are unknown. It is said that Volkov sold it to a visiting Englishman not long after it was exhibited, but there is no record of it being taxed or having left the country; something that was usually documented very meticulously.\\"Mirror of Fate\\" @ Ozmns.narod Most of the reproductions were apparently made from a copy.

The series stars Will Arnett as the title character, BoJack Horseman. The supporting cast includes Amy Sedaris, Alison Brie, Paul F. Tompkins, and Aaron Paul. The series' first season premiered on August 22, 2014, on Netflix, with a Christmas special premiering on December 19. The show is designed by the cartoonist Lisa Hanawalt, who had previously worked with Bob-Waksberg on the webcomic Tip Me Over, Pour Me Out. __TOC__ Main characters =BoJack Horseman= BoJack Horseman (voiced by Will Arnett; born January 2, 1964 in San Francisco, California) is a self-loathing, alcoholic, anthropomorphic horse currently in his 50s. His acting career peaked when he starred in a successful family sitcom called Horsin' Around in the 1990s. He went on to star in The BoJack Horseman Show, an edgier, less successful sitcom which was cancelled in 2007 after just one season. Though he began as a young bright-eyed actor, he has since grown bitter, deeply depressed, and jaded about and who he has become post-fame. BoJack has been shown to be caring and insightful, but his insecurities, loneliness, and desperate need for approval often result in self-destructive actions that devastate those around him. Many of his issues stem from his drug abuse, alcohol abuse, horrible decisions he's made throughout his career, and issues with his unhappy parents during childhood, which the audience is shown through flashbacks. At the end of season 5, BoJack checks into rehab after he developed a drug addiction to prescription painkillers he was on which caused him to strangle his co-star. In season 6, he decides to fight his inner demons so he can stay sober and be content with himself, accepting a job as an acting professor at Wesleyan. His past inevitably catches up with him, however, when the Hollywoo Reporter runs a story about his role in Sarah Lynn's death, with eventually all the details of his many wrongdoings and missteps becoming common knowledge and BoJack inevitably being \\"canceled.\\" The isolation that ensues causes BoJack to briefly relapse into his old ways, breaking into his old home, using drugs and alcohol, and attempting suicide by drowning in his old swimming pool. His body is found the next morning and after initially being pronounced dead, he eventually comes to and is sentenced to prison for breaking and entering. In the series finale, he is released from prison for one day for Princess Carolyn's wedding, during which he takes the time to make amends with each of his old friends before eventually moving on and creating a new life for himself. =Princess Carolyn= Princess Carolyn (voiced by Amy Sedaris; born June 6, 1974) is a pink Persian cat who is BoJack's agent in the first three seasons and former on-and-off girlfriend. Earnest and unflagging, Princess Carolyn was a top agent at Vigor agency through her dogged pursuit of new talent and large network of odd personal connections. Though she struggles to find a balance between work, her troubled personal life, and taking care of BoJack and her friends, she enjoys her fast-paced hectic lifestyle. She left Vigor to start a new agency with her then-boyfriend and coworker Rutabaga Rabitowitz. After recognizing his lack of trustworthiness and confronting her fear of being alone, she ultimately decides to leave him and run the new company named VIM by herself. After several setbacks, Princess Carolyn closes VIM in season 3, only to reopen it as a management agency. She struggles throughout the series with starting a family, but frequently suffers miscarriages. In season 5, after several failed attempts, she successfully adopts a baby porcupine from Sadie, a young woman from her hometown in North Carolina, who she subsequently names Ruthie in season 6. It is revealed in season 5 that she went to Los Angeles, California because she was accepted into UCLA. In season 6, she rehires her old assistant Judah to help her run VIM and is subsequently offered to run her own female-centered production company from Lenny Turteltaub called Girteltaub. As she prepares to make the transition, Judah confesses his love for her and a year later they are married. She ends the series in a good place and tells BoJack she wishes him well but also that they won't have any future professional relationship. =Diane Nguyen= Diane Nguyen (voiced by Alison Brie; born March 19, 1980 in Boston, Massachusetts) is a human ghostwriter, a nice, well-reasoned, misunderstood intellectual, and a Vietnamese-American third-wave feminist from Boston who used to live with her rich and famous ex-boyfriend (and later ex- husband), former sitcom star Mr. Peanutbutter. She is hired by BoJack's publisher to ghostwrite his memoir, having written a biography of BoJack's childhood hero, Secretariat. While writing BoJack's memoir, he and Diane initially develop a strong friendship that becomes increasingly awkward and strained after BoJack develops romantic feelings for her. She has struggled throughout her career to get recognition for her writing, and travels to the war-torn Republic of Cordovia to make a difference, but discovers that this life is not for her. Ashamed of returning to Mr. Peanutbutter, she enters into a severe depression, during which she drinks heavily, smokes pot, and sleeps disheveled on BoJack's patio furniture. She is able to reconcile her feelings with Mr. Peanutbutter and gets a job at VIM ghostwriting tweets for celebrities. She is subsequently fired from VIM, and is hired to write for a feminist blog. During and after Mr. Peanutbutter's run for Governor of California their marriage begins to deteriorate and, at the beginning of season 5, they divorce. Diane moves into a run-down studio apartment upon separating from Mr. Peanutbutter. In season 6 Diane starts a relationship with her coworker, a Bison named Guy, and decides after returning to her studio apartment to move in with him in Chicago. She begins writing a new memoir that leads her back into her recurring depression. She combats this with antidepressants (which itself leads to a noticeable weight gain) but these stall her progress on her memoir, which she eventually abandons in favor of a teen fiction series called Ivy Tran: Food Court Detective. She eventually moves to Houston with Guy and is revealed in the series finale to have married him. She ends the series having what will seemingly be her last conversation with BoJack, telling him that she is grateful that she knew BoJack and for her life in LA, but that she is ready to move on. =Mr. Peanutbutter= Mr. Peanutbutter (voiced by Paul F. Tompkins; born August 20, 1968) is an energetic and cheerful yellow Labrador Retriever who is BoJack's former sitcom rival and Diane's ex-boyfriend (and later ex-husband). Mr. Peanutbutter was the star of Mr. Peanutbutter's House, which, according to BoJack, \\"borrowed the premise\\" from Horsin' Around. He portrays many characteristics of an actual Labrador yet portrayed as a human-like character being sweet, loyal, kind, playful, and considerate. He had a stint at filming a celebrity reality show called Peanutbutter and Jelly. Despite their rivalry, Mr. Peanutbutter cares a great deal about BoJack's opinion and admires him for his work on Horsin' Around. He has an especially good relationship with Todd, and his positive attitude and financial resources combined with Todd's outlandish schemes and plans often result in the two starting questionable business ventures, such as a Halloween store that is exclusively open in January. In the episode \\"Let's Find Out\\", Mr. Peanutbutter starts hosting his own televised game show after his film company enters bankruptcy due to his and Todd's extensive expenditures on useless products. In \\"Hank After Dark\\", it is revealed that Mr. Peanutbutter was formerly married to a woman named Katrina who was emotionally abusive. His second wife was famous actress Jessica Biel, who is portrayed as being obsessed with her celebrity status and people recognizing her. He grew up in the Labrador Peninsula, which is depicted as being populated entirely by Labrador Retrievers. \\"Mr.\\" is his actual first name. He often shouts to an offscreen, but implicatively outlandish, presence only known as \\"Erica\\". He is a graduate of Northwestern University. After his divorce with Diane, he started dating a pug named Pickles who is much younger than him but shares a lot of the same characteristics. At the end of the season 5 finale, he proposes to her, though only out of guilt after cheating on her with Diane. He does eventually tell Pickles of his infidelity which leads to the joint decision that for them to be even she must sleep with other men and him be fine with the situation. He later becomes the face of depression on a tour around the US talking about the mental illness with pop star Joey Pogo. During this time, he encourages Pickles to sleep with Joey Pogo due to their similarities, however this eventually backfires when Pickles leaves Mr. Peanutbutter for Pogo. =Todd Chavez= Todd Chavez (voiced by Aaron Paul; born April 15, 1991) is a friendly and lovable human slacker who ended up at BoJack's house for a party five years before the beginning of the series and never left. Although BoJack constantly voices disdain for him, he secretly cares about Todd, continuing to financially support him and sabotage his attempts to gain independence. Todd has been shown to possess a plethora of skills including an understanding of Japanese; entrepreneurial know-how, having allied with Mr. Peanutbutter for various business ideas; and writing and composing his own rock opera, Newtopia Rising, Book I: The Search for a New Utopia. His rock opera was eventually sabotaged by BoJack, who took advantage of his former addiction to video games. Todd puts the pieces together of what BoJack did string map style and begins to question his friendship with BoJack. Todd also has an uncanny knack for getting himself in absurd and extremely dangerous situations when his friends aren't around, such as getting into gun fights on several occasions, ending up in prison, and in one case switching places Prince and the Pauper-style with a dictator from Cordovia, a fictional eastern European country in the midst of a brutal civil war. Todd's friendship with Mr. Peanutbutter landed him various jobs creating seemingly useless products. He sees the best in BoJack, despite his multitude of problems, up until \\"It's You\\" in season three, where he finally snaps at him for his constant misdoings; it is not until the season four episode \\"Hooray! Todd Episode!\\" where they finally speak again, with the now-humbled BoJack having a sincere talk with him. He's usually happy, even when being insulted by BoJack. His catch phrases include shouting \\"hooray!\\". He is also almost never seen without wearing his signature yellow beanie. In the 2000s, he was an aimless skateboarder, and the object of affection of his schoolmate, Emily. It is revealed in the season 3 finale \\"That Went Well\\" that he is asexual. In season 5, he gets a management position at a clock website company called \\"What Time Is It Right Now\\", but then he gets laid off at the end of season 5. In season 6 episode \\"The Kidney Stays in the Picture\\", he gives one of his kidneys to his mom who is in desperate need of one. He later begins a relationship with Maude, an asexual cashier at an airport Cinnabunny, and they quickly move in together, sharing an affinity for quirky, outlandish ideas. He also reconnects with his mother after several failed attempts catching her attention after staging a fake kidnapping by Character Actress Margo Martindale. At the end of the series, Todd reconnects with BoJack at Princess Carolyn's wedding, revealing that he has made up with his mother and enjoys a comfortable life with Maude and his daycare service which he runs in the VIM Management building. He encourages BoJack to keep up his sobriety and shares an insight about art that leads BoJack to say with affection \\"Is that smart or stupid\\" and Todd to gleefully say \\"I never know!\\" Recurring characters =Pinky Penguin= Pinky Penguin (voiced by Patton Oswalt) is an Emperor penguin and book editor who works at Penguin Publishing. He was depending on BoJack's book to save his job and the entire company. In \\"Yesterdayland\\", Pinky started working at MBN. At the end of \\"Later\\", it is revealed he was able to see his kids again. After Wanda moves to Detroit, he becomes the head of MBN. His wife has stated that everything he touches falls apart, and much of his character's humor is derived from his failures or near-failures. =Sarah Lynn= Sarah Lynn (born Sarah Himmelfarb, voiced by Kristen Schaal) was a human actress who played the Horse's precocious adoptive youngest daughter Sabrina on Horsin' Around starting when she was only three years old, and who looked up to BoJack off-screen as a father figure. After the show went off the air, she became a successful pop singer in the early 2000s before drug addiction and alcoholism ended her career. Flashbacks indicate that Sarah Lynn's self-destructive behavior is in part the result of being forced into an acting career by her mother, and BoJack (whom she idolized) having neglected her as a child. Around the end of \\"Later\\", she was seen visiting Andrew Garfield (with whom she was mentioned as having an on-again, off-again relationship) at the hospital. It is heavily implied that she was sexually abused as a child by her mother's boyfriend and later stepfather. Although BoJack attempts to get her sober earlier in season 1, he later goes on a bender with her and Todd in an attempt to rewrite his memoir after firing Diane. In season 3, she becomes sober, but only because she hears that taking drugs after being sober for a long time is the best experience. When BoJack hits rock bottom, he invites Sarah Lynn to go on an epic bender. Through a series of blackouts, they have a series of misadventures attempting to make amends to BoJack's ex-friends, and even stalking Penny at Oberlin College. Along the way, Sarah Lynn wins the Academy Award for Best Original Song in absentia. She then admits to BoJack that she doesn't like anything about herself and, at the Griffith Observatory planetarium, dies lying on BoJack's shoulder after a drug overdose. In \\"That Went Well\\", it is revealed that BoJack was at one point her only friend who hadn't tried to get something from her, and her downward spiral began after he visited her and tried to get her to be a guest star on his TV show. It is later revealed in \\"A Little Uneven, Is All\\" that the first time Sarah Lynn drank alcohol was from a bottle of vodka that BoJack left on set when she was ten years old. During season 6, BoJack has recurring flashbacks about her and is one of the reasons why he wants to get sober. She makes a final appearance as a part of BoJack's hallucination in the episode \\"The View from Halfway Down\\", as one of the several deceased people from BoJack's past whom he sees after he almost accidentally committed suicide. =Herb Kazzaz= Herb Kazzaz (voiced by Stanley Tucci) was BoJack's human former comedy partner, who created and wrote Horsin' Around where he also provided the voice of Mr. Libertore who runs the law firm where the Horse works as an attorney. Herb appeared to be friendly and upbeat during the show's production, usually nice, understanding, and insightful to all his cast, even Bradley. When BoJack and Herb first meet as comedians, BoJack angrily tells him to \\"get cancer\\" which is what eventually happens. Halfway through production of Horsin' Around, Herb is caught engaging in a public sexual act with another man which causes a public outcry for his removal from the show. BoJack and Herb had a falling out at the apex of the show's success when Herb was blackballed by the network for being gay and BoJack did not stand up for Herb for fear of losing his own job. At the beginning of the series, they have not spoken for nearly 20 years. BoJack attempts to reconnect with him after learning Herb has been diagnosed with terminal rectal cancer and is being watched over by Tina. Though Herb reveals he lived a full life in spite of losing Horsin' Around, he has not forgiven BoJack for not having been a supportive friend and refuses to do so when BoJack finally apologizes to him. Despite his cancer going into remission, he instantly passes away due to an allergic reaction to the peanuts on a peanut truck in a car crash when his brakes gave out during a ride home from the hospital. It was also revealed that Herb's office was under the room where tap dancer Savion Glover kept a studio. Following his death, Henry Winkler (who Herb met volunteering at Habitat for Humanity) and Tina stole the manuscript of his poorly written novel to keep it from being published and tainting his legacy. In \\"Out to Sea\\", Herb's ashes are donated to the Jerb Kazzaz Memorial Orphanage (misspelled due to BoJack's email and the hedgehog owner's stubborn refusal to pay for its replacement). He makes a final appearance as a part of BoJack's hallucination in the episode \\"The View from Halfway Down\\", as one of the several deceased people from BoJack's past whom he sees after he almost committed suicide. =Hollyhock= Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero- Robinson-Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzarelli-McQuack (voiced by Aparna Nancherla) is a 17-year-old filly first seen at the end of \\"That Went Well\\". She was adopted by eight fathers in a committed gay polyamorous relationship. She is at first believed to be BoJack's illegitimate daughter. During season four, she moves in with BoJack to find out more about him and later visits Beatrice, BoJack's mother, who also moves in with them. It is later revealed that she is actually the illegitimate daughter of Butterscotch Horseman, BoJack's father, and Beatrice's maid, Henrietta, making her BoJack's half-sister. Beatrice, who snipes at Hollyhock for being overweight, spikes her coffee with weight-loss supplements (containing amphetamines). She overdoses and is rushed to the hospital and survives, although she suffers from PTSD like symptoms when she returns to BoJack's house. In season 5, she is a freshman at Wesleyan University. In the season 6 mid-season cliff hanger, \\"A Quick One While He's Away\\", she goes to a party in NYC and meets Pete-Repeat, who was on a double date with BoJack and Penny at the high-school prom \\"Escape from LA\\". Hollyhock ends up discovering BoJack giving Pete's girlfriend at the time, Maddy, alcohol poisoning, when they're talking. When BoJack takes a teaching position at Wesleyan, Hollyhock is distant from him due to learning about that past misdeed and makes it clear she doesn't appreciate him imposing himself on her college experience, stating that he shouldn't say she's his sister \\"like it means something\\" and only reluctantly giving him any reason to think they'll have an improved relationship going forward. When the full weight of BoJack's misdeeds becomes public, Hollyhock ignores BoJack's desperate phone messages, disconnects her phone, and sends him a letter which is unseen but his heartbroken reaction to it implies she will no longer have any contact or relationship with him. =Butterscotch Horseman= Butterscotch Horseman (voiced by Will Arnett) was a horse who was BoJack's physically and verbally abusive father. He appears in flashbacks to BoJack's childhood. Butterscotch, who hailed from a working-class background, was an alcoholic and failed novelist. He resented his wife's financial independence and took out his insecurities on BoJack. In flashbacks, Butterscotch is often seen yelling nonsensical conservative hyperbole such as claiming that the Panama Canal is for \\"Democrats\\" and calls screws \\"fancy Jew nails.\\" He is confirmed to be dead, as a flashback shows BoJack and Beatrice going to Butterscotch's funeral. In \\"Time's Arrow\\", it is revealed that Butterscotch is Hollyhock's father, due to his affair with the family maid named Henrietta. In \\"Free Churro\\", BoJack revealed that Butterscotch died after challenging a man who hated his book to a duel and then tripping and hitting his head on a rock. A version of Butterscotch appears in the penultimate episode \\"The View From Halfway Down\\" as one of many deceased people from BoJack's past whom he sees in a prolonged hallucination while he is unconscious following a suicide attempt. While most of the other figures in the hallucination appear as they did in life, Butterscotch is portrayed as a hybrid with Secretariat, with Secretariat's appearance and Butterscotch's voice, and his personality/experiences being presented as a combination of the two. During the hallucination, the half of the horse that's based on Butterscotch tells BoJack that he always cared about and loved him, but was terrified of letting that show. In the cabaret, he performs a reading of the eponymous poem \\"The View From Halfway Down,\\" drawing from Butterscotch's penchant for literature and poetry while being largely based on Secretariat's suicide. =Beatrice Horseman= Beatrice Elizabeth Horseman (n√©e Sugarman) (voiced by Wendie Malick) was a horse who was BoJack's neglectful, verbally abusive mother. Heiress to the Sugarman sugar cube fortune, she primarily appears in flashbacks of BoJack's childhood and young adult life. In \\"Brand New Couch\\", Beatrice calls up BoJack to tell him she read the book about him and concedes that he was born \\"broken\\". In \\"The Old Sugarman Place\\", it is revealed that Beatrice's family had a summer home in Michigan when she was a child, and that she had an older brother named Crackerjack, who died in World War II. Her childhood was marked by cruel treatment from family and peers alike, hardening and embittering her personality. While seen as a liberal college graduate concerned with the civil rights movement, she soon becomes bitter and jaded after making the poor choice to romantically involve herself with Butterscotch Horseman. After becoming impregnated by Butterscotch, Beatrice decides to marry him and move to San Francisco, California, where she becomes resentful of BoJack, blaming him for her dissatisfaction in her life. She begins to suffer from dementia and after an incident at her nursing home, she moves in with BoJack and Hollyhock. However, after BoJack realizes Beatrice has been drugging Hollyhock (to make her lose weight), BoJack kicks her out of his house to put her into an even worse nursing home and makes clear he no longer wants her in his life. In the episode \\"Free Churro\\", it is revealed that Beatrice has died at the age of 80 years old, as BoJack is delivering a eulogy to her throughout the episode. She makes a final appearance as a part of BoJack's hallucination in the episode \\"The View from Halfway Down\\", as one of the several deceased people from BoJack's past whom he sees after he almost committed suicide. =Crackerjack Sugarman= Crackerjack Sugarman (voiced by Lin-Manuel Miranda) ‚Äì Beatrice Horseman's older brother, BoJack's uncle, and the eldest son of Joseph and Honey Sugarman, who died in World War II when Beatrice was very young.

During the theatrical show scene in BoJack's hallucination, he plays the trumpet for Beatrice while she does an acrobatic routine. =Joseph Sugarman= Joseph Sugarman (voiced by Matthew Broderick) was Beatrice's father and BoJack's maternal grandfather, the owner of the Sugarman Sugar corporation. Emotionally distant, he frequently spouted his backward views about women, making Beatrice feel insecure and inadequate (for which she compensates with meanness as an adult). =Honey Sugarman= Honey Sugarman (voiced by Jane Krakowski) was Beatrice's mother and BoJack's maternal grandmother. She was a housewife and exceptional singer, but suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after her son, Crackerjack Sugarman (voiced by Lin-Manuel Miranda) was killed in World War II. After she got drunk and made a scene while out with young Beatrice and forced her to drive home, and the resultant car accident, her husband had her lobotomized. =Charlotte Carson= Charlotte Carson (n√©e Moore) (voiced by Olivia Wilde) is a deer who was Herb Kazzaz's old girlfriend with whom BoJack was once in love. During a drug and alcohol induced stupor in \\"Downer Ending\\", BoJack imagines an alternate life where instead of becoming a television star he moves to Maine with Charlotte. In this fantasy, the couple get married, have a daughter named Harper, and lead a quiet rustic lifestyle. In \\"Still Broken\\", Charlotte attended Herb Kazzaz's funeral. In a discussion with BoJack, she mentioned that she visited Herb and read the part in BoJack's book on how he and Herb fought over a telescope. She tells him she only lived in Maine for a month and later moved to Tesuque, New Mexico. In \\"Escape from LA\\", BoJack drives to Charlotte's house to find she is married to a dorky, dad-joke making man named Kyle and has two teenage children named Trip (human) and Penny (doe). She also owns a store called \\"Your Deer Friend\\". During his time in New Mexico, BoJack bonds with the 17-year-old Penny by becoming her \\"date\\" for prom. While talking with Charlotte later over by her fire pit, the two share a brief kiss. BoJack initially urges her to leave with him anew amidst her protests, eventually relenting. However, Charlotte asks him to leave by the next day, confessing his presence depresses her. Later that night, Charlotte catches BoJack and Penny in a compromising position in his yacht. BoJack apologizes, but she orders him to get off her property before she calls the police, and warns BoJack that if he contacts her or her family again, she will kill him. She returns briefly in the final season, when she and Penny are approached by Paige Sinclair who seeks details of their encounter with BoJack for an article she is writing about his involvement in Sarah Lynn's death. She tells BoJack she doesn't want to be involved and that he has to handle the situation, causing him to hyperventilate and later pass out. =Penny Carson= Penny Carson (voiced by Ilana Glazer) ‚Äì A deer who is Charlotte and Kyle's daughter, and Trip's sister. She bonds with BoJack while he stays at their home during \\"Escape from L.A.\\" where he acts as her surrogate date from prom. After returning from the home, she propositions him to have sex which BoJack rejects despite her saying she is of consent age in her state. Charlotte later finds her and BoJack in a compromising position on his yacht and she is sent to her room before either one can explain what happened. In season three, BoJack attempted to reconcile with Penny believing she may have been emotionally damaged because of the incident and finds her at her school Oberlin College. Penny freaked out when he suddenly appeared and ran off stating that he shouldn't be here. She appears again in season 6 when Paige and Maximilian ask for details about her encounter with BoJack. She considers if it is time to finally come forward, with Charlotte telling her that if she does, she must do it on her own terms. =Lenny Turteltaub= Lenny Turteltaub (voiced by J.K. Simmons) is a tortoise and big-shot film producer in . He worked with Ed Begley, Sr., Lionel Barrymore, Buster Keaton and Edwin S.

In \\"Still Broken\\", Tina was in collaboration with Henry Winkler to keep Herb's terrible manuscript for a novel from being posthumously published and harming his legacy.

Later in season 4, Tina returns as the nurse of BoJack's Mother, Beatrice. =Sextina Aquafina= Sextina Aquafina (voiced by Aisha Tyler in season 1‚Äì2, Daniele Gaither in season 3) is a bottlenose dolphin pop-music sensation. In \\"Out to Sea\\", Diane meets with Sextina to discuss becoming her social-media ghostwriter. In the season three episode \\"Brrap Brrap Pew Pew\\", Diane accidentally tweeted out that Sextina was having an abortion while she was being distracted, which caused a media storm. While Sextina was initially angered with the tweet and tried to fire Diane, she later embraced the image because of support from other celebrities. She later released a music video militantly supporting abortion, had her \\"abortion\\" on live TV, and soon after became pregnant. It is implied that she is sent to a farm where celebrities go to disappear. According to creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg, she is based on a girl who was in his and Lisa Hanawalt's English class as a senior in high school. =Kelsey Jannings= Kelsey Jannings (voiced by Maria Bamford) is a human who was hired to direct the Secretariat movie. A divorced, lesbian, independent filmmaker, she sees the Secretariat project as her last chance to break into the big time and make enough money to get her daughter Irving into an Ivy League school (as opposed to Vassar). Cynical and initially dismissive of BoJack's attitude, she and BoJack grow closer over the course of filming. She has a special fondness for Todd because she likes his face. She is later fired by Lenny Turteltaub in \\"The Shot\\" for filming a scene that involved Secretariat's encounter with Richard Nixon which had since been cut from the film. In season three, BoJack finds Kelsey at POFF (Pacific Ocean Film Festival) and attempts to reconcile with her through various apology notes, however she cannot understand it because the ink starts to wash away and BoJack is unaware of his suit's voice capabilities until the episode ends. Later in the season, the two discuss doing a serious independent film together called Jelly Belle to legitimize BoJack as an actor. Unfortunately, this is part of a plan by Vanessa Gekko to sabotage Princess Carolyn's agency, and the film option expires before a deal can be reached. The resulting fallout seemingly ends BoJack's unique professional and artistic connection with Kelsey. In season six, Kelsey is struggling to find directing jobs, due in part to her getting fired from the Secretariat film.

Everyone except BoJack appears oblivious to (or just does not care about) the fact that Vincent appears to be three children standing atop each other underneath a trench coat. Though he speaks in a child's voice and has awkward syntax, he also occasionally exhibits strangely keen insight, prompting others to ignore BoJack's observations. In season 2, Princess Carolyn meets Kevin, who appears to be the top child of Vincent's trio. He tells Princess Carolyn that Kevin is Vincent's son, which she believes, but leads to them breaking up. =Bradley Hitler-Smith= Bradley Hitler-Smith (voiced by Adam Conover) ‚Äì A human actor who played the Horse's adopted son Ethan on Horsin' Around.

They begin a sexual relationship off-set that later evolves into dating, until she breaks up with BoJack when his drug addiction spirals out of control. BoJack then chokes Gina on set while they were filming an episode of Philbert while he was high on painkillers and then does an interview (before the interview, Gina tells BoJack while she'll continue to work with him, she never wants to speak to him again.) to hide the fact that BoJack was really choking her by stating it was all just an act and that they've broken up because of what BoJack did (even having to kiss BoJack to make her statements sound sincere, much to her dismay). Gina has spent most of her career doing small parts and sees Philbert as her chance to finally break out. By season 6, her acting career has taken off, however her experience with BoJack has changed her and caused her to be incredibly anxious on set, especially when doing stunts. This garners her a reputation throughout Hollywoo for being difficult to work with, which seems to cost her a high-profile role in Kelsey Jannings' superhero film Fireflame (it is revealed in the series finale, however, that she does in fact get the role and stars alongside Courtney Portnoy, who is also considered for the role). =Pickles Aplenty= Pickles Aplenty (voiced by Hong Chau in season 5 and Julia Chan in season 6) (born 1993) is a female pug waitress, and aspiring social media influencer, who works at BoJack's restaurant, and becomes Mr. Peanutbutter's girlfriend in season 5.

He is initially cast on Philbert as Philbert's partner Fritz, due to Waggoner's \\"bad boy\\" reputation, but the controversy that ensues as a result of Waggoner's past and with Philbert's indelicate subject matter (as well as the countless job offers that he receives after returning to the spotlight) causes him to leave the show and be recast with Mr. Peanutbutter. He appears later in season 6 to be BoJack's AA sponsor after no one is willing to work or talk with BoJack anymore, and the two bond over having been \\"canceled.\\" Waggoner encourages BoJack to hold onto his anger and continue making content for the small part of the population that still supports him, and directs BoJack in The Horny Unicorn, a bawdy, low-brow comedy. =Henry Fondle= Henry Fondle (voiced by Aaron Paul) is a sex robot designed by Todd in an attempt to get Emily to date him again without having sex with her.

History  Babburkammes are followers of the Smarta tradition, which is closely associated with the Advaita tradition of Adi Shankara. Kamme is derived from 'Karmin' (Karmigalu in Kannada) meaning those who practice \\"Vaidhika Dharma\\". The migration pattern reflects the various Hindu kingdoms and economic centres of their times. Over the last 100 years, the local migration appears to be from small-towns to Mysore and Bangalore, and in recent years to other parts of the world. This trend seems to be coherent with migration patterns of other service-providing communities in the region. Babburkammes place strong emphasis on education and political influence. Due to their history, most in the community do not have significant ancestral land or other fixed assets (unlike the business or warrior communities, for example) and therefore formal education is seen as a pathway to success. In addition, and perhaps as a result of advanced education, the community is quite progressive in its outlook. The founder of the Vijayanaga Empire, Sri Vidyaranya, belonged to the community. It is also believed that he brought many Brahmins from his community to settle in Karnataka. Later, his brothers, Madhavacharya and Sayanacharya, contributed to Hinduism by documenting the Vedas and Upanishads for the first time (hitherto it was spread from guru to shishya by word-of- mouth). Max Muller and Swami Vivekananda applauded the efforts of Sayanacharya in preserving the heritage of the Sanathana dharma. Followers of Adi Shankara  Culture  The mother tongue of majority Babburkamme Brahmins is Kannada. A minority claims Sanskrit or Telugu as its mother tongue. They are vegetarians (no restriction to use milk, leather and horns).  Deities and festivals  The main deity of Babburkammes is dependent on the family deity or Ishta-Deva. Those deities can be Shiva-Shakti or Laxmi-Narayan but, being followers of Advaita Smartism, Babburkammes worship all the major forms of God in Hinduism including Shiva, Vishnu, Ganesha, Gowri, Saraswati, Laxmi, Durga, and Karthikeya. Babburkamme offer Panchayatana puja worship, introduced by Adi Shankara, and celebrate all the festivals of the Mysore region. They have Shaiva, Vaishnava and Shakta leanings.

Often attributed to H.W. Fowler,See, for example, Collinson (1927) p. 127; Wordsworth (2011). the phrase was in fact coined by the historian Archibald Ballantyne in an article entitled Wardour Street English, published in Longman's Magazine in 1888,Ballantyne (1888) in which, for example, he characterized William Morris's translation of the Odyssey as ‚Äúnot literary English of any date; this is Wardour-Street Early English‚Äîa perfectly modern article with a sham appearance of the real antique about it.‚ÄùBallantyne (1888) p. 589 The phrase appeared sporadically thereafter in literary criticism, particularly in reference to Morris's work,See, for examples, Anonymous (1890), Sainsbury (1912) p. 435, Ball (1931) p. xxxv and there is a brief mention of \\"antiquarian rubbish, Wardour Street English\\" in The King's English,Fowler and Fowler (1906) p. 3 by the brothers H.W. and F.G. Fowler, but it was the article Wardour Street in A Dictionary of Modern English Usage, written by H.W. Fowler after his brother's death, that gave the expression broad currency.Fowler (1926) p. 700 In his typical idiosyncratic style, Fowler wrote: > As Wardour Street itself offers to those who live in modern houses the > opportunity of picking up an antique or two that will be conspicuous for > good or ill among their surroundings, so this article offers to those who > write modern English a selection of oddments calculated to establish (in the > eyes of some readers) their claim to be persons of taste & writers of > beautiful English. Words deprecated by Fowler include such examples as anent, aught, ere, erstwhile, haply, maugre, oft, perchance, thither, to wit, varlet, withal and wot. Some words that Fowler found objectionable, such as albeit, for(e)bears and proven have found their way into normal English idiom and have been replaced in more recent editions of Modern English Usage by, amongst others, betimes, peradventure, quoth and whilom.Burchfield (2004) p. 833 None of these lists is exhaustive. Wardour Street English includes not only an incongruous choice of vocabulary, but also pseudo-archaic sentence structure. Fowler, in the first edition of Modern English Usage, criticized the use of inverted protasis with had, should and were (as in 'Had he done this, then‚Ä¶', rather than 'If he had done this, then‚Ä¶'), although this objection does not appear in later editions. A more recent editionButterfield (2015) p. 870 gives as examples the, at first glance, almost incomprehensible 'Bread and wine needs a man to fight and die' and 'Us enchants he, but eke frightens.' As ButterfieldButterfield (2015) p. 870 points out, 21st Century critics are more likely to be exercised by what is in many respects the opposite process, namely the incongruous use of modern vernacular in popular broadcast period dramas. An example of this is the number of web pages devoted to pointing out, and arguing over, anachronistic language in the popular British television programme Downton Abbey.Examples, among many others, include \\"Downton Abbey\\": Tracking the Anachronisms; Prochronisms: Downton Abbey, Season 4; Did You See This? Downton Abbey Anachronisms; Downton Abbey Anachronisms, Season Finale edition; More linguistic anachronism in Downton Abbey Although much of this is probably accidental,To give a visual, rather than linguistic example, the presence of a plastic water bottle on a mantlepiece in a publicity photograph was certainly inadvertent. See BBC: Downton Abbey: Plastic bottle appears in promotional photo unlike the deliberate Wardour Street English, the producers have agreed that the language has been modernized in order to allow modern audiences to \\"relate to\\" the characters.Daily Telegraph: Downton Abbey producer admits language is dumbed down to make characters sound more 'like us' See also *Archaism References Bibliography *Anonymous (1890).

De Barth was aided by Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and Alexander Hamilton, the first two hoping to sell their Ohio Valley lands to the Frenchman. De Barth showed his appreciation with gifts to Jefferson from France and the American frontier, including a French art book, buffalo skin, and rather mysterious \\"tooth of a carnivorous elephant.\\" De Barth and his followers were aristocrats and city merchants, not pioneer material, and struggled with land speculators, Indians, and the wilderness. The aging de Barth soon moved on, purchasing a manor at Springettsbury in Philadelphia. This unfortunately turned out to be an even more dangerous move; shortly thereafter he succumbed to the 1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic, and his home became a hospital for the treatment of victims of yellow fever. (Note: the records conflict on the manor location within the Springettsbury estate, one specifying the Bush Hill estate, while others contradict that.) Jean Joseph de Barth was buried at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia). The count's lands included 10,000 acres on the Elk River in what is now West Virginia. This land passed to his son, General John Baptiste de Barth Walbach, for whom the town of Wallback, West Virginia and the Wallback Wildlife Management Area are named. Walbach, the oldest officer to ever serve in the U.S. Army, had in his long career commanded most American eastern seacoast forts and became adjutante general of the United States. Another of de Barth's sons, Rev. Adolphus Louis de Barth, was vicar general and administrator of the diocese of Philadelphia, and established several early frontier Catholic churches. A daughter, Marie-Antoinette de Barth, became Mother Edmond-Paul, Abbotess of the Cistercian nuns of Notre-Dame-de- la-Misericorde at Koenigsbruck Abbey in the Forest of Haguenau. In 1795, the Alsatian home that the de Barth family fled to escape the guillotine was purchased by industrialist Andre Hartmann, and later was the beginning of the beautiful Albert Schweitzer Park.

Career  Without any formal training, she started her own business Betty Joel Ltd. with her husband David Joel, with a furniture workshop, initially located on Hayling Island and retailing through her shop in Sloane Street. She began to design furniture, using the expertise of the local craftsmen from around local area who had previously worked as yacht fitters and specialized the traditional boat building woods, oak and teak. The designs were first retailed through their showroom in London at 177 Sloane Street and then at 25 Knightsbridge. The larger premises allowed them to show a wider range of items and to hold art exhibitions. Exhibitions included rugs by Ivan da Silva Bruhns, the French artist, drawings by Matisse and paintings by Marie Laurencin. She began to design her own rugs which she had made in Tianjin, China and textiles which were manufactured in France. Her work in both furniture and textiles was distinctive for the use of curved lines and curvilinear shapes. In 1938 she created a study for Lord Mountbatten's Park Lane, London home and a bedroom for the 2nd Countess of Iveagh at Elveden Hall.

Between 1915 and 1918, he attended a number of schools including Bishop Crowther Memorial School. He was an active member of the school brass bands and took interest in playing the flute and side-drum. Later on in his life, he adopted the name Harcourt Whyte. His people, the Kalabaris relied on fishing and trading, and Ikoli as a child was trained in these skills. In 1919, he was diagnosed with leprosy after symptoms were first noticed in 1918. In the early 1920s, he was sent to Port Harcourt General Hospital where he developed his talent in music and went on to form a vocalist band with forty other lepers. In 1932, he was transferred to Uzuakoli Leprosy Hospital, Bende Division, Eastern Nigeria where he met doctor-reverend-musician T.F. Davey from England. Whyte was encouraged by Davey, who took him on village survey tours to collect various traditional sounds.

He has represented Acre in the Federal Senate since 2015. Previously, he was a deputy from Acre from 2007 to 2015. He is a member of the Progressive Party. He has been implicated in the Petrobras scandal. Cameli is the governor of Acre, having been elected in the first round of the 2018 election.Gladson Cameli, do PP, √© eleito governador do Acre Biography Gladson Cameli, son of El√°dio Messias Cameli and Maria Lindomar de Lima Cameli, attended elementary school at Escola S√£o Jos√©, in Cruzeiro do Sul, his hometown, between 1985 and 1992. In Manaus, he attended high school at Instituto Batista do Amazonas (IBA), completed in 1995. At the age of 19, he was trained in fluency in English by the EF International School of English, in the UK, and started a course in Civil Engineering at the Lutheran Institute of Higher Education in Manaus, completed in 2001. Married to lawyer Ana Paula Correia da Silva Cameli and father of Guilherme Correia Cameli, Gladson became a partner at Marmud Cameli Cia Ltda, his family's company, in 1997. In addition, the former senator also served as Technical Responsible of Construtora ETAM Ltda of Manaus in 2005. Political Career Gladson Cameli, a member of the Municipal Youth Council, joined the PFL during (2000-2003) and the PPS during (2003-2005). However, he began his political trajectory at the age of 28 as a member of the PP, in which he joined in 2005, elected for the first time to the mandate of federal deputy (2007-2011) with 18,886 votes. In the 2010 elections, he was re-elected as deputy (2011-2015) with more than 30 thousand votes. In October 2009, he was awarded the title of Citizen Rio Branquense by the City Council of Rio Branco / AC. In 2014, during the electoral campaign, two of the three polls released by Ibope in Acre pointed to Gladson Cameli's victory. On the election date, Gladson achieved victory for the senatorial position, with about 218,756 votes. However, the then-senator-elect did not complete his term in the legislature, being licensed to exercise the post of governor of the state of Acre after the 2018 elections, in which he already won in the first round over candidates Marcus Alexandre (PT), Colonel Ulysses (PSL), Jana√≠na Furtado (Rede) and David Hall (Avante). Gladson Cameli's victory breaks the existing PT hegemony in the state of Acre for about 20 years. In 2016, the then senator voted in favor of the Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff and the PEC on the Ceiling of Public Spending. Gladson also voted in favor of labor reform in July 2017, and stood against A√©cio Neves' impeachment on the Senate's ethics board. Cameli's political career is marked by family political heritage, as he is the nephew of former state governor Orleir Cameli, who died in 2013, who ruled between 1995 and 1999.

It was situated at F√∂rsta L√•nggatan nr 10 in the Masthugget area in Gothenburg. The area contained a building for public balls and concerts as well as a park, and was used for balls, concerts, fire works, military parades and all sorts of artists performances against an entrance fee. History Initially, a tavern was managed on the spot by Carsten Vogdt or Voegt (d. 1678), which was made into a country villa by the wealthy Amija merchant family in 1686, as it was then a bit outside of town. In 1745, the house was bought by Johan Bartram Kitz (1712-1759), who established a restaurant in the garden, known as Kitziska tr√§dg√•rden (Kitzian Gardens), which also included tobacco gardens and fishponds. The Vauxhall was founded when the Kitzian Gardens were bought by Peter Lamberg, who wished to found an establishment of the same kind as the Vauxhall Gardens in London, which were famous at the time and had inspired similar establishments in many European capitals: the capital of Stockholm had its own Vauxhall in Kungstr√§dg√•rden in 1772. At the time, Gothenburg was a big and important city dominated by a very wealthy merchant class, but with few public pleasure establishments outside of the concerts given in the city hall and the cathedral from 1756 onward, and the occasional travelling theater companies and other artists passing temporarily through town. The Vauxhall of Gothenburg was inaugurated 15 August 1773 with a concert in the gardens for a fee of 1 daler silver. The establishment was a part of a greater demand of entertainment in Gothenburg: in 1774, regular public balls was arranged in the city hall, and in 1779, the first permanent theater, Comediehuset, was founded. Vauxhall was reserved for the upper classes: people of the low status classes, such as servants, were not admitted to the gardens even if they could pay the fee. The Vauxhall arranged masquerades, fire works, and performances by actors, athletes, circus artists and all sorts of artists passing through town. It was frequented by the rich burgher class and particularly popular among the officers of Gothenburg. The clients took walks in the park, had dinner, listened to a concert, often with a singer as well, watched a performance of some kind, and danced. The house of the park could also be hired for private celebrations by both private citizens as well as societies, often to celebrate royal events. Vauxhall was opened every day of the week, by Sundays was a special \\"Vauxhall- day\\" when something special was generally arranged in the park, often fire works. On 24 September 1774 as well as in 1779, the future Charles XIII of Sweden and Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp visited Gothenburg and were celebrated by the burghers of Gothenburg in Vauxhall, and on 12 July 1786, king Gustav III of Sweden and the crown prince were celebrated with a grand party in the Vauxhall arranged by the burghers of the town. In 1802, the Vauxhall was no longer fashionable and the selling of tickets was discontinued. In the 1820s, the park was destroyed and divided into residential areas, and in 1906, the Vauxhall building was torn down.

It seems to have earlier been titled ·π≠up≈°enna pitƒìma, or \\"Open the Tablet Box\\" after its incipit (opening line) and was re-titled Naram-Sin and the Enemy Hordes, after its subject matter by its last Babylonian editor. It is named after Naram-Sin of Akkad ‚Äì a prominent monarch of the late 3rd millennium BCE, under whose suzerainty the Akkadian empire reached its zenith, and the Cutheans (or inhabitants of Kutha), the Cuthean Legend is a morality tale told for didactic purposes, rather than an epic grounded in historical events. In this respect it is unlike, for example, similar works like The Great Revolt Against Naram-Sin. Cuthean Legend follows a traditional tripartite structure: introduction, narrative of events, blessing/cursing formula, common among similar pseudo-autobiographical nar√ª- literature. Naram-Sin is the protagonist and his foes are the Umman Manda (or UmmƒÅn-Manda), variously described as Hurrians from Malgium, cave-dwellers and demonic bird-like creatures, depending on which version of the epic is consulted. The text The tale evolved over time while the actual text seems to have shrunk from a two-tablet epic of 600 lines in the Old Babylonian period to a single tablet of 180 lines in the late period, albeit with lines lengthier than the short truncated ones of the earlier period. It opens: The text then harkens back to the time of Enmerkar, the legendary Sumerian founder of Uruk, who offended the gods by not heeding their omens and whose failure to leave a memorial of his achievements caused Naram-Sin to be unable to pray for him. The enemy hordes are created by the great gods, with Belet-ili their progenitress and Tiamat their wet nurse. Led by seven kings, and numbering 360,000 troops, the hordes begin their conquests of the Mesopotamian hinterlands. Naram-Sin dispatches a scout to prick them with a pin to determine whether they bleed. This he confirms concluding that they are mortal. He conducts extispicy with seven sacrificial lambs representing each of the antagonists' kings. Receiving an unfavorable omen, in an act of sheer hubris he brazenly repudiates it, \\"I will cast aside that (oracle) of the gods; I will be in control of myself\\" and sends forth three armies over three years, each one of which is annihilated. Naram-Sin sinks into a deep depression in which he doubts his legacy. At the New Year's Festival, he promises to mend his ways, acting only in accordance with the will of the gods. He receives assent to pursue enemy soldiers and captures 12 of them, but, in obedience with the will of the gods, does not punish them. Once again, he consults the diviners with seven lambs but this time does not disregard its outcome. Ishtar warns: \\"Destroy not the brood of destruction! In future days, Enlil will summon them for evil.\\" In a long passage she describes their purpose. Finally, Naram-Sin admonishes future rulers, describing his warning to them to heed the omens of the gods, recorded on a stela in a tablet box which he left in the Emeslam, Nergal's temple in Kutha, to protect themselves but at all costs to avoid or appease the hordes of Enlil. He concludes with a call for pacifism, to \\"tie up your weapons and set(them) in the corners!\\", ignoring enemies that might ravage their lands and to leave an account of their lives for posterity.

It is also known as SARME, for Surgically Assisted Rapid Maxillary Expansion. It is a technique in the field of orthodontics which is used to expand the maxillary arch. This technique is a combination of both Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Orthodontics. This procedure is primarily done in adult patients whose maxillary sutures are fused and cannot be expanded via other techniques.  History  Orthodontic expansion was first described by Emersen Angell about 145 years ago. Kole in 1959 was the first person to speak about the procedure of corticotomy in adults with maxillary constriction. Brown first described the surgical technique for SARPE in 1938. Steinhauser first described the technique involving the segmental left/right split of maxilla along with placement of the graft in 1972.  Indications  * Skeletal Maturity or Adult Patients * Fused Intermaxillary Suture * Transverse maxillary hypoplasia * Bilateral posterior crossbite * Previous failure of use of any other expansion devices *Dental crowding due to lack of space in the maxilla to accommodate all the teeth of the upper arch *Obstructive Sleep Apnea (in patients with a narrow palate)  Procedure  SARPE is performed to address the transverse dimension changes in a patient. Sometimes this surgery is followed by Le Fort 1 in a second surgery to address the vertical and the anterior-posterior changes. Between the two surgeries, a patient's constricted maxillary arch is expanded with the rapid maxillary expander device placed in the maxilla. For the first surgery, under local anaesthesia and iv sedation or general anesthesia, a patient first goes through Le Fort fracture of skull without the downfracture of maxilla. The oral surgeon also performs the midpalatal osteotomy to allow the break in the inter-maxillary suture. The surgeon, while performing the LeFort 1 osteotomy, may separate the pterygoid plates during this procedure. This separation of the plates is termed as Pterygomaxillary disjunction (PMD). Some of the surgeons are cautious in their approach to separate the pterygoid processes due to a risk of injury to pterygoid plexus. Sangsari et al. published a systematic review and a meta-analysis in 2016 which studied the effects of PMD on the outcome of SARPE. From the 3 studies that were included in their criteria, they concluded that the literature is inconclusive regarding the effect of PMD on the outcomes of SARPE and that further controlled trials are needed.  Stability of procedure  Chamberland and Profitt in 2011 published a paper in AJODO which looked at long-term and short-term effects of SARPE procedure. The procedure of SARPE was done with pterygoid plate separation to achieve the transverse expansion of the maxilla. The authors observed skeletal changes of about 3-4mm and these changes were stable. In an earlier study published in 2008, the same authors stated that about one-third of the transverse dental expansion obtained with SARPE is lost, however the skeletal expansion remains the same. They also stated that post-surgical relapse with SARPE was similar to the changes in dental arch dimensions after non-surgical rapid palatal expansion, and also quite similar to dental arch changes after segmental maxillary osteotomy for expansion. Therefore, the stability of the procedure is not superior to other known expansion techniques. Contrary to the newer studies, a study performed in 1997 by Northway et al. stated that the long-term buccogingival expansion was more acceptable in adults expanded with surgical augmentation than in those expanded orthopedically. However, a setback of this study was that the measurements were dental on dental models of patients, and not PA Cephalograms that were used in the study done by Profitt.  Disadvantages  * Unaesthetic period after the expansion with RME * Implementation of palatal expander post- operatively * Patient compliance is necessary * Second surgery likely References Orthodontics ","title":"Surgically Assisted Rapid Palatal Expansion"},{"id":"51318939","text":"David Valter (born 7 January 1970 in P≈ô√≠lepy) is a Czech sport shooter.

This species was described in 1861 by the French naturalist Francis de Laporte de Castelnau. Distribution This species is found in the southern third of Africa where it inhabits the Quanza, Cunene, Okavango, upper Zambezi, Kafue and Congo River basins. In the Congo River basin, it is only known from the southernmost part of the Kasai system and the lower Luapula. Description H. cuvieri can be distinguished from Hepsetus odoe as it has a lower count of gill rakers on the first gill arch, of 8‚Äì13 as opposed to 14‚Äì21; a normally higher number of scales between the lateral line and the dorsal fin, 10.5‚Äì11.5 as opposed to 7.5‚Äì10.5; a typically higher number of scales from the adipose fin and the lateral line, 6.5‚Äì7.5 as opposed to 4.5‚Äì6.5; and a distinctive colour pattern characterized by a mottled appearance of the dark brown blotches on the lateral surface of the body versus distinct vertical brown stripes in that region in H. odoe. This species reaches maturity at a standard length of and the maximum recorded size is . Biology H. cuvieri prefers quiet, deep water, such as channels and oxbow lakes; the juveniles and fry inhabit dense marginal vegetation. The adults are mainly piscivorous while juveniles feed on smaller prey such as invertebrates and small fish. H. cuvieri is a lurking, ambush predator found in marginal swamps and lagoons of large floodplain rivers.A Survey of the Fishes of Upper Okavango River System in Angola. Authors: Roger Bills, Paul Skelton and Francisco Almeida. South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity (SAIAB) 2012. Investigational Report No. 73. It breeds over the summer months, spawning more than once in a free- floating bubblenest which the adults guard; it is relatively short-lived, only living for 4‚Äì5 years. Immediately before spawning, the male and female pair up and become territorial, building large bubblenests amongst surface vegetation. They deposit the eggs into the nest and the fry move to the base of the nest upon hatching. Here they attach themselves via a gland on the top of their heads. The nest is guarded by the parents up to the point of hatching. The fry remain attached to the nest for around 4 days after which point they begin to disperse, as the nest starts to disintegrate. The fry continue to use on the sticky gland on their heads to attach themselves to pieces of vegetation etc., for a short time. Hepsetus cuvieri lives in the more unpredictable seasonal swamp and has flexible spawning times because their bubblenests allow them to reproduce even when levels of dissolved oxygen are low, so they do not have a distinct breeding season. Hepsetus cuvieri overlaps in its distribution and habitat with the African tigerfish Hydrocynus vittatus and there is also a large degree of overlap in prey. The tigerfish prefers open, better oxygenated water and hunts by rapid pursuit of prey while H. cuvieri prefers dense vegetation where it is an ambush predator. H. vittatus is also known to prey on H. cuvieri, while it is almost unknown for H. cuvieri to prey on tigerfish. Taxonomy Formerly considered as a synonym of Hepsetus odoe sensu lato but that species has now been split into a number of species with H. cuvieri as the southernmost species of Hepsetus.

He is best known for extending the Pandya rule to the Chera country (Kerala). He was succeeded by his son Maravarman Arikesari Parankusan.  Names  Jayantavarman (of the Smaller Sinnamanur Plates) is described as Seliyan Sendan in the Velvikkudi Grant. Sendan is the Tamil form of the Sanskrit name \\"Jayantan\\". The Velvikkudi Grant uses the Chera title \\"Vanavan\\" for Sendan. This probably signifies his victory over a Chera king (or the extension of the Pandya rule to the Chera country).  Dates  * K. A.

Raman ‚Äî ascension year = 653 CE. * Noboru Karashima ‚Äî c. 620-650 CE (or) c. 654-670 CE  Life and career  Jayantavarman was the son and successor of Maravarman Avanisulamani. T. V. S. Pandarathar identified him as the king who ruled in Madurai, when the Chinese traveler Xuanzang visited Kanchipuram. The rock-cut cave temple at Malaiyadikurichi in Tirunelveli district is ascribed to Jayantavarman's reign. This inscription is dated to the 17th regnal year of \\"Maran Sendan\\", and states that the cave was excavated by an officer under the royal order. It was discovered in 1959, and is written in mixed Tamil Brahmi and Vatteluttu. Another inscription ascribed to Jayantavarman was discovered in Vaigai riverbed at Madurai by a washerman, who used it for washing clothes. K. V. Raman noticed it in 1961. This inscription is dated to the 50th regnal year of \\"Sendan\\". The Sanskrit portion of this script is written in Grantha script, while the Tamil portion is written in Vatteluttu script. According to this record, Sendan performed several charitable donations (maha-dana) including hiranyagarbha and tulabhara. He commissioned a sluice to the Vaigai river, and named it Arikesariyan (apparently after his heir-apparent Arikesari). He also founded the city of Mangalapura. The Velvikkudi Grant states that Ko Chadaiyan Ranadhira, a later Pandya king, attacked and defeated certain maharathas (warriors?) at the city of Mangalapura. Historians generally tend to identify Mangalapura with present-day Mangalore. K. V.

After Copland had written the score, Robbins reneged on his commitment and the performance did not take place. Three years later, Copland revised the score for a ballet by the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, Germany, where it premiered on 3 December 1963. The ballet was performed by the New York City Ballet in 1965 and the concert version received its first performance at the Ojai Music Festival the following year. According to Copland biographer Howard Pollack, Dance Panels has proven from a musical standpoint one of the composer's more accessible late scores. While some of its more dissonant moments sound similar to Copland's twelve-tone compositions, other parts recall his earlier stage and screen music. It is also the only one of Copland's six ballets not written to a specific program. Background Aaron Copland wrote Dance Panels in 1959 on a commission from Jerome Robbins and his \\"Ballets: U.S.A.\\" company. This company was sponsored through the American National Theatre and Academy (ANTA), a United States government agency set up to represent American art abroad. According to Pollack, Robbins had wanted to work with Copland on a ballet since 1944, following his Broadway success with Leonard Bernstein's ballet Fancy Free, and had a proposed a similar scenario to Copland at that time. In Copland Since 1943, the composer dates their desire to collaborate on a ballet at 1954, when Robbins directed the premiere of his opera The Tender Land at the New York City Opera. At the beginning of 1959, Robbins suggested two options to Copland, a ballet based on The Dybbuk and a non-programmatic ballet. Copland opted for the latter. Robbins then volunteered an outline that he tentatively called Theatre Waltzes: > The originating idea is to do a ballet with presents the style, youth, > technical competence, theatrical qualities and personalities of the company > [Ballets: U.S.A.] in pure dance terms. The technique is essentially classic > ballet (in the way that Americans employ it) and to make the whole ballet a > declarative statement‚Äîopen, positive, inventive, joyous (rather than > introspective)‚Äîa parade; a presentation; perhaps elegant, witty, tender and > with a sure technique. > The ballet should be a chamber work in effect, both on stage as well as in > the pit: the form, number of people and the quality of the atmosphere > intimate and clear. It should say, this is Dance; it's the way we use our > European heritage (classic technique) in America. At the top of his proposal to Copland, Robbins wrote, \\"These are only ideas,\\" Pollack writes that the choreographer \\"went on to suggest over twenty different types of waltzes, including 'circus waltz' and 'tea-room waltz'; at the same time, he recognizes the advantages of working with 'more abstract and evocative' forms.\\" Copland finished the ballet in early 1959, in the hope the work would be premiered at that year's Spoleto Festival in Florence, Italy. However, Robbins, to the dismay of ANTA, decided not to stage Dance Panels. While the choreographer claimed at the time that he did not receive the full score until the day before the troupe was to leave for Italy, both he and the composer had found the music had not turned out as either person had anticipated. Robbins later wrote that the score was \\"much more serious and difficult than I had expected....I realized that because of fatigue from my work on [the musical] Gypsy...it would be foolhardy to attempt it if I rushed into rehearsal without assimilating the score.\\" Copland wrote that Dance Panels \\"sat on the shelf\\" until the Bavarian State Opera approached him in 1962 for a ballet to stage at the opening of their new house that November. Once that offer came, the composer revised the score, partly in hope that Robbins could still choreograph it. Robbins again refused. Composition =Instrumentation= In keeping with Robbins' request for an intimate setting, Copland scored Dance Panels initially for six woodwinds and five brass. Even when he revised the score, the composer kept, in his words, to \\"a moderate-sized orchestra of six woodwinds, five brass, two percussion (but no timpani) and strings.\\" =Form= A typical performance of the ballet version lasts approximately 30 minutes. The concert version lasts 23 minutes. The music in both versions is \\"essentially the same,\\" Copland says; the difference in performance time arises from the number of extended pauses in the first section when the music is danced. The ballet is divided into seven sections, played without pause. # Introduction: Moderato. A quiet opening with long sustained notes, written in a slow waltz tempo. # Allegretto con tenerezza. A continuation of the waltz rhythm, with \\"charm and delicacy, involvements, hesitations and swirlings.\\" # Scherzando. Light and transparent. # Pas de trois. Marked \\"Somewhat hesitant, melancholic and naive.\\" # Con brio. Another scherzo-like section, infused, as Copland phrased it \\"by brisk rhythms and jazzy drum patterns.\\" # Con moto. A brief lyrical interlude, marked \\"menacing\\" and later \\"eloquent.\\" # Molto ritmico. The finale begins, according to Copland, \\"by suggesting flight and hectic emotions.\\". Written in jagged, irregular rhythms, the music is alternately joyous and frenetic. It ends quietly with material similar to the opening of the piece. Overall, Copland called the music \\"simple and direct.... The lyrical parts are very diatonic ... while the lively and bouncy parts have more complexity of texture.\\" In Music Since 1900, musicologist Nicolas Slonimsky notes the work as \\"built in a translucidly intricate polyphonic reticle.\\" Pollack points out that, while the composer acceded to Robbins' demand for music based on waltzes, he employed a stylized approach, which gave the vague feeling of the dance rather than an overt evocation. =Significance of title= The ballet was variously titled Music for J.R., Music for a Ballet, The Dream and Ballet in Seven Movements before Copland settled upon Dance Panels: Ballet in Seven Sections. The idea for the final title, Copland said, was from the ballet being in seven continuous sections, \\"like the panels on a screen.\\" =Resemblance to other Copland works= Dance Panels, Copland writes, is different from his earlier ballets‚Äî\\"more abstract ... lyrical and slower in tempo than most of my other ballet music.\\" he also claimed he did not use any American folk melodies in it, though two sections contained aspects of \\"the quiet sentimental song and a type of stage music used for 'tap dancing.'\\" Butterworth writes that, while the second section \\"is one the few passages similar to the pastoral movements in the three 'cowboy' ballets,\\" no melodic or harmonic material elsewhere in the work resembles a Western setting The quasi-folk songs and country dances indicative of those works, he adds, are likewise absent. However, a passing resemblance to the fifth movement, Jingo, of Copland's Statements for orchestra, occurs in the third section. Pollack calls Dance Panels one \\"of the most accessible scores of [Copland's] later years.\\" He adds that some sections are reminiscent of the composer's earlier stage and screen music, while others seem to presage Copland's 12-tone scores such as Connotations and Inscape in their thick textures and harmonic dissonance. Reception Copland conducted the world premiere of Dance Panels on December 3, 1963 at the Bavarian State Opera. While the work \\"was greeted with great applause,\\" the composer was disappointed with the choreography by Heintz Rosen. He said he felt Rosen lacked \\"feeling for the American quality of the music.\\" George Balanchine considered choreographing the work for its United States premiere with the New York City Ballet but eventually gave the task to his assistant, John Taras. Since Taras knew the composer was open to having the ballet mounted either with or without a story, he adopted one by Scott Burton. In it, two lovers meet in a cemetery, where their dancing is interrupted by various others buried there. Titled Shadow'd Ground, the work was performed at the then-new Lincoln Center on January 21, 1965. It was neither a popular nor critical success. Copland remained concerned how the music would fare unstaged. The concert premiere, under Ingolf Dahl and the Ojai Festival Orchestra on May 24, 1966, proved this fear unfounded. Pollack writes, \\"As a concise, plotless, beautifully crafted ballet ... Dance Panels easily accommodated itself to the concert format\\" and enjoyed \\"considerably more success than it has on the stage.\\" It has since been recorded under the direction of Leonard Slatkin, Dennis Russell Davies and the composer himself.

Polyorthoesters are formed by transesterification of orthoesters with diols or by polyaddition between a diol and a diketene acetal, such as 3,9-diethylidene-2,4,8,10-tetraoxaspiro[5.5]undecane.N.N.: Polymers as biomaterials. (online auf: usm.edu)  Applications  Polyorthoesters are used as hydrophobic implant materials for drug depots for continuous drug delivery by surface erosion. The active ingredient (which is homogeneously dispersed in a matrix of polyorthoester) should be released as evenly as possible into the human or animal organism over an extended period of time in a zero-order release kinetics. Four classes of polyorthoesters (polyorthoesters type I - IV) are well characterized as biodegradable polymers for drug implants, primarily through work of Jorge Heller (1927-2009).  Production  = 1st generation polyorthoester (POE I) = Polyorthoester type I is (usually) obtained by transesterification of an Œ±,œâ-diol with 2,2-diethoxytetrahydrofuran (synthesized from Œ≥-butyrolactone and triethylorthoformate). :POE-I-Polyaddition In polycondensation small molecules are formed (in this case of ethanol), which have to be removed from the equilibrium to achieve the necessary molar mass of the polymer for the use as an implant material. The solid polyorthoester type I is hydrophobic and particularly acid-sensitive. In an aquatic environment it autocatalytically hydrolysis in an uncontrolled fashion. Therefore, it must be stabilized by adding an alkaline pharmaceutical excipient when used as an implant material. The degradation of the polymer chain sets free the initial diol and Œ≥-butyrolactone, which is further hydrolyzed to 4-hydroxybutanoic acid. The 4-hydroxybutanoic acid formed is responsible for the locally lowered pH value upon polymer degradation. :POE-I-Degradation The commercial use of polyorthoester type I was prevented by the required addition of a base (e.g. sodium carbonate), the difficult synthesis and its unsatisfactory mechanical properties. = 2nd generation polyorthoesters (POE II) = Polyorthoesters type II are formed by polyaddition of a Œ±,œâ-diol and the diketene acetal 3,9-diethylidene-2,4,8,10-tetraoxaspiro[5.5]undecane (DETOSU). The polyaddition forms much more quickly high molecular weight polymers than the transesterification does and in contrast to polyorthoester type I no small molecules are released. For the reaction, the monomers are dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and small amounts of an acidic catalyst are added, e. g. p-toluenesulfonic acid. The molecular weight of the polymers can be controlled by the molar ratio of the reactants. The addition of triols leads to crosslinked polymers, whereas the crosslinking density is determined by the ratio of triol/diol. The polymerization takes already place rapidly at room temperature and ambient pressure and allows the formation of a polymer matrix in the presence of sensitive pharmaceutically active agents. POE-II-Synthese The solid polyorthoester type II polymers are very hydrophobic, storable in the dry and significantly less sensitive to acid than polyorthoester type I. The pH-sensitivity (and thus the rate of degradation in physiological media) as well as the glass transition temperature (and thus the mechanical and thermal properties) can be controlled through the use of diols of different chain flexibility. polyorthoester type II with molecular weights of up to about 100,000 have therefore a glassy-hard (e. g. when using the rigid 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol) to semi-soft consistency (when using the flexible 1,6-hexanediol). In the aqueous medium a two-stage, non-autocatalytic hydrolysis takes place, initially generating neutral fragments (pentaerythritol dipropionate and the diol). POE II-Degradation The propionic acid produced in the second step is metabolized so rapidly that a local lowering of the pH value does occur. Therefore, to accelerate polymer degradation acidic additives must be added (such as octanedioic acid, hexanedioic acid or 2-methylidenebutanedioic acid). Zero-order release kinetics were achieved when embedding the cytostatic agent 5-fluorouracil. In toxicity tests as specified in the US Pharmacopeia USP polyorthoester preparations were found to be acutely nontoxic in cellular, intradermal, systemic and intramuscular implants. = 3rd generation polyorthoester (POE III) = polyorthoester type III is prepared just like POE I by transesterification, in this case a triol (preferably 1,2,6-hexanetriol) with an orthoester (e. g. triethylorthoacetate). POE III-Synthese korr. The triethylorthoacetate reacts initially to the corresponding cyclic orthoester with the vicinal hydroxyl groups of the 1,2,6-hexanetriol, which is homopolymerized to polyorthoester type III by reaction with the 6-position hydroxyl group. Polyorthoesters type III are at room temperature semi-solid to ointment-like due to the very flexible polymer backbone. They allow the incorporation of thermally labile and solvent-sensitive active ingredients at room temperature without the use of organic solvents. Such drug implants are particularly suitable for applications on the eye, where no sudden release occurs by diffusion (initial burst release) but the release follows the continuous polymer degradation. Also for Polyorthoesters type III the degradation occurs at the surface by cleavage of the hydrolytically labile bonds in the polymer backbone. POE III-Degradation Depending on the initial bond cleavage on the quaternary carbon atom 1-, 2-, or 6-acetoxy-hexanetriol is formed, which is further degraded to acetic acid and 1,2,6-hexanetriol. The use of polyorthoester type III for biomedical applications is severely limited by the lengthy synthesis of polymers having useful molecular weights and poor reproducibility. = 4th generation polyorthoesters: POE IV = The polyorthoester type IV is a further development of the type polyorthoester type II, which is formed of the diketene acetal DETOSU with a diol which is modified by short sequences of polyglycolide or polylactide. Depending on the type of diol used polyorthoester type IV can be synthesized as gel (with a low glass transition temperature Tg, meaning low molecular weight) or as a solid. Polyorthoester type IV-types are also accessible under the very mild conditions of interfacial polycondensation. POE IV-Synthese Polyorthoester type IV avoids the addition of acidic excipients required in polyorthoester type II, which often diffuse uncontrolled out of the polymer matrix and thus lead to erratic degradation kinetics. During the degradation of the polyorthoesters polyorthoester type IV in aqueous media glycolic acid or lactic acid is produced, which further catalyze hydrolysis. POE IV-Degradation The degradation rate can be controlled by the proportion of glycolic or lactic acid in the sequence. Implants made of polyorthoester type IV show surface erosion while being highly biocompatible with degradation times from days to months and can thus also be used as a long-term drug depots, e. g. for the cytostatic agent 5-fluorouracil. Polyorthoesters type IV are considered the most promising members of this class as implant materials for controlled drug release.

In August 1855 Alexander Hertzen started to publish his first periodical, Polyarnaya Zvezda (Polar Star), the first issue of it still comprising the materials from the immigrant circles. He made another plea for a response. \\"The question of whether or not you'll provide us your support is crucial. Your response will give us the idea about the ripeness of social awareness in Russia... Without articles from Russia, without the Russian readership, the Polar Star won't be having reason enough for its existence... Surely, your silence won't shatter our belief in the Russian people and its future; it will only make us doubt the moral strength and the real worth of our own generation [of Russians].\\" The second, May 1856 issue of the paper featured for the first time a letter from Russia, but 190 pages of its 288 were still written by Hertzen. Kolokol, No. 186. 1864 1856 marked dramatic turn in fortunes for Free Russian Press. In April that year Nikolai Ogaryov arrived in London to join in with the enterprise. In the course of several weeks he managed to contact a large group of Russian authors, mostly belonging to the liberal intelligentsia. People like Konstantin Kavelin, Boris Chicherin and Nikolai Melgunov, who started to write to Hertzen, promptly gave him to understand that the only way for the publication out of quagmire would be to start addressing the widest possible range of the Russian readership, not just marginal radicals. In July 1856 Hertzen and Ogaryov launched another periodical, Voices from Russia (–ì–æ–ª–æ—Å–∞ –∏–∑ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏), moderate in its tone and appeal, and having little in common with the blatantly pro-revolutionary Polar Star. All of a sudden a flood of material rushed in from Russia. In March 1857 Hertzen and Ogaryov decided that they needed one more publication, the one that would be focusing more closely on current events. On 13 April the launch of a newspaper was announced, and on 22 June the first issue of Kolokol came out. Originally a supplement to the Polar Star, it quickly gained its own ground and became Hertzen and Ogaryov's major project.

In its heyday Kolokol was a weekly, its circulation reaching 5 thousand, an average one hundred letters a month arriving at its London office. The Free Russian Press published banned poems by Alexander Pushkin (including \\"The Ode to Liberty\\", \\"The Country\\", \\"Epistle to Siberia\\", and \\"To Chaadayev\\"), agitation songs by Kondraty Ryleyev and Alexander Bestuzhev, \\"Death of the Poet\\" by Mikhail Lermontov, some other work that had been until then circulating in hand- written form and would have been otherwise most certainly lost and forgotten.

The sensational confession by Catherine the Great concerning the birth of Pavel I (whose father, as she asserted, had been not Peter III, but Prince Sergei Saltykov), the document which had been sealed and hidden even from the members of the Imperial family, was also published by the Free Russian Press, as well as the revealing memoirs of Princess Dashkova and the senator Ivan Lopukhin. Even if the publications of the Free Russian Press were banned in Russia (as well as, due to the Russian government's pressure, in some parts of Europe, including Prussia and Saxony), many of them were making their way into Russia illegally, mainly through St. Petersburgh, Odessa, the Caucasian and the Chinese borders.

The Secrets Correspondent of the Polar Star. Mysl (Publishers). 1966. Obshcheye Veche, 15 July 1862. The first issue In the years prior to the 1861 Emancipation Act the Free Russian Press succeeded in drawing Alexander II's attention to several alternative projects of the land reform, including the one by Valerian Panayev, which was published in Voices from Russia. The early 1860s saw the Free Russian Press starting to lose its ground. For the new generation of revolutionaries in Russia it was not radical enough, some even saw it as 'half-legal'. With the ban on mentioning Hertzen's name having been by now lifted, sections of the Russian press went into open polemics with him. That Kolokol had become so important as to influence the Russian government's decisions, was now the fact. On the other hand, a huge section of liberal readership turned away from Kolokol after the 1862 Petersburg arsons, reputedly committed by 'nihilists', nurtured by 'the ideas of Hertzen and Chernyshevsky', as the conservative press was quick to maintain. In a desperate attempt to widen the range of its appeal the publishing house launched another paper, Obshcheye Veche (Common Council), written in simple language and aiming to cater for the semi-literate masses of Russians. Then came the controversial decision by Hertzen to endorse the 1863 Polish January Uprising, and the curtain started to fall on the history of Free Russian Press. By the winter of that year the circulation of Kolokol dropped to 5 hundred. Russian abroad stopped visiting Hertzen in London. In April 1865 Hertzen moved the Free Russian Press to Geneva and passed the ownership to the Polish emigre Ludvig Chernetsky, his closest associate, apart from Ogaryov, since 1853. For a while it looked like the crisis could be stalled but after the 1866 Dmitry Karakozov's assassination attempt and the repressive measures undertaken by the Russian government all ties that the FRP had maintained with Russia got severed. The last issue of Polar Star came out without any Russian correspondence at all. Kolokol tried to re-orient towards the European readership, and its several last issues came out in French. In August 1867 the Free Russian Press was closed. Chernetsky launched the completely new publishing house under the same name which, without making any significant mark, went on for three more years and folded in 1870, soon after Hertzen's death.–í–æ–ª—å–Ω–∞—è —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è —Ç–∏–ø–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—è.

Vinu Patel completed his primary and secondary education at an English-medium school within the local township and then completed his 12th grade at the Christ Church Boys Senior Secondary School. He then attended the College of Agriculture in his father's native town of Anand, Gujarat, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in agriculture. = Early inspiration for monastic order = During his college years (1951-1952), Vinu Patel first met Yogiji Maharaj, the spiritual successor of Shastriji Maharaj. Impressed by Yogiji Maharaj's life and teachings, Vinu traveled with Yogiji Maharaj during his summer vacations, and was inspired to enter the monastic life over the next few years.  Early years as a swami  Mahant Swami Maharaj performs the arti At age 23, on 2 February 1957, he received novitiate initiation, parshad diksha, and was renamed Vinu Bhagat. During this initial training phase, he accompanied Yogiji Maharaj on his travels, looking after his daily correspondence with devotees. At age 28, on 11 May 1961, Vinu Bhagat was given bhagwati diksha, initiated as a swami, in Gadhada and named Keshavjivandas Swami. He was one of 51 youths receiving initiation into the monastic order that day. This group of 51 was initially placed in Mumbai to study Sanskrit, with Swami Keshavjivandas appointed as their group head or Mahant at the mandir in Dadar, Mumbai. Thus, he became known throughout BAPS as Mahant Swami. = Service under Pramukh Swami Maharaj = He initially met Pramukh Swami Maharaj in 1951 and traveled extensively with him. After Guru Yogiji Maharaj's death in 1971, Mahant Swami Maharaj served under Pramukh Swami Maharaj. His austerity, self-control, devotion, humility and service earned him the blessings and joy of Yogiji Maharaj and Pramukh Swami Maharaj. In 1971, after the death of Yogiji Maharaj, he dedicated himself to Pramukh Swami Maharaj, the new guru, as he had to guru Yogiji Maharaj. His exposure to Pramukh Swami Maharaj had begun in 1951, when he first met him. Since 1971, as per the wishes and instructions of Pramukh Swami Maharaj, he has travelled throughout India and abroad to inspire and strengthen satsang in countless devotees. He has also offered his services during the BAPS mega-festivals, in children and youth activities, Akshardham projects, and other satsang activities.About Mahant Swami Maharaj on BAPS website  As the leader of BAPS  = Presidency = Pramukh Swami Maharaj had known that Mahant Swami would be his successor when the latter received initiation in 1957. On 20 July 2012, in the presence of senior swamis in Ahmedabad, Pramukh Swami Maharaj formally declared that Mahant Swami Maharaj would be his spiritual successor after his death and wrote a letter in his own handwriting to this effect. On 13 August 2016, he became the sixth spiritual successor in Swaminarayan's lineage of Gunatit gurus. In 2020, he wrote Satsang Diksha, a book where he describes a path which he believes will give its followers Moksha. = Honours = In 2017, he was presented with the key to the city by the mayors of various cities, including Toronto, Canada, Lilburn, Georgia, Irving, Texas,https://www.baps.org/Data/Sites/1/Media/GalleryImages/14424/WebImages/2017_08_20_Dallas_07_001.jpg and Chicago, Illinois.  Significance in BAPS  Followers of BAPS are told he is a manifestation of ontological entity of Akshar, the form of the eternal abode of God. As such, he is said to be in constant communion with God. He is to be considered by devotees as \\"the perfect servant of God, ‚Ä¶totally filled with God and therefore worthy of reverence and worship.\\":87-95 = Theological role = Mahant Swami Maharaj discoursing on the Vachanamrut BAPS teaches followers that the living guru is considered to be the ideal swami, the perfect devotee, and the principal exemplar for emulation by spiritual aspirants. He is described to followers as a personification of the scriptures:94. He is viewed as \\"fully brahmanized\\", or having achieved the ultimate level of spiritual development. Devotees are to consider him the example of all the ideals of the religion; he is to be viewed as the first disciple, most faithful in his observance of the commandments, most active in propagation of the religion, the best interpreter of the meaning of the scriptures, and the most effective in eradicating the ignorance that separates man from God. His conduct is hence to be considered as that of the \\"ideal saint\\" and \\"perfect bhakta (devotee)\\", providing a tangible and graspable example for the spiritual aspirant to follow. Devotees are to view his respect for his gurus (Yogiji Maharaj and Pramukh Swami Maharaj) to be the model of devotion to one's guru. Followers are to believe that by associating with him, they might rid themselves of their vices, baser instincts, and worldly attachments. Earning the grace of the guru, devotees are to believe, enables them to achieve liberation in which they would escape the cycle of births and deaths and attain Akshardham (God's divine abode). For a devotee of BAPS, he is to be considered the essential spiritual link with God. According to the teachings of Swaminarayan, the Akshar-Purushottam Darshan, devotees consider God (Swaminarayan) to be manifest through Mahant Swami Maharaj, the present form of Akshar on earth. Thus, BAPS followers are to believe that by offering devotion to the guru (the form of Akshar), they offer it to Swaminarayan himself.Brian Hutchinson (1998) The guru-devotee relationship in the experience of the members of the Akshar-Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha..

It is part of the municipality of Heerlen in the province of Limburg, about 20 km east of Maastricht. The village lies between Benzenrade and Simpelveld, next to the A76 motorway and the N281 provincial road. In 2014 the village had a population of 336 and was home to an immigration detention centre with space for 700 immigrants.  Etymology  Imstenrade shares its name with the family Emsenrade that used to own the local castle. \\"Em\\" means around, \\"sen\\" refers to a stone building, and \\"rode\\" is common part of village names in the Netherlands, often located close to forests. It refers to a region that was deforested for agriculture (Dutch: rooien). Imstenrade (gemeente Heerlen), Rijckheyt archives for the municipalities Brunssum, Gulpen-Wittem, Heerlen, Nuth, Simpelveld and Voerendaal, viewed on 13 August 2016  History  The remains of a Roman villa are located in the forest Imsteraderbos, officially in the neighbouring village of Benzenrade. In the 14th century there was a castle in Imstenrade owned by the family Emsenrode. The castle had a hunting forest and stood at least until the 17th century. Over het natuurgebied Imstenraderbos, Vereniging Natuurmonumenten, viewed on 13 August 2016 By the 19th century the estate only encompassed two farms and surrounding lands. In 1908 villa Imstenrade was built near the southern farm and in 1928 a park was added around the villa. The villa eventually became a female monastery of the Medical Mission Sisters, who also built several other buildings in the region, and later became private property again.  Culture  The village is home to villa Imstenrade which was built in 1908. Next to the villa is a monumental farmhouse with a water tower built in 1910. Woonhuis en watertoren, National monument registry, viewed on 13 August 2016 The farm and villa are located on the southern edge of the Imsteraderbos, a 65 hectare forest owned by Vereniging Natuurmonumenten. Originally 28 hectare it served as hunting grounds for castle Imstenrade. It was sold by the municipality to Vereniging Natuurmonumenten in 2010. There are trees that date back to the 18th century and as such the forest has some of the tallest European beeches in the Netherlands. One beech is particularly large with a girth of 5.33 meters measured at 1.3 meters of the ground.European beech in the woods of Imstenrader bos in Imstenrade, Monumental trees, viewed on 13 August 2016 The villa eventually became a female monastery of the Medical Mission Sisters, who raised a new monastery building next to the villa.

In 1993 the school moved to a new location in Kerkrade and the building became a home for the elderly with the name Parc Imstenrade.

professional wrestler currently signed to WWE, where she performs on the Raw brand under the ring name Nikki Cross. Cross previously wrestled on the independent circuit under the ring name Nikki Storm, most notably for Insane Championship Wrestling, Pro-Wrestling: EVE, Scottish Wrestling Entertainment, and Shimmer Women Athletes. She and Alexa Bliss are the first two-time Women's Tag Team Champions in WWE history.  Early life  Glencross was born and raised in Glasgow, Scotland, and graduated from the University of Glasgow with a Bachelor of Arts in history. She is also a qualified fitness instructor and personal trainer.  Professional wrestling career  = Independent circuit (2008‚Äì2015) = In September 2008, Glencross began training at the Scottish Wrestling Alliance, where she made her debut for the promotion, performing under the ring name Nikki Storm. In February 2010, she began working on the British independent circuit, and became a mainstay for promotions such as her debuting at the Insane Championship Wrestling (ICW), and Pro-Wrestling: EVE, where she held the Pro-Wrestling: EVE Championship three times. In 2013, Storm began touring in Japan with JWP Joshi Puroresu, and made some appearances for World Wonder Ring Stardom until the middle of the summer of 2015. In October 2013, Storm began wrestling for American all-female promotions Shimmer Women Athletes, Shine Wrestling and Women Superstars Uncensored. She has also wrestled for Global Force Wrestling (GFW), Absolute Intense Wrestling (AIW), World Wide Wrestling League (W3L), Queens of Combat, and World Xtreme Wrestling. = Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2014) = Glencross competed in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA)'s British Boot Camp 2, which began airing in October 2014, in which she was unsuccessful. = WWE =  SAnitY (2016‚Äì2018)  Glencross received a tryout with WWE in London during the autumn of 2015, and in April 2016, she was one of ten signees that had begun training at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida. She debuted for NXT on 22 April, during a live event. During a Facebook live video in August, she was introduced as Nikki Cross. She made her first televised appearance and in‚Äìring debut on 17 August episode of NXT under the name \\"Nikki Glencross\\", where she competed in a six-woman tag team match along with Carmella, and Liv Morgan, defeating Daria Berenato, Mandy Rose, and Alexa Bliss. Sanity member Alexander Wolfe during a live event in 2017 On 12 October episode of NXT, Cross returned as part of the debuting heel stable, Sanity, along with Alexander Wolfe, Eric Young, and Sawyer Fulton (who was later replaced by Killian Dain). She and Young accompanied Fulton and Wolfe for their winning effort against Bobby Roode and Tye Dillinger in the first round of the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic. One week later, Cross scored her first televised singles victory over Danielle Kamela, however, the decision was reversed when Cross continued to attack Kamela after the match. On 11 January 2017 episode of NXT, Cross came to the aid of NXT Women's Champion Asuka, who was being attacked by Peyton Royce and Billie Kay, before turning on Asuka and attacking her as well. As a result, Cross, Royce and Kay were placed in a four-way match at the NXT TakeOver: San Antonio event on 28 January, which Cross failed to win. In May, Cross participated in a number one contender's battle royal for Asuka's NXT Women's Championship, where she, Ruby Riot, and Ember Moon were attacked by Asuka for being the last competitors left in the match and as a result, all four of them were placed into a four‚Äìway championship match at NXT TakeOver: Chicago, which was later changed to a three‚Äìway match after Ember Moon suffered an injury. At the event, Cross failed to capture the title. In a rematch which was contested in a three‚Äìway elimination match once again against both women, Riot was the first eliminated before the match ended in a no contest as Cross and Asuka brawled backstage. This led to a last woman standing match (the first ever in WWE history) between the two women for the NXT Women's Championship on 28 June episode of NXT, in which Cross was once again defeated. On 19 August at NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III, Cross accompanied and helped Sanity to capture the NXT Tag Team Championships from The Authors of Pain. In October, Cross earned herself a spot for the fatal four‚Äìway match for the vacant NXT Women's Championship at NXT TakeOver: WarGames on 18 November, which was ultimately won by Ember Moon. In early 2018, Cross began a little winning streak, defeating Lacey Evans and Vanessa Borne. During the 2018 Superstar Shake-up her fellow stable partners Eric Young, Alexander Wolfe and Killian Dain were drafted to SmackDown, leaving Cross on NXT to work again as a singles competitor. Throughout the summer, Cross started a feud with Shayna Baszler over the NXT Women's Championship, which led to a match between the two at NXT TakeOver: Chicago, in which Cross was once again unsuccessful and was defeated by technical submission. After a short hiatus, Cross returned in August and she was placed in the Aleister Black attack storyline where she was revealed to be a witness as she was on the roof of the building at the time he was attacked. In September, Cross also started a short feud with Bianca Belair which led to a match between the two that ended in a double count‚Äìout. One month later, on 17 October episode of NXT, a rematch ended in a no contest, after Aleister Black returned and interrupted it to ask Cross who his attacker is. Johnny Gargano was eventually revealed as the attacker and her involvement in the storyline sparked a match between Cross and Gargano's wife Candice LeRae, whom she was able to defeat in a singles match at NXT TakeOver: WarGames. Cross wrestled her final match on 9 January 2019 episode of NXT, where she lost to Bianca Belair, officially ending the feud between the two as well.  Main roster debut (2018‚Äì2019)  On 6 November 2018 episode of SmackDown from Manchester, England, Cross made her surprise main roster debut by answering an open challenge from WWE SmackDown Women's Champion Becky Lynch, who defeated her in a non-title match. On 17 December 2018 episode of Raw, Cross was advertised as one of the six NXT wrestlers about to be moved to the main roster. On 14 January 2019 episode of Raw, Cross made her Raw debut, teaming with Bayley and Natalya in a winning effort against The Riott Squad (Liv Morgan, Ruby Riott and Sarah Logan). At the Royal Rumble, Cross entered her first Royal Rumble match at number 8, lasting nine minutes before being eliminated by the IIconics (Billie Kay and Peyton Royce). On 4 February episode of Raw, Cross and Alicia Fox were defeated by The Boss 'n' Hug Connection (Bayley and Sasha Banks) in a match to determine the final Raw entrants in the tag team Elimination Chamber match to determine the inaugural WWE Women's Tag Team Champions at the Elimination Chamber event. On 8 April (aired 24 April) on Worlds Collide, she took part in a triple threat match for the NXT UK Women's Championship won by defending champion Toni Storm.  Teaming with Alexa Bliss (2019‚Äì2020)  After not being mentioned during the 2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up, Cross was confirmed to have been drafted to the Raw brand on 8 May taping of Main Event (aired on 11 May). After weeks without appearing on Raw, Cross returned on 13 May in a backstage scene with Alexa Bliss; this marked a change in her character, who appeared calmer and more collected than during her time in NXT. In the segment, Cross, seemingly sad and claiming that nobody even noticed that she had joined Raw, appeared to bond with Bliss, whose ring gear had been lost, and accepted to fill in for her in her upcoming match; Cross won her match later that night, a fatal four-way match against Dana Brooke, Naomi, and Natalya. This was her first match on Raw since February. She later unsuccessfully took part in the Money in the Bank ladder match at the Money in the Bank event, having replaced Bliss who suffered an injury. After the event, Cross, having become Bliss' \\"best friend\\", started acting as her manager and tag team partner, starting on 19 May episode of Raw during which she, Bliss and Becky Lynch defeated Lacey Evans and the IIconics.

These legal advantages are defined as Tribal Sovereignty which are based upon existing laws and treaties to ensure that U.S. state governments and the U.S. federal government live up to their legal obligations to the Native American Tribal Nations. NAVF's vision is to help all tribal nations become economically self-sufficient by providing access to business opportunities, capital, training and mentor-ship. NAVF purpose / inspiration Native American Nations have been in a constant battle to maintain their sovereign rights to protect their lands, distinct culture, society and even way of life. With media headlines focused on a small percentage of tribes succeeding in their casino operations, such as the Seminole Tribe of Florida's potential $3B state-tribal gaming compact, the Native American mascot controversy or Hollywood's portrayal of mafia like, corruption of a tribal business operated by the fictional Ugaya Tribe in an episode of \\"House of Cards,\\" there has been huge misconception in the portrayal of Native American Nations as a powerful, diverse and sustainable conglomerate, given, the reality could not be further from the truth. Taking a closer look, a crisis within Native America is ever mounting, from high school dropout rates (33%), extreme reservation poverty (25%) drug addiction (39%), lack of healthcare access (42%), compounded by a lack of economic opportunities has led to mortality rates by Alcoholism and Diabetes 220% and 220%, respectively, above the national average. Sadly, this has led to an average life expectancy in some US regions of Native American's are as low as 49 years of age, according to recent US Census and CDC data. These systemic issues facing Native America will not be solved by the politicians, non- profits, philanthropic endeavors or governmental agencies which affect 567 Federally Recognized Tribes to include 229 Ingenious Alaskan Tribal Communities. To combat the long-term issue of Native American Tribal sustainability, the only real solution can come from connecting the dots between leveraging tribal sovereignty, corporate America, investment capital, industry leadership, and education, with a sustainable outlook measured in generations, not by fiscal quarters. NAVF formation Native American Venture Fund, LLC was co-founded on April 13, 2015 and was formed as a Delaware Series, limited liability Company. Native American Venture Fund, LLC was formed as a Series, Delaware limited liability Company on April 13, 2015. The Manager of the Fund is Native American Partners, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The Fund filed its Form D registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 30, 2015, under Federal Exemption Rule 506c as a pooled investment - venture capital fund. NAVF fund portfolio Native American Enterprise Fund ‚Äì Invests into mid to late stage businesses in E-commerce / Data centers, Fintech, Renewable Energy and Government Contracting. Native American Venture Fund Carbon ‚Äì NAVF partners with both tribes and investors to combat one of the most significant threats facing the world today, Climate Change. The main cause, is the Greenhouse gases that are released from Fossil Fuel Use (Industry, energy production, automotive), deforestation, and intensive livestock farming. As concentrations of these gases increase, more warming occurs than would happen naturally, because greenhouse effetely traps radiation from the sun and warms the planet's surface. Simply put, forest conservation creates a \\"Carbon Offset\\", which equates to the removal of a metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent. For every ton of Carbon captured through a Carbon Offset Program, a qualified \\"Carbon Credit / Carbon Offset\\" is created. Companies such as British Petroleum (BP), Google, Chevron, FedEx and several hundred US companies purchase carbon credits at established market prices, in some cases to avoid environmental penalties that cost well in excess of the carbon credit. Thus, NAVF provides financing and project management for North American indigenous tribes, given that the total land holdings of this minority is in excess of 3% of the entire landmass of the continent. The NET outcome, according to the Fund is profitable environmental protection for the Tribe and the investment community. NAVF capital raise / invested to date According to Edgar, the Fund can raise up to $100,000,000, with individual investment minimums at $250,000. The Fund declined to revel names of investors or amount raised in their current Securities Disclosures. NAVF Advisory Board NAVF's vision is molded through its three advisory boards with each board having up to 10 seats. The NAVF boards are as follows: 1) Tribal Board ‚Äì composed of Native Americans from different tribes throughout the country with a variety of expertise in Indian matters in social-economic development, 2) Industry Board ‚Äì composed of corporate leadership that matches specific business ventures to tribes, and 3) Governance Board ‚Äì composed of thought leadership in sovereign law, tax matter, legislation and have/hold influential roles in government that relates to the tribal / economic endeavors of the fund.

For the first twenty years of his life, he spelled his name James Mountain. He was a supporter of Daniel O‚ÄôConnell and the Irish liberation movement. As an adult he resided at 72 North Main Street, Cork, which has since been demolished, and worked as a shoe-maker. He was involved in the Fenian movement and imprisoned multiple times. By the time of his death, James Mountaine was a well known nationalist. Early adult life Mountaine was involved in the Cork Confederate Club, Cork National Reading Rooms, as well as the Brotherhood of St. Patrick. As part of a group of shoe- makers accused of assault, James Mountaine was first imprisoned in 1848. They allegedly assaulted fellow shoe-maker John M'Donnell over a depute about regulations of their trade. After the accuser failed to appear in court, the case was dismissed and the defendant being bound to keep the peace for 12 months.Cork Examiner, Police Court, 1 March 1844 Later life The marriage of the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) and Alexandra of Denmark on 10 March 1863 was an occasion for loyalist celebrations in Cork. Houses and shops had their windows illuminated. This increased nationalistic unrest, with windows being smashed and the mayor being roughly handled. Hansard, 17 March 1863 vol 169 c1552 Several rioters were prosecuted, including Mountaine. The trial started on 23 March with the charge of inciting the mob of 500 people and property damage. Cork Examiner, 17 March 1863 This was held immediately after John Lynch's trial over the same incident. Both were acquitted. On 5 November 1863, he was seen on a ship to the United States by Irish police. Mountaine claimed that the purpose of the trip was to find his lost son, a surgeon in New York, after many requests from his wife. His search was successful. In December, he was seen in New York by the informant Pearce Nagle visiting the offices of John O'Mahony, a founding member of the Fenian Brotherhood in the United States. His stay in the country was less than three months. He carried a letter of recommendation from James Stephens, a founding member of what went on to be the Irish Republican Brotherhood, to John O'Mahony, which was published after his death: From 1864, the movements of Fenian leaders were closely watched by police, including John J. Geary's pub, which was often frequented by Mountaine, Brian Dillon and John Lynch.Cork Examiner, Fenian Trials, 29 December 1865 Mountaine was arrested on 5 Oct 1865 in the general purge of Fenian leaders. About 11 AM, twenty police arrived at Mountaine's shop. A large crowd gathered to find the cause of police presence. The property was searched for incriminating documents and Mountaine was taken away in handcuffs after an hour. Mountaine walked in a defiant manner as some of the crowd cheered, clapped in sympathy and wept. The police left with a parcel of evidence from the house. 5 October 1865, Fenian Arrest, Cork Examiner On 27 December 1865, he was charged under the Treason Felony Act 1848. The trial on the next day was conducted by the Special Commission. Evidence was given that he associated with conspirators John O'Mahony, John J. Geary and Brian Dillon. Police claim they saw Mountaine talking to Fenian leader James Stephens in April 1864, although they could not hear the conversation. The police had found the Chicago statement, a nationalist pamphlet written in America, as well as a copy of \\"Biggs' Military Resources of Ireland\\" at his home. On Mountaine's son was found book of poetry with the inscription \\"James Mountaine, Esq., Fenian Brotherhood\\". A request for a letter of introduction for Richard O'Leary to John O'Mahony was found on his person. Police said they saw Mountaine on 1 June on a tender to a ship to the United States talking to Callaghan O'Reardon, with Mountaine wishing O'Reardan's return, although the meaning of the remark was quite ambiguous. Cork Examiner, Fenian Trials, 28 December 1865 Mountaine was defended by Isaac Butt and Mr Waters. They argued that the charge was conspiracy to overthrow the Queen, but his association with members of the Fenian brotherhood did not itself establish his guilt. They claimed that no overt act was committed by Mountaine and all evidence presented was circumstantial and inconclusive. The handwriting of the book inscription was questioned, as was the authenticity and relevance of the request for a letter of recommendation. Mountaine was acquitted after the jury deliberated for a quarter of an hour. The announcement was accompanied by some applause, which was quickly suppressed. Cheering was also heard in the courthouse from the street as Mountaine left the building.

On 24 June 1803 she was under the command of Lieutenant Mayson Wright when she captured the 4-gun privateer Marengo. Albion, with a crew of 27, was employed in raising men for the Royal Navy.

An hour and twenty minutes later, the privateer struck. She had had three men wounded; Albion had no casualties though she had taken some shots to her hull and had a gun dismounted. The privateer turned out to be Marengo, of four guns and a crew of 26 men under the command of \\"John Sieur Granger\\".

As Duke of Clarence awaited her boat's return she hit a submerged rock with the result that she started to fill with water.

Buffett's version was a concert staple and even regarded as his theme before \\"Margaritaville\\"'s popularity, until he was forced to stop playing it after being sued by Buckley's son, Dick Buckley Jr., for copyright infringement. Content Buckley's monologue and Buffett's rendition both tell a story in the first-person of a recovering alcoholic who finds himself taking care of his brother-in-law's still, eventually giving into his temptation and drinking its whiskey. In the midst of his bender, he crosses paths with a bear; who, from the narrator's drunken perspective, is a male Kodiak about 16 feet (Buckley) or 19 feet (Buffett) tall. The narrator's fearlessness interests the bear, and out of mutual curiosity, the narrator gives the bear some whiskey and names him \\"Buddy\\". The two drink the night away, and the narrator awakens to find that both Buddy and the still are gone; implying that the bear liked the whiskey so much that he stole the still. Buffett's cover Although Buffett did not officially record his rendition until 1974, he had been performing it since 1966 after two friends played him Buckley's 1959 Hollywood recording of Lord Buckley in Concert.You Had to Be There (1978), disc 2 track 2. Buffett and his friends were living in New Orleans at the time and were playing at a bar where the performers were required to do a rendition of Buckley's \\"God's Own Drunk\\". Lawsuit In the Names and Faces section in newspapers all over the country on August 30, 1983, the following story ran: =The Lawyer and the Asshole= Though few details of the lawsuit are known, it inspired a song titled \\"The Lawyer and the Asshole\\". Because \\"God's Own Drunk\\" was a concert staple before the lawsuit, the song's sudden absence from the setlist was a disappointment to fans, so Buffett played \\"The Lawyer and the Asshole\\" instead, to explain why \\"God's Own Drunk\\" couldn't and wouldn't be performed. Live performances Buffett had been performing \\"God's Own Drunk\\" on an occasional basis since learning it in 1966, but the song became a concert staple after its recording in 1974 and remained a standard until 1978, to which he only performed it on a frequent basis because it did not mesh well with the softer sound he was promoting with Son of a Son of a Sailor. A live version was released on You Had to Be There, capturing the crowd's demand for its performance and its acclaim when Buffett finally played it after teasing some fans before the preceding song \\"Grapefruit‚ÄîJuicy Fruit\\". By 1983, when Dick Buckley Jr. sued Buffett for copyright infringement, the song was dropped completely. When Buffett was obligated to stop performing it during the lawsuit, he instead occasionally played \\"The Lawyer and the Asshole\\" as a substitute, with the earliest known performance being in Telluride, Colorado on August 27, 1983 and the last being November 16, 1986 in Gainesville, Florida. Sometimes, in lieu of playing \\"God's Own Drunk\\" due to the litigation, he would heave a boxful of little \\"Buddy Bears\\" to the audience or did trivia about the song, where he would ask the questions and the crowd would shout the answer. The outcome of the court case is unknown, but Buffett had brought \\"God's Own Drunk\\" back to the setlist in 1988 and since then has only played it rarely. Aside from the You Had to Be There performance, other notable live versions are: at the Palladium on March 14, 1980 (captured on Ringling Ringling); in George, WA on August 22, 1992, with several references to the Gorge Amphitheatre; at Toyota Park in Bridgeview, Illinois on July 23, 2011, using the Chicago Bears as a plot device for the Kodiak bear in the song, going on to release this performance as a single; and its most recent performance at the Riverbend Music Theater on June 21, 2016. On September 6, 2008, Buffett moved his 8:00pm show in Mansfield, MA at the Comcast Center to 3:00pm because Hurricane Hanna was expected to make landfall in Massachusetts later that night. After singing \\"Why Don't We Get Drunk\\", Buffett surprised the Coral Reefer Band by waving them off stage to perform solo, in which he played a 10-minute rendition of \\"God's Own Drunk\\" while the rest of the band stood to the side of the stage and watched. This was done to extend the show as long as possible before the hurricane arrived, resulting in a three-hour performance of 29 songs. Pop- culture references In Buffett's studio take, one of the types of drunks listed off is \\"Reggie Younging\\", a reference to Reggie Young. In the song \\"Semi-True Story\\" from Beach House on the Moon, Buffett sings about the day in 1974 when he recorded \\"God's Own Drunk\\".

Location Rathcoran is located atop Baltinglass Hill, east-northeast of Baltinglass, overlooking the River Slaney. History The passage grave is thought to be contemporaneous with Newgrange, i.e. it was built 3500‚Äì3000 BC, during the Neolithic. The site was excavated in 1934‚Äì36 by P. T. Walshe, revealing evidence of the cremations of at least 3 adults and a child. Fragments of quartz unearthed during the excavation suggest that it was used for decoration. Carbonised hazelnuts, wheat grains and a saddle quern point to the extent of local climate change: in Neolithic Ireland, the climate was drier and warmer, County Wicklow's glens were densely wooded, and farmers could grow crops at altitudes above . Five hillforts surround Baltinglass. Rathcoran, atop Baltinglass Hill is dated to 1000 BC or slightly earlier: during the Bronze Age. The name is from the Irish R√°th Cuar√°in (\\"Cuar√°n's ringfort\\"), but this name is doubtful: the original name could be R√°th Charn√°in, \\"ringfort of the cairn.\\" Description =Passage grave= The passage tomb survives as a multi-period kerbed cairn with a diameter of , underneath which are five structures: *A kerb of large stones surround the cairn, and an inner kerb was revealed during excavation. Two stones of the inner kerb and one of the outer bear passage tomb art. *The main tomb is on the north side. It has a short passage, long, roofed with slabs and leading to a chamber in diameter which contains three shallow recesses and a stone basin with pecked ornament. *On the south side of the cairn is another tomb comprising a chamber divided into three compartments, but no passage, and two of its stones bear passage tomb art. *On the northwest side of the cairn are the remains of a small corbelled structure, partly overlain by the inner kerb. *A fifth chamber stands inside the kerb to the east of the main tomb. The finds from the site include the cremated bones of at least three adults and one child, flint scrapers, Carrowkeel pottery and bone pins. Finds from beneath the cairn included a stone axe, a flint javelin- head, scrapers, an egg-shaped stone, carbonised wheat grains and hazelnuts. A saddle quern was also found in the cairn. =Hillfort= The Rathcoran hillfort, a bivallate ringfort, is at the top of Baltinglass Hill, and surrounds the cairn. Stones from the cairn were moved to make a protective wall. It has a double rampart and perhaps was intended to have a third, which is incompleted.

It started in 1423 as a personal conflict against the condottiero Braccio da Montone and the city of L'Aquila in Abruzzo, but later turned into a national conflict when the forces of the Duchy of Milan, the Republic of Florence, the Papal States, and the Kingdom of Naples were also involved. Braccio da Montone was killed in the final battle near L'Aquila. Background In 1423 Braccio da Montone was named by Queen Joanna II of Naples as connestable of the Abruzzi for ten years. The condottiero, however, was fighting in Umbria, and named Ruggero d'Antignola as governor with the task to put these lands under his personal rule against the royal power of the Kingdom of Naples. After an initial period of good relationships, in late 1422 the citizens of L'Aquila, fearing to lose their secular autonomy, rebelled under the leadership of Antonuccio Camponeschi and expelled Ruggero d'Antignola. The Camponeschi family was related with Giacomo Marzano, grand admiral of Naples, and the condottiero Muzio Attendolo, lord of Benevento and Manfredonia, as well as with Pope Martin V, who supported Louis III of Anjou's claims against Joanna. When the city declared itself under Louis' suzerainty, Braccio da Montone mobilized its forces to regain it. History In late 1423, Braccio da Montone's strong army started destroying the 99 historical castles (in Italian, Castelli Fondatori, meaning \\"founding castles\\") which surrounded the city. In May 1424, the population took refuge in Aquila itself and prepared for the siege. After a failed storming attempt, Braccio da Montone took a position on the Collemaggio hill, waiting for the city to surrender by famine. In the meantime, a coalition between Florence, Milan, and the Pope mustered an army under the condottieri Jacopo Caldora and Francesco Sforza. The final clash between the two armies occurred in early June 1424. Muzio Attendolo had died in the march towards L'Aquila while wading the Pescara River. After having been initially pushed back by Caldora, Braccio started losing ground. His vice-commander, Niccol√≤ Piccinino, left the position on the city walls. This left his army's right flank, which was immediately attacked by Francesco Sforza. In the meantime, the Aquilans under Antonuccio Camponeschi sortied from the gates and contributed to Braccio's complete defeat. Mortally wounded in the neck, Braccio was made prisoner and transported to L'Aquila, where he died three days later, on 5 June 1424.

But before the journey home begins, Amit‚Äôs son Abhi (Samir Kochhar) arrives from America to commit his father to an old age home. Amit runs away and encounters Salim (Pankaj Tripathi). Salim is a Muslim auto- rickshaw driver whose wife was raped and burned to death by Hindu rioters. Amit had earlier saved the life of Salim‚Äôs son. Salim offers to drive the doctor anywhere, as a way of repaying his debt. When Amit asks to be taken home, Salim cannot imagine how far he will end up going for the doctor or where the journey will lead them. Along the way, Amit and Salim forge an unforgettable friendship and help each other discover the peace they have been longing for.

Presentation slides (19 March 2017). Historically the proton charge radius was measured by two independent methods, which converged to a value of about 0.877 femtometres (1 fm = 10‚àí15 m). This value was challenged by a 2010 experiment using a third method, which produced a radius about 4% smaller than this, at 0.842 femtometres. New experimental results reported in the fall of 2019 agree with the smaller measurement. While some believe that this difference has been resolved, this opinion is not yet universally held. Problem Prior to 2010, the proton charge radius was measured using one of two methods: one relying on spectroscopy, and one relying on nuclear scattering. =Spectroscopy method= The spectroscopy method uses the energy levels of electrons orbiting the nucleus. The exact values of the energy levels are sensitive to the nuclear radius. For hydrogen, whose nucleus consists only of one proton, this indirectly measures the proton radius. Measurements of hydrogen's energy levels are now so precise that the proton radius is the limiting factor when comparing experimental results to theoretical calculations. This method produces a proton radius of about (or ), with approximately 1% relative uncertainty. =Nuclear scattering= The nuclear method is similar to Rutherford's scattering experiments that established the existence of the nucleus. Small particles such as electrons can be fired at a proton, and by measuring how the electrons are scattered, the size of the proton can be inferred. Consistent with the spectroscopy method, this produces a proton radius of about (or ), . =2010 experiment= In 2010, Pohl et al. published the results of an experiment relying on muonic hydrogen as opposed to normal hydrogen. Conceptually, this is similar to the spectroscopy method. However, the much higher mass of a muon causes it to orbit 207 times closer than an electron to the hydrogen nucleus, where it is consequently much more sensitive to the size of the proton. The resulting radius was recorded as , 5 standard deviations (5œÉ) smaller than the prior measurements. The newly measured radius is 4% smaller than the prior measurements, which were believed to be accurate within 1%. (The new measurement's uncertainty limit of only 0.1% makes a negligible contribution to the discrepancy.) Since 2010, additional measurements using electrons have slightly reduced the estimated radius to (), but by reducing the uncertainty even more the disagreement has worsened to over 7œÉ. A follow-up experiment by Pohl et al. in August 2016 used a deuterium atom to create muonic deuterium and measured the deuteron radius. This experiment allowed the measurements to be 2.7 times more accurate, but also found a discrepancy of 7.5 standard deviations smaller than the expected value. In 2017 Pohl's group performed yet another experiment, this time using hydrogen atoms that had been excited by two different lasers. By measuring the energy released when the excited electrons fell back to lower-energy states, the Rydberg constant could be calculated, and from this the proton radius inferred. The result is again ~5% smaller than the generally-accepted proton radius. In 2019, another experiment reported a measurement of the proton size using a method that was independent of the Rydberg constant -- its result, 0.833 femtometers, agreed with the smaller 2010 value once more. Proposed resolutions The anomaly remains unresolved and is an active area of research. There is as yet no conclusive reason to doubt the validity of the old data. The immediate concern is for other groups to reproduce the anomaly. The uncertain nature of the experimental evidence has not stopped theorists from attempting to explain the conflicting results. Among the postulated explanations are the three-body force, interactions between gravity and the weak force, or a flavour-dependent interaction, higher dimension gravity, a new boson, and the quasi-free hypothesis. =Measurement artefact= Randolf Pohl, the original investigator of the puzzle, stated that while it would be \\"fantastic\\" if the puzzle led to a discovery, the most likely explanation is not new physics but some measurement artefact. His personal assumption is that past measurements have misgauged the Rydberg constant and that the current official proton size is inaccurate. =Quantum chromodynamic calculation= In a paper by Belushkin et al. (2007) including different constraints and pertubative quantum chromodynamics predicted a smaller proton radius than the 0.877 femtometres which was the accepted value at the time. =Proton radius extrapolation= Papers from 2016 suggested that the problem was with the extrapolations that had typically been used to extract the proton radius from the electron scattering data though these explanation would require that their was also a problem with the atomic Lamb shift measurements. =Data analysis method= In one of the most recent attempts to resolve the puzzle without new physics, Alarc√≥n, et al. (2018), at Jefferson Labs, have proposed that a different technique to fit the experimental scattering data in a theoretically as well as analytically justified manner produces a proton charge radius from the existing electron scattering data that is consistent with the muonic hydrogen measurement. Effectively, this approach attributes the cause of the proton radius puzzle to a failure to use a theoretically motivated function for the extraction of the proton charge radius from the experimental data. Another recent paper has pointed out how a simple, yet theory motivated change to previous fits will also give the smaller radius. =Relativistic reference frame issues= Other investigators have suggested that the analysis used for the electron-based proton charge radius may not properly consider the rest frames of the different components of the experiments, in the light of special relativity. Polarization factors in muonic hydrogen which are not material in ordinary hydrogen have also been proposed as a possible solution. Yet another paper in April 2019 suggested that scale relativity may provide an answer based on the relativistic sizes of protons and muons. = 2019 measurements = In September 2019, Bezginov et al. reported the remeasurement of the proton's charge radius for electronic hydrogen and found a result consistent with Pohl's value for muonic hydrogen. In November W. Xiong et al. reported a similar result using extremely low momentum transfer electron scattering. Their results support the smaller proton charge radius, but do not explain why the results before 2010 came out larger. It is likely future experiments will be able to both explain and settle the proton radius puzzle.

In their 88-year history, the Greenjackets have won four Empire Football League Championships, two Eastern Football League Championships, two North American Football League Championships, and ten Empire Football League Division Championships. Players include high school and college graduates, athletes looking to take their career to higher levels (e.g. arena football, CFL, or NFL), and older adults still looking to participate in football. All members of the Greenjackets organization are volunteer. This includes players, coaches, trainers, front office staff, and the President/CEO Hank Pelton III. Despite not being paid, the Greenjackets' level of completion is still classified as semi- professional. History =Founding & Early Years (1928-1936)= In 1928 the team was organized by three local businessmen in Hudson Falls, NY; William Angleson, Fred Burns and Dr. Francis D. Moynihan. Initial financial support came from local merchants and equipment was loaned by Hudson Falls High School and Whitehall Senior/Junior High School. A contest was held to name the team and a little girl, whose name no one can remember or identify, came up with ‚ÄúGreenjackets‚Äù and won a season pass for the 1928 season. The cost of a 1928 general admission ticket was 50 cents a game. Local legend holds that the ‚ÄúG‚Äù logo, shared between the Greenjackets and the Green Bay Packers of the NFL was first designed by Hudson Falls. Hudson Falls joined the Eastern Football League along with the Albany Knickerbockers, Watervliet Mariners, Troy Bearcats, Saratoga Brown Bears, and Fort Ethan Allen. The first game was held on October 14, 1928 against Saratoga at Derby Park in Hudson Falls. They defeated the Brown Bears 2-0. The Greenjackets‚Äô inaugural season finished with an impressive 5-0-1 record. The tie was with a strong Albany team. Of the original 1928 team, guard Dick Carpenter was the last living member until his death in 2005. His memories were vivid and his face lit up when he spoke about those past years he had played with the Greenjackets. One of his fondest memories was when ‚Äúa bunch of guys came together to form a football team.‚Äù Dick would reminisce about how nice it was playing the Army team at Fort Ethan Allen in Colchester, Vermont. ‚ÄúThey would feed the Greenjackets beans and homemade cornbread after the game. After everyone had eaten, the Army players would bet the Greenjackets players that they could not ride the pack mules for a full minute. Many a 25 cent bets changed hands.‚Äù =Intermittent Era (1937-1969)= After nine seasons of play, operations temporarily ceased for three seasons in 1937-39. And with the breakout of World War II, the Greenjackets once again halted from playing from 1942 to 1945. After resuming play in 1946, Hudson Falls became Eastern Football League Champions in 1949 and 1951. But in 1952, the green and gold faced a new obstacle as the EFL disbanded. With no league to play in, the Greenjackets also disbanded until 1962. After a ten-year hiatus, a major change was needed for the Greenjackets to continue a football tradition in the Southern Adirondacks. =Empire Enlightenment (1969-1980)= In the spring of 1969, Greenjackets players were called together for a meeting and told that they would need to go out on their own if they wanted the team to continue playing. Under new leadership of President Dick Leland and Vice President Jim Willing, Greenjackets football would continue to thrive. In May 1969 a newly organized league, the Empire Football League, was incorporated in Poughkeepsie, NY. The original five-team league comprised the Hudson Falls Greenjackets, Dutchess County Checkmates (Poughkeepsie), Hudson Vikings, Cohoes Olympiads, and Troy Titans. The Greenjackets would go on to win the inaugural 1969 EFL championship. In addition to winning the Valley Division Championship in 1972 and another EFL title in 1976, Hudson Falls was a successful playoff team in the 1970s appearing six out of nine seasons (1969, 1972-1974,1976, 1977). The 1978 season was commemorative as it was the 50th Anniversary of the team and 10th anniversary of the league. =Move to Glens Falls & Multiple Championships (1980-1990)= With the opening of East Field in Glens Falls in 1980, the Greenjackets relocated and re-branded as the Glens Falls Greenjackets. The old Hudson Falls fan base easily coveted with Derby Park only being 3.5 miles away. With a new stadium came multiples victories. The Greenjackets were prosperous as five-time consecutive Northern Division Champions from 1981 to 1985. =Decade of Decline & First Departure from the EFL (1990-2000)= Glens Falls fell into a slump during the 1990s and did not produce any division or league championships. Glens Falls left the Empire Football League for the 1997 season to play in the New York Amateur Football League but returned the following season in 1998. In 1998, the Greenjackets Hall of Fame was established to honor past players, coaches, and staff members that made significant contributions the Greenjackets. The inaugural class had 34 inductees; the largest class in the Hall of Fame's history. = Back-to-Back Championships & Second Departure from EFL (2000-2011)= The early to mid-2000s was a successful dynasty for the Greenjackets as they won three consecutive Northern Division Championships and back-to-back EFL Championships in 2003 and 2004. However, despite their success in the EFL, owner Charles Adams moved the team to the North American Football League in 2005. He was cited as having a desire to play \\"a stronger competition\\". In 2008, Hank Pelton III and Craig Matuszak purchased the team from a group headed by NAFL commissioner Rob Licopoli. Glens Falls won back-to-back Empire Division titles in 2008 and 2009. =Return to the EFL & Present (2011-Present)= After spending six seasons with the NAFL, the Greenjackets made the decision to return to the Empire Football League in 2011 after a six-year hiatus. Since their return to the EFL in 2011, the Greenjackets have made the playoffs three times, losing in the semi-finals in 2015 and 2016, and winning the championship in 2017. Logos & Uniforms The Glens Falls Greenjackets primary logo is the same primary logo used by the Green Bay Packers. Local legend holds that the ‚ÄúG‚Äù logo, was first designed by then Hudson Falls Greenjackets. The uniform has also been similar to Green Bay over the years, but with small variations.

Kane in his publications, was a physicist who established some of the basic understanding of the theory of semiconductors that are now used in consumer and other electronics. He was one of the main developers of the k¬∑p perturbation theory which is used to calculate band structures.  Ancestry  Kane's family had a long history in the U.S. His great, great uncle, Elisha Kent Kane, was a famous arctic explorer, writing popular books in the 1850s about his journeys. His great grandfather, Thomas Leiper Kane, who founded the town of Kane, Pennsylvania, was an American Civil War General. He also helped with the Underground Railroad and successfully urged the Buchanan Administration not to go to war with the Mormons in Salt Lake City. Kane's grandfather, also named Evan O'Neill Kane, was a doctor who was so enamoured of the idea of local anesthesia that he surgically removed his own appendix to show its effectiveness.  Life  Evan O'Neill Kane was born on December 23, 1924 in Kane, Pennsylvania. His father, Thomas Leiper Kane, died in 1933 of spinal meningitis, which was preceded by scarlet fever. He later moved with his mother and siblings to Daytona Beach, Florida, where he stayed through high school. = Career = Kane was an undergraduate at Princeton University, and interrupted his education to serve in the army during World War II. He graduated from Princeton University in 1948, and went directly to Cornell University to study towards his PhD in Physics, which was awarded in 1953 on an experimental project related to vacuum tube technology. Dr. Kane then joined the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady, New York. There he began contributing to the theoretical underpinnings of the then-new field of semiconductor research. Semiconductors rapidly displaced vacuum tubes and are now used in most computers and electronic devices. He published widely in scientific journals. Perhaps his best known paper was published in 1956 on a technique to calculate the structure of solids. This technique is referred to as the k¬∑p method for band structure calculations. It is still used by both theoretical and experimental solid state researchers. Kane left General Electric in 1959 to join Hughes Aircraft in California and then moved to the Theoretical Physics Department in Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey in 1961. He continued his semiconductor research at Bell Labs, at the interface between experimental and theoretical physics, until AT&T; was broken up. He then worked for BellCore until he retired in 1984. = Personal life = Evan O‚ÄôNeill Kane married Anne Bassler in 1950 in Anne's home town of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. They lived together for over 40 years in New Providence, New Jersey, where they raised three children and coauthored one paper.EO Kane and AB Kane, \\"Direct calculation of Wannier Functions; Si valence bands, Physical Review B, 1978 In addition to distinction as a physicist, Dr. Kane was a devoted father and then grandfather, and became serially passionate about hobbies, including learning languages, canoeing, and long-distance running. In 1974 he became ranked second in the country in the 50 and over marathon category. He spent most of the rest of his life working in childcare for infants, toddlers and young children including his grandchildren and church group. He passed away in 2006 at the age of 81. The cause of death was complications secondary to myeloproliferative disease and myelodysplasia. After his death he was cremated and his ashes were buried at Christ Church in Summit, New Jersey. Kane's descendants currently include three children (Ruth Elizabeth Kane, now Ruth Kane-Levit b. 11 December 1952; Daniel O'Neill Kane b. 22 December 1954; Martha Lucille Kane, now Martha Kane Savage b. 28 June 1957), six grandchildren (one, Kelly Robert Savage, deceased) and three great-grandchildren.  Kane model  Kane used the k¬∑p perturbation method to determine what became known as the Kane model or Kane Hamiltonian of the structure of energy bands of semiconductors. The Kane Hamiltonian describes the valence and conduction bands in sp3 bonded semiconductors: the group IV, II-V and II-VI semiconductors. This 1957 publication is still prominent in scientific literature and textbooks more than 50 years after its discovery (the paper has about 3377 citations despite the fact that modern citation indexes undercount citations for papers published before the mid-1990s). The model is now often cited via books where it is discussed, most notably in Yu's and Cardona's book, Fundamentals of Semiconductors.Peter Y. Yu and Manuel Cardona, \\"Fundamentals of Semiconductors, Physics and Materials Properties, Springer, (Print) 978-3-642-00710-1 (Online) In their book on the k¬∑p method, Voon and WillatzenLok C. Lew Yan Voon and Morten Willatzen, \\"The k.p Method\\" Electronic Properties of Semiconductors, Springer, Springer-Verlag Berlin, Heidelberg, 2009. devote several chapters to explaining Kane models. They note that Kane's quasi-degenerate perturbation theory approach worked well for semiconductors with small band gaps. Kane improved previous valence band models by adding the lowest conduction band. This model was extended later to take into account the non-parabolicity of materials such as gallium arsenide (GaAs). The model explains essentially most of the materials used in semiconductor technology. The theoretical literature describing the electronics and optical responses of these semiconductors all rely heavily on this model, as does the very active field of quantum phenomena in size-limited crystalline structures.

He was a Member of Parliament for the West Indies Federation, Senator of Trinidad and Tobago, and Member of Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago. From 1981 to 1986, he served as Minister of State Enterprises. During his tenure in government, his drive to reduce waste and seek cost efficiencies earned him the nickname \\"Chinese Chopper\\", a reference to his ethnicity and his willingness to cut expenditures. After graduating from the University of Toronto, Williams returned to his native Trinidad and Tobago, where he is known for his contributions to the country's economic and cultural development as both a public figure and a private citizen. He served in a number of different roles on various boards and committees, including as Chairman of the Carnival Development Committee. He is credited with naming Trinidad and Tobago's annual steelband festival, \\"Panorama\\".First Panorama In recognition of his contributions to the nation's cultural development, he was awarded the Hummingbird Medal Gold in 1971 by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago. Early life Ronald Jay Williams was born in 1928 in Trinidad and Tobago, then a colony of the British Empire. His mother was Ellen Lai Fook, the sister of Father Arthur Lai Fook, and his father was Trinidadian businessman Louis Jay Williams (1897 ‚Äì 1968). Williams's parents were descended from Chinese labourers who came to the Caribbean in the early to mid 1800s. His father was born in Trinidad and would become well known for his business acumen. Louis Jay Williams played a pivotal leadership role in the nation's business development in the 20th century; his many accomplishments included being the first Trinidadian businessman to use local broadcasting stations for advertising purposes and pioneering Trinidad and Tobago's international trade relations, notably establishing the Australia to West Indies Shipping Service. In 1925, Louis Jay Williams founded L.J Williams Ltd., the company Ronald Jay Williams would eventually lead as Managing Director. Williams spent his early life being educated in his native country, attending Western Boys' Roman Catholic School, Belmont Boys' Intermediate School, and St. Mary's College. He then pursued his undergraduate studies in Canada at the University of Toronto, where he would meet his wife, Winifred Lownie. Career After completing his studies in Canada, Williams returned to Trinidad where he began his career working for his father at L.J Williams Ltd. From 1952 to 1966, he was the Manager of American Life Insurance Company and a director at L.J Williams Ltd. In 1966, he assumed full control of the family company and became Managing Director of L.J Williams Ltd. During this time, Williams also became deeply involved in politics at a crucial point in Trinidad and Tobago's transition from colony to independent nation. In 1958, several islands of the English- speaking Caribbean attempted to seek autonomous governance through the creation of the West Indies Federation. Based on the Canadian Confederation model, each nation formed its own provincial government while also electing representatives to a unified federal parliament. When the newly formed West Indies Federation held its first election in 1958, Williams represented the People's National Movement (PNM) party and was elected to the Federal Parliament of the West Indies Federation as Member of Parliament for Port of Spain West. Although the local PNM party did not win the majority of federal constituencies in Trinidad and Tobago, it helped form the federal government as part of the larger West Indies Federal Labour Party lead by Sir Grantley Herbert Adams. Meanwhile, the PNM also controlled the local Legislative Council with Williams's party leader, Eric Williams (no relation), serving as Premier.

In the meantime, Marlborough sailed away from the action and escaped back to Britain unscathed. At his subsequent court martial Captain Boteler blamed his failure to return fire on an inadequate supply of gunpowder for Ardents cannon, a statement denied by the ship's gunner. Archibald Macintyre provided evidence that there was enough powder for fifty minutes of engagement. The court martial rejected Boteler's appeals, finding instead that the inexperience of the crew was the principal cause of the Ardents capture, and he was expelled from the Navy for his failure to adequately defend his ship. Ardent was, nevertheless, recaptured by the British on 14 April 1782 following the Battle of the Saintes and recommissioned that month under Captain Richard Lucas.

Seeing the social inequities in Vietnam, she became a freelance photojournalist and posted photographs online as an alternative news source to state-controlled media. In 2010, at 25 years old, she participated in the movement against China's territorial claims in the South China Sea Dispute. She captured images of the slogan ‚ÄúHS.TS.VN‚Äù that were posted throughout Vietnam to assert Vietnam's claims over the islands of Hoang Sa (Paracel Islands) and Truong Sa (Spratly Islands). She traveled and documented police brutality, government corruption, and peaceful public protest, including the large anti-China demonstration held in Saigon on June 5, 2011. On July 31, 2011, Vietnamese authorities arbitrarily detained Minh M·∫´n along with her mother (ƒê·∫∑ng Ng·ªçc Minh) and brother (Nguy·ªÖn ƒê·∫∑ng Vƒ©nh Ph√∫c). During a two-day trial of 14 Vietnamese activists in January 2013, Minh M·∫´n received one of the longer sentences, 8 years in prison and 5 years house arrest. She was imprisoned at Prison Camp 5, Yen Dinh, Thanh Hoa, until her release on August 2, 2019.  2011 arrest  As part of a massive crackdown on Vietnamese youth activists in 2011, Vietnamese authorities on July 31 arrested Nguy·ªÖn ƒê·∫∑ng Minh M·∫´n, along with her mother, ƒê·∫∑ng Ng·ªçc Minh, and her brother, Nguy·ªÖn ƒê·∫∑ng Vƒ©nh Ph√∫c. The Vietnamese authorities had no warrant for the arrest and confiscated Minh M·∫´n's camera and other photojournalistic materials. Minh M·∫´n and her family were in arbitrary detention for over 17 months before going to trial.  2013 conviction  On January 8‚Äì9, 2013, the People's Court of Ngh·ªá An Province held a trial to convict 14 Vietnamese democracy activists, including Nguy·ªÖn ƒê·∫∑ng Minh M·∫´n. All of them were sentenced between 3‚Äì13 years in prison on charges of subversion under Article 79 of Vietnam's Penal Code. Minh M·∫´n and her mother were accused of painting the slogan ‚ÄúHS.TS.VN,‚Äù which represents Vietnam's claims to the Paracel and Spratly islands. The Vietnamese government actually agrees with the slogan that asserts the islands belonging to Vietnam, but have a greater fear of public protest getting out of hand. Along with the other activists on trial, Minh M·∫´n was also accused of participating in Vi·ªát T√¢n, a pro-democracy organization that aims to establish democracy and reform Vietnam through peaceful and political means. Minh M·∫´n was initially sentenced to 9 years in prison, but it was later amended to 8 years in prison and 5 years house arrest. She is one of three activists from this trial still arbitrarily detained.  Treatment in prison  Nguy·ªÖn ƒê·∫∑ng Minh M·∫´n is subject to unfair and discriminatory treatment in prison. Amnesty International reported in 2013 that Vietnamese prisoners of conscience ‚Äúare held in harsh conditions amounting to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.‚Äù Minh M·∫´n is forced to do physical labor, and is socially isolated since officers threaten other prisoners from being friends with political prisoners. In November 2014, Minh M·∫´n was put in near-solitary confinement without clear reasons. Soon after, Minh M·∫´n launched repeated hunger strikes to raise awareness about ill-treatment towards prisoners of conscience, weighing 35 kg, or about 77 pounds, after her protest. Her father Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn L·ª£i attempts to visit her at least once a month, but he must travel 40 hours to get to the prison camp, sometimes being turned away because prison guards put Minh M·∫´n in solitary confinement. Unlike other prisoners of conscience who could speak freely with their guests, Minh M·∫´n and her father are separated by glass with guards surrounding them.  International response  On November 28, 2013, the UNWGAD had ruled in favor of activists convicted during the same time with Minh M·∫´n, stating that Vietnam violated its international human rights obligations and must ‚Äúimmediate[ly] release‚Äù the prisoners of conscience. A year later, while Nguy·ªÖn ƒê·∫∑ng Minh M·∫´n faced near-solitary confinement and went on hunger strike against prison abuse, students of the Freedom of Expression Law Clinic submitted a petition in November 2014 on Minh M·∫´n's behalf to the UN Working Group On Arbitrary Detention (UNWGAD). This petition raises awareness about the Vietnamese government's violation of its international commitments to human rights. On June 11, 2015, her father Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn L·ª£i spoke at the Vietnamese Congressional Caucus in the US Capitol Building to raise awareness about the struggles his daughter and other prisoners of conscience must endure while in prison. He explains, \\"[The prison guards] feed her rice with salt, only give her 1 liter of drinking water a day, not allowing her any water for hygienic reasons, and do not give her a sleeping net. She is only given only one change of clothing for about 15 to 20 days in a month.\\". On International Human Rights Day in 2015, a social media and letter writing campaign called #BarsForBlogging was launched to raise awareness about the remaining three prisoners of conscience from the 2013 trial: Nguy·ªÖn ƒê·∫∑ng Minh M·∫´n, ƒê·∫∑ng Xu√¢n Di·ªáu, and H·ªì ƒê·ª©c Ho√†.
