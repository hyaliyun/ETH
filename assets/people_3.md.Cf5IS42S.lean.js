It has small, roughly spherical pseudobulbs each with a single leaf and up to three small creamy white to yellow flowers emerging from the base of the pseudobulb. This orchid grows in rainforest and dry forest where it often covers the branches of trees or rocks on which it grows.grey myrtle in the Royal National Park Description Bulbophyllum exiguum is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic orchid with small, roughly spherical pseudobulbs, usually 5 to 10 mm in length which taper towards the leaf. Each pseudobulb carries one leaf, about 25 to 30 mm long but greatly variable. The flowers are small and creamy white to yellow, and have sepals roughly twice as long as the petals. Flowers are borne on a thin flower stalk which usually carries up to three flowers and emerges from the base of a pseudobulb, but sometimes comes from the rhizome between bulbs. The bulbs occur either relatively evenly spaced along a rhizome or clustered together, the latter occurring mainly when plants are young. Flowers are produced between March and May.The Bulbophyllum- Checklist Taxonomy and naming Bulbophyllum exiguum was first formally described in 1860 by Ferdinand von Mueller who published the description in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. The specific epithet (exigua) is a Latin word meaning \\"small\\", \\"short\\", \\"poor\\" or \\"scanty\\". Distribution and habitat This orchid grows on trees and rocks in Queensland and New South Wales subtropical to temperate rainforests and sclerophyll forests, where it can often cover rock faces, trunks or branches. It occurs at elevations up to , requiring a hot, shady, humid climate.

Colonel John Stuart (17 March 1749 in Augusta County, Virginia ‚Äì 18 August 1823 in Greenbrier County, Virginia [now West Virginia]) was a Revolutionary War commander and pioneering western Virginia settler. A veteran of the Battle of Point Pleasant (1774), he surveyed and settled the Greenbrier Valley and is known locally as the \\"Father of Greenbrier County\\". Owing to his Memoir of Indian Wars and Other Occurrences, written in 1799, he has been called \\"the most important chronicler of pioneer history in southern West Virginia\\".Rice, Otis K. and Stephen W. Brown (1993), West Virginia: A History, 2nd edition, The University Press of Kentucky, pg 78. Biography Stuart's father, the Scotsman David Stuart, was among the supporters of Charles Edward Stuart (\\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\\") as king of Great Britain. Soon after the failure of the Prince's cause at Culloden (1746) David found it necessary to immigrate to America.Cole, Joseph R. (1917), History of Greenbrier County; Lewisburg, West Virginia (Reprinted in 1998 by Higginson Book Co), pp 51-60. He settled in Augusta County, Virginia on the Shenandoah River, some distance from the town of Staunton. At the age of twenty, John Stuart was a member of the 1769 survey by citizens of Augusta County, Virginia, which explored the wilderness of the Greenbrier Valley to the west in preparation for European settlement. The following year he built the first mill in present-day Greenbrier County, at Frankford. In 1774, he led a company of Greenbrier troops in the Battle of Point Pleasant at the confluence of the Kanawha and Ohio Rivers. On 18 November 1776, he married Agatha Lewis (1753-1836), daughter of lawyer, surveyor and Virginia pioneer Thomas Lewis (1718‚Äì1790) and granddaughter of Virginia pioneer John Lewis (1678‚Äì1762).Gravestone Inscription In 1777, Stuart ‚Äî then at Fort Randolph, which had just been built on the site of the Battle of Point Pleasant ‚Äî witnessed the slaughter of four Indians including the Shawnee Chief Cornstalk who had been there to explain the Shawnee attitude toward the British and Americans. (Cornstalk's own desire was for peace but the young Shawnee youth wanted war.) These murders by a mob were denounced by Patrick Henry and the Continental Congress. In 1778, Stuart was commander of troops when the last Indian raid on Fort Donnally, near Lewis Spring (Lewisburg), occurred. (Lewisburg was named for Agatha's uncle, Andrew Lewis [1720‚Äì1782].) He was among the city of Lewisburg's first trustees and in 1780 he became the county's first clerk, leaving many historic records behind. (His first office in Lewisburg‚Äîin his own yard‚Äîis still standing.) He attended the 1788 Virginia Ratifying Convention and advocated ratification of the U.S. Constitution. In 1789 Stuart built a large stone house (\\"Stuart Manor\\") at Fort Spring (which he ended up commanding and which was later called Fort Stuart) near Lewisburg. The land on which the first county courthouse and the Old Stone Church in Lewisburg are situated was donated by Stuart. Stuart was a correspondent of Thomas Jefferson and in 1796 he sent Jefferson fossil bones he had obtained from a salt petre cave about five miles from his home. These specimens fascinated Jefferson and were eventually determined to be tens of thousands of years old and to represent Megalonyx jeffersonii, or Jefferson's Ground Sloth. (With his publication of his commentary,Jefferson, Thomas, \\"A Memoir on the Discovery of Certain Bones of a Quadruped of the Clawed Kind in the Western Parts of Virginia\\", Read before the American Philosophical Society, March 10, 1797. Jefferson is considered to have initiated the discipline of vertebrate paleontology in the United States.) Stuart died in 1823 and is buried in the family cemetery at \\"Stuart Manor\\" with his wife.

His work spans several media, including animation, painting, drawing, performance and installation. He makes work that is funny, grotesque, fantastical, and political. He often imposes these fantastical creations onto pre-existing cultural materials such as movie clips, army recruiting pamphlets, and magazines. He has been active as both an exhibitor and an organizer at ABC No Riohttp://www.brooklynrail.org/2008/02/local/abc- no-rio since 1995. His work has also been shown at several prominent venues, including P.P.O.W. gallery, the Queens Museum of Art, P.S.1, Arario Gallery, Nurture Art, and the Bronx Museum of the Arts. He has been in residence at The MacDowell Colony, both the workspace and the Governors Island residency at Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, and NY Arts Beijing. image on left A still from Self-Inflicted Monster Death, 2010. Animations In 2003, he began making animations that took from a variety of cultural sources, juxtaposing different elements to make a political or aesthetic statement. An early example is The Road to Nam, a mash-up in which the famous Eddie Adams photograph of an execution during the Vietnam War is animated to depict the two main characters each singing a part to Bob Hope and Bing Crosby's version of If I Knew You Were Comin' I'd a Baked a Cake. More typical of later animations is The Good, Etc., in which Estabrook takes footage from the climactic showdown scene of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, and essentially doodles his own monsters on top of it. He has also done this with the Zapruder footage of the Kennedy Assassination, and scenes from Demille's The Ten Commandments. St. Paul the Apostle Church, NYC, fall 2009. Installations His installation work often involves arrangements of several standing cardboard figures. The first of these was Standing Army, an installation of 50 life-size soldiers made of found cardboard. The figures were based on those found in army recruiting materials, and were arranged in formations based on the Chinese Terracotta Army. A second installation in this vein is Popes, an arrangement of 21 papal figures, each approximated four-feet tall and decorated with painting and metal leaf, installed in St. Paul the ApostleCchurch in autumn 2009. Most Recently, Estabrook created Warriors of The Dragon's Teeth, a multi media installation done in Tblisi Georgia in November 2015. This work is an exploration of the Myth of Jason and the Golden Fleece, which was taken from present day Georgia. The imagery here illustrates the warriors who grew from dragon's teeth the hero planted in the earth. The work uses this myth as springboard to discuss the interests of western neoliberal powers in countries of the former Soviet Union, such as Georgia. Drawings Estabrook's art practice is founded in drawing, a medium which he often uses as a tool of political satire. His drawing projects include \\"Purple Pilot Pen Presidential Portraits\\", a piece in which all of the American presidents (as of 2005) were rendered hairless. He also uses shrinky dinks as a medium, creating \\"bug demons\\" of such figures as George W. Bush's cabinet (\\"Shrinky Dink Bug Demons, The President and His Cabinet\\") and Ronald McDonald (Swarm of Ronalds). At the root of this drawing are Estabrook's \\"Accretions\\", stream of consciousness drawings that organically grow onto the paper. Often these \\"Accretions\\" are done on scrolls, some measuring as long as 45 feet. Paintings Estabrook uses painting to many ends. Most often, purposeful vandalism is his intention. Works in this vein include \\"An Army of One\\", in which he defaced army recruiting propaganda and then returned it to its distribution point. Related to this is the \\"Gun Mags\\" series in which Estabrook paints out all the text of gun magazine pages except sexualized words like \\"cock\\" or \\"butt\\". He then paints monsters on the guns and people posing with them. Feel Remington's Beef, acrylic on magazine, 2008. Collaborations In addition to his work as a solo artist, Estabrook often engages in collaborative art activities. The two most prominent of these are with the Artcodex collective, and with the Shining Mantis. Artcodex is a loosely defined collective of artists which, in addition to Estabrook, includes Brian Higbee, Glen Eden Einbinder, Jennifer Berklich, Manny Migrino, and his wife Vandana Jain, and occasionally others. The Shining Mantis is a collaboration between Estabrook and Ernest Concepcion known for their Kangarok epic: large-scale chalk drawings which are both a live drawing battle, and the depiction of one. They are also an experimental music ensemble with influences ranging from the minimalist composers to punk, metal, and noise.

In 2017, Premiere Cinemas opened its first LUX Cin√© and Pizza Pub concept in Grand Prairie, TX outside of Dallas. Premiere's LUX Cin√© locations include state of the art luxury lounge recliners. These recliners feature reclining foot and head rests, customized head support and USB charger ports in each chair. LUX concession stands include bottled and draft beers and both self serve popcorn machines and self serve state of the art touch screen soda fountains. At locations featuring the Pizza Pub concept, guests can order their appetizers, pizzas and desserts at the concession stand or bar and meet food at their auditorium door when it is ready! The second Premiere LUX Cin√© and Pizza Pub opened November 30, 2018 in Biloxi, MS at the Edgewater Mall. During 2017, Premiere also began the process of retrofitting its theatres to lux recliner seating, replacing traditional rocking chairs with electric recliners. Concession retrofits were also complete making these four locations complete Premiere LUX Cin√© concepts. Pell City Premiere Cinertainment In 2019 Premiere opened a Cinertainment concept in Pell City, AL featuring Pizza Pub, bowling, redemption arcade, and ropes course along with its multi-screen recliner cinemas. D-BOX motion technology Premiere Cinemas partners with Quebec-based D-BOX Technologies, Inc. to bring D-BOX motion technology, programmed motion effects synchronized with the film to a platform or the seat.D-BOX Signs First Deal with Premiere Cinemas, D-BOX, October 27, 2010 (pdf), archived at the Wayback Machine, June 25, 2011.

It was founded in November 2008. On 14 August 2009, the group's spiritual leader, Sheikh Abdel Latif Moussa, announced the establishment of an al-Qaeda inspired Islamic emirate in the Palestinian territories and criticized the ruling power, Hamas, for failing to enforce Sharia law. In response, Hamas attacked the organization, resulting in 24 people being killed, including Moussa, and Jund Ansar Allah ceased to exist. Background Jund Ansar Allah was established in November 2008 by Sheikh Abdel Latif Moussa, who had headed a Salafi organization in Gaza since the 1980s, and Khalid Banat (Abu Abdullah Suri), who claimed to have fought with leading al Qaeda figures including Osama bin Laden and Abu Musab al Zarqawi. Jund Ansar Allah was an al-Qaeda inspired organization ideologically affiliated with the movement for global jihad. Moussa, an \\"Egyptian-educated physician-turned- cleric,\\" was the group's spiritual leader. He left his medical practice in Rafah to become one of the most influential preachers in the southern Gaza Strip. In his Friday sermons that attracted thousands of young men, Moussa argued that Hamas had failed to properly institute Sharia law and had become too lenient. Hamas repeatedly warned Moussa and his followers to abandon his mosque in Rafah. Jund Ansar Allah remained relatively unknown until 8 June 2009 when it launched a military operation against an IDF force near the Nahal Oz border crossing in the northern Gaza Strip. The IDF successfully foiled the attack, which incorporated the use of horses booby-trapped with IEDs and explosives. Five Jund Ansar Allah operatives died in the operation. The organization also clashed with Hamas. On 22 July 2009, three Jund Ansar Allah militants holed up in a building in Khan Younis surrendered in a standoff with Hamas police. Armed activities On 8 June 2009 the group carried out a raid on the Karni border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Israel. Ten individuals from the group rode into battle on horses laden with large quantities of explosives, with at least three of them being shot dead by Israeli troops. Israeli officials said several of the men had been wearing explosive belts, and suspected they had been attempting to kidnap a soldier.Profile: Jund Ansar Allah, BBC News 15-08-2009 Hamas officials also blamed the group for the bombings of several internet cafes, seen as a source of immorality, and of a wedding party attended by relatives of the West Bank- based Fatah leader, Muhammad Dahlan, in which fifty people were injured. Jund Ansar Allah denied any responsibility for the latter attack, and Fatah leaders blamed Hamas. In August 2009, a senior Hamas official told The Jerusalem Post that Jund Ansar Allah received its weapons from former Fatah policemen and security officials in the southern Gaza Strip and that the aim of its attacks were to \\"defame\\" Hamas. Declaration of an Islamic emirate On Friday, 14 August 2009, Moussa unexpectedly declared the creation of an Islamic emirate in the Gaza Strip before 100 of his armed followers at the Ibn-Taymiyah mosque in Rafah.Hamas says Gaza now under control, BBC News 15-08-2009 During his sermon, Moussa condemned Hamas for failing to implement Sharia law and acting like a \\"secular government.\\" Regarding the sermon as a challenge to its rule over the Gaza Strip, Hamas forces surrounded the mosque and demanded those inside surrender. Exchanges of gunfire erupted into a seven-hour battle in which Hamas fighters sealed off the entire neighborhood and fired rocket- propelled grenades at the mosque. During the firefight, 24 Palestinians were killed and more than 130 injured. The dead included twelve Jund Ansar Allah members, six Hamas members and six non-combatants, including three young children aged 8, 10 and 13.Jund Ansar Allah: Operation against us was unwarranted, Ma'an 16-08-2009All 24 victims of Friday's Rafah clashes identified, buried, Ma'an 07-09-2009 An Egyptian security official said a three-year-old boy across the border with Egypt was critically wounded by a bullet from the fighting. Moussa killed himself and a Hamas fighter by detonating an explosive belt strapped around his waist after being trapped in his house. The house was dynamited by Hamas forces.Mai Yaghi, Gaza clashes between Hamas, Islamist radicals kill 13, AFP 14-08-2009 Abu-Jibril Shimali, head of Hamas' Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades in the southern Gaza Strip, died in the fighting. Israel believes that Shimali orchestrated the abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in a June 2006 cross-border raid. Hamas did not permit media coverage of the event, barring journalists from entering Rafah or interviewing the wounded. Following the clashes, a number of al-Qaida- affiliated groups condemned Hamas as an apostate movement that committed \\"massacre\\" and charged Hamas's actions to \\"serve the interest of the Jewish usurpers of Palestine and the Christians who are fighting Muslims in Iraq, Afghanistan, Chechnya and Somalia\\".Gaza's radical Islamists: Hamas serves the Jewish usurpers, JPost, August 20, 2009 Websites associated with Fatah later released cellphone footage of what appeared to be Hamas executing Jund Ansar Allah fighters during the clash. The video showed black-clad Hamas militants gathering several men from the rebel group in a mosque courtyard, and then mowing them down in a fierce burst of gunfire. Some of the Jund Ansar Allah men were shown lying motionless and bleeding on the ground. In two scenes, Hamas militants appeared to be shooting captives execution-style at close range, and bodies were seen falling to the ground. In another scene, a group of Jund Ansar Allah captives were seen standing motionless against a wall a few meters away. Israeli television Channel 10 also broadcast a recording of what it said was the Hamas military communication channel, ordering Hamas forces to execute everyone. There was no immediate comment from Hamas officials. However, Hamas had previously denied that an execution took place at the site, or that members of Jund Ansar Allah were \\"massacred.\\"Avi Issacharoff, Hamas men killing Al-Qaida rebels caught on tape, Haaretz 26-08-2009 Following the battle, Jund Ansar Allah vowed to attack Hamas security compounds and mosques in retaliation. On 29 August, bombs exploded inside a security compound and near a mosque in Gaza City, according to security officials. Nobody was injured in the attacks. Jund Ansar al-Jihad wal Sunna, a previously unknown Islamist group, claimed responsibility for the attack on the Hamas security headquarters, declaring: \\"We urge our jihadist brothers to join forces to conduct painful joint attacks against those miscreant apostates [Hamas] and end their reign.\\" https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jghfSEQWXkoxob19Acz8XKzqGMgg, AFP 04-09-2009 The Associated Press said that \\"the two explosions appear[ed] to be revenge attacks against Gaza's Islamic Hamas rulers,\\" and suggested a link with Jund Ansar Allah.Rizek Abdul Jawad, 2 bombs explode in Gaza compound, outside mosque, Associated Press 29-08-2009 Ideology A message issued on the group's website and jihadist forums on the day of the clash with Hamas stated: > \\"The soldiers of Tawhid (monotheism) will not rest ... until the entirety of > Muslim lands are liberated and until our imprisoned Aqsa (mosque) is > purified from the desecration of the accursed Jews\\".

Journal of Neutron Research 17, 2014 pp. 35-43 is free and open-source (GNU Public License) software simulator for neutron scattering experiments. McStas is an abbreviation for Monte carlo Simulation of triple axis spectrometers, but the software can be used to simulate all types of neutron scattering instruments. The software is based on both Monte Carlo methods and ray tracing. A special compiler translates a domain-specific language describing the neutron instrument geometry and component definitions (written in C) to a stand-alone C code. The basics of McStas was written in 1997 at Ris√∏ for simulation of their neutron experiments, that were based at the DR3 reactor that was shut down in year 2000. After the fusion of Ris√∏ with the Technical University of Denmark, McStas is currently developed at the Physics department of DTU and Institut Laue-Langevin, with involvement from the Niels Bohr Institute and Paul Scherrer Institute. The Copenhagen-based Data Management and Software Centre of the European Spallation Source is also expected to become a partner since many of the future instruments are being simulated using McStas. McXtrace, an equivalent simulation package using X-rays instead of neutrons, started being developed in 2009 and it is now freely available.

Life He was the son of Robert Donne and descended from John Dwnn of Radnorshire, was educated at Oxford, where he was a member of All Souls College, and was admitted to the degree of B.C.L. 14 July 1572. Eight years later the higher degree was conferred on him, when he became Principal of New Inn Hall. He entered the College of Advocates 22 January 1582, and in 1598 was appointed Dean of Arches and master of requests. In the following year he sat with Sir Julius Caesar and others on two commissions which were appointed to inquire into the grievances of Danish and French fishermen and merchants respectively. He was also a member of the commission formed in 1601 with the object of framing measures for the suppression of piracy by English sailors; and as John Whitgift's vicar-general he sat with five bishops on special commissions at the provincial synod and at convocation. About this time he was made a master in chancery, and was one of nine civilians who drew up an argument in support of oaths ex officio in ecclesiastical courts. In 1602 he was appointed commissioner, together with Ralph Eure, 3rd Baron Eure and Sir John Herbert, to confer at Bremen with commissioners sent by the King of Denmark concerning the feasibility of a treaty which should put an end to the frequent quarrels between Danish and English fishermen. On the successful termination of this mission Donne was rewarded with a knighthood. Shortly after the accession of James I he was placed on a commission under the Archbishop of Canterbury to inquire into heresies and offences against the marriage laws in the diocese of Winchester, with powers of summary jurisdiction, and he also attended the conference held at Hampton Court in reference to ecclesiastical courts. In the same year (1604), when the universities were empowered to send representatives to parliament, he was one of the first two elected by Oxford University, and he was reelected in 1614. A pension was in the following year granted to him by royal warrant. The last commission on which Donne sat was that appointed in 1616 to conduct an examination on the marriage of Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset. Donne published nothing, but in Letters from the Bodleian Library, 1813, ii. 207-21, is an account of William Aubrey, printed from a manuscript supposed to be in his writing. He had married one of Aubrey's six daughters, and had succeeded him in the headship of New Inn. He died 15 September 1617.

Career  Watercolour portrait of Prudente, by Fran√ßois Roux, commissioned by Willaumez. In 1791, under lieutenant Villaret de Joyeuse, she was tasked with ferrying troops to Cap-Fran√ßais and with police duty in Santo Domingo. In 1793, she returned to France, escorting a convoy from Terre-Neuve, under Villaret de Joyeuse, by then promoted to Captain. In 1794, she was the flagship of a frigate division under Captain Renaud, also comprising Cyb√®le, under Pierre Julien Tr√©houart. She took part in the Sunda Strait campaign of January 1794 and in the Action of 22 October 1794 off Ile de France. During the Sunda Strait campaign the squadron captured the East Indiaman Pigot. In 1796, Prudente was attached to the squadron under Sercey, that had come from France. She served for a time at Mauritius, taking part in the Action of 8 September 1796, before being sold and becoming a privateer.Hennequin, p. 209 Capture captured Prudente on 9 February 1799 near Table Bay, Cape of Good Hope. At daybreak Daedalus spotted two sails and gave chase to the larger vessel, catching up with her at about 12:30. The quarry struck after an action of almost an hour. She proved to be the Prudente, which Captain H.L. Ball referred to as a French National frigate, rather than a privateer. She was pierced for 42 guns but was armed with twenty-six 12-pounder long guns on her main-deck and two long 6-pounders and two brass howitzers on her quarterdeck. She had a crew of 297 men. In the fight, Daedalus lost two men killed and 12 wounded. Prudente lost 27 men killed and 22 wounded. The ship in her company, which escaped, was an American vessel that she had taken as a prize.

Local legends claim that the house is haunted, and shortly after Declan moves in, he begins hearing voices and seeing things. Declan is also distracted by an undeniable attraction to Cajun local, Lena Simone. Lena was raised on the bayou by her grandmother Odette (Dunaway), and has her own deep connection with the manor. While living in the house, Declan begins to have visions from a century past and details of events that took place in the mansion. With the help of Odette, Declan and Lena realize that they are inextricably linked with Manet Hall, and uncover a shocking secret that has been hidden there for more than 100 years.

He wrote one of the earliest Holocaust memoirs, Nine Suitcases (Kilenc koffer in Hungarian). Tibor Fischer has called it \\"Hungary's finest contribution to Holocaust writing\\", warning that it is \\"not for the squeamish\\". It has been translated into English by Ladislaus L√∂b. Early life Zsolt was born in 1895, in Kom√°rom and died in Budapest. Before World War I and whilst still a young man, Zsolt was already considered an outstanding representative of the Hungarian Decadence movement. In the tumultuous years of revolution, 1918 and 1919, he was a vehement advocate for a bourgeois-liberal regime and opponent of the soviet republics and Horthy's emerging Christian-nationalist corporate state. In the intervening years between the wars, Zsolt gains recognition as a playwright, novelist and political journalist. He blamed \\"folksy populists . . . who decried urban Western civilization and championed a chauvinistic system based on the alleged strength and purity of an unspoiled Magyar race rooted in the Hungarian countryside\\" for the Hungarian right wing government's rise to power. Holocaust in Hungary Like thousands of other Hungarian Jews in the World War II B√©la Zsolt served in a forced labor battalion on the Ukrainian eastern front. This was extremely dangerous and many of Hungary's intellectuals were killed this way. He worked as a gravedigger as White Ukrainians, Nazis and Hungarian soldiers burnt villages. He describes how the inhabitants \\"tumble all over the ground, into the glowing ashes\\" as they are shot while fleeing. By spring 1944, after the Nazis invaded Hungary during Operation Margarethe, Szolt was arrested by Hungarian fascists and held at the Nagyv√°rad ghetto. Located just across the border from Hungary in Romania, known today as Oradea, it became a collection point for Hungarian Jews. Zsolt's daughter was among those deported to Poland; she lost her life in Auschwitz. As part of the so-called 'Kasztner train' Zsolt's freedom, along with that of a thousand other Hungarian Jews, was bought from the Nazis. He spent the second half of 1944 in Bergen-Belsen with his wife awaiting emigration. They move to Switzerland followed in December. Following his return to Hungary in 1945 Zsolt founded the Hungarian Radical Party, whose newspaper Halad√°s (\\"Progress\\") he edited. Zsolt was elected to the National Assembly of Hungary at his second attempt in 1947. He did not live to see the ultimate seizure of power by the communists. B√©la Zsolt died in 1949 following a serious illness.B√©la Zsolt, Nine Suitcases; translated by Ladislaus Lob. London: Jonathan Cape, 2004 ; London: Pimlico Publishing, 2005Nine Suitcases was originally published in weekly instalments. The first installment appeared on 30 May 1946, and the last on 27 February 1947. Two of his books have been published in Germany: Neun Koffer; Eine seltsame Ehe (\\"A dunaparti n√∂\\")Nine Suitcases has been adapted for the British theater. Nine Suitcases Zsolt's memoir Nine Suitcases has been called \\"Hungary's finest contribution to Holocaust writing\\". The memoir is noted for its black humor and the author \\"a cool, urbane guide to the horrors\\". There are relatively few memoirs written by Hungarian survivors, some published posthumously such as Mikl√≥s Radn√≥ti. Though Nine Suitcases, considered one of the best, was one of the first memoirs to be serialized in 1946‚Äì1947, Zsolt died before he finished editing the text, and it wasn't available in English until L√∂b's translation was published 60 years later. Zsolt's text can be difficult to follow in its examination of the history of Jews in Hungary for readers unfamiliar with the history, but L√∂b's translation includes an introduction and footnotes. Zsolt was assimilated and did not hold the Yiddish-speaking Hassidim he was interned with in high regard. English writer Ian Thomson has written: > In unsparing detail, Zsolt describes the bestial insouciance of the ghetto's > Hungarian guards who beat and tormented old women and children. Nazi > stooges, these men stopped at nothing in their pursuit of money and > jewellery. Zsolt has been described as apathetic and cunning, traits that have been credited with helping to keep him alive: \\"At times his stoicism verges on the distasteful, and there is a complete absence of special pleading.\\" He describes the violence of the Nazis in disbelief: \\"They are killing us for the sake of objects\\". The book, which condemns the Hungarian Catholic Church and Hungarian nationalists for anti-semitism, was banned for being \\"insufficiently propagandist\\" in Communist Hungary for 40 years.

Within the conservation levels this species fits into species the least concerned category. Due to the beauty and sturdiness of the species flowers it can be found outside of its range due to being used for horticultural and landscaping purposes,and is found in gardens and landscapes in a wide variety of countries including the United Kingdom and the Eastern United States. As well as being a beautiful landscaping species for businesses and residential gardens alike, this species have been used in a wide array of research projects and studies that have been conducted at a variety of Universities in countries around the world including Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States to name a few.  Description  A small deciduous shrub reaching 3 to 4 ft in height. This shrub contains intricate hairy branches that are twisted and bent at opposite angles. The leaves on this shrub are deep toothed, and are covered in stinging hairs. Hydrangea hirta has alternating leaves that are 5 to 8 cm long with an egg shape that comes to a pointed tip. Yellowing and dropping of the leaves commences in August. As this shrub gets older the branches and leaves begin to smooth due to the loss of the stinging hairs. The flowers of this shrub tend to grow in small clusters that are light blue to white in color. An individual flower of this species measures 5 cm in diameter with 5 petals and 10 stamens; this species lacks the ornamental bracts that many other hydrangea species possess. Each flower is fertile, and contains an urceolate seeds swell in the middle and begins to narrow at the top within the flower clusters that contain a central stem bearing a single terminal flower that develops first, the other flowers in the cluster developing as terminal buds of lateral stems. At the base of a flower pod the typical forming of the whorl that encloses the petals and forms a protective layer around a flower in bud is fairly small reaching to be approximately 2 to 3 inches across.  Distributions  This shrub is native to the mountain ranges of Japan, and extends from the Himalayas through China to Taiwan. In Japan the Hydrangea Hirta species is located in the cool-temperate rainforest belt, otherwise known as the Montane Temperate Rainforest. This rainforest belt had a range of 1200 meters in elevation in Kyushu, at 1,000 ‚Äì 1800 meters in Shikoku, 800 ‚Äì 1650 meters in Chubum and the lowlands of south Hokkaido. An example of where this species can be located is in the Tsuga Sieboldii Forest that covers the Pacific side of Honshu and Shikoku where this shrub is a species that helps compose the 20% to 40% shrub cover layer in the lower area of the orotemperate belt.  Ecology  Hydrangea hirta is a slow growing deciduous species that requires podosolic soils that are more acidic, heavily leached, and moist, with colder and wetter climate conditions. This species is shade tolerant and prefers areas of light shade with partial or full shade. The reproduction of this species is completed by bee pollination with a blooming season that starts in June or late spring and ends in the early summer. However, bee pollination is not the only way this species reproduces, other forms of reproduction for this species includes the ability to reproduce from the parent stock by the breaking of woody stems, of semi hardwood stems, softwood stems, and the ability to grow new plants from buried aerial stems that will eventually break off and make new plants.  Taxonomy  Hydrangea is pronounced hy-DRAIN-juh. Hydrangea is Greek in origin, and comes from Greek hudro- meaning ‚Äúwater‚Äù and angeion meaning ‚Äúa vessel‚Äù describing to the shape of the cup shaped fruit and the capsule the fruit is contained in. The hirta portion of this species name means ‚Äúhairy‚Äù, and is pronounced HUR-ta. Another name for this species is Hortensia hirta. Hortensia is a Latinised version of the French given name Hortense, referring to the wife of Jean-Andr√© Lepaute. The vernacular name for this species is Viburnum hirtum. While viburnum comes from a Latin origin, and means a small shrub or tree within the temperate and warm regions that bare flat or rounded clusters of white flowers. While hirtum is also Latin in origin, and means ‚Äúhairy‚Äù with a thick growth. In Japan the name for this species is ko-ajisai meaning small hydrangea.  Synonymous  Hydrangea hirta f. albiflora Hydrangea hirta f. lamalis Hydrangea hirta var. albiflora  Uses  This species has started to be used horticulturally and in landscaping. The seeds for this species can purchased online through a multitude of vendors online, and are commonly found in Europe include the United Kingdom, and parts of the United States. In the European countries that this species can be found in it is notably susceptible to honey fungus.The leaves of this species can be eaten once they have been cooked, and is usually served with rice.  Studies and Research  This species has also been used in a wide variety of studies and research projects. A recent project that was conducted by the Department of Forestry at Kyoto University in Kyoto Japan conducted its research on spatial arrangement of the floral buds of plants which perform functions such as climbing and protection of the terminal parts showing their stems nature with emphasis on herbivory on the shoots that have grown in the new growing season. Another portion of this study was done on the competition from surrounding species and compare the requirements that is needed for the support of the species to grow. A recent article that was published by the University of Chicago Press was on an already conducted research project that included a variety of Hydrangea species, including the Hydrangea hirta that was on the phylogenetic implications of seed morphology the species. This study was conducted on eleven seed characteristics including shape, primary sculpture, secondary sculpture, and appendages. The last example of a research study was done on the genome size and base composition on a variety 16 species and subspecies of hydrangea, including hydrangea hirta. The study showed that natural hybrids between thy hydrangea species are rare. However, this study stated that there have been natural hybrids found in the Izu Peninsula of Japan between Hydrangea hirta and Hydrangea scadens. However, for breeding programs and or potentially enlarging the genetic diversity in cultivated species this study looked at the natural hybrids evolutionary development and diversification.

He became Secretary and President of the Young Liberal Association of Quebec. He was first elected to Parliament at the Rimouski riding in the 1917 general election, initially under the \\"Laurier Liberal\\" banner used as a result of the Conscription Crisis of 1917 which split the Liberals into pro-conscription Liberal Unionists and anti- conscription \\"Laurier Liberal\\" factions. He was re-elected there in 1921 as a Liberal. d'Anjou resigned on 4 October 1924 to open the seat for Eug√®ne Fiset. Fifteen years later, after Fiset resigned from Parliament to become Quebec's Lieutenant-Governor, d'Anjou returned to the Rimouski riding, winning in the 1940 election. On 22 June 1944, as a result of the Conscription Crisis of 1944, d'Anjou left the Liberals and crossed the floor to join the Bloc populaire which opposed conscription during World War II. By the end of his term in the 19th Canadian Parliament, d'Anjou left the Bloc and aligned with an independent anti-conscription candidates group headed by Fr√©d√©ric Dorion.

Career Born in Oundle and apprenticed at Whitbread, Benjamin Greene initially founded a brewing business in 1801 with John Clark in Bury St Edmunds.Benjamin Greene at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Then in 1806 he dissolved that partnership and established a new venture with William Buck at the Westgate Brewery. It was this venture that became Greene King. On the death of Sir Patrick Blake, 2nd Baronet he became the executor and, on the subsequent death of Sir Patrick's widow, the owner of some estates in the West Indies. He was a supporter of the arts and in 1819 lent ¬£5,000 to William Wilkins to build the Theatre Royal in Bury St Edmunds.The Theatre Royal He acquired the Bury and Suffolk Herald in 1828 and as proprietor took an ultra-conservative position opposing both the Reform Bill and the Slavery Abolition Bill. This position attracted much criticism and three libel actions. He left Bury St Edmunds in 1836 and established with his son, Benjamin Greene & Son, West India merchants and shipowners, at 11 Mincing Lane, London. He made three claims under the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 and was awarded a total of ¬£4,033 15s 7d compensation for the 231 slaves he had owned on his estates in Montserrat and St Kitts. The Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave-ownership at UCL describes him as an enthusiastic supporter of slavery, being particularly active between 1828-1833.

Sanford Professor of Economics at Princeton University, and a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He is a faculty member of Princeton's Department of Economics and director of the Bendheim Center for Finance. His research focuses on international financial markets and the macro economy with special emphasis on bubbles, liquidity, financial crises and monetary policy. He promoted the concepts of liquidity spirals, CoVaR as co-risk measure, the paradox of prudence, and the I Theory of Money. He is or was a member of several advisory groups, including to the IMF, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the European Systemic Risk Board, the German Bundesbank and the U.S. Congressional Budget Office. Education and academic career Growing up in Landshut, Germany, Brunnermeier was expected to follow his father into the business of carpentry. A slump in the construction industry lead Brunnermeier onto a different path. He worked for the German tax office in Landshut and Munich and served in the German Army before enrolling as an undergraduate student at the University of Regensburg in 1991. He continued his studies at Vanderbilt University, receiving a master's degree in Economics in 1994. Subsequently, he joined the European Doctoral Program first at the Bonn Graduate School of Economics and from 1995 to 1999 at the London School of Economics. He was awarded his Ph.D. by the London School of Economics (LSE) in 1999. While at the London School of Economics, Brunnermeier parleyed a survey paper into a book on asset prices, bubbles, herding and crashes. He was subsequently hired by Princeton University as an assistant professor in 1999. He became full professor in 2006 and assumed his current chaired professorship as Edwards S. Sanford Professor of Economics in 2008. In 2011, he set up the Julis- Rabinowitz Center for Public Policy and Finance at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School. In 2014, he became director of Princeton's Bendheim Center for Finance. Selected awards, memberships, and editorial services Brunnermeier received several career awards. In 1999, he was selected for the Review of Economic Studies Tour. He was named a Sloan Fellow in 2005, a Guggenheim Fellow and a Fellow of the Econometric Society in 2010. In 2008 he was awarded the Germ√°n Bern√°cer Prize, which is granted to a European economists under 40. In 2016, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) appointed him as the Lamfalussy Senior Research Fellow. Brunnermeier is also affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Centre for Economic Policy Research in London, and directs the \\"Macro, Money and International Finance\\" area at the CESifo network. He is or was a member of several advisory groups, including to the IMF, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the European Systemic Risk Board, the German Bundesbank and the U.S. Congressional Budget Office. Brunnermeier was an associate editor of several journals, including The American Economic Review, The Journal of Finance, The Review of Financial Studies, the Journal of the European Economic Association and the Journal of Financial Intermediation. Selected Research Brunnermeier's research lies at the intersection of international macro, monetary and financial economics. He primarily studies distortions caused by financial frictions. These frictions invalidate the Efficient market hypothesis (EMH), a proposition that markets incorporate all information relevant to prices immediately and consequently the price of a given asset accurately represents the likely value of that asset.There are multiple forms of the EMH, each with various levels of confidence among academics economists. Among the strong, semi-strong, and weak versions of the hypothesis, the latter have higher levels of support. See Beechey, Gruen & Vickery (2000) for more detail. Price efficiency, bubbles, liquidity, and systemic risk Faced with the empirical evidence that asset prices diverged from their fundamentals during the dot-com bubble, Brunnermeier crafted a model of trading where participants in the market would recognize bubbles in asset prices but continue to trade \\"into the wind\\". Brunnermeier's empirical paper, coauthored with Stefan Nagel, documents that hedge funds were riding the dot-com bubble. The paper won the Smith Breeden Prize in 2004. Brunnermeier and Lasse Pedersen introduced different liquidity concepts and studied liquidity spirals, which are vicious cycles that amplify initial shocks and provide an explanation for the liquidity crisis in 2008. Brunnermeier with Tobias Adrian from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York created one of the first systemic risk measures, the CoVaR, an alternative to value at risk which takes spillover and contagion effects between assets and industries into account. Macroeconomy and finance Brunnermeier and Yuliy Sannikov integrated financial frictions into macro and international economic models. Their macro models capture non-linearities that occur during crises episodes. They also introduced the concept of volatility paradox, which refers to the phenomenon that risk builds up primarily during tranquil times in background in the form of imbalances and only materializes when crises erupt. Monetary theory and financial regulation Brunnermeier and Sannikov's monetary paper, The I Theory of Money, studies debt deflation √† la Fisher and the interaction between (redistributive) monetary policy and macroprudential policy. The \\"Paradox of Prudence\\" emerges: micro-prudent behavior of individual financial institutions is not necessarily macro-prudent. His approach provides an alternative to the predominant New-Keynesian view, in which price and wage rigidities are the primary frictions. International financial markets Brunnermeier's work on international finance documents the link between carry trades and currency crashes. He also analyzes sudden stops in international credit flows and other inefficiencies due to pecuniary externalities. Euro and economic philosophies Further work of Brunnermeier focuses on the architecture of the euro and the Eurozone. His book, The Euro and the Battle of Ideas, (together with Harold James, from Princeton's Department of History, and Jean-Pierre Landau), from the Banque de France and International Monetary Fund, shows, how core problems of the euro are also linked to conflicting political and economic philosophies of the Eurozone's founding countries, especially those of Germany and France, and discusses ways to reconcile the competing views. Brunnermeier also proposes European Safe Bonds (ESBies) in form of Sovereign Bond Backed Securities (SBBS) as a means to break the vicious circle between sovereign risk and bank risk in the Eurozone and to rechannel flight-to-safety capital flows from cross-border flows to flows across tranches of the ESBies.

Shuttleworth is in his late 50s and is from Walkley in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. He has a quiet manner and slightly nerdish tendencies. His musical talents are usually expressed through his PSS portable keyboard and include \\"Pigeons in Flight\\", a song that Shuttleworth attempted to have selected for the Eurovision Song Contest. Character portrait Shuttleworth is a pathetic character, essentially decent and benevolent, but with a painful lack of self-awareness. The unfortunate gap between his actual musical talent and his steadfast belief in the possibility of his eventual pop super-stardom is the main source of the character's tragi-comedy. His \\"next-door neighbour and sole agent\\", Ken Worthington is more of a hindrance than a help in John's life. The character was inspired by some demo tapes sent in to Chappell Music, where Fellows - who had previously had UK chart success as the character Jilted John - worked as a songwriter in the 1980s, and takes some of his mannerisms from Graham's father and from mouse breeders he knew as a young man in Sheffield. A character prototypical of John Shuttleworth appeared on the single \\"Men of Oats And Creosote\\", issued under Fellows' own name in 1979.45cat.com Appearing on BBC Radio 4's Midweek programme, on 3 June 2015, Fellows suggested that Shuttleworth was an amalgamation of the \\"very steady types\\" he had served beer to in a working men's club in Sheffield and the more eccentric characters he had met while showing fancy mice. Supporting characters Shuttleworth has fronted several radio and television series, usually supported by other characters, also voiced by Fellows, including agent / manager, Ken Worthington (\\"TV's Mr. Clarinet Man\\"), who came last on the TV talent show New Faces in 1973, as well as John's wife Mary Shuttleworth, their two teenage children Darren and Karen, and Mary's friend Joan Chitty. Other characters included Janet Le Row (formerly Rowbotham), who shares John's agent - John came up with the idea for a name change, which has brought Janet relative success; a fellow singer-songwriter; Plonker, a friend of Darren; Maxime, a friend of Karen; and Peter Cornelius, a salesman, and friend of Ken, who is always keen to sell his products. Broadcasting The Shuttleworths' various adventures have featured on several radio shows, including The Shuttleworths, Shuttleworth's Showtime and Radio Shuttleworth, with Fellows supplying all the voices and performing on his organ. He also made a four-part TV series supposedly filmed by Worthington, 500 Bus Stops (the title being a parodying reference to Frank Zappa's 200 Motels), about a UK national tour thwarted very early when his beloved Y-reg Austin Ambassador broke down, but then continued by public transport. The venues visited were invariably mundane and uninspiring, and situations experienced usually demoralising, but were optimistically dealt with as if they were defining moments in his career. There followed a television special, Europigeon, following the success (or otherwise) of \\"Pigeons in Flight\\". In May 2008 Fellows appeared in the BBC's Comedy Map of Britain in which he discussed the origin of his Shuttleworth character. In February 2019, The Shuttleworths was placed at number 26 in the Radio Times 'Top 30 From Plomley To Peel' poll of BBC radio shows (Radio Times print edition, 16-22 Feb 2019). Radio * The Shuttleworths (5 series, Radio 4, 1993‚Äì2010) * Shuttleworth's Showtime (1 series, Radio 1, 1994) * Radio Shuttleworth (2 series, Radio 4, 1998‚Äì2000) * John Shuttleworth's Open Mind (1 series, Radio 4, 2006) * John Shuttleworth's Lounge Music (2 series, Radio 4, 2014‚Äì2016) Shuttleworth has also guested on Mark and Lard's Graveyard Shift on Radio 1 and on Radio 4's Loose Ends.

Fellows explained, in an interview for The Scotsman, in March 2015: \\"It does make me think he [John Shuttleworth] needs to be moved into another sphere. By that I am hinting at the animation project we are trying to get off the ground. Kevin Baldwin, who has done a lot of animation for me over the years, and I have worked on an animation of The Shuttleworths. It‚Äôs nearly finished and would be a great way to immortalise John.\\" As of December 2015 the programme had not been picked up by a broadcaster, although test scenes and still images were available to view on-line and a short four minute animated teaser, titled \\"Unaccompanied Lady\\", was included as an extra on the DVD release of \\"It's Nice Up North\\". In late 2016 a full 22-minute long pilot episode was released through Amazon Video It's Nice Up North and Southern Softies In 2006, Fellows (as Shuttleworth) made a film with photographer Martin Parr, entitled It's Nice Up North, in which Shuttleworth tests his theory that British people are nicer the further north one ventures by visiting the Shetland Islands, the most northerly part of the United Kingdom. In summer 2007 he travelled to the Channel Islands to shoot another film, Southern Softies. Again featuring an appearance from Parr, Shuttleworth aims to discover whether people are softer the further south you go.

A John Shuttleworth voice was also planned. Stage show In April 2007 Shuttleworth started touring with a new stage show With My Condiments. It was inspired by Jamie Oliver's promotion of healthy food for school children. Fellows thought \\"what would happen if Shuttleworth did the same for a slightly older age group\\".The Independent, 20 April 2007 (5-minute Interview) In June, Shuttleworth's 4 Rather Tasty Tracks was released as a download or CD, reaching the appropriately modest number 96 in the UK charts and number 29 in the Indie Charts in July 2007. In November 2008 Shuttleworth began his Minor Tour ‚Äì and other Mythological Creatures tour. In October 2010 Shuttleworth began a five-month A Man With No More Rolls tour, claiming that it was a misprint and should have been called A Man With No Morals. In Spring 2015 it was announced that Shuttleworth was to appear in a one-night concert John Shuttleworth & Friends, on 28 June 2015, at the London Palladium. The concert, celebrating 30 years of the character, and in aid of multiple sclerosis charities, would include appearances by Chas & Dave, Toyah, Martyn Ware of Heaven 17, John Otway, Leee John of Imagination, Gordon Giltrap, Jon McClure of Reverend and The Makers and Sooty and Sweep. Shuttleworth suggested there would also be a rare appearance by Jilted John. In Spring 2017, Shuttleworth embarked on a 53-date \\"farewell\\" tour, titled \\"My Last Will And Tasty Mint\\".

From Boston, Kane moved to Exeter, New Hampshire, as the first woman named to the George Bennett Fellowship in Writing at Phillips Exeter Academy. In 1976, Kane moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where she began to incorporate her impressions of the unique landscape and culture of the area into her poetry. Taking a job as a technical writer in New Orleans, she became associated with poets who frequented the weekly literary readings held at the Maple Leaf Bar‚Äîincluding Yusef Komunyakaa, Grace Bauer, and Everette Maddox. In 1982, British poet Geoffrey Godbert's Only Poetry Press published a two- woman collection of Kane's and Ruth Adatia's poems, titled Two Into One. In 1987, Kane's first full-length poetry collection, Body and Soul, came out from Pirogue Publishing. In 1991, Greville Press published her chapbook, The Bartender Poems, and she was introduced by Harold Pinter at the Southbank Centre in London. Kane returned to graduate school at Louisiana State University in 1991. While there, she won the Academy of American Poets Prize and wrote her dissertation on the villanelle under poet Dave Smith.

It was founded by Michel Collin, a French priest in Lille, and self-proclaimed Pope Clement XV, saying he was inspired by \\"unknown messages\\" from the Virgin Mary. The group was led by Jean-Gaston Tremblay (1928‚Äì2011), also named John Gregory of the Trinity, or Gregory XVII. History Frenchman Michel Collin (sometimes spelled Colin),Most easily available sources use the form \\"Collin\\", but \\"Colin\\" is found in a summary of the book Cl√©ment XV, pr√™tre lorrain et pape √† Cl√©mery by Antoine Delestre. born in a village of Lorraine in 1905 and ordained a priest in 1935, announced in 1936 that he had been ordained a bishop by Christ himself. He founded a community called the Order of the Mother of God (a name later changed to \\"Apostles of Infinite Love\\"), in response to the 1846 request made by the Blessed Virgin Mary, as reported later by M√©lanie Calvat, one of the seers of La Salette. In 1950 he announced that he had been crowned Pope and had taken the name Clement XV.Michael W. Cuneo: The Smoke of Satan: Conservative and Traditionalist Dissent in Contemporary American Catholicism (JHU Press, 1999) , , pp. 121-134 Pope Pius XII laicized him in 1951 and publicly declared him, by name, a vitandus (one who should be avoided) excommunicate. In 1952, Canadian Jean-Gaston Tremblay (1928‚Äì2011) founded, near Saint-Jovite in Quebec, Canada, a community under the name of the Congregation of Jesus and Mary. In 1961, he met Michel Collin and the two decided to merge their communities into one called the Apostles of Infinite Love. The following year Collin consecrated Tremblay a bishop. The Saint-Jovite community grew rapidly in the first years of the Second Vatican Council. In 1967, Collin announced that he had been divinely instructed to bypass Tremblay as his designated successor; but in 1968, Tremblay declared that he had mystically been made Pope under the name of Gregory XVII and, in the following year, Collin acknowledged that Tremblay was now Pope. In France, Collin's movement broke up into different factions some years after his death in 1974. The Canadian group continues, using the name \\"Apostles of Infinite Love\\", and giving more prominence to the name \\"Order of the Magnificat of the Mother of God\\" and \\"Order of the Apostles of the Latter Times\\". Controversies From 1978 to 2001, the movement was sued because of alleged abuses, including rape, extortion and sexual abuse. Its millenarianism, apocalypticism and its rejection of the world contributed to qualify it as a cult in the Francophone press. In 1999, a hundred police officers raided their reclusive community in St. Jovite. The co-accused was Reynald Huot, aka Father Andr√©. In 2001, the public prosecutor abandoned all charges against Jean-Gaston Tremblay after a 34-year investigation. In 2005, the city of Br√©beuf obtained a decree from the Quebec government allowing it to expropriate the land of the religious community.

The first Bah√° º√≠ pioneered to Angola about 1952. By 1963 there was a Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly in Luanda and smaller groups of Bah√° º√≠s in other cities. In 1992 the Bah√° º√≠s of Angola elected their first National Spiritual Assembly. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 2,000 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. Early Phase  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s Tablets of the Divine Plan  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book Tablets of the Divine Plan. The eighth and twelfth of the tablets mentioned Africa and were written on April 19, 1916 and February 15, 1917, respectively. Publication however was delayed in the United States until 1919‚Äîafter the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. The tablets were translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° mentions Bah√° º√≠s traveling \\"‚Ä¶especially from America to Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, and travel through Japan and China. Likewise, from Germany teachers and believers may travel to the continents of America, Africa, Japan and China; in brief, they may travel through all the continents and islands of the globe\\" and \\" ‚Ä¶the anthem of the oneness of the world of humanity may confer a new life upon all the children of men, and the tabernacle of universal peace be pitched on the apex of America; thus Europe and Africa may become vivified with the breaths of the Holy Spirit, this world may become another world, the body politic may attain to a new exhilaration‚Ä¶.\\" Establishment of the community By early 1952, a Bah√° º√≠ pioneer had arrived in Angola. In 1953 Shoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, planned an international teaching plan termed the Ten Year Crusade. During the plan pioneers moved to many countries including Angola from places like East Timor. This was during a period of wide scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa near the end of the period of Colonisation of Africa. In April 1956 the Bah√° º√≠ Faith was present in small numbers across 15 countries of southern Africa. To administer these communities a regional National Spiritual Assembly was elected in South West Africa to cover them. An election of a Local Spiritual Assembly in Luanda was attempted in 1954 and successfully in 1956. By 1963 an assembly was known in Luanda and smaller groups of Bah√° º√≠s were in Malange and Nova Gaia. Following the death of Shoghi Effendi, the elected Universal House of Justice was head of the religion and began to re-organized the Bah√° º√≠ communities of Africa, including Angola, by splitting off national communities to form their own National Assemblies from 1964 though the 1990s. In 1964 one of the interim regional national assemblies - of South and West Africa - had some 3,600 Bah√° º√≠s and 36 local assemblies. From 1977 to 1992 Angola and Mozambique shared a regional national assembly. In 1992 the Bah√° º√≠s of Angola elected their first National Spiritual Assembly, witnessed by Counsellour Rolf von Czekus, representing the Universal House of Justice at the proceedings. Modern community Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bah√° º√≠s were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bah√° º√≠ teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bah√° º√≠ socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. The Angolan Bah√° º√≠s at the local Centre in Luanda hosted an interfaith prayer gathering to mark the opening of the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders, which was held at the United Nations August 2000. Nine Bah√° º√≠s from Angola were among the thousand who gathered for a regional conference called for by the Universal House of Justice to be held in Lubumbashi, Congo, in November 2008. Others traveled to the regional conference held in Johannesburg South Africa. Demographics The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 2,051 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005.

It was formed in the late 1990s, as a branch of the Queen City Kings, which started in the Cedar Greene housing complex, east of Hidden Valley, near the streets of Craighead and North Tryon. The Queen City Kings were formed by a People Nation member who moved to Charlotte from Chicago in the mid 1990s. He initially established a People Nation faction in the Cedar Greene Apartment Complex but as a way to be inclusive of the growing Folk Nation influence within the growing Supreme King Queen Nation, an agreement was made by all parties involved to change the name of the gang to the Queen City Kings, which played on the nickname of the City of Charlotte, which people dub the \\"Queen City.\\" The name, according to the Original Kings, was the gang's affirmation to the claiming of the city, stating: \\"The Queen City is our bitch, which makes us the Kings.\\" Shortly thereafter, he was incarcerated on an unrelated offense. A Cedar Greene Apartments resident named \\"Korn,\\" along with Korn's half-brother, was left in charge; Korn proved to be a very charismatic and dedicated leader, remaining loyal to the movement until his suicide, several years later. The Kings, which originally stood for Knowledgeable Islamic Nubian Gods, then renamed Krucial Islamic Nubian Gods, was meant to be a Charlotte, home-grown version of the Chicago gangs. The Kings were structured similar to the Los Angeles gangs, but instead of \\"Original Gangsta\\" (OG) or \\"Baby Gangsta\\" (BG) the Queen City Kings used \\"Original King\\" (OK) or \\"Baby King\\" (BK). The Kings color is black but the Hidden Valley Kings wear the color green for their neighborhood, the Hidden Valley neighborhood sign is green and Hidden Valley Elementary school colors are green. Just as the nations in Chicago had different branches, or \\"sets,\\" the Queen City Kings had a number of small sets as well. These sets were actually small groups of members who lived in different Charlotte communities, who were dedicated to spreading the Kingz to each of these neighborhoods. Some of them were successful but many of them were unknown in their respective neighborhoods. Among the factions were the Wilmore Kings (WMK), Tuckaseegee Kings (TSK), Beatties Ford Kings (BFK), Derita King (DTK), North Side Jamaican Kings (NJK), Westside Kings (WSK) the Creek Town Kings (CTK or FOC), The Cedar Greene Kings (CGK), the Woodview Kings (WVK), the Hidden Valley Kings (HVK) among others of these various sets, the Hidden Valley Kings became the most prominent. Eventually, the Hidden Valley Kings gained independence as a gang, as the original concept and philosophy of the Queen City Kings seemed to have died with Korn, the gangs former leader. Korn's half-brother began to get heavily involved in rap and radio (many of the Original Queen City Kings were actually aspiring rap artists, with a full LP to their credit), seemingly leaving the gang life behind. The HVK now represents themselves with black bandanas. In the 2000s the gang's activities consisted mainly of selling narcotics for profit, though Corn often stated that \\"There are many hustles outside of selling drugs.\\" they began organizing the neighborhood, mimicking the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, dividing it into three zones. The Hidden Valley Kings don't have many known enemies, but within the neighborhood members have been known to have altercations with the United Blood Nation. The Hidden Valley kings home base is the Hidden Valley Neighborhood located on the city's northeast side. A small fraction of the gang also dominate a few apartments on West Blvd. But majority of them hangout in their home base neighborhood. On November 28, 2005, members of the Hidden Valley Kings ran into a rival drug dealer who refused to pay taxes at Eastland Mall. After a shootout in the mall's food court, the victim managed to escape. Later that night, the Kings lured the dealer into a local motel on North Tryon Street as they attempted to ambush the victim. Once again, the victim managed to escape. The Kings chased him down Tryon as the passengers of the two vehicles exchanged fire. After colliding with a telephone pole, the victim ran into a nearby neighborhood. After a brief chase, the Kings eventually caught up to the victim and while cornered, killed him, shooting him point-blank with an AK-47. The brutal manner in which the murder occurred triggered the Charlotte- Mecklenburg Police Department to begin taking action against the gang. The department put together a Special Operations Unit to take down the Hidden Valley Kings. They gathered informants and followed the Kings for almost two years gathering information on how the gang operated. On March 30, 2007, more than one hundred task force agents cracked down on the Kings. They arrested over 20 Hidden Valley King members, including the leaders, on multiple charges.

H. C. Society (founded on November 11, 1750). Today a number of secret societies are known (or believed) to exist at the College: the F.H.C Society or Flat Hat Club, the Seven Society, the 13 Club, the Ladies of Alpha, the Bishop James Madison Society, the Phi Society, the Wren Society, the W Society, the Y's, The Penny Brigade, The Cord, The Order of the Silver Roses, Dirty Shirley Fraternity, The Fourth Wall, and one group \\"simply called the Society.\\" 7 Society The 7 Society is a senior class society believed to have been founded in 1826. Its seven members, selected in their junior year, work to honor and encourage those who help strengthen the university, often through gifts. In 2003, for example, the \\"Sevens\\" left dozens of umbrellas for the Admissions Office to use during rainy campus tours. Historically, the society formally announced its members' identities as they graduated. In recent years, however, membership has become steeped in mystery‚Äîbeing only revealed in the event of death. There are a number of other secret societies with the word \\"seven\\" in their name, though there is no known evidence connecting the groups. One such society is the Seven Society at University of Virginia, founded in 1905, also noted for its philanthropic practices. 13 Club Given the society's name, the 13 Club, founded in 1890 and reactivated in 1994, is presumed to have thirteen members. Little information has been made public regarding their campus activities. In fact, the society maintains such a high level of secrecy that even members' wives and children are unaware of their membership. Such was the case of Louise Kale, Director of William and Mary's Historic Campus, who only became aware of her father's membership after his death. Although club membership and activities are kept secret, the 13s have allowed for outside communication through their campaign \\"Be Here Now\\" and campus speaker series \\"One Last Thing.\\" In historical archives, a photo of their members was published in the 1939 edition of the W&M; yearbook and presumably other years. Alpha Society The all-female Alpha Society was likely created to counteract the college's male-dominated secret societies. It was created by Martha Barksdale in 1918, a member of the first class of female students at William & Mary. Their stated mission is that they are dedicated to empowering women and recognizing strong female leadership. They recognize female students and faculty monthly for their dedication to the college community by leaving yellow roses and notes for these individuals. Other details surrounding this society remain a mystery. Bishop James Madison Society The Bishop James Madison Society reports its founding year as 1812. Named in honor of William & Mary's eighth president, the late Bishop James Madison. The original society was forced to disband at the advent of the Civil War but it was reformed sometime in the 20th century. The society's activities, which seek to further the reputation, pride, and mirth of the college community, include the promotion of a \\"Last Lecture\\" in which it invites a noted faculty member to speak on issues of current social and/or academic importance. Membership in the society is confidential. During the college's annual commencement exercises, some graduating members identify their involvement by wearing medals featuring the society's symbol, an elongated quatrefoil. The Cord The Cord is believed to have been founded in 1881 after the College was forced to close as a result of financial issues dating back to the Civil War, and would not reopen until 1888. President Ewell continued to ring the College Bell at the beginning of each academic year for the duration of the College's closure. The name \\"The Cord\\" is thought to have been taken from the cord that rings the College Bell as a symbol of the society's endurance through William and Mary's darkest years. The society is said to consist of 8 members, 4 seniors who then select 4 juniors during each academic year to replace them and choose the next year's juniors. Little is known about the actions of The Cord, but they appear to take part in several ceremonies and rituals around campus each year, set up by the seniors but attended only by its juniors. Notable rumored members include Chris Genoa, Bill Mims, and Thao Nguyen. Flat Hat Club Founded during the early-20th century (and later revived in 1972), today's all-male Flat Hat Club is named in honor of the historic F. H. C. Society. The original F. H. C. Society was founded in 1750 under a secret Latin name, possibly Fraternitas, Humanitas, et Cognitio, Fraternitas Humanitas Cognitioque, or variations thereof. The club was informally referred to as the Flat Hat Club. Its members included St. George Tucker, Thomas Jefferson and George Wythe. In 1972, the society was reformed. According to The Flat Hat (a largely unaffiliated student newspaper), \\"new members are selected by those currently in the group. Historically, the group has tapped student government leaders, as well as several members of The Flat Hat [newspaper], which took its name from the historic group.\\" Phi Society The Phi Society was created at the University of Virginia, but a chapter has been established at William & Mary. Little is known about this society at the college. Another similarly named organization, the Phi Society of 1883 exists at The University of the South. Outside of the fact that both organizations were created by former members of Phi Delta Theta, the two societies are unrelated. Both societies branched off from the main organization due to conflicts of interest with the national organization. W Society Little is known about the W Society. It honors one freshman every year for service to the Williamsburg community. The members are selected via secret invitation. The Society is service focused. Wren Society The Wren Society is said to have been founded in 1832 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of British architect Sir Christopher Wren's birth. Sir Christopher Wren is the presumed designer of the Wren Building, which is the nation's oldest academic building. Like the Bishop James Madison Society, the Wren Society, was forced to disband at the start of the Civil War and later restored by students. Taps are selected based upon academic achievement, service to the campus community, and exceptional leadership. The society strives for the betterment of the college.

Biography  Born on 30 September 1679 to a family of merchants of Nantes, Cassard began a career as a sailor at age 14 on the merchantmen owned by his family. In January 1697, he joined the French Navy on bombship √âclatante. In 1700, Cassard became a merchantman captain. The next year, the War of the Spanish Succession broke out, and Cassard converted to a privateer. In 1705, he captained the privateer Saint Guillaume, capturing 12 merchantmen and raiding Cork. Two years later, he captured 13 merchantmen with the Duchesse Anne, earning a rank in the Navy. In 1709, Cassard, promoted to Commander, was tasked to escort a 25-ship food convoy on the 68-gun √âclatant. On 29 April, supported by S√©rieux, he defeated five English ships, allowing the convoy to safely reach Marseille. The next year, Cassard lead a squadron comprising the 74-gun Parfait, the 58-gun S√©rieux and the 50-gun Ph√©nix and the 60-gun Sir√®ne, with his flag on Parfait. He was tasked to escort an 84-ship convoy inbound from Smyrna that had become blockaded at Syracuse by a British fleet. He captured HMS Pembroke, while S√©rieux secured the surrender of the 32-gun HMS Falcon in the 9 November Battle of Syracuse. The convoy reach Toulon. In 1711, Cassard again secured the way for a 43-ship convoy bound for Pensacola. In December 1711, Cassard obtained the command of a 6-ship squadron and embarked on an expedition in which he raided English, Dutch and Portuguese colonies in Cape Verde and in the Caribbean. On 10 October 1712, Cassard captured the plantation of Meerzorg in Suriname for France, and threatened Paramaribo across the Suriname River. Negotiations started, and on 27 October Cassard left with ∆í747,350 (‚Ç¨ 8.1 million in 2018) worth of goods and slaves. After the Treaty of Utrecht and the end of the war in 1713, Cassard started numerous trials to obtain payments. Cassard retired in 1731. In 1736, he was declared insane after insulting the Cardinal de Fleury, and detained in Ham, where he died four years later.

With an advanced combination of high lift, slow flying controls it was beset by handling problems and made few flights. Development The Handley Page H.P.46 was built to Air Ministry specification M.1/30 for a carrier based torpedo bomber to replace the Blackburn Ripon. The Air Ministry paid Handley Page for a single prototype; its competitors were the Blackburn M.1/30 and the Vickers Type 207. No manufacturer could meet both the specified performance and weight limits together. M.1/30 required a military load of 2,874 lb (1,303 kg), including 2,000 lb (910 kg) or over in a single bomb or torpedo with an endurance of 8 hours. A maximum speed of at least 150 mph (240 km/h) and a service ceiling of 16,000 ft (4,900 m) were specified. The maximum allowed weight was 9,300 lbs (4,218 kg) as the weight limit of the lifts on Royal Navy carriers at that time was 9,500 lb (4,300 kg). If the recommended Rolls-Royce Buzzard or Armstrong Siddeley Leopard engines were used, the performance parameters could be met but the fuel consumption made the aircraft overweight; if a smaller Rolls-Royce Kestrel was used, then with its lower consumption the weight limits could be met but not the performance. The design process was thus a struggle to reduce weight. The H.P.46 was a single bay biplane with constant chord, unswept foldable wings carrying slight stagger but of unconventional appearance. To meet the requirements of an excellent view from both of the closely spaced open cockpits, the upper wing met the top of the fuselage with a thinned centre section. To keep the inter-wing gap large enough to avoid interference, the lower centre section carried extreme anhedral (about 30¬∞). Outboard the lower wing had slight dihedral. By mounting the fixed undercarriage at the junction, Handley Page's designer Gustav Lachmann was able to use a weight-saving short undercarriage. Originally the intention was to save weight further with internally sprung wheels, but these proved unavailable and a heavier pair of wheels on either side, each on a standard oleo leg within a broad chord fairing was used. In the few photographs of the H.P.46 the undercarriage is unfaired. An arrester hook was fitted. Lachmann had also intended to save weight by making the lower centre sections into a monocoque fuel tank, but the Navy insisted on removable tanks. From the start Handley Page had decided that the low speed requirements for carrier landings with the high overall performance could only be met with the combination of leading edge slots, drooping ailerons and interceptors, devices all carried on the H.P.46's upper wing. A late change to evaporative or steam cooling of the Buzzard III led to a large and boxy chin radiator, which added both drag and weight. Another cause of weight growth was the requirement of a movable rather than fixed bomb aiming position for the gunner under his and the pilot's cockpit. Lachmann was also concerned about longitudinal stability and included a novel moving tailplane-elevator combination for greater pitch control. By the time of the first flight on 24 October 1932 the H.M.46 was both overweight and too late to enter the M.1/30 trials. Nonetheless, the Air Ministry decided that the combination of devices for low speed flying were worth investigation and a test flight programme went ahead. This immediately revealed both minor structural and persistent control problems. The former were soon fixed by wing bracing changes but aileron and slot issues and the longitudinal instabilities and associated fore and aft trim problems persisted, even though a new tail unit fitted in the first half of 1934 improved things. Low speed control weaknesses remained to the last flight in May 1934. In November 1934 the Air Ministry agreed, reluctantly, to accept the sole H.P.46: it left Handley Page's Radlett works in April 1935 by road to Farnborough Airfield and did not fly again. It never carried arms.

The original line-up was Makoto on vocals, Haruhi on guitar, Ko-Zi on drums and Reika on drums. They started out mainly playing songs from Haruhi's former band but as they decided to continue as a serious band they started to compose their own songs. They played their first one-man concert on December 12, the same day as Haruhi and Ko-zi left the band along with the support member Syuren. With two guitarists and a bassist missing the two remaining artist took a small break to recruit new members and was back again on the first day of 2003. The new members was Ken on guitar, Ryu on guitar and Maya on bass and contra bass. The first release with the new line-up was Shinshoku Doremi techou (maxi-single). Since Haruhi had been the main songwriter and as he left the band and his role was now taken over by Maya and Ken with Makoto writing the lyrics the music style was slightly changed from the old Doremidan. The maxi-single however became a hit and the 3,000 copies sold out on the release date. In October 2004 the Maya left the band after the final concert of their small one-man tour and was replaced by Shinji in 2005. In 2005 they also released their first full album, called Gekijou Shouroku. In August 2007 Doremidan break a number of months due Makoto's family circumstances. Mars 2008 they were back, and for those fans who'd been fearing that the break would last forever it was a relief. Mars 5 they released the best-of album Onkai Chronicle and two months later they released a new full- length album Yuugure Line which got mixed reviews by the fans. On January 23, Doremidan had been introducing their new member Yuu at their first live in 2010, who joined them as their new bassist. The released their first Major Album \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" in December 2009. Doremidan announced that they will be splitting up after their final tour in 2012.

The Oxford Encyclopedia of Economic History. Oxford University Press, 13 aug. 2003. p. 461 known for his inventions in the field of metallurgy. Early life Mushet was born on 2 October 1772 in Dalkeith near Edinburgh, the youngest son of Margaret Cochran and William Mushet.The Mushets of Dalkeith He was educated at Dalkeith Grammar School. When Mushet was a boy, his father (a weaver by trade) established a foundry at Croft Street in Dalkeith. He would sometimes accompany him at the ironworks and it was on these visits that the first seeds of his lifelong obsession with iron-making were sown. Career in Scotland Mushet left school at the age of 19, but did not go to work at his father's foundry. Instead, being good at mathematics, he began work as an accountant at the Clyde Iron Works near Glasgow. Alongside his bookkeeping duties, he read extensively on the subject of iron making and, after a staff reduction was made in 1793, he began a series of experimental researches. At first, these were encouraged by his employers, and he even taught assaying to the manager's son; but later, and without reason given, he was prohibited from experimenting during work hours. Forced to continue his experiments outside office hours, he frequently worked until the early hours of the morning and in just a few years he became an established authority on the manufacture of iron. In 1800, he patented a process to make cast steel from wrought iron, which he then sold to a Sheffield firm for ¬£3000. His employers, becoming jealous of him, dismissed him from the Clyde Iron Works in the same year. The following year, with the help of partners, he bought and rebuilt the Calder Iron Works, where he continued his experiments. It was here he made his second great discovery; in 1801, he demonstrated that 'Black-band Ironstone,' (typically found with a thin seam of inferior 'wild Coal'http://www.scottishmining.co.uk/Indexes/Barrowman.html) could be used to economically produce iron. Previously, this abundant resource had been viewed as a useless form of coal, and while the discovery brought little financial reward to Mushet personally, the use of Black-band Ironstone was to lead to a remarkable expansion of the Scottish iron industry and eventually brought millions of pounds profit to Scottish industrialists. By 1805 Mushet had published some thirty papers in Philosophical Magazine. In his book, Man of Iron - Man of Steel, historian Ralph Anstis writes that Mushet was now \\"looked up to as an authority both at home and abroad on matters connected with iron and steel making. Not unnaturally, perhaps, he was becoming dissatisfied with the limitations imposed by the Calder Iron Works and, restive for wider experience and greater opportunities, decided to move on\\". Career in England In 1805 Mushet moved to Derbyshire, to become manager of the Alfreton Ironworks. While working there, he joined the Geological Society and wrote several authoritative articles on iron which were published in magazines and encyclopaedias, including the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. However, he did not enjoy perfect relations with his colleagues. In 1808 Mushet was approached by Thomas Halford, a wealthy investor from London, who owned two furnaces at Whitecliff, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire. Halford was having difficulty with the quality and quantity of iron being produced at his works and offered to pay for Mushet's help in overcoming the production problems he was encountering. Mushet designed and supervised a major rebuilding of the Whitecliff Ironworks, but the time he was spending in the Forest of Dean became instrumental in the complete breakdown of relations with his colleagues at the Alfreton works. In February 1810 he moved to Coleford to take up full- time management of the Whitecliff works; buying a quarter share of the business. Some weeks later he was joined by his wife, Agnes, and their six children. Remains of Darkhill Ironworks. Mushet ran the furnaces at Whitecliff for six months, but then quickly disengaged himself from the partnership. He was not known to act impulsively, and the reasons for this decision are not fully known. Possibly Halford, the majority partner at Whitecliff, suffered a collapse of his other business interests, for it is known that he became bankrupt in 1816Gloucester Records Office D192/4 From the time he had arrived in the Forest of Dean, Mushet had been shrewd in making investments in local industries, predominantly coal, and it seems that for several years he was able to live off the proceeds from these investments. During this time he carried out experiments in a stone barn, in a field adjoining his house. In 1815, he discovered a way to produce refined iron directly from the blast furnace, without the use of a separate refinery, and took out a patent on the process. Some of the iron produced was in fact steel, and for ten years he shaved using a pair of razors made at this time. In 1818/9 he built a foundry at Darkhill, in the Forest of Dean. Although he did produce significant quantities of iron for sale there, the larger part of the works was given over to research and experimental production. He was appointed a director of the British Iron Company in 1826 although not without misgivings among some of the shareholders as to his suitability for such a post.Standing, Ian. (1986). The Whitecliff Ironworks in the Forest of Dean By the late 1820s he had built up a considerable empire, which included both iron and coal mines, and shares in the tramroads which connected them. He was also on the committee of the Severn and Wye Railway and Canal Company and used his position to stifle the expansion of steam railways into the Forest; which threatened the monopoly of his tramroads. In 1845 David retired to Monmouth and conveyed Darkhill to his 3 sons, with the youngest, Robert Mushet, becoming the manager. The remains of Darkhill are now preserved as an Industrial Archaeological Site of International Importance and are open to the public. Family life Grave of David and Agnes Mushet Mushet married Agnes Wilson in 1798 and their first child, Margaret, was born in 1799. Their second child, Hariot, was born in 1801, but died a few months later. Henrietta was born in 1802, followed by his first son, William, in 1803, and David, in 1805. All these children were baptised in Monkland Parish Church, Lanarkshire. James was born in 1807, after the family's move to Derbyshire, followed by Agnes in 1809. Robert, the last of the children, was born in Coleford on 8 April 1811. He spent his formative years studying metallurgy with his father and was also to become a noted metallurgist, though was never to receive full recognition, financial or personal, for his achievements. Mushet's success in the field of iron production was not mirrored in his family life. His relationship with his wife Agnes and his sons was often cold and, in the case of his sons, sometimes even involved communication via solicitors. Soon after his death, a friend was to write that he had, in the last years of his life, been \\"visited with some extremely heavy and unnatural family afflictions\\".Letter, Railway & Commercial Gazette, 23 June 1847 David Mushet died at Monmouth on 7 June 1847, but even in death was surrounded by bitter and public family feuding. During his later years Mushet had often pleaded poverty and soon after his death, his friend John Upton made a public appeal for donations to support Mushet's widow. In a letter to the Mining Journal, Mushet's son David attacked Upton, referring to his \\"beggarly and impertinent account of my father's circumstances\\" and stating that his father had left his family considerable property.Letter, Mining Journal, 28 June 1847. Mushet's son Robert then joined in, attacking David in a letter to the same publication, writing that, had David attended his father's funeral, he might have \\"learnt more accurately how matters really stood with their widowed mother\\".Letter, Mining Journal, 30 June 1847. Mushet's wife, Agnes, died in 1854 and they are buried together in Staunton churchyard, in the Forest of Dean. Animal rights Mushet was an early advocate of animal rights and opponent of vivisection but was not a vegetarian.Scholtmeijer, Marian Louise. (1993).

He authored an essay which was entered into a writing competition sponsored by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. His essay condemned animal cruelties such as hunting, overworking of stagecoach horses and the use of dogs as draught-animals. It was published as The Wrongs of the Animal World, in 1839.

Smith has achalasia, a rare disorder of esophagus which affects its ability to move food toward the stomach. It started to affect him around the time of the 2009 Rose Bowl, where he began losing a few pounds of body weight each week because food would get stuck in his esophagus and he would have to throw it up. The weight loss was a problem as Smith tried to keep his weight up to . Originally diagnosed as acid reflux, further tests revealed the problem as achalasia. Smith underwent a surgical procedure called a Heller myotomy which helped somewhat, but he still has dietary restrictions that force him to eat very slowly.Michael Lev, USC's Malcolm Smith tackles rare disorder August 19, 2010, accessed May 1, 2011.

The Barnesville Historic District consists of the oldest part of Barnesville, Ohio, originally platted in 1808 and contains roughly 40 acres and 180 buildings.http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/OH/Belmont/districts.html The district was added to the National Register on July 19, 1984. History Founding and growth: 1800‚Äì1860 The area around Barnesville was settled by pioneer families, mostly Quaker, around the early 19th century. These early settlers arrived in the area after leaving Maryland, Pennsylvania and the southern states. A meeting house was built and cemetery was established to the east of the future site of Barnesville. This early settlement attracted the attention of a certain Maryland farmer. Barnesville was first \\"laid out\\" in 1808 by James Barnes, who had travelled to the area hoping to create a new Quaker settlement in a rural setting. He found rolling landscape along a Drovers' road ideal for a site and soon platted out lots and roads for his new town. Barnes was not alone in this venture as his brother, David, also made the trek out in hopes to find a better place for his family. The Barnes brothers owned much land and had a hand in the development of the village, owning a tannery, a brick yard, mills, and several farming and crop lands. James soon left to return to Maryland, but his brother stayed as mayor of the developing town and took up residence on Main Street. Much of the architectural heritage from this period is lost to the current Victorian buildings. During the mid-to-late 19th century, more settlers, tired of the cramped eastern seaboard, migrated to places like Barnesville. A railroad was placed through the town in 1857, leading to what would be Barnesville's population boom. Expansion to industrialization: 1860‚Äì1950 The railway brought with it industrialization and population growth. Watt Car and Wheel Company, The Eastern Ohio Glass Company, Hanlon Paper Company and the Barnesville Glass Company are some of the many manufacturing companies which moved into Barnesville during this time. The original plat was expanded to the north and south to accommodate the influx of residents. The town kept growing at a rate that the B&O; Railroad built the town a much needed depot in 1916, which is also listed on the National Register. It was during this time period that many of the current buildings were constructed, lending Barnesville a unique post-Civil War architectural theme. Many of the numerous churches were also built reflecting the variety of religious sectors that helped Barnesville grow (the town currently boasts 12 different churches within its limits).http://www.barnesvilleohio.com/churches.htm The town particularly saw a growth during the World Wars, as the needs of the country turned to militarization. The Watt Car and Wheel Company increased production to keep up with the demand for coal, and also turned to manufacturing other wheel and accessory components for vehicles. The Glass Company also increased production for vehicles and ships during the war economy. When peace was finally declared after World War II, none in the town realized that it would begin a declining trend in the community. Decline to stabilization: 1950‚Äìpresent The armistice of the Korean War finally signalled an end to the war-time production demanded during the 1940s and many communities suffered as a result. Barnesville soon saw many businesses close their doors during the next few decades. As redevelopment emerged in the late 1960s to early 1970s, many building from this period were erased from existence. The large warehouses were soon replaced with houses and smaller businesses. The town began to recover from this setback during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The town's historical integrity has been fairly maintained leading to a sense of pride in the community.Barnesville, Ohio: 1808-2008; Barnesville Historical Society; 2008 The district today The Bradfield Building. Many of the buildings currently standing date back to the Victorian era of building. The district includes several buildings well known in the area, such as the Bradfield Building, which once housed WesBanco, the Barnesville Municipal Building and the Belmont County Victorian Mansion Museum, as well as several private homes. The district totals 198 structures consisting of 180 contributing properties, as well as the Barnesville Railroad Tunnel located under the intersection of East Main and Arch Streets. Much of the district play key roles in the Annual Barnesville Pumpkin Festival held every September, including West Main Street: the site of the King Pumpkin display.

To the east of the North Island is the Hikurangi Trough, a collision zone between the Pacific Plate and the Australian Plate. The Pacific Plate is being subducted under the Australian Plate, compressing the east of the North Island, and causing the North Island Fault System, and a series of SSW-NNE trending basins and ranges, including the Raukumara Range. Successively newer rocks have been accreted to the east coast. The Raukumara Region used to be adjacent to Northland, before being shifted to its current position, and many rocks of the two regions match. To the north of the Raukumara Range lies the Bay of Plenty, formed of Torlesse (Waioeka) Greywacke. The central ranges are covered by in-place and allochthonous (displaced) Cretaceous to Oligocene rocks. To the south are more recent, mainly Miocene and Pliocene, rocks. Basement rocks All basement rocks beneath the Raukumara Region belong to the Torlesse Composite (Waioeka) Terrane, of late Jurassic to early Cretaceous age (150-100 Ma). They are largely composed of Greywacke (hardened sandstone and mudstone), that accumulated in a deep marine environment. These rocks are exposed to the north of the Raukumara Range, from Whakatane to Papatea Bay. In-place Cretaceous to Oligocene rocks Sandstones and mudstones were deposited over the region in Cretaceous to Oligocene times (100-24 Ma). These rocks still cover the Raukumara Range. The East Coast allochthon In Early Miocene times (24-21 Ma), when the Raukumara region was still adjacent to Northland, a series of thrust sheets was emplaced over much of the East Cape area. Large portions of the Cretaceous to Oligocene rocks have been displaced by tens to hundreds of kilometres, forming what is known as the East Cape Allochthon. The rocks came from the Northeast, and were emplaced in reverse order, but the right way up. The original rocks are of Cretaceous to Oligocene age (100-24 Ma), and include mudstones, limestone and basalt lava. Most of the rocks east of the line from Papatea Bay to Waipiro Bay, and rocks just north of Whatatutu are allochthonous. Allochthonous rocks are assumed to underlie the more recent rocks to the south as well. In the north, from Cape Runaway to Tokata, are allochthonous basaltic rocks, believed to represent sea floor, that has been obducted onto the land. These rocks correspond to the Tangihua rocks of Northland. Miocene and Pliocene rocks During Miocene and Pliocene times, sandstone, mudstone, and some limestone was deposited over much of the southern area of the Raukumara region. Marine terraces Marine terraces are common between Opotiki and East Cape, and at Mahia Peninsula. Hot springs Sinter deposits occur around the Te Puia Springs. Geological Resources The area to the south of the Raukumara region contains oil seeps (Waimata Valley and Waitangi Station), and is believed to have potential commercial gas and oil reserves. While the region has been explored, and minor reserves found, no major commercial reserves have yet been found. Geological hazards The Raukumara Region, and the Hikurangi Trough are prone to earthquakes, with the consequential risk of tsunami. For example, a magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the Gisborne area on 20 December 2007.2007 Gisborne earthquake There were also two major tsunamis on 26 March 1947 and 17 May 1947.The Gisborne Tsunami Much of the land is composed of soft mudstones, that are easily eroded, particularly in areas without bush cover. The region is also prone to flooding, when tropical cyclones manage to come sufficiently far south. The region can also receive minor falls of volcanic ash from the Taupo Volcanic Zone. Geological sites worth visiting *Drive the loop from Gisborne, through the Waioeka Gorge, looking at the greywacke, to Opotiki, then around East Cape, looking at the Matakaoa volcanics between Cape Runaway and Tokata (e.g., Haupara Point, near Hicks Bay), visiting East Cape itself, then back to Gisborne, though Miocene sandstones and mudstones. *At Oponae, in the Waioeka Gorge 19 km from Opotiki, massive blocks of red, green and white chert containing radiolarians of Jurassic age are embedded in Cretaceous greywackeDA Feary & EA Pessagno 1980. An early Jurassic age for chert within the Early Cretaceous Oponae Melange (Torlesse Supergroup), Raukumara Peninsula, New Zealand. NZ Journal of Geology & Geophysics 23: 623-628.. The blocks protrude from road cuttings and form the narrow Hell's Gate Rapids on the river. *Try white water rafting down the Motu River, or drive to the Motu Falls. *Visit Waimata Valley (Y17/508894) and Waitangi Station (Y17/383016), north of Gisborne, to see the mud volcanoes and oil seeps. (Maybe these are difficult to find.) *Have a hot swim at Te Puia Springs, and see the sinter deposits.

Freedman demonstrated (through simulation and asymptotic calculation) that this is a common occurrence when the number of variables is similar to the number of data points. Specifically, if the dependent variable and k regressors are independent normal variables, and there are n observations, then as k and n jointly go to infinity in the ratio k/n=œÅ, (1) the R2 goes to œÅ, (2) the F-statistic for the overall regression goes to 1.0, and (3) the number of spuriously significant regressors goes to Œ±k where Œ± is the chosen critical probability (probability of Type I error for a regressor). This third result is intuitive because it says that the number of Type I errors equals the probability of a Type I error on an individual parameter times the number of parameters for which significance is tested.

Class D with 100 units became the backbone of the DSB freight locomotives from the start of its delivery in 1902 until the start of the 1950s when the significance of the railway traffic started to decline. Together with the previous deliveries of the heavier 2-8-0 class H freight locomotive and then in 1952 purchased 10 Belgian-built German class 50√úK locomotives (DSB class N), pushed the class D to the sidelines. When the light GM diesel locomotive class MX was delivered in the start of the 1960s, it was the swansong for class D. Only two class D engines were serviceable when DSB abandoned steam in 1970; D 825 and D 826.  History  The need for stronger freight train locomotives in the start of the 20th century made DSB order five 2-8-0 tender locomotives by Henschel in the very start of the century. The so far strongest DSB freight locomotive was the 0-6-0 G class tender locomotive which started to be delivered in the 1880s and actually the final units were delivered when the first D class engine was ordered in 1901. Class D was a 2-6-0, two-cylinder, saturated steam tender locomotive with cylinder bore, driving wheel diameter and 47 tons serviceable weight. The engine yielded approx . DSB acquired in total 100 D class engines between 1902 and 1922 to be numbered D 801 ‚Äì 900. They were delivered from such different manufacturers as; Henschel, S√§chsische Maschinenfabrik and Berliner Maschinenbau (Germany), Tubize (Belgium), Nydquist (Sweden), Baldwin (USA) and Frichs (Denmark). The delivery from Baldwin was quite a special story. The State of Denmark sold the Danish West Indies to The US in 1917 and part of the money was used to buy 16 class D engines from Baldwin. The first version called class D I (one), was quite an old fashioned construction without a superheater. It including the engines D 801 ‚Äì 841. The next series of engines delivered from 1910‚Äì1922, were delivered in two versions: One version numbered 842 ‚Äì 851 and 865 ‚Äì 900, was provided with a superheater (the very first DSB superheated locomotives) to be called D II (two). Another version numbered 852 ‚Äì 864 to be called D III (three), had a larger boiler but no superheater. The engines with superheater made good experience as well as the series with the larger boiler, so DSB decided between 1925 and 1950 to modernize all D I and some D II engines into a modernized version with superheater, larger boiler and larger cab which version was called D IV (four). Class D was a dedicated freight locomotive and became the backbone of DSB freight traffic on main and branch lines for half a century, though the class was also seen on passenger trains after World War 2 because of the serious lack of traction power. Its popularity earned the class, as one of the few in Denmark, a nickname; \\"Dagmar\\" which is a traditionally Danish ladies name. When the heavy ex.

Millburn is located at the junction of U.S. Route 45 and County Routes A10 and A14; it lies within the village of Old Mill Creek and borders Lindenhurst to the west. It is south of the Illinois-Wisconsin state border and west of Waukegan. History The Robert Strang Store, the first store in Millburn Millburn was founded in 1837, when brothers George, Robert, and Peter Strang came from Ontario, Canada to settle in Illinois. They sought work on the Illinois and Michigan Canal, under construction at the time. After working for a year, the family issued claims on territory in Lake County, then returned to Canada. In 1839, they returned to their claim with their parents, a fourth brother (Jake), and their parents. The family was of Scottish descent, which lured other settlers of Scottish origin to what was then called Strang's Corners. By 1840, the First Congregational Church was founded.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/200132.pdf Jake, Peter, and George Strange participated in the California Gold Rush. Jake appears to have accumulated significant wealth from it, judging by his ability to design a high-style house shortly afterward. Robert Strang remained in Millburn and opened a store in 1856. He is generally credited as the father of the settlement because he was the only one of his brothers who remained in Millburn without interruption and his store was the first in the vicinity. Robert's son John M. succeeded him in running the store. Cobbler Richard Pantall was another early settler. He opened a general merchandise store in Millburn in 1862. Pantall was named postmaster and used his store as the town post office starting in 1864, a role it maintained until 1904. James Jamieson came from Scotland in 1859 and later served as Lake County Treasurer. The small settlement is unusual as an example of a mid-19th century rural community near Chicago. Although one of the roads through the village became U.S. Route 45, the village maintained its heritage. The oldest remaining buildings date back to 1856. The entire village was listed by the National Park Service on the National Register of Historic Places on September 18, 1979. Buildings John M.

History The hospital opened as the London Temperance Hospital on 6 October 1873 by initiative of the National Temperance League, and was managed by a board of 12 teetotallers. Under its rules, the use of alcohol to treat patients was discouraged, but not outlawed: doctors could prescribe alcohol when they thought necessary for exceptional cases. In 1931, Chicago magnate Samuel Insull donated $160,000 to build a new extension, the \\"Insull Memorial wing\\" which was designed in the Art Deco style by architect William Binnie. It was renamed the National Temperance Hospital in 1932 and acquired the premises of the St Pancras Female Orphanage and Charity School, located on an adjacent site, in 1945. It was incorporated into the National Health Service in 1948 under the management of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. After the hospital was closed in 1990, its exterior featured in an episode of Mr. Bean, broadcast in October 1995, in which Bean tailgates an ambulance and stops behind it before entering the hospital. It was briefly considered, but rejected, as a potential site for the National Institute for Medical Research between 2006 and 2007. The building was used by Camden Collective, a regeneration initiative, from 2015 to 2017. In 2017 demolition began as part of the work necessary to clear the area for the proposed High Speed 2 railway line. Time capsules were discovered during the demolition in October 2017.

Background and education Born in 1955, Machat Dorskind grew up in Roslyn Harbor, New York and graduated from Roslyn High School in 1973. She attended Washington University in St Louis for the first year and a half of her college studies and graduated, cum laude, in June 1977 from Boston University with a Bachelor of Science degree in marketing. From 1978 to 1982, she was a Product Manager for Epic, Portrait, & The Associated Labels (then part of CBS, Inc. and now under the Sony Music umbrella) in New York City where she managed Pop music and R&B; legends that included Dan Hartman, Karla DaVita, Patti Labelle, The O'Jays, and Billy Ocean. While there she received two Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified gold records in recognition of her important contribution to music marketing. In 1982, Cheryl Machat married Glenn Dorskind, left Epic Records, and returned to her own artistic interests. Like many other photographers, she became involved in the photography of children when she had children of her own. Her daughter Nicole was born in 1986; her second daughter Joelle was born in 1991. Her experience with her own children resulted in a freelance career focusing primarily on children‚Äôs portraits, and eventually in a book, The Art of Photographing Children, published in 2005. Cheryl Machat Dorskind has been involved in a number of community service programs in the Greater Westhampton Beach Community. She has served as an Honorary Board Member for the Suffolk County Coalition Against Domestic Violence since 1989. Career As a photo-artist, Dorskind is best known for her handpainted photographs or photopaintings, predominantly of landscapes and of children, in which she applies washes of oil paints and glazes of watercolors and pastels, a technique she has worked out experimentally over time. Since 1989 she has continued to exhibit her photography annually. Machat Dorskind was an associate professor at Southampton College (Long Island University) from 1994-2000 in the Fine Art department where she taught photography (Introductory and Intermediate Darkroom, Independent Study and BFA) to both majors and non-majors. She also taught at the Southampton Masters Workshop Series in July 1991, 1994, 1996, and 1999 and at the Maine Photographic Workshops in July 2001. Presently she is an assistant professor at Suffolk County Community College teaching digital photography. Online she teaches and mentors an international clientele at the Perfect Picture School of Photography since 2006. In 2005, Machat Dorskind began writing the newspaper column, \\"Picture This,\\" for The Southampton Press. Additionally, she has authored two photography books, The Art of Photographing Children, ¬©2005 (Watson-Guptill Publications), and The Art of Handpainting Photographs, ¬©1998 (Watson-Guptill Publications). Both books were received with critical acclaim and The Art of Handpainting Photographs is considered by Watson-Guptill Publications \\"the definitive guide to traditional methods of handpainting photographs.\\" With the publication of The Art of Handpainting Photographs, Machat Dorskind coined the phrases \\"handpainted\\" and \\"photopainting,\\" to draw attention to the fact that both aspects of the finished print are equally important: both the photograph and the color overlay are two integral parts of a unified whole. Prior to her book's 1998 publication, the process was known as colorization, or as tinted or hand- tinted.

Race report The race was won by Richard Petty driving a 1964 Plymouth. Petty drove his number 43 to victory in 3 hours and 14 minutes. There were three caution flags that slowed the race for 19 laps. The Chrysler teams debuted their brand-new 426 ci Chrysler Hemi engine in this race; NASCAR ordered the teams who had it to sandbag it during practice and qualifying due to their superiority. During the race itself, Richard Petty, who at the time was known best for his skill on short tracks, led 184 of the 200 laps (a Daytona 500 record that stands to this day) and Chrysler teams took four of the top five spots. First Daytona 500 starts for Bobby Isaac, Doug Cooper, Johnny Rutherford, Jack Anderson, Jim Bray, and Neil Castles. Only Daytona 500 starts for Dave MacDonald, Jo Schlesser, Smokey Boutwell, Jim McElreath, Ronnie Chumley, Bobby Marshman, Joe Clark, Bill McMahan, and Jim Cook. Last Daytona 500 starts for Jimmy Pardue, Billy Wade, Dan Gurney, Larry Thomas, Ralph Earnhardt, Curtis Crider, Sal Tovella, Parnelli Jones, Fireball Roberts, and Elmo Henderson. This was the first NASCAR race that had a purse of over $100,000. The transition to purpose-built racecars began in the early 1960s and occurred gradually over that decade. Changes made to the sport by the late 1960s brought an end to the \\"strictly stock\\" vehicles of the 1950s. Bobby Marshman would retire from NASCAR Grand National Series racing after the conclusion of this event. For some drivers, this would be their last Daytona 500, as the 1960s were an especially brutal era for NASCAR. Jimmy Pardue was killed later in the year in a test crash. Billy Wade was killed in a tire test in January 1965. Bobby Marshman killed in a test crash in late 1964 at Phoenix. Fireball Roberts died in July from injuries inflicted while racing in the World 600 and Joe Weatherly was killed at Riverside early that year.

Forty copies were printed in 1783 with the help of Blake's friends, the artist John Flaxman and the Reverend Anthony Stephen Mathew, at the request of his wife Harriet Mathew. The book was never published for the public, with copies instead given as gifts to friends of the author and other interested parties. Of the forty copies, fourteen were accounted for at the time of Geoffrey Keynes' census in 1921.Margaret Ruth Lowery, \\"A Census of Copies of William Blake's Poetical Sketches, 1783\\", The Library, Fourth Series, 17:3 (Autumn, 1936), 354-360 A further eight copies had been discovered by the time of Keynes' The Complete Writings of William Blake in 1957.Keynes (1966: 883) In March 2011, a previously unrecorded copy was sold at auction in London for ¬£72,000. Publication The original 1783 copies were seventy-two pages in length, printed in octavo by John Flaxman's aunt, who owned a small print shop in the Strand, and paid for by Anthony Stephen Mathew and his wife Harriet, dilettantes to whom Blake had been introduced by Flaxman in early 1783.Ackroyd (1995: 94) Each individual copy was hand-stitched, with a grey back and a blue cover, reading \\"POETICAL SKETCHES by W.B.\\" It was printed without a table of contents and many pages were without half titles. Of the twenty-two extant copies, eleven contain corrections in Blake's handwriting.Erdman (1982: 846) Poetical Sketches is one of only two works by Blake to be printed conventionally with typesetting; the only other extant work is The French Revolution in 1791, which was to be published by Joseph Johnson. However, it never got beyond the proof copy, and was thus not actually published. Even given the modest standards by which the book was published, it was something of a failure. Alexander Gilchrist noted that the publication contained several obvious misreadings and numerous errors in punctuation, suggesting that it was printed with little care and was not proofread by Blake (thus the numerous handwritten corrections in printed copies). Gilchrist also notes that it was never mentioned in the Monthly Review, even in the magazine's index of \\"Books noticed\\", which listed every book published in London each month, signifying that the publication of the book had gone virtually unnoticed.Gilchrist (1998: 42) Nevertheless, Blake himself was proud enough of the volume that he was still giving copies to friends as late as 1808, and when he died, several unstitched copies were found amongst his belongings. After the initial 1783 publication, Poetical Sketches as a volume remained unpublished until R. H. Shepherd's edition in 1868.Bentley and Nurmi (1964: 55) However, prior to that, several of the individual poems had been published in journals and anthologised by Blake's early biographers and editors.In Part I of A Blake Bibliography, Bentley and Nurmi give an extensive publication history of each poem. For example, Benjamin Heath Malkin included 'Song: \\"How sweet I roam'd from field to field\\"' and 'Song: \\"I love the jocund dance\\"' in A Father's Memoirs of his Child (1806), Allan Cunningham published 'Gwin, King of Norway' and 'To the Muses' in Lives of the most eminent British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects (1830), and Alexander Gilchrist included 'Song: \\"When early morn walks forth in sober grey\\"' in his Life of William Blake (1863). Gilchrist, however, did not reproduce Blake's text verbatim, instead incorporating several of his own emendations. Many subsequent editors of Blake who included extracts in their collections of his poetry, such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti, A. C. Swinburne, W. B. Yeats and E. J. Ellis, also introduced their own emendations. Due to the extreme rarity of the original publication, these emendations often went unnoticed, thus giving rise to a succession of variant readings on the original content. Subsequent versions repeated or added to these changes, despite what later commentators described as obvious misreadings. However, in 1905, John Sampson produced the first scholarly edition of Blake's work, in which he returned to the original texts, also taking into account Blake's own handwritten corrections. As such, most modern editors tend to follow Sampson's example, and use the original 1783 publication as their control text.For more information on the variations between different editions, see the collations in, for example, Sampson (1905), Keynes (1957 and 1966), Erdman (1965 and 1982), Ostriker (1977) and Stevenson (1971, 1989 and 2007) Influences and importance Blake's literary influences in Poetical Sketches include, amongst others, Elizabethan poetry, Shakespearean drama, John Milton, Ben Jonson, Thomas Fletcher, Thomas Gray, William Collins, Thomas Chatterton, Edmund Spenser, James Thomson's The Seasons (1726‚Äì1730), Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto (1764), James Macpherson's Ossian (1761‚Äì1765) and Thomas Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry (1765). Blake shows especial antipathy towards the closed couplet of Augustan poetry.Ostriker (1977: 870) Although scholars are generally in agreement that Poetical Sketches is far from Blake's best work, it does occupy an important position in Blakean studies, coming as it does as the very outset of his career. In 1947, for example, Northrop Frye declared in Fearful Symmetry that although Poetical Sketches is not regarded as a great piece of work, \\"it is of the highest importance to us, partly because it show Blake's symbolic language in an emergent and transitional form, and partly because it confirms that Blake is organically part of his literary age.\\"Frye (1947: 177) Writing in 1965, S. Foster Damon concurs with Frye's opinion. In the entry for Poetical Sketches in Damon's Blake Dictionary, he refers to Sketches as \\"a book of the revolutionary period, a time of seeking for non-neoclassical inspiration, a preparation for the Romantic period [...] For all the derivative material, the book is a work of genius in its daring figures, its metrical experiments, its musical tone.\\"Damon (1988: 331) Damon also writes, \\"Historically, Blake belongs ‚Äì or began ‚Äì in the Revolutionary generation, when the closed heroic couplet was exhausted, and new subjects and new rhythms were being sought out. The cadences of the Bible, the misunderstood Milton and the poetic Shakespeare with his fellow Elizabethans were Blake's staples from the first; to them we must add the wildness of Ossian, the music of Chatterton, the balladry of Percy's Reliques, and the Gothic fiction of Walpole. All the principles of Romanticism are to be found in Blake's first book.\\"Damon (1988: 332) Harold Bloom is also in agreement with this assessment, seeing the book as very much of its particular epoch; a period he dates from the death of Alexander Pope in 1744 to the first major poetry of William Wordsworth in 1789. Bloom sees Sketches as \\"a workshop of Blake's developing imaginative ambitions as he both follows the poets of sensibility in their imitations of Spenser, Shakespeare and Milton, and goes beyond them in venturing more strenuously on the Hebraic sublime [...] Perhaps the unique freshness of Poetical Sketches can be epitomised by noting Blake's first achievements in the greatest of his projects: to give definite form to the strong workings of imagination that produced the cloudy sublime images of the earlier poets of sensibility. In the best poems of Blake's youth, the sublime feelings of poets like Gray and Collins find a radiant adequacy of visionary outline.\\"Harold Bloom, \\"Commentary\\" in Erdman (1982: 967-968) Frye, Damon and Bloom are all in agreement that Blake was, at least originally, very much of his age, but this is by no means a universally accepted opinion. Peter Ackroyd, for example, sees the poems as fundamentally divorced from the dominant poetic formulas of the day. Speaking of 'To the Evening Star' in specific and Poetical Sketches in general, Ackroyd argues that \\"it would be quite wrong to approach Blake's poetry with a Romantic belief that he is engaged in an act of confessional lyricism or brooding introversion [...] This is not the poetry of a melancholy or self-absorbed youth.\\"Ackroyd (1995: 54) Susan J. Wolfson goes even further, seeing the volume as a statement of Blake's antipathy towards the conventions of the day and an expression of his own sense of artistic aloofness; \\"He serves up stanzas that cheerfully violate their paradigms, or refuse rhyme, or off-rhyme, or play with eye-rhymes; rhythms that disrupt metrical convention, and line-endings so unorthodox as to strain a practice of enjambment already controversial in eighteenth century poetics.\\"Wolfson (2003: 68) Similarly, W. H. Stevenson argues that \\"there is little direct borrowing, and it would be truer to say that, even at this early stage, he is experimenting with verse forms and has formed for himself a style as individual as Collin's and Akenside's\\".Stevenson (2007: 3) Contents Poetical Sketches consists of nineteen lyric poems, a dramatic fragment (King Edward the Third), a prologue to another play in blank verse ('Prologue, Intended for a dramatic piece of King Edward the Fourth'), a prose poem prologue ('Prologue to King John'), a ballad ('A War Song to Englishmen') and three prose poems ('The Couch of Death', 'Contemplation', and 'Samson'). The nineteen lyric poems are grouped together under the title \\"Miscellaneous Poems\\": Page from an original 1783 edition of Poetical Sketches showing 'Mad Song' (note the handwritten correction in line 7; \\"beds\\" has been changed to \\"bryds\\") * 'To Spring' * 'To Summer' * 'To Autumn' * 'To Winter' * 'To the Evening Star' * 'To Morning' * 'Fair Elenor' * 'Song: \\"How sweet I roam'd from field to field'\\" * 'Song: \\"My silks and fine array'\\" * 'Song: \\"Love and harmony combine'\\" * 'Song: \\"I love the jocund dance'\\" * 'Song: \\"Memory, hither come'\\" * 'Mad Song' * 'Song: \\"Fresh from the dewy hill, the merry year'\\" * 'Song: \\"When early morn walks forth in the sober grey'\\" * 'To the Muses' * 'Gwin, King of Norway' * 'An Imitation of Spencer' * 'Blind-man's Buff' The work begins with an 'Advertisement' which explains that the contents were written by Blake in his youth and, therefore, any \\"irregularities and defects\\" should be forgiven: According to J.T. Smith, the advertisement was written by \\"Henry Mathew\\", which most critics take to mean Anthony Stephen Mathew; \\"Mrs Mathew was so extremely zealous in promoting the celebrity of Blake, that upon hearing him read some of his earlier efforts in poetry, she thought so well of them as to request the Rev. Henry Mathew, her husband, to join Mr. Flaxman in his truly kind offer of defraying the expense of printing them; in which he not only acquiesced, but with his usual urbanity, wrote the following advertisement.\\"From J.T. Smith, A Book for a Rainy Day (1845), quoted in Bentley (1975: 48) The following year, in 1784, Flaxman sounded a similar sentiment in a letter to William Hayley accompanying a copy of the book; \\"his education will plead sufficient excuse to your liberal mind for the defects of his work.\\" 'To Spring', 'To Summer', 'To Autumn', 'To Winter' The opening four poems, invocations to the four seasons, are often seen as offering early versions of four of the figures of Blake's later mythology, each one represented by the respective season, where \\"abstract personifications merge into the figures of a new myth.\\"Harold Bloom, \\"Commentary\\" in Erdman (1982: 968) Spring seems to predict Tharmas, the peaceful embodiment of sensation, who comes to heal \\"our love-sick land that mourns\\" with \\"soft kisses on her bosom.\\" Summer is perhaps an early version of Orc, spirit of Revolution, and is depicted as a strong youth with \\"ruddy limbs and flourishing hair\\", who brings out artists' passions and inspires them to create. In later poems, Orc's fiery red hair is often mentioned as one of his most distinguishing characteristics; \\"The fiery limbs, the flaming hair, shot like the sinking sun into the western sea\\" (The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, 25:13). Autumn seems to predict Los, the prophetic genius and embodiment of imagination, as it is the only one of the four seasons Blake allows to speak directly, which it does in a \\"jolly voice.\\" Finally, Winter serves as an antecedent for Urizen, limiter of men's desires and embodiment of tradition and conventionality, insofar as winter is depicted as a giant who \\"strides o'er the groaning rocks;/He writhers all in silence, and his hand/Unclothes the earth, and freezes up frail life.\\" In The Book of Urizen (1795), Urizen is depicted as a giant striding over the land spreading winter throughout the cities of men (Chap. VIII: Verse 6).For more information on these four poems and their relation to Blake's later mythology, see Harold Bloom, \\"Commentary\\" in Erdman (1982: 968), Frye (1947: 182), and Lowery (1940: 82-86) 'To the Evening Star' Possibly inspired by Spenser's \\"Epithalamion\\" (c.1597), lines 285-295,Lowery (1940: 100-102) 'To the Evening Star' is described by S. Foster Damon as \\"pure Romanticism, way ahead of its time.\\" Harold Bloom identifies it as perhaps Blake's earliest Song of Innocence in its presentation of a pastoral vision of calm and harmony; 'Fair Elenor' 'Fair Elenor' has attracted critical attention insofar as it is one of the very few poems in Blake's ≈ìuvre written in a specific genre; in this case the genre is Gothic, and the poem adheres to its conventions so rigidly, it may in fact be a parody.Ostriker (1977: 871) The opening lines, for example, are almost clich√©d in their observance of Gothic conventions; 'Song: \\"How sweet I roam'd from field to field\\"' According to Benjamin Heath Malkin, this poem was written prior to Blake's fourteenth birthday, and as such, \\"How sweet\\" may be his oldest extant poem. Despite his young age, the poem includes allusions to mythological figures such as Eros, Cupid and Psyche. Bloom sees it as Blake's first Song of Experience.Harold Bloom, \\"Commentary\\" in Erdman (1982: 969) Northrop Frye argues that the poem functions as a precursor to Blake's version of the Pha√´ton myth in 'Night the Second' of Vala, or The Four Zoas (1796), where the sun is seized by Luvah (representative of love and passion).Frye (1947: 178) Damon reads it as \\"a protest against marriage,\\" and notes that the imagery in the poem, particularly the phrases \\"silken net\\" and \\"golden cage\\" predict Blake's later metaphorical uses of nets and enclosures.Damon (1988: 297) For example, in The Book of Urizen, after the Fall of Los and Urizen, and the birth of Enitharmon and Orc, the Eternals cover mortal earth with a roof \\"called Science\\" (Chap: V: Verse 12). Subsequently, after exploring the earth, Urizen spreads out \\"the net of Religion\\" (Chap VIII: Verse 9). 'Song: \\"My silks and fine array\\"' \\"A pastiche of Elizabethan imagery\\", possibly to the point of parody, \\"My silks\\" deals with the popular Elizabethan topic of the transience of love; 'Song: \\"Love and harmony combine\\"' and 'Song: \\"I love the jocund dance\\"' \\"My silks and fine array\\" contrasts sharply with the next two poems; \\"Song: 'Love and harmony combine'\\", which celebrates a natural love in which the lovers are depicted as trees with intertwining branches and roots (\\"Love and harmony combine,/And around our souls intwine,/While together thy branches mix with mine,/And our roots together join\\") and the similarly themed \\"Song: 'I love the jocund dance'\\" (\\"I love our neighbours all,/But, Kitty, I better love thee;/And love them I ever shall;/But thou art all to me\\"). W. H. Stevenson speculates that Kitty could in fact be Blake's future wife, Catherine Blake.Stevenson (2007:11) 'Mad Song' 'Mad Song' is often regarded as Blake's first satire. Harold Bloom, who feels it is the most \\"Blakean\\" poem in Poetical Sketches refers to it as an \\"intellectual satire\\" on both the concept of mad songs (six of which appeared in Percy's Antiques, which describes madness as being a peculiarly English themeOstriker (1977: 872)) and the world which the singer seeks to leave. Frye is also an admirer of the poem and argues that \\"a maddened world of storm and tempest is the objective counterpart of madness in the human mind; and the madman is mad because he is locked up in his own Selfhood or inside, and cannot bear to see anything. In order to have his world a consistently dark one, he is compelled to rush frantically around the spinning earth forever, keeping one jump ahead of the rising sun, unable even to sleep in his everlasting night.\\"Frye (1947: 179) Alexander Lincoln likens the poem to 'Song: \\"How Sweet I roam'd from field to field\\"' insofar as both deal with \\"states of mental captivity described from within.\\"Andrew Lincoln (ed.) William Blake: The Illuminated Books, Volume 2: Songs of Innocence and of Experience (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1998), 12 'Song: \\"Fresh from the dewy hill, the merry year\\"' and 'Song: \\"When early morn walks forth in sober grey\\"' As with the contrast between \\"My silks and fine array\\" on one hand and \\"Love and harmony combine\\" and \\"I love the jocund dance\\" on the other, Blake again opposes the pleasure of love with its opposite in 'Song: \\"Fresh from the dewy hill, the merry year'\\" and 'Song: \\"When early morn walks forth in sober grey\\"'. In particular, the third stanza of each poem stands in diametric opposition to one another. The first reads This is strongly contrasted with the following song: Northrop Frye calls the contrasts between these various poems an \\"attempt to work out an antithesis of innocence and experience,\\" and as such, they serve as a thematic antecedent of Blake's later work. 'To the Muses' 'To The Muses' represents an attack on contemporary poetry, using the language and cadence of Augustan verse to mock that very style of writing. Blake describes how the nine muses, once so active amongst the poets of old, now seem to have left the earth; The poem also contains Blake's first reference to a topic with which he would deal several times in his subsequent work; the four elements, water, air, fire and earth (although he replaces fire with Heaven);Damon (1988: 117) In For Children: The Gates of Paradise (1793), Blake would assign each element a visual representation. In The Book of Urizen, the four elements are personified as the sons of Urizen (Utha is water, Thiriel is air, Fuzon is fire and Grodna is earth). In Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion (1820), Blake describes the original formation of the elements (30:27-40). 'Gwin, King of Norway' Presented as a warning for tyrannical kings, the longer lyric poem 'Gwin, King of Norway' represents Blake's first engagement with revolution, a theme which would become increasingly important in his later verse, such as America a Prophecy (1793), Europe a Prophecy (1794), The Song of Los (1795) and The Book of Ahania (1795). In 'Gwin', Blake points out how the ordinary man must become a revolutionary to suppress political tyranny; For Frye, \\"Gordred the giant leads a workers' revolution [...] the rebellion seems to be largely a middle class one in which the stronghold of political liberty is the independent yeoman.\\"Frye (1947: 181) David V. Erdman sees the poem as a direct antecedent of America and thus containing allusions to the American Revolution; England's actions prior to and during the war received widespread condemnation from the majority of the people, especially in London, where numerous protests were held against it. Blake was very much of the popular opinion that England was the oppressor and that the American people were fighting a righteous battle for their freedom. Erdman argues that in 'Gwin', \\"the geography is sufficiently obscure so that \\"the nations of the North\\" oppressed by King Gwin may easily be compared to the nations of North America oppressed by King George [...] In 'Gwin', the rising up of the oppressed behind the \\"troubl'd banners\\" of their deliverer \\"Gordred the giant\\" parallels the hope that some American champion would prove the Samson of the New World.\\"Erdman (1977: 17-21) Erdman thus compares Gordred with George Washington and Thomas Paine. Susan J. Wolfson also sees the poem as primarily metaphorical; \\"the revenge- tale enacted by two symbolic figures is less the ballad's point than the universal carnage that displaces all hope of political reform [‚Ä¶] this bloodbath may not so much pale politics into visionary history as evoke an appalling visionary politics, a transhistorical anxiety about the human cost of historical conflict.\\"Wolfson (2003: 75-76) The name Gordred was probably taken from Chatterton's 'Godred Crovan' (1768). Margaret Ruth Lowery suggests that Blake took more from Chatterton than simply the name of Gordred, arguing that there are many parallels in theme and imagery between Chatterton's story of a Norse tyrant invading the Isle of Man, and Blake's of a revolution against a Norse tyrant.See Lowery (1940), Chapter II, for many specific comparisons 'An Imitation of Spencer' Alicia Ostriker sees 'An Imitation of Spencer' as \\"an early attempt on Blake's part to define his poetic vocation.\\"Ostriker (1977: 873) The poem follows 'To the Muses' in its mockery of Augustan poetry, accusing such poetry of consisting of \\"tinkling rhimes and elegances terse.\\" This is contrasted with the power of more accomplished poetry; 'Blind-Man's Bluff' Predicting the close bond between form and content which would prove so important an aspect of his later Illuminated Books, in this simple story of a children's game, Blake uses the structure to carry his metaphorical intent; \\"Blake's tidy couplets report a game of all sound and no eye, where tyranny and wanton cruelty ensue, provoking a summary call for law and order and fair play [‚Ä¶] Miming the forms of children's rhymes, he even implies the genesis of man's designs in childish games, whose local mischief, tricks and blood-letting confusions rehearse worldly power- plays.\\"Wolfson (2003: 73) This is most evident in the poem's concluding lines: King Edward the Third The unfinished dramatic fragment King Edward the Third is a Shakespearean-inspired ironic depiction of Edward III's war with France which began in 1337. Written in loose blank verse, the play is set the night before the Battle of Cr√©cy, a significant turning point in the Hundred Years' War. Blake ironically presents the invasion as a noble crusade for Liberty, which is spoken of as a commercial value by the English lords. For example, several times they boast that England is the home of Liberty and is protected by Liberty, yet they also proudly claim that \\"England is the land favour'd by Commerce\\" (Sc.2 l.30). This treatment of Liberty has been identified as mockery of a similar, but non-ironic, treatment in James Thomson's Liberty (1735), e.g. \\"Cressy, Poitiers, Agincourt proclaim/What Kings supported by almighty love/And people fired with liberty can do\\" (iv:865-867).Ostriker (1977: 874) The character of William his Man may be a representative of Blake himself, as he is the only character in the play who questions the morality of the invasion beyond the ostensible explanation of Liberty; \\"I should be glad to know if it was not ambition that brought over our King to France to fight for his right\\" (Sc.4: ll.20-21). Beyond the investigation into notions of Liberty and the reasons for the invasion, David V. Erdman argues that the theme of the play is the bloodshed and hardship for the common people which will result, despite Edward's belief that the war provides ordinary men with a chance to be heroes; \\"the key to the [play] is the great Death which lies in wait for the warriors of Edward's ill-starred invasion of France.\\"Erdman (1977: 63) Erdman believes the play is wholly ironic, and challenges critics who have read it literally and accused it of jingoism. Margaret Ruth Lowery, for example, believes that it expresses \\"a 'boylike' delight in the picturesqueness of war.\\"Lowery (1940: 127) S. Foster Damon calls it \\"uncritically patriotic.\\"Damon (1988: 228) Mark Schorer interprets it as an \\"extended defence of war and national interests.\\"Schorer (1959: 165) Northrop Frye sees it as \\"Rule, Britannia! in blank verse.\\" He further states, \\"the most puzzling feature of King Edward the Third is the frankness with which Blake admits that economic conditions are the cause of the war. Industry, commerce, agriculture, manufacture and trade are the gods directing the conflict, but the conflict is glorious and the gods worthy of worship. There seems to be no use looking for irony here.\\"Frye (1947: 180) Erdman, however, sees it as impossible that the author of such bitter and anti-imperialist tracts as 'Prologue, Intended for a dramatic piece of King Edward the Fourth', 'Prologue to King John' and 'Couch of Death', could possibly be expressing genuine sentiments in this apparent celebration of jingoism. Instead, Erdman argues that \\"there are many indications of Blake's general prophetic intent in these scenes; yet if we forget to ask what historical climax they point toward, we may be quite puzzled that Blake's Edward and his brave and battle-ready warriors appear to be undertaking their invasion of the vineyards of France under favourable auspices, marching with jingoistic complacency towards a great slaughter of enemy troops and to be getting by what they represent to each other as glorious and fully justifiable murder.\\"Erdman (1977: 64) Similarly, Alicia Ostriker refers to the piece as \\"an ironic treatment of military values urged in the name of high ideals.\\" Regarding the fact that Blake never completed the play, and hence did not depict the English victory, Susan J. Wolfson argues that \\"Blake's refusal to report these outcomes functions systematically as a refusal of triumphalism, the mode of nationalistic self-satisfaction. His sketch draws us in, instead, to the various critical perspectives on the interests that impel England's history of military adventurism.\\" She goes on to point out that \\"Blake's perspective is not the conservative lens of eighteenth-century formalism that would expose liberty as lawlessness, but a modern lens of suspicion about the motivated rhetoric, craft and intentional designs in the cant of Liberty.\\"Wolfson (2003: 77) 'Prologue, Intended for a dramatic piece of King Edward the Fourth' and 'Prologue to King John' The moral judgements which are kept implicit in King Edward the Third are made very much explicit in 'Prologue, Intended for a dramatic piece of King Edward the Fourth' and 'Prologue to King John'. 'Edward the Fourth', which Frye calls \\"the first real statement of Blake's revolutionary politics,\\" uses the refrain \\"Who can stand\\" to enquire into the possibility of nobility amidst war and destruction. It then imagines that even God wonders from where all the conflict has come, with Blake pointing his finger directly at those he holds responsible; When the senses are shaken (British Museum), a colour intaglio etching from A Large Book of Designs (c.1796); 2nd state of a piece also known as Our End is come (1st state - 1793) and The Accusers of Theft Adultery Murder: A Scene in the Last Judgement (3rd state - c.1809) Blake was evidently quite proud of this piece as c.1796, he inscribed a colour etching with \\"When the senses are shaken/And the Soul is driven to madness. Page 56\\". This is a reference to the original publication of Poetical Sketches and refers to lines 2-3 of 'Edward the Fourth'.See Erdman (1982: 672 and 889) and Erdman (1977: 19n30) In 'King John', which Erdman reads as a document of English protest against the American War, Blake becomes even more explicit regarding his detestation of war.Erdman (1977: 16) Depicting an almost apocalyptical wilderness, Blake laments how \\"brother in brother's blood must bathe.\\" England has become a place where \\"the sucking infant lives to die in battle; the weeping mother feeds him for the slaughter\\" and \\"the trembling sinews of old age must work the work of death against their progeny.\\" However, the poem concludes on an optimistic note; \\"O yet may Albion smile again, and stretch her peaceful arms and raise her golden head, exultingly.\\" The source for this possibility of renewal however is never revealed. 'The Couch of Death' and 'A War Song to Englishmen' Erdman believes that the prose poem 'The Couch of Death' is a coda to Edward the Third, insofar as it depicts the victims of the plague and hardship brought about by the war.Erdman (1977: 77-79) The ballad 'A War Song to Englishmen' is usually interpreted as forming a part of Edward the Third, perhaps written by Blake to be inserted later. Specifically, the poem is seen as the second song of the minstrel, whose first song closes the fragment with a passionate evocation of Brutus of Troy, supposed founder of Britain. \\"War Song\\" continues to urge troops to battle and, like the minstrel's first song, is usually interpreted as parody and an ironic celebration of patriotic bloodlust. Erdman interprets it as \\"a parody of the battle songs of modern Britain.\\"Erdman (1977: 72) 'Samson' The final piece in the volume, 'Samson', has received little critical attention over the years. Andrew Lincoln, however, has identified it as perhaps introducing a pseudo- biographical element into Blake's work, and argues that it \\"is an early experiment in prophetic narrative. Blake's Samson can be seen as a type of the artist who struggles against the materialism of his own age ‚Äì and is doomed to be seduced by it before finally achieving his mission. The vulnerability of the would-be deliverer suggests that spiritual captivity is a state through which the strongest of mortals must pass.\\" In Milton (1810), Blake would again allude to the Samson legend, referring to Emanuel Swedenborg as \\"the strongest of men, the Samson shorn by the Churches\\" (22:50). Additional Content On the blank leaves of a copy of Poetical Sketches inscribed \\"from Mrs Flaxman May 15, 1784\\", are three handwritten poems which, since John Sampson in 1905, have been attributed to Blake. The three poems, \\"Song 1st by a shepherd\\", \\"Song 2nd by a Yound Shepherd\\" and \\"Song 3d by an old shepherd\\" are not in Blake's handwriting, but are thought to be of his composition insofar as \\"Song 2nd\\" is an early draft of \\"Laughing Song\\" from Songs of Innocence (1789).Sampson (1905), Ostriker (1977: 876) and Erdman (1982: 851) In his 1965 edition of the Complete Poetry & Prose of William Blake, David Erdman assigns two additional incomplete prose poems to Poetical Sketches, under the section title 'Further Sketches'; \\"then She bore Pale desire‚Ä¶\\" and \\"Woe cried the muse‚Ä¶\\". These two poems are extant on seven MS pages in Blake's handwriting, and dateable to the early 1780s, but nothing else is known about them. Erdman includes the two pieces in Poetical Sketches simply because there is no other collection with which to associate them. His decision, however, is by no means the norm amongst Blake's editors. For example, R.H. Shepherd did not include them in his publication of Poetical Sketches in 1868. In his 1905 edition of the collected works, Sampson mentioned them in his Introduction to Poetical Sketches but did not include them in the collection itself. In The Complete Writings of William Blake (1957 and 1966) Geoffrey Keynes included them but divided them from Poetical Sketches, indexed them separately and dated them both 1777. Alicia Ostriker, in her William Blake: The Complete Poems (1977), makes no reference at all to either piece throughout the volume. W.H. Stevenson in Blake: The Complete Poems (1971, 1989 and 2007), mentions them in a footnote, but does not reproduce them. \\"then She bore pale desire\\" was first published in 1904, by William Michael Rossetti in the August edition of The Monthly Review, where it was rewritten into verse and appeared under the title The Passions (which is also the name used by Gilchrist). \\"Woe cried the muse\\" was first published in 1925 in Geoffrey Keynes' The Writings of William Blake. \\"then She bore Pale desire‚Ä¶\\" begins with a small letter and the first line is not indented, so it is clear that at least one page is missing. Harold Bloom believes it to be an experiment in stream of consciousness writing.Harold Bloom, \\"Commentary\\" in Erdman (1982: 970) According to Erdman, it is \\"an allegorical genealogy of Pride and Shame and Policy and \\"the Kingdoms of the World & all their Glory,\\" it shows Blake revolving the problem of man's fate in terms that link imperial pride and individual frustration.\\"Erdman (1977: 50) For Damon, it is an attempt \\"to outline the spiritual decay of mankind in the course of history.\\"Damon (1988: 104) References Citations Further reading * Ackroyd, Peter.

The Hieroglyphs of Ancient Egypt. New York: Barnes & Noble. Hardcover: , p. 30. Information about his life was found on the back of his block statue (which is now located in Munich). The information on the statue provides details about the education of young Egyptian noblemen at that time and the career of priests. Bakenkhonsu is named for the god Khonsu, traveller, a Moon God of ancient Egypt and son of Amun. Life According to the information inscribed on his statue, Bakenkhonsu was the son of Ipui, a priest of Amun (other sources suggest that he was the son of Roma, whose wife was also called Roma). His two younger brothers were Roma-Roi and Ipui. He spent four years at school, starting at the age of four, as was customary at that time. He then worked at the stables of Pharaoh Seti I for eleven years. There he learned to shoot with a bow and to drive a chariot. It is possible that he also served in the Pharaoh's army. Bakenkhonsu's career as a priest then began when he joined Amun's priesthood in Thebes where his father already served as a priest (Ipui later became Second Prophet of Amun). Bakenkhonsu served as a wab priest (lowest priestly rank) for four years. He was then promoted to the rank of prophet and, twelve years later, he was the Third Prophet of Amun, the third highest ranking priest in the most powerful priesthood of the era. Later he was promoted to second, then to first prophet or high priest, a position he held for twenty- seven years. He died in the last regnal year of Ramesses II, at the age of ninety, and was succeeded as High Priest by his brother Roma-Roi. Bakenkhonsu was responsible for several building projects for the king, including the eastern temple in the Karnak Temple complex. Bakenkhonsu was married to Meretseger, who held the titles of Chief of the Harem of Amun. Two of their sons, Paser and Amenmesse became governors of Thebes. Their daughter, Nefertari married Tjanefer, the Third Prophet of Amun and three of her sons and a grandson became high ranking priests (fourth, third, or second prophets of Amun). The family is related to another important family of priests which included Ramessesnakht, who was High Priest of Amun during the 20th dynasty, as Nefertari's son Amenemopet married Ramessesnakht's daughter Tamerit/Aatmerit. Autobiographical texts Bakenkhons has left autobiographical inscriptions on statues from Karnak, one of which is now in a museum in Munich. Bakenkhons outlines his life as follows: * I spent 4 years as a promising youngster * I spent 11 years as a youngster, when I was a trainee Stablemaster of King Menmare * I was a wab-priest of Amun for 4 years * I was a God's Father of Amun for 12 years * I was a Third Prophet of Amun for 15 years * I was a Second Prophet of Amun for 12 years * He showed me favor, because he recognized the worth of my character. He appointed me High Priest of Amun for 27 years (already). On another statue ‚Äì from Cairo (CGC 42155) ‚Äì Bakenkhons mentions that he came from Thebes and that his parents also were Thebans. He spent some years at the scribal school in the Temple of the Lady of Heaven, and he was taught to be a wab-priest by his own father in the House of Amun. Burial Bakenkhons was buried in TT35 in Thebes. In the hallway there are several depictions of Bakenkhons and his wife Meretseger. A niche contains seated statues of Bakenkhons and his wife. The tomb also had a pyramid associated with it. Bakenkhonsu's sarcophagus is now located in the World Museum Liverpool (M13864). Other finds from the tomb include a wooden scribe's palette in the form of a hes vase, which is now in the Louvre (N 3018), and a block statue, which is now in the Munich Staatliche Sammlung f√ºr √Ñgyptische Kunst. The block statue inscribed with four vertical columns of hieroglyphs relating his life story. The plinth of the block statue is also engraved with hieroglyphs. His name Soul (of) Khonsu, Soul of The Traveller may relate to the title given on his block statue:Freed, 1987, p. 82. Victory Forever for the Soul, using the branch (hieroglyph) for 'victory', n-khet; Forever, h-Ra-h, (the h-(wick hieroglyph)), being in a hieroglyphic block for 'Eternity', and the 'Soul', in another block for: \\"for the soul of\\", or \\"for the spirit of\\", yielding: Victory Forever for the Soul.

Coppery brushtails are found within the Atherton Tablelands area of Queensland, in northeastern Australia. These mammals inhabit rainforest ecosystems, living within the tree canopy. Though they have a restricted distribution, they are locally common. This population is often considered a subspecies of T. vulpecula. Description Coppery brushtail possums have a typical length of 400-490 mmm and weigh 1200-1800 g, with males being larger and heavier than females. Ecology Like the common brushtail possum, coppery brushtails are nocturnal, and live in dens, which are usually tree hollows. At night, they still spend half of their time resting to conserve energy, and the other half in foraging. In feeding experiments, in selecting their food, these possums may tend to select a mix of plant materials with detoxification requirements that are correlated or independent, rather than contradictory, thus maximizing their ability to process harmful plant byproducts. Dominance among individuals tends to place females above males, and larger over smaller individuals.

It is also known as the Phoenix Church.Phoenix Church from the Keweenaw County Historical Society, retrieved 8/11/09 The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.  History  In 1853, Frederic Baraga was consecrated as bishop of the Upper Peninsula diocese, and in 1854 he sent Rev. Henry L. Thiele to serve at the Eagle River mission, which included the town of Clifton at the Cliff mine. In 1858, Bishop Baraga authorized Thiele to construct a church near Clifton. A site for a church and cemetery was donated by the North American Mining Company, and Thiel hired Nicholas Grasser to build the church for $1860. It is likely that Bishop Baraga himself designed the church. Construction began in 1868, and was completed in 1869. The church was consecrated as St. Mary's, but by 1883, the name was changed to the Church of the Assumption. The church was served from the mission at Eagle Harbor. In 1884, the Cliff Mine closed down and the population of Clifton dropped to almost nothing in a few years time. The nearby Phoenix Mine suffered the same fate, and with almost no parishioners left, the Church of the Assumption was closed. However, in 1899 the Phoenix Consolidated Copper Company made plans to reopen the Phoenix Mine, and the church was dismantled and reconstructed in its present location in Phoenix. During reconstruction, the architecture of the church was changed to give it a more Gothic appearance, installing Gothic windows, changing the roof pitch, and reconstructing the belfry and spire. The Phoenix Mine closed again bu 1905, and the population of Phoenix again subsided. However, masses were held in the church until 1957, after which the church was finally closed. In 1985, the church was purchased by the Keweenaw County Historical Society, which undertook an extensive restoration process. As of 2009, the church (although deconsecrated) is still used for weddings and memorial services. Description The Church of the Assumption is a white-painted wooden building in what was once the mining town of Phoenix. The church is covered in clapboard, and stands on concrete block piers which replaced the original supporting posts made of mine timbers. The building consists of a gable-roof nave about sixty feet by twenty-four feet, with a centrally positioned entryway/tower and steeple in the front facade and a small rear addition. The roof is steeply pitched, and the double-door entry has a pointed top arch. Four tall Gothic windows line each side of the nave's, and short upper and lower windows flank the entry tower, with additional windows in the tower's side walls. Another window in the front face of the tower above the entry. Inside there is a small vestibule in the base of the tower, which leads into the nave. The long narrow room has wooden floor boards and wood-sheathed walls. A gallery is above, and a central aisle leads toward the altar. A rectangular-plan Gothic wooden altar stands on a platform in the front, with tiers of candle shelves behind. A door in the center of the rear wall behind the altar leads to a small one-story hip-roof sacristy.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. History In 1913, the state of Michigan passed the State Trunk Line Act, which in part provided for the construction of a state route through Keweenaw, Houghton, Ontonagon and Gogebic counties. Portions of this 1913 route were later included into US 41 and US 45\\\\. In the 1920s, parts of the trunkline were improved by regrading and the building of new bridges. One such bridge was constructed by the Keweenaw County Road Commission, just east of Copper Harbor near the northern terminus of the trunkline. (The Keweenaw County Road Commission also built the M-26‚ÄìSilver River Culvert and the M-26‚ÄìCedar Creek Culvert around the same time.) The original cost of the bridge was $8,132.02. Description Side view down Fanny Hooe Creek The bridge spanning the Fanny Hooe Creek is a small concrete arch bridge (spanning 25 feet) with an elliptically shaped continuous arch ring and filled spandrels. It sits on a concrete foundation. The endwalls and parapet walls of the bridge have decoratively placed fieldstone work with grapevine mortar joints. Each parapet has four paneled concrete bulkheads which merge into pilasters along the sidewalls below grade level. The bridge is particularly significant because of its decorative stonework (unusual for Michigan bridges) and the degree of craftsmanship in its construction. George Tramp, an engineer with the Michigan State Highway Department in the 1920s, commented that, \\"after one sees the masonry work on this bridge they will agree that the art work of the stone mason has not been entirely lost.\\" See also   * List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan * National Register of Historic Places listings in Keweenaw County, Michigan References External links * Category:Buildings and structures in Keweenaw County, Michigan Category:Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:Bridges completed in 1928 Category:Transportation in Keweenaw County, Michigan Category:Road bridges in Michigan Category:Bridges on the United States Numbered Highways Category:U.S. Route 41 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Keweenaw County, Michigan Category:Arch bridges in the United States Category:Concrete bridges in the United States ","title":"US 41‚ÄìFanny Hooe Creek Bridge"},{"id":"23997671","text":"Bulbophyllum machupicchuense is a species of orchid in the genus Bulbophyllum.

It has tiny, crowded, slightly flattened, dark green pseudobulbs, a single thick, fleshy leaf and a single dark red to purplish red flower with a narrow labellum. It grows on trees and rocks in sheltered places. Description Bulbophyllum macphersonii is an epiphytic or lithophytic herb that forms dense clumps. It has a creeping rhizome and densely crowded, more or less spherical, dark green pseudobulbs long and about wide. There is a single variably shaped, dark green, channelled leaf long and wide on the end of the pseudobulb. A single dark red to purplish red, sometimes pink, green or white flower, long and wide is borne on a thread-like flowering stem long. The dorsal sepal is narrow egg- shaped, long and about wide. The lateral sepals are a similar length to the dorsal sepal but are about long and joined to each other. The petals spread widely and are about long and about wide. The labellum is long and only about wide. It has a fringe of long, fine hairs and vibrates in the slightest breeze. Flowering occurs between March and August. Taxonomy and naming The small eyelash orchid was first formally described in 1934 by Herman Rupp and the description was published in The Victorian Naturalist. It had previously been described in 1884 by Frederick Manson Bailey, intending his description to be published in Robert D. Fitzgerald's book Australian Orchids. Fitzgerald died before the volume was published but it was later published by Arthur Stopps and Henry Deane who considered the orchid to belong to the monotypic genus Osyricera. With Bailey's approval, the description was published as Osyricera purpurascens. In 1905, Johannes Jacobus Smith changed the name of Osyricera purpurascens to Bulbophyllum purpurascens, but that name had already been used for a different orchid and was therefore a nomen illegitimum. The specific epithet (macphersonii) honours Ken PacPherson who \\"rediscovered\\" the species in 1933. The names of two varieties of this orchid are accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families: * Bulbophyllum macphersonii var. macphersonii - the small eyelash orchid; * Bulbophyllum macphersonii var. spathulatum ‚Äì the large eyelash orchid which is larger in all its parts. It has also been known as Bulbophyllum sladeanum A.D.Hawkes and Blepharochilum sladeanum.(A.D.Hawkes) D.L.Jones & M.A.Clem. Distribution and habitat Bulbophyllum newportii grows on trees, rocks and cliff faces in sheltered rainforest and open forest.

A passionate Calvinist, she assisted her husband in his successful struggle to introduce Protestant reforms in the Transylvanian church.Fest, S√°ndor. ANGLO- HUNGARIAN HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL RELATIONS, Angol Filol√≥giai Tanulm√°nyok / Hungarian Studies in English, Vol. 4, (1969), pp. 5‚Äì44. Published by: Centre for Arts, Humanities and Sciences (CAHS), acting on behalf of the University of Debrecen CAHS. Under her influence, John Amos Comenius, a prominent Calvinist teacher, took up residence in S√°rospatak. Her older son, George II R√°k√≥czi, became Prince of Transylvania. Her younger son, Sigismund R√°k√≥czi (1622‚Äì1652), was married to Henriette Marie of the Palatinate, daughter of Elizabeth of Bohemia. She founded or sponsored several educational establishments, notably the Reformed College at S√°rospatak. Her Protestant religious beliefs compelled her to shun the pampered life of an aristocrat and instead to express her religion through action especially through development of girls' education. While living in Nagyv√°rad she ensured that girls were taught not only the skills needed to run a home and bring up a family, but also to read, write, and do arithmetic. They were to be versed in the Bible. She sponsored the V√°rad Bible, a completely new translation (and not a reproduction of the Vizsoly Bible).
