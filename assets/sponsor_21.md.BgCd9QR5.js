It is served by MBTA Commuter Rail Fairmount Line and Franklin Line. Readville is the outer terminus for most Fairmount service, though some trips continue as Franklin Line trains. The station is located at a multi-level junction, with the Northeast Corridor tracks at ground level and the Dorchester Branch (used by the Fairmount Line) above; Franklin lines use a connecting track with a separate platform. Platforms are available for the Providence/Stoughton Line on the Northeast Corridor tracks, but they are not regularly used. An MBTA maintenance and storage yard and a CSX Transportation freight yard are located near the station. Passenger service to Dedham Low Plain began in 1834 with the Boston and Providence Railroad (B&P;). A branch line to Dedham was built in 1835, and the neighborhood and station were renamed Readville in 1847. The Boston and New York Central Railroad opened its Midland Branch (Dorchester Branch) through Readville in 1855, crossing over the B&P.; Its station there was originally named Blue Hill, but later renamed Readville as well. Both railroads were consolidated under the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in the 1890s. The New Haven built a two-level union station at Readville as part of an 1897‚Äì98 grade separation project, then constructed its Readville Shops car repair facility just to the west in 1900‚Äì03. Dorchester Branch service ended in 1944, and Dedham Branch service in 1967 when the newly-formed MBTA ended its subsidies. Dorchester Branch service returned in 1979 as a Southwest Corridor construction bypass and became permanent as the Fairmount Line in 1987. The disused station building burned in a suspicious fire in 1983. The MBTA built accessible platforms and a footbridge in 1990‚Äì92. Readville 5-Yard, the former location of the 1958-closed Readville Shops, underwent decontamination in 2011‚Äì12 for reuse to allow construction of an industrial and office development. Station layout Geographic schematic of Readville station Readville station is located at the crossing of two rail lines: the north-south Northeast Corridor and the northeast-southwest Dorchester Branch (Midland Division). The three-track Northeast Corridor is at grade, with the single-track Dorchester Branch on an embankment. On the west side of the station, a single track runs from the Northeast Corridor up to the Dorchester Branch, which continues as the Franklin Branch. A single side platform is located on the north side of the Dorchester Branch east of its bridge over the Northeast Corridor. Two side platforms are located on the outside of the Northeast Corridor tracks, while the connector track has platforms on both sides. West of the connector track, two stub tracks that formerly ran to the Dedham Branch and Readville 5-Yard are used for Amtrak equipment storage. Fairmount Line trains run on the Dorchester Branch; most terminate at Readville. Most Franklin Line trains use the connector track and run on the Northeast Corridor north of Readville, though some run on the Dorchester Branch as Fairmount Line trains to avoid congestion in the crowded Southwest Corridor. Providence/Stoughton Line trains on the Northeast Corridor do not stop at Readville in regular service; the platforms are occasionally used during service disruptions when Fairmount Line service is not running or when trains cannot stop at Hyde Park. The station has entrances and parking lots at both levels off Hyde Park Avenue on the east side, and a ground-level entrance and parking lot off Milton Street on the west side. Readville station is accessible; all platforms (except one of the pair on the connector track) have a 1-car length (\\"mini-high\\") high-level platform. The platforms and east entrance are connected by a system of footbridges and accessible ramps; the west entrance is not accessible. In 2016, the MBTA considered the addition of elevators to supplement the ramps and add an accessible route to the Milton Street parking lot; however, this was not pursued. Readville station is bounded by several active and former railroad yards. East of the station on the Fairmount Line is the Readville Interim Repair Facility, an MBTA commuter rail maintenance facility and layover yard. Readville 1-Yard is an active CSX freight yard located south of the station, connecting the Dorchester Branch to the Northeast Corridor. West of the station, the former Readville 5-Yard lies south of the former Dedham Branch on both sides of the Franklin Branch. Readville is served by two MBTA bus routes: route runs on Hyde Park Avenue on the east side of the station, while route runs on Readville Street just to the west. History Early stations The Boston and Providence Railroad (B&P;) was chartered on June 22, 1831 to build a rail line between its two namesake cities. Construction began in late 1832, and the B&P; opened from Park Square, Boston to Sprague Mansion in Dedham Low Plain (just south of the modern station) on June 4, 1834. A second daily round trip and a stagecoach connection from Sprague Mansion to Dedham began on July 28. The line closed on August 25; it reopened on September 12 with an extension to Canton but only one daily round trip. The remaining section of the B&P; main line from Canton to Providence opened the following year with the completion of the Canton Viaduct. The Dedham Branch from Dedham Low Plain to Dedham ‚Äì the first branch line in Massachusetts ‚Äì opened on February 5, 1835, with service allowing day trips to Boston. Dedham Branch service varied between through trains to Boston, and horse-drawn cars split from Providence trains at Dedham Low Plain, for the next seven years. Dedham Specials became permanent in June 1842, allowing commuting from Dedham and Dedham Low Plain to Boston. Double track was built from Boston to Roxbury in 1839, and extended to Dedham Low Plain in 1845. alt=A detail of an old bird's eye view map showing two railroad stations The neighborhood of Dedham Low Plain was renamed Readville after mill owner James Read in 1847. Commuting from Readville was not possible for several years after the 1850 completion of the West Roxbury Branch rerouted Dedham service via West Roxbury. Commuter service from began in 1855; it was replaced in 1858 by Dedham service via Readville, and supplemented by Providence commuter service in 1864. Readville became a short turn terminal in 1868. A new one-story wooden station was built in 1873, with the old station converted to a freight house. A third track opened from Boston to Readville in 1874. The Norfolk County Railroad opened from to on April 23, 1849, using the B&P; from Dedham to Boston. The Boston and New York Central Railroad (the 1853 successor to the Norfolk County) opened its Midland Branch (Dorchester Branch) from to Boston via Readville on January 1, 1855, providing the railroad with its own entrance to Boston. The Midland Branch was intermittently operated over the next decade due to a lawsuit about grade crossings and financial issues of the parent railroad. Regular service did not resume until February 11, 1867, when it was sold to the Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad (BH&E;), which was in turn was acquired by the New York and New England Railroad (NY&NE;) in 1875. The Midland Branch crossed the B&P; on a bridge; there was no track connection between the two railroads. The Midland Branch station, located on the upper level east of the B&P; tracks, was originally called 'Blue Hills after the nearby range of hills. It was renamed Readville in the 1870s or 1880s. The station served as a short turn terminal for Midland Branch trains from 1867 to 1880 and after 1899. Consolidation alt=A black-and-white postcard of a two-story station at a complex railway junction The B&P; was leased in 1888 by the Old Colony Railroad, which was in turn leased by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (New Haven) in 1893; the B&P; became the Providence Division. In 1896, the New Haven eliminated Readville short turns in favor of higher-frequency service north of on its newly elevated mainline. The NY&NE; fell under control of the New Haven in 1895, and it was leased in 1898. On October 1, 1897, the New Haven began a $1.2 million project (equivalent to $ million in ) to eliminate several grade crossings at Readville. New road bridges were built to carry Sprague Street and Milton Street over the tracks, and a new 5-track bridge for the Midland Branch over the Providence Division. A -wide stone arch with an span ‚Äì the widest such bridge of that span in the country ‚Äì was built to carry the Midland Branch over Hyde Park Avenue. Connecting tracks were built between the Midland Branch and the Providence Division. A two-story triangular union station, , was constructed at the northeast corner of the junction. It was made of yellow brick trimmed with Fitchburg granite. An under-track passage provided access to the southbound Providence Division platform, platform on the Midland Branch connector track, and the Dedham Branch platforms. The work was completed around October 15, 1898. In September 1899, most service from the southwest on the Midland Branch was routed onto the Providence Division at Readville, allowing use of express tracks and the new Back Bay station. In 1900, the New Haven began construction of Readville Shops, a large coach repair yard complex located in the wedge- shaped space between the Midland and Dedham lines. The shops were built to consolidate the scattered shops of the New Haven and its recent acquisitions (including the NY&NE; and the Old Colony). Upon opening in 1903, Readville Shops employed as many as 3,000 workers, and could repair 200 passenger cars and 1,000 freight cars monthly. The powerhouse of the shops was designed to also power a planned electric suburban service, which was to run from Dedham to the new South Station on two routes via Readville and via West Roxbury to compete with the new Washington Street Elevated. (The electric service was not implemented; it was again proposed in 1913, but never constructed.) The addition of the shops increased residential development in Readville. Decline alt=A black-and-white aerial view of a two-story railroad station. A single track, on an embankment across from the main station, has a small shelter. Rail service in the Boston area peaked in the early 20th century and began to decline after World War 1. Between 1926 and 1938, trains operated on a loop using the Dedham Branch and the West Roxbury Branch (part of which is now part of the Needham Line) ‚Äì the same loop previously proposed for electrification. Readville‚ÄìBoston service on the Midland Branch (four daily round trips) was discontinued on July 18, 1938, as part of the 88 stations case; it was restored in 1940, but ended again on Mar 12, 1944. Midland Branch service southwest of Readville continued, though it was cut back from to in 1955. The Midland Branch bridge over the Providence Division, originally five parallel spans, was reduced to two spans by 1930 and one by the 1980s. By the early 1960s, Readville was served only by peak-hour peak- direction trains on the Providence and Blackstone lines, plus the single weekday Dedham round trip. The two-story depot served the lower level (Providence Division, later Northeast Corridor) tracks, while the elevated connector track to Franklin and beyond was served by a small shack with stairs to the lower level and to the Dedham Branch track. In August 1964, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) was formed to subsidize suburban commuter rail service; initially, only trains that the Interstate Commerce Commission has approved for discontinuance were subsidized. On April 24, 1966, the MBTA began subsidizing some New Haven commuter service, including the Dedham and Blackstone lines (the later cut back to Franklin that day). The lone Dedham round trip ended on April 21, 1967. The MBTA purchased most of the New Haven's former commuter lines, including the Providence, Franklin, and abandoned Dedham routes, from Penn Central on 27, 1973. Subsidizes began for Canton Junction and Sharon service in June 1973, and for Providence service on 1976. MBTA era alt=A passenger train at a low- level railway platform with an angular shelter Construction of the Southwest Corridor necessitated closure of the main line between Back Bay and Forest Hills. The MBTA purchased the then-freight-only Midland Branch in 1976 and modernized it for passenger use. From November 3, 1979 until October 5, 1987, all Franklin Line and Providence/Stoughton Line service ran to Boston on the Midland Division via Readville. The two-story station building was destroyed by a fire on June 11, 1983. The building had been vacant since the early 1970s and was a frequent target of vandalism; the fire was judged to be of suspicious origin. When Franklin and Providence/Stoughton service returned to the main line, service on the Midland had become popular enough to justify a continued shuttle service along the line from Boston to . The Fairmount shuttle was extended to Readville on November 30, 1987 as the Fairmount Line. Since 1987, Providence/Stoughton Line service has run through Readville without making a station stop, even though there are platforms in place to allow such use. (Until 2004, a small number of Providence/Stoughton Line trains diverted to the Dorchester Branch at Readville without stopping at the station; such a diversion has also been used during service disruptions on the Northeast Corridor.) The MBTA renovated the station in 1990‚Äì92. The accessible platforms and footbridges were constructed, the parking lots and platforms paved, and the pedestrian underpass filled. The 1898-built truss bridge over the Northeast Corridor, still used by Fairmount Line trains laying over plus Franklin Line trains running via Fairmount, needed replacement in the 2010s. The span was replaced with a prebuilt bridge in two weekends with minimal impact to Amtrak and MBTA service on the Corridor, with the old abutments left in place as retaining walls. The design contract was awarded in 2012, and a construction contract was awarded in September 2015. The bridge was replaced in November 2016. Rail yard reuse alt=An aerial view of a disused railway yard with various buildings The New Haven Railroad closed Readville Shops in 1958, with its functions moved to yards in New Haven, Connecticut. The railroad intended to create an industrial park on the site. The railroad was merged into Penn Central Railroad in 1968; the property was transferred to Conrail on March 30, 1976, and to Amtrak a day later. The MBTA acquired the yard from Amtrak on November 11, 1987 and used it to store railroad-related materials. In the late 1980s, the yard was used for final assembly of new Green Line vehicles. A number of yard buildings, including the power station and several repair shops, remained extant. 1-Yard remained in use as a freight yard by the New Haven, Penn Central, Conrail, and finally CSX Transportation. The MBTA opened a track maintenance facility (Readville Interim Repair Facility) in 2-Yard in 1996, and a midday storage yard for commuter rail trains in August 1997. A 1999 proposal to expand the 12-track facility by 8-10 tracks (as Amtrak's Northend Electrification Project reduced MBTA midday storage at Southampton Street Yard) was opposed by then-mayor Thomas Menino, who lived several blocks away. In 1989‚Äì90, while analyzing 5-Yard for potential use as a commuter rail facility, the MBTA discovered high levels of environmental contamination including lead and petroleum hydrocarbons in the soil. In October 2001, Massachusetts Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly sued the MBTA for failing to decontaminate the site. The MBTA quickly agreed to a decontamination program. Site remediation for contamination including lead, arsenic, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons took place in 2011‚Äì12. In March 2012, the MBTA announced that the contamination had been fully removed, and revealed plans to place solar panels in the west part of 5-Yard. The panels would be installed and maintained for at least 20 years by an outside contractor. Bidding began in May 2012, with the stipulation that the solar array would be operational by the spring of 2013. The contract was chosen in September 2012, with a revised completion date of October 2013. In July 2013, MassDOT (the MBTA's parent agency) announced that construction would not begin until at least 2014 due to a state solar program reaching capacity earlier than expected. By January 2015, the installation was planned for that June, but it did not occur. Readville 5-Yard was considered for use as a midday layover yard in 2013 as part of South Station Expansion planning, but was rejected because the MBTA had committed to Boston that the site could be used for development. 1-Yard was rejected because it would interfere with CSX freight operations, while expanded use of 2-Yard was advanced for further planning. Planning began in 2014 for a five-building industrial and office development on the Boston portion of 5-Yard; construction began in 2018. Proposed Orange Line extension Readville is located in a densely populated neighborhood just nine miles from downtown Boston, making it a strong candidate for rapid transit service rather than conventional low- frequency commuter rail service. The 1945 Coolidge Commission Report recommended that an extension of the Main Line Elevated (now the Orange Line) south from be built to Dedham via rather than Hyde Park and Readville. The 1966 Program for Mass Transportation recommended a bifurcated Orange Line, with one branch to West Roxbury or and another to Readville or via Hyde Park. Various reports over the next two decades continued to recommend various combinations of the extensions; however, due to cost, the 1987 relocation of the Orange Line to the Southwest Corridor was terminated at Forest Hills. The 2004 Program for Mass Transportation included an Orange Line extension to Route 128, with intermediate stops at , Hyde Park, and Readville at a cost of $342.8 million. The extension was listed as low priority due to environmental issues with crossing the wetlands south of Readville, and because the corridor already had commuter rail service.

Founding the university The University of Redlands had its roots in the founding of two other Baptist institutions, California College in Oakland (not to be confused with the founding institution of the University of California, but a Baptist college founded with a $28,000 endowment on a site donated by Mrs. E. H. Grey) and Los Angeles University, first proposed in 1883 by Charles Button, a preacher who convinced an association of Southern California Baptist churches to raise funds for what became Los Angeles University. Both institutions were opened in 1886, but LAU never became financially solvent, soon ceased functioning as a university, and incurred massive debts. The Baptists appointed an education commission in 1905 to raise funds to cancel the debt and reopen the university as a high school. After the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 damaged the finances of California College, the commission began exploring the liquidation of both institutions to develop a new institution in Southern California. After the Baptist education commission tentatively accepted a proposal to join with Congregationalists to make Pomona a strong interdenominational college, Jasper Newton Field, a new Baptist pastor at Redlands, persuaded the Redlands Board of Trade to pursue the college at Redlands, California, and the Southern California Baptist convention to reject Pomona's offer. The selection of Redlands The convention appointed a second commission to coordinate efforts with Baptists in Northern California to establish a college in Southern California. Newton Field became first a member, then chair of the 14 member commission. Due to miscommunication, California College retained its autonomy for the time being, leaving the commission with only the physical assets of Los Angeles University to convert into capital for a new university. Meanwhile, Redlands proposed at least 100,000 dollars and for a campus (on land donated by Baptist layman Mr. K.C. Wells) if the Baptist Church could bring in from 240,000 to 500,000 dollars towards building the university. On June 27, 1907, the commission met in Pasadena and, out of a field including Azusa, Pasadena and Riverside, voted all in favor of the Redlands proposal. Redlands won because there was no other college in that part of the state, insuring a large local patronage. Also, there was much interdenominational interest among the local citizenry in a non-sectarian college in Redlands. Of the seven signers of the Redlands petition, only one was Baptist, but all were college men from the East and North who valued education. Of the original board of trustees of the new institution three were to be non-Baptists and laymen were to be in the majority, which marked a change from the days when higher education administration in the US was primarily conducted by ministers. From the beginning, there was debate over what to call the new institution, a \\"university\\" or a \\"college.\\" Field envisioned Redlands becoming a full university with a medical school and professional programs, although others more realistically saw it as a liberal arts college. Field's vision carried the day, however, and the Baptists charged him with raising their portion of the start-up funds. After he had successfully raised over $300,000, the board of trustees moved to elect him the first president of the University of Redlands on January 13, 1909, with the full support of the Redlands community.Nelson, Lawrence Emmerson, \\"Redlands: Biography of a College, the first fifty years of the University of Redlands\\" University of Redlands, California 1958. Groundbreaking Ground was broken on April 9, 1909, on the hill where the administration building now stands. On that site once stood the home of Dr. J. D. B. Stillman, personal physician to Senator Leland Stanford, part of a vineyard. After breaking ground with a shovel, Field spoke: > A short time ago we were not here; a few more years we shall have gone > hence. May it be our supreme purpose while we are here to turn the best > account for good the powers that God has given us. In the name of the Lord > of Hosts do we set up our banners. May the educational institution located > on these grounds be forever worthy of the name Christian in the best sense > of the term. May its policy be neither too narrow nor too broad, but such as > will redound to the glory of God and the good of mankind, having always on > it the seal of divine approval. In the name of the Father, and of the Son > and of the Holy Spirit. The doors open The nine founding faculty members held their first day of classes in the Redlands Baptist Church on September 30, 1909, with 39 students attending. Materials were borrowed from the Smiley Library, and Redlands High School offered use of their science labs. (When California College in Oakland was eventually liquidated in 1909 to produce the Berkeley Baptist Divinity School, science equipment and books not needed for divinity education were lent to Redlands in 1914.) Almost immediately, tensions developed between students and the faculty. On December 18, 1909, the faculty tabled a resolution forbidding student attendance at dances or card parties without written permission of parents. The trustees supported the faculty, absolutely forbidding student dancing or card playing, and later further prohibited students from marrying, prohibitions which lasted over three decades. On January 27, 1910, the University of Redlands opened its physical doors by occupying the newly completed Administration building. Bekins Hall and the President's mansion were the only two other buildings completed. President Field was charged with further securing $200,000 for endowment, but the Great Freeze of 1911, which wiped out half the California citrus crop and severely damaged the local economy, made this impossible. Field went east for help, but came back almost empty handed. Faculty salaries became 7 months in arrears, but the faculty stayed on with credit extended by the local community to keep the school open. After the trustees decided '\\"that it would be in the best interest of the University to temporarily use the president's home for the music department,\\" President Field resigned in 1914. The trustees were responding to criticism of UR's cost outlays as reported to the Northern Baptist Convention. As accounts stood, the Northern Baptist's education board would not endorse the university to prospective donors. Victor LeRoy Duke, Dean and Professor of Mathematics, took over as acting president. He was formally appointed by the trustees on June 24, 1915. Redlands during and after the Great War years With the change in administration from Field to Duke, the dream of building a large university faded to a determined focus on building and retaining a strong liberal arts college. However, for the first several years operating deficits continued to average $17,617 annually. The Southern California Baptist community called a mass-meeting in Los Angeles, endorsed the school as \\"the Baptist College of the Southwest,\\" and initiated a campaign to raise $50,000 to clear outstanding debt. The following spring the Northern Baptist Education Board, after meeting with the Trustees, reversed their decision of two years earlier and also endorsed the school, promising to help raise an endowment. After the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, the national Baptist campaign for UR's endowment was called off. The trustees and faculty had decided that no beginning classes in German would be offered, and required a pledge of loyalty to the United States from graduating seniors before degrees were conferred. Continued fundraising for UR depended mainly on the local efforts of George Cortner, UR's business manager, while President Duke adjusted the college to a war-time economy. The university recruited 131 men to qualify the campus for the Students‚Äô Army Training Corps program, whose tuition expenses were to be paid by the federal government in exchange for military training. However, due to the armistice, the Corps was ordered demobilized before the end of its first term, though the new recruits made 1918-19 a banner year for Redlands athletics. Tensions between faculty and students continued. Determining in May 1918 that \\"the existence of fraternities and sororities in this democratic institution is not for the best interests of the University of Redlands\\" the faculty invited the students‚Äô \\"cooperation with the object of their ultimate elimination.\\" The students requested, deftly, that the faculty provide substitutes for their organizations before they gave them up. Hazing and other rowdiness were becoming issues, however, so the trustees and faculty ultimately decided in 1923 that residential fraternity houses would not be allowed. Criticism of the faculty in the student newspaper that year brought a faculty motion that any article concerning the administration must be submitted to the president's approval before publication. By 1925, Redlands employed 25, and student enrollment had increased to 465. Finances had improved to the extent that, with significant volunteer help, UR was able to erect 12 new buildings by the end of the decade. New dormitories, classrooms, a library, memorial chapel and gymnasium were built. A school of education was added. The developing alumni base also started to support the university. The first alumni gift to the school, in planning since 1916, was the Greek theater completed in 1927. By 1928, the University's endowment was $2,592,000, the fourth largest in the state and among the top ten percent of American universities. Statements of faith In the post-war readjustment period following the armistice, concerns for orthodoxy in religious leadership lead the Northern Baptist Convention to send inquiries to various denominational institutions investigating the loyalty of students, faculty and administration to Baptist doctrine. In response, the UR Trustees passed a \\"loyal Baptist doctrinal declaration\\" in 1923, which read: > The trustees of the University of Redlands ‚Ä¶ hereby reaffirm and declare > their continued faith in the historic Baptist position in regard to the > Great Doctrines of the Bible, especially in the inspiration and authority of > the Holy Scriptures, the Deity of Jesus Christ, His supernatural Birth, and > Resurrection and His sacrificial Atonement. We further declare that it is > the purpose of the University of Redlands to remain faithful to these > historic Baptist principles. (Minutes of the Board of Trustees, June 19, > 1923) Furthermore, in 1926 they resolved: > ‚Ä¶that we recognize and appreciate the distinct field of service of the > Christian college, namely, in addition to a high standard of scholarship, > its main objective is the molding of Christian character and that this is > best made possible through the fostering of faith by the emphasis placed on > spiritual things both in the class room and in the social contact of faculty > with the students. > Resolved, further, that prior to the employment of a teacher for a position > on the faculty of the University of Redlands, such person shall be made > acquainted with the above and shall not be employed unless he is in sympathy > with and desirous cooperating with the program of the University of > Redlands. > Resolved, further, that it is the will of the University of Redlands that > any teacher who may find himself out of sympathy with the program and > purpose of the University shall without controversy or delay, tender his > resignation. (Statement of Faith, June 7, 1926) Thus, statements of faith in Baptist doctrine were required of faculty appointments to the University. Still, the number of non-Baptists interested in a Redlands education continued to grow, and by 1927 non-Baptists for the first time exceeded the numbers of Baptists enrolled at Redlands. The Trustees responded by requesting the students and faculty help frame a declaration addressing the ideals of the University, which were: > To establish and maintain a Christian institution of higher education which > emphasizes the spiritual life; in which students may search for the truth, > unhampered by prejudice, superstition, or skepticism, and in an atmosphere > permeated by the spirit of the Great Teacher ‚Äì to the end that they become > men and women, whose wholesome bodies are fit temples for the indwelling of > the Holy Spirit; whose social graces make them welcome where gentlefolk > congregate; whose keen minds enrich scholarship; whose reverent souls > worship God in spirit and in truth; whose loyal lives exemplify the > teachings of Jesus Christ and serve to advance His Kingdom and His > righteousness. (Report of the Committee on Ideals, January 27, 1931) Redlands during the Great Depression By the beginning of 1932, the effects of the Great Depression started to be felt at the University. Enrollment soared, as there was no work to be found, but student indebtedness also increased exponentially, as well as the amount the University owed banks. Salaries were cut, and employees were laid-off. On March 3, 1933, the day after the governor declared a moratorium on banks, President Duke died of a cerebral hemorrhage. In the wake of Duke's death, antagonism developed between the faculty and trustees over forced retirements and other severances. The Trustees appointed Dr. W. Rafferty acting president on the day of Duke's funeral, but as he did not want the job on a permanent basis a nationwide search was immediately undertaken for Duke's successor. The board unanimously elected lay member Dr. Clarence Howe Thurber, Dean of Faculty and Director of Education at Colgate University, as the third president of the University of Redlands. Although Dr. Thurber agreed with the \\"statement of faith\\" required of all UR faculty since 1926, he quickly became known as a relentless innovator. \\"Education,\\" he stated at his inaugural address on December 6, 1933, \\"cannot be ‚Äòpoured in‚Äô or ‚Äòplastered on,‚Äô it must be ‚Äòrooted out‚Äô for oneself ... Leaners not learners result from spoon feeding ... Shall we not then, re-examine our whole set up in an endeavor to quicken the love of learning?\\" He proceeded to do so, working with the Faculty to reorganize the curriculum to make it \\"abreast of the foremost institutions of the nation.\\" His administration, however, soon ran afoul of ultra-conservative churches. Their student members complained of a liberal attitude toward Baptist doctrine being inoculated by Robert H. Lynn, Crawford Professor of Biblical, Missionary and Ethical Instruction. Although the trustees attempted to assuage the matter by conducting a hearing between Lynn and the complaining students, the report they issued commending the Christian spirit of both parties further alienated the critical Baptists. The Upton Sinclair affair Although the Redlands community initially supported the faculty's academic freedom, the later affair of Dr. William H. Roberts, a Redlands psychology professor who became the campaign manager for Upton Sinclair's run for governor in 1934, severely strained town and gown relations in the predominantly Republican community. The affair lead to the undoing of President Thurber. Although he requested Roberts drop all political activity at once, which Roberts promised to do, Roberts later discovered Thurber acted without authorization of the Board of Trustees, so he continued to speak for Upton Sinclair in public under the assumed name of \\"Allan Brand.\\" Sinclair had already lost the election by the time Thurber found out about it three months later; he was so incensed he charged Roberts with unethical conduct, and furthermore presided over his trial before the Faculty Council as both prosecutor and juryman. While the faculty trial returned a verdict of \\"not guilty as charged,\\" it recommended Roberts be fired anyway. Thurber himself resigned two years later; too many people had come to view him as both an autocratic authoritarian and inept administrator, though the event was also viewed as a victory for Baptist fundamentalists on the Board of Trustees. Sectarian strife continues The schism between sectarianism and non-sectarianism continued through the administration of Elam J. Anderson, Redland's fourth president. Formerly the President of Linfield College in Oregon, he was a deeply religious man, and though he also believed in the scholastic ideal of the denominational college as a non-sectarian institution, he did not find evangelical zeal incompatible with intellectual inquiry. As he said at the Southern California Baptist Convention four months before assuming office, \\"The Baptist is the first denomination which has insisted that each person has the right to think for himself.\\"' As President, Anderson spent so much time in off-campus outreach to the Baptist community that non-Baptist students and some faculty felt neglected. However, he was an open and capable enough administrator to create diplomatic channels for hearing and handling complaints. Still, the ultra- conservative churches never forgot their suspicions. In 1941 they appointed a committee to survey all church members requesting signed complaints against Robert Lynn, which they sent in summary to Lynn and President Anderson, requesting a private meeting in Los Angeles to discuss them. They complied, though this was unprecedented, and raised concerns for academic freedom among the faculty. Anderson assuaged them by promising all parties that the only reason for the meeting would be for the investigating committee to \\"gain a new understanding of the task, our ideals and prayers for the University, and a sympathetic acquaintance with Professor Lynn.\\" Although the meeting was successful to that effect, the churches represented by the investigating committee did not accept their recommendation to continue supporting the university. Anderson continued to hold his ground, however, refusing to submit academic freedom to sectarian authority, and the problem gradually eased when the more militant churches broke from the Northern Baptist Convention in the middle 40s. Redlands during and after World War II The 1940s brought many changes to the University of Redlands. They began with the bombing of Pearl Harbor. As conscriptions and enlistments for the war depleted classes, courses were set up for the soldiers at Camp Haan and March Field. Physical education and military science courses at the college began to assume a much higher priority. An emergency control center was set up in California Hall, and drills were conducted in event Redlands was bombed. Although the war-time economy was disastrous to faculty finances, the University itself was on a much surer footing. Rather than cut salaries or lay-off employees, the Trustees promised to borrow against capital to maintain \\"an efficient educational program\\" and \\"efficient faculty personnel.\\" By February 12, 1942, in fact, for the first time in twenty years, the University was completely out of debt. The July 1, 1943, arrival of a Navy V-12 unit, composed of 631 men for officer candidate training, along with a civilian enrollment of 473 women and 110 men, gradually lead to the easing of social restrictions at Redlands. Military men were not required to attend chapel, and on New Year's Eve the Marines clandestinely held the first impromptu dance ever at Redlands. Two months later, the Navy held the first formal dance on the commons, and the Trustees finally discarded the \\"no dancing\\" policy in 1945, after the Redlands V-12 unit had been disbanded.Moore, Frank E. \\"Redlands, Our Town\\" Moore Historical Foundation, Redlands, California 1987 President Anderson died unexpectedly in 1944. Rather than select an acting president, Redlands was run by a faculty administrative committee for a while. In June 1945, the Trustees elected George H. Armacost, then head of Education at William and Mary, the fifth president of the University. He served as president for 25 years, leading the university through times of tremendous change, and instituting it. As he later said in a 1990s interview, in order to establish himself \\"one of the first things I had to do was root out the old-line Baptists from the Board.\\"Burgess, Larry E. \\"With Unbounded Confidence: A History of the University of Redlands 2006 The passage of the GI Bill the year before further opened the doors at Redlands. By special action of Congress, housing units from Washington State University for 50 veteran's families were installed on campus. Of the 219 graduates of June 1949, 126 were veterans, and of these 70 were married, breaking Redlands' longstanding policy against student marriage. The 50s saw other changes. Fraternity houses were established for the first time, and other improvements made to the university. KUOR, the university's radio station, began broadcasting in 1955. The first Ph.D. ever granted by the University was received in 1957, by Milton D. Hummex, in Philosophy. Faced with increased competition for student recruiting due to the establishment of new state universities in Riverside and San Bernardino, Redlands partnered with other institutions to form the Independent Colleges of Southern California organization in 1952, to jointly publicize their programs and solicit support from local industry. In 1954, an Association of Independent California Accredited Colleges and Universities of both Northern and Southern California was formed to lobby the state legislature on issues affecting their campuses. New, ambitious fund raising goals were set in anticipation of Redlands' 50th anniversary in 1959. Redlands during the 1960s and 1970s The effects of the free speech movement began to be felt at Redlands in 1967, when students invited Bettina Aptheker, a Cal student and avowed Communist, to speak on campus. Although the event occurred without violence or other disruption to the university, Armacost suspended the organizers for five weeks in violation of a 1963 Board policy that explicitly prohibited communists from speaking on campus. He later reduced the suspensions to two and a half weeks, and a university and community council was developed for approving controversial speakers. In this time, planning started for an experimental college to be attached to the University of Redlands. James Graham Johnston, of IBM, made the founding grant, and buildings were constructed for the purpose of developing Johnston College as a separate institution that would complement Redlands, similar to the way the Claremont Consortium was organized. Although the Redlands planners only intended it to be an academically autonomous school of foreign policy, in line with the ordinary conventions of the university, those directly involved as its students and faculty envisioned Johnston as something far different. Dr. Presley McCoy, Johnston's first Chancellor, developed its contract-driven pedagogical philosophy by means of a series of encounter groups held at an initiating student and faculty retreat at Pilgrim Pines, Yuciapa, in September 1969. This encounter-driven approach became the lasting pedagogical philosophy of Johnston. According to John Watt, a faculty fellow who was present at Pilgrim Pines: > Certainly one of Johnston's major and most lasting objectives was to find > ways of combining education of mind and heart. This was expressed in the > language of the times as combining cognitive and effective learning, > creating a living learning environment and confluent education. None of > these concepts does justice to the intensity with which the College engaged > in this process, especially under the leadership of its first Chancellor > Pressley McCoy... McCoy's approach... was the force which brought about > Pilgrim Pines and which introduced the encounter group mode into every > social structure, from classes to faculty and community meetings. -John > Watt, \\"Johnston College: A Retrospective View\\", Journal of Humanistic > Psychology, XXI (Spring 1981), pp. 41-42. This approach did not bode well with President Armacost, who went to Pilgrim Pines in order to discuss McCoy's controversial hiring of Jeanne Friedman, an avowed Communist, as a faculty member, following her well-publicized arrest for felonies at Stanford. According to Ed Williams, another professor present at these events: > A great moment of truth came at Pilgrim Pines when the University President > came to the terrible realization that some promises he never could endorse > had gone out to all 180 vibrating students, in materials he hadn't read > carefully enough. There was an amazing confrontation with the President and > Pres McCoy on a public platform sticking their jaws out at each other. Pres > said, 'We have the right to develop our own social rules,' President > Armacost said, 'Pres, you do not and you never did.' > The profound repercussions of that confrontation alone almost blew up > Pilgrim Pines; and we faculty, consciously, deliberately went much further > in developing academic collegiality with students than we otherwise might > have done, just as a way of relieving their anger and frustration over > social control issues. > I suppose a fourth seed of destruction was thereby sown. Because students > emerged with split feelings, almost split personalities: 'The academic > program is ours and well will live by it heart and soul; but the student > life policies are theirs, and we will undermine them however we can. We will > develop our own group ethic of self-protective disobedience. -Ed Williams, > \\"A Confirmation and Critique\\", Journal of Humanistic Psychology, XXI (Spring > 1981, p 20-21) These objectives were realized when Armacost suspended a Johnston girl for keeping a cat in her dorm, in violation of health regulations. McCoy readmitted her, and her cat, a few weeks later, which was one of many factors leading to McCoy's forced resignation in 1971. These events continued to be debated on campus for years afterward; however, as an independent institution, Johnston had lost the support of both the University and the community of Redlands. Broader student militancy at Redlands lead to compulsory chapel attendance gradually being discontinued in the early 1970s. The seventh President of the University, Dr. Douglas Moore, was not even Baptist. The campus became truly interdenominational and multicultural, going for years without Baptist clergymen on the Board of Trustees, but remained true to the spirit of its founding.

He attended a Lutheran collegiate institution in Esslingen am Neckar from 1768 to 1771, when he became Lutheran preceptor and music director in Biberach, which was a free imperial city until 1803, and had a rich cultural life. He became organist of St Martin's church in 1792, which was used simultaneously by Lutherans and Catholics. He led an energetic, busy musical life; he composed for the theatre and church, organised subscription concerts, and taught music theory, acoustics, aesthetics, composition, and instruments at the Gymnasium, which was affiliated to the Musikschule in 1806. He went to Stuttgart in December 1806 in the hopes of a post there as Kapellmeister or similar, but after being appointed Direktor beim Orchester by the King of W√ºrttemberg in April 1807, he returned in 1808 to his former life in Biberach where he remained for the rest of his life.

St. Laurent serves the distinction of being the last NHL goaltender to wear a goalies mask made entirely out of fiberglass.  Playing career St. Laurent was born in Arvida, Quebec. As a youth, he played in the 1972 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Arvida. He began his career playing for the Chicoutimi Saguen√©ens of the QMJHL from the 1975‚Äì76 season until the 1978‚Äì79 season, playing in 70 games during his final season in the juniors. On 10 October 1979, St. Laurent signed with the Philadelphia Flyers organization. From the 1979‚Äì80 seasons until the 1983‚Äì84 seasons, he would spend his time assigned to the minors. St. Laurent would play for both the Toledo Goaldiggers of the IHL and the Maine Mariners of the AHL, where he was part of the Calder Cup-winning team during the 1983‚Äì84 season. The Flyers traded St. Laurent to the New Jersey Devils on 27 September 1984 for future considerations. For the 1984‚Äì85 season, he remained with the Mariners of the AHL. The 1985‚Äì86 season would be one of accomplishments for St. Laurent. His first taste of NHL action was on 4 January 1986, where he replaced (and was subsequently replaced by) Glenn \\"Chico\\" Resch in a stunning 9‚Äì3 loss to the Washington Capitals. After a brief reassignment to the minors, St. Laurent was called back up and started his first NHL game 27 March 1986, making 24 saves to earn a 1‚Äì0 shutout victory. He would go on to post a 2‚Äì1 record with the Devils that season. On a minor league level, he would go on to win the Aldege \\"Baz\\" Bastien Memorial Award for the AHL's best goaltender and would share the Harry \\"Hap\\" Holmes Memorial Award with Karl Friesen for having the lowest team GAA in the AHL. The Detroit Red Wings would go on to acquire St. Laurent from New Jersey for Steve Richmond on 18 August 1986. St. Laurent enjoyed a particular level of success with their minor league affiliate Adirondack Red Wings of the AHL, winning the Calder Cup with them during the 1988‚Äì89 season, as well as receiving the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy for the MVP during the Calder Cup playoffs that same year. From the 1986‚Äì87 season to the 1989‚Äì90 season, St. Laurent would post a cumulative 5‚Äì11‚Äì4 record with 3.42 GAA and a .887 save percentage in 30 regular season appearances with the Detroit Red Wings. He would appear in a playoff game on 14 April 1988, where he was injured after allowing one goal in what eventually became a 5‚Äì3 Red Wings victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs (Greg Stefan would finish the game in St. Laurent's place.) With the emergence of Tim Cheveldae from the Red Wings' depth chart, St. Laurent was traded to the New York Rangers for cash on 26 June 1990. For the 1990‚Äì91 season, St. Laurent would spend his time with the Binghamton Rangers of the AHL. During the 1991‚Äì92 season, his last as a professional, he appeared in one game for the Binghamton Rangers, and was the third-string goaltender for the silver medal winning Canadian National Team at the 1992 Winter Olympics, during which time he switched from his mask made entirely of fiberglass to a modern-era goaltender's mask . He retired from his playing career after participating in the Olympics.  Coaching career  St. Laurent went on to become a goaltender coach/consultant for the Rangers organization from 1993‚Äì2004, helping the organization develop such goalies as Mike Richter, Henrik Lundqvist, and Dan Cloutier.

O'Keefe is an Australian-born book illustrator and designer. He resided in the USA for a number of years, returning to live in Australia in 2018. O'Keefe has been the dustjacket designer and illustrator for US publisher Ramble House for close to two decades. He is also one of the publisher's commissioning editors. Biography Early life Gavin O'Keefe was born in Melbourne and lived in Sydney from the early-1980s to 1990. During that period, his artwork (usually black and white, though sometimes colour) was included in a variety of non-fiction books, science- fiction and horror magazines and other publications. His earliest covers were for books by Australian writers Jacob G. Rosenberg, Alex Skovron, Walter Adamson, and Ian Kennedy Williams. O'Keefe is a classically trained musician and plays the viola. Career Twentieth Century O'Keefe's illustrative work has appeared in many publications, including Aphelion, Crypt of Cthulhu, Culture Magazine (illustrated serial \\"Down the Rabbit Hole\\"), Eidolon, Esoterica, Phantastique, Scarp, Shadowplay, 24 Hours (Australian Broadcasting Corporation), Terror Australis, Theosophy in Australia and Wildfire. He has also provided illustrations for anthologies such as Terror Australis: Best Australian Horror, and for The Australian H.P. Lovecraft Calendar 1990. He contributed illustrations to Sally B. Boillotat's Polocrosse: Australian Made, Internationally Played (1990). He cover designs appear on Ian Kennedy Williams' Stopping Over (1988), Walter Adamson's The Man With the Suitcase (1989), Roslyn Taylor's Uncle Abe (1989), Peter Coaldrake and J.R. Nethercote's What Should Government Do? (1989) and John Leonard's Contemporary Australian Poetry: An Anthology. (1990) Other works include Eight Illustrations for the Gormenghast Books by Mervyn Peake. . This was followed in 1995 by O'Keefe's illustrated version of Lewis Carroll's classic The Hunting of the Snark: An Agony in Eight Fits . His continued interest in illustrating Carroll is evinced by his 2004 compilation A Snark Selection (Ramble House). O'Keefe's first illustrations for Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures In Wonderland (subtitled 'The GO Alice') were published in Melbourne in 1990 by the Carroll Foundation. In a review of this volume, it was stated \\"the hardbound volume intrigues the reader from the first glance at the mysterious black and red dustjacket. O'Keefe's illustrations are stark black and white drawings which have some of the foreboding one expects in Edgar Allan Poe. There is a humor here also, and though there is nothing particularly Australian about these drawings, there is much that we have not seen before, and the collector of innovative illustrated editions will certainly want to add this to his shelf.\\" Knight Letter: Newsletter of the North American Lewis Carroll Society No 36(Winter 1991) A new edition of 'The GO Alice' with entirely new illustrations was published by Ramble House in 2011. O'Keefe has a longstanding interest in the art of Australian painters Norma Bull and Vali Myers. He has also written essays on writers and artists, such as \\"Sita and Salome: A Short Comparative Look at the Art of Aubrey Beardsley and Mervyn Peake\\" in Peake Studies 2, No 3 (Winter 1991) and \\"Alice's Odyssey in Oz\\", Oz Arts 7 (1993). Twenty-First Century O‚ÄôKeefe has illustrated Philip Jos√© Farmer‚Äôs The Green Odyssey and Love Song, William Blake's An Island in the Moon (Purple Mouth Press), Aleister Crowley's The Poem and Leanne Frahm's Borderline (MirrorDanse Books). He designed the cover for the Lovecraftian novel Marblehead by Richard A. Lupoff, published by Ramble House, and cover designs for the novels of Harry Stephen Keeler. (O'Keefe is the cover designer at Ramble House and has been prolific in designing their covers since the turn of the century.) He is also one of the publisher's commissioning editors. Time Line: Selected Illustrations (Ramble House, 2010) collects a range of O'Keefe's illustrations from his first four decades, including designs inspired by the macabre stories of H. P. Lovecraft, Tod Robbins and Edgar Allan Poe, illustrations for science-fiction works by Richard A. Lupoff, Robert Sheckley and Philip Jos√© Farmer, drawings for the ‚Äònonsense‚Äô stories of Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear, drawings inspired by the music of King Crimson, Queen and Brian Eno, cover illustrations for mystery novels by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, Mark Hansom, Walter S. Masterman, Richard E. Goddard and Arlton Eadie, and a range of fairy and fantasy art. A new edition of L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz with O'Keefe's black-&-white illustrations was released by Ramble House in 2013; these illustrations follow the symbolism of Theosophy and the Tarot. O'Keefe's English translation, with numerous black-&white; illustrations, of Lautr√©amont's Les Chants de Maldoror was published by Ramble House in 2018.

Yearbook for Traditional Music 25 (1993), p. 60. He was a master performer of tanbur, dutar, and sato.liner notes, \\"Turgun Almitov 1\\" from Yitco Entertainment, 2001 The musical community knows Alimatov first and foremost as a player of tanbur, dutar, and sato. He has found a new style and technique of performance on the dutar, sato, and tanbur which became popular around Uzbekistan, and his way of playing in these instruments is followed by many performers. Alimatov‚Äôs music is used in many Uzbek houses to put to sleep babies and kids, also in hospitals and treatment centers in Uzbekistan.Matyakubov, O. \\"A Traditional Musician in Modern Society: A Case Study of Turgun Alimatov's Art\\". Yearbook for Traditional Music 25 (1993), pp. 60-66. Early life He was born in 1920 in Tashkent and lived there all his life. He came to music of his own volition. From his childhood Turgun has been learnt playing dutar by his talented father. Although his father didn't teach him how to play the dutar, he allowed him to take the dutar and play whatever he wanted. Aside from his father's dutar playing he listened to other musicians and remembered their melodies and rhythms. Turgun became inspired by endlessly repeating their music without copying them exactly. He considered that his principal teacher to be his hearing ability, good memory, and his heart. Alimatov never studied in a special music school and remained one of the musicians who learned how to play traditional instruments without taking any direct lessons and formal education in music.Levin, Theodore, liner notes for Alimatov's Ouzbekistan, Ocora/Radio France, 1995. Life and work His career as a musician began in 1939, when he was 17, and was connected to musical theatre, and chiefly to Uzbek radio. Working without a teacher he developed his own style and technique on the dutar and other instruments. Although many older masters listening to him believed he played incorrectly, his compositions became popular on the radio and listeners liked the simplicity and sincerity of his music. \\"If I had a teacher, then I might hate the music, because I would have been embarrassed to play the dutar for a teacher\\" he said. After finishing the tenth grade, he joined Theater of Young Audiences where he found a job as a violinist. At the same time, he became an instructor and directed his own amateur music society as the supplementary activity. Turgun Alimatov worked and performed in the Theatre of Young Audiences until the beginning of World War II. In 1941, he resigned and was sent to the military front. After one year in the Second World War, in August 1942 he was wounded in the leg and evacuated to a hospital in Siberia, and then back to Tashkent. While he was recuperating, he knew that the Muqimi Theatre of Musical Drama, the largest and the most popular Theatre in Uzbekistan announced a competition for musicians and singers, whose winners would be freed from duty at the front. Turgun Alimtov entered the competition and won a place in the theater‚Äôs music ensemble. Then, the performer has worked at the Republican Radio as a leading tanbur payer in national and instrumental ensemble headed by Yunus Rajabiy. From 1985 until the end of his life, Turgun Alimatov worked at Tashkent State Conservatory as honorable professor. From 1991, he started his solo tour programs in US, UK, Germany, and France becoming the first Uzbek musician by his solo concerts abroad. His art and creative work has not until now been the subject of studies by ethnomusicologists.Theodore Levin \\"Hundred Thousand Fools of God, The: Musical Travels in Central Asia (and Queens, New York)(1999), pp. 52-60. In 1991, Turgun Alimatov was awarded as The People‚Äôs Artist of Uzbekistan, one year later in 1992, he received the Order of The Great Contribution. Turgun Alimatov played for himself and always played the songs he wanted to perform, simply because he enjoyed playing. He didn't prepare himself for the life of professional musician and never followed the music career. Music for him was not a profession. On December 17, 2008 Turgun Alimatov died at the age of 86 remaining one of the best and successful musicians in world music history.Expat.uz-People‚Äôs artist Turgun Alimatov dies Compositions  Discography  * Ouzbekistan (1995) * The great 1960s and 80s (1960, 1970, 1980) External links *Official Webpage The Fund Turgun Alimatov official Twitter page References Category:1922 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Uzbekistani classical musicians Category:People from Tashkent ","title":"Turgun Alimatov"},{"id":"11757713","text":"Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) is a cytokine.

History This station began regular broadcast operation on May 8, 1953, licensed as WRMA. Owned by the Southland Broadcasting Company, WRMA began as a 1,000 watt daytime-only station broadcasting on 950 kHz.1954 Broadcasting Yearbook On December 1, 1957, WRMA was acquired by WRMA Broadcasting Company, Inc.1968 Broadcasting Yearbook William O. Jones, doing business as W.O. Jones, Inc., purchased WRMA in 1969.1973 Broadcasting Yearbook On March 24, 1977, the station was acquired by the Brien Broadcasting Corporation.1979 Broadcasting Yearbook The new owners had the station's callsign changed to WLSQ. Brien Broadcasting Corporation owner Cleveland J. \\"Cleve\\" Brien died in April 1986. The station applied for a new callsign and was assigned WREZ on March 16, 1987. On June 4, 1987, after clearing probate and other legal hurdles, an application was made to the FCC to transfer control of licensee Brien Broadcasting Corporation to the estate of Cleve J. Brien with Sara M. Brien serving as administratrix. The transfer was approved by the FCC on June 29, 1987. One day later, on June 5, 1987, the Brien Broadcasting Corporation announced an agreement to sell WREZ to Montgomery Broadcasting Limited Partnership. The deal was approved by the FCC on July 17, 1987. This change would also prove short-lived as on August 4, 1987, the Montgomery Broadcasting Limited Partnership applied to transfer the broadcast license for WREZ to Don McCoy's U.S. Broadcasting Limited Partnership. The transfer was approved by the FCC on August 14, 1987, and the transaction was consummated on October 14, 1987. The new ownership had the FCC change the station's call letters to WSYA on September 14, 1988. In October 1993, U.S. Broadcasting Limited Partnership contracted to sell this station to Colonial Broadcasting Company, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on December 28, 1993, and the transaction was consummated on January 31, 1994. In September 1994, Colonial Company, Inc., agreed to transfer control of station licensee Colonial Broadcasting Company, Inc., to Robert E. Lowder. The deal was approved by the FCC on December 8, 1994, and the transaction was consummated on March 8, 1995. In March 1995, Robert E. Lowder agreed to transfer control of licensee Colonial Broadcasting Company, Inc., to Republic Corporation. The deal was approved by the FCC on April 4, 1995, but the transaction was never consummated and Lowder retained control of the licensee. In anticipation of the completed sale, the station had switched to the call sign WNZZ on April 17, 1995. In January 1998, Robert E. Lowder reached a new agreement to transfer control of the licensee to Cumulus Media through their Cumulus Holdings, Inc., subsidiary. The deal was approved by the FCC on March 10, 1998. In a series of internal corporate moves, the license was transferred through several holding companies before winding up with Cumulus Licensing in December 1998. This final deal was approved by the FCC on December 12, 1998, and the transaction was consummated on December 31, 1998. Cumulus Licensing announced in November 2007 that it would assign the licenses for 19 stations to a trust company, Stratus Radio, to comply with FCC ownership regulations. This trust was to be an independent trustee whose sole mission was to sell off the stations to new owners and, while the sales were pending, to run the stations independently of Cumulus Media. The deal was approved by the FCC on May 15, 2008, but the transfer application was dismissed at the request of Cumulus Licensing LLC. On June 8, 2016, Joule Broadcasting announced that WNZZ would be sold to Shelby Broadcast Associates for $55,000. On August 29, 2016, Joule Broadcasting closed on the sale of WNZZ to Shelby Broadcast Associates. As of this update, Radio Insight is reporting: Shelby Broadcast Associates is spinning its recently acquired Silent 950 WNZZ and 94.1 W231DF Montgomery AL to Roscoe Miller‚Äôs Autaugaville Radio for $215,000. In September 2016, WNZZ went silent. The sale to Autaugaville Radio was made official at the start of November 2016. Around that time, the new owners reserved the WZKD calls. On December 15, 2016, WNZZ changed their call letters to WZKD. The station was reported on air in mid-January 2017 airing \\"The Big Station\\" urban contemporary format heard on the company's two FM's south of town, WKXK/WKXN.

Licensed to Troy, Alabama, United States. The station is currently owned by Troy Broadcasting Corp. and features programming from Citadel Media (formerly ABC Radio Networks). WTBF-FM currently simulcasts the AM station during some dayparts, and breaks away for Rush Limbaugh, Clark Howard, Ken Hamblin and sports talk shows weekdays, and for sports and syndicated nostalgia shows on weekends. The station also airs music from Citadel's The True Oldies Channel radio network. Jess Jordan and Bob \\"Pappy\\" Tolbert were the mainstays of WTBF Radio during its first 30 years. Their voices were very familiar to listeners in Pike County, and both were extremely active in the Troy community. Joe Gilchrist is the original engineer, and still owns the station, along with Asa Dudley and Jim Roling. Jim Roling worked there as a teenager in the 1950s and 1960s, left for South Carolina, then returned in 1980 and bought out one of the original owners. Jim hosted \\"The Morning Show\\" since returning in 1980 until semi-retirement in 2007, and is a well-known icon in Pike County. \\"Doc\\" Kirby (so nicknamed for his trumpet playing abilities) has been the Program Director since 1974, with one break from 1985-86 when he was a band director at a local school and was replaced by then Morning Show co-host, Joey Meredith. Since 1986, Doc has developed a weekly program called \\"On The Bookshelf,\\" which is syndicated on the Alabama Radio Network. Doc also became a Methodist minister. Other long-term employees include Ralph Black, who worked there from the late 1970s until the mid-1980s, when he started the Troy State Sports Network. He was the voice heard on every Troy broadcast game. Ralph was bought out by the college in 2002, and replaced by Barry McKnight, who hosts a sports call-in show on WMSP in Montgomery. Ralph came back to WTBF in 2002, and in 2007 became the host of \\"The Morning Show\\".

Other popular programs include \\"Crosby's Country Classics,\\" which was hosted by local personality Ray Crosby from 1998-2006. Ray returned in 2008. In late 2007, Joey Meredith returned to the airwaves on WTBF helming the popular Sunday morning gospel music request show, Gospel Favorites. Allen Stevens helps Joey with the abundance of phone calls on Sunday mornings on the Gospel show. The engineer is Wade Giddens, who spends three days a week at WTBF and four days a week at WAAO in Andalusia. Joe Gilchrist retired after 59 years on the job, but still owns the station. WTBF was located on the Troy University campus by the lagoon, from 1947-1997. This original site was torn down in February, 2008. On June 18, 1997, Joe Gilchrist flipped the switch at the transmitter site. Larry Wells was operating with one CD player at what staffers called \\"Skylab\\", the old studios, and Jim Roling and Doc Kirby were waiting at the brand new studios at 67 West Court Square. At 3:00 p.m., Larry faded the music, Joe flipped the switch, and Jim and Doc signed on from the new location.  WTBF Today  AM 970 has updated their format to an all sports programming. The AM station broadcasts CBS's popular sports line up 24 hours a day Monday-Saturday. Pausing for religious programming and local church services on Sundays until 1:00pm. FM 94.7, licensed to Brundidge, airs about 4 hours per day of live local programming, but tune in the rest of the day an you'll hear \\"Good Time Oldies\\" playing the top billboard hits from the late 60s through mid 80s.

OSMR is a member of the type I cytokine receptor family. This protein heterodimerizes with interleukin 6 signal transducer to form the type II oncostatin M receptor and with interleukin 31 receptor A to form the interleukin 31 receptor, and thus transduces oncostatin M and interleukin 31 induced signaling events.  Expression  OSMR is widely expressed across non-haematopoietic, hepatocytes, mesothelial cells, glial cells and epithelial cell types across various organs and mammary glands. OSM receptor is abundantly expressed on endothelial and stromal/fibroblast cells in the lung of mice.= In vitro expression of OSMR in fetal hepatocytes is upregulated by OSM stimulation. OSMR expression has been shown to be induced by parathyroid hormone in osteoblasts and OSM.  Signaling  Intracellular cell signalling occurs as a consequence of extracellular binding of the ligand OSM to OSMR complexes, formed from dimerization with receptor subunits such as gp130. Activation of the OSMR-gp130 complex by OSM triggers Janus Kinase 1 (JAK1) and Jak2 cross phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the intracellular receptor domain. Downstream signaling activation of the OSMR- gp130 complex along the JAK1 pathway leads to IL-6 signalling which is linked with activation of the MAPK cascade, PI3K cascade and STAT3 activation. OSM induced recruitment of SHC to the OSMRŒ≤ sub-unit has been shown to enhance Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling and lead p38 and JNK activation.  Clinical significance  The oncostatin M receptor is associated with primary cutaneous amyloidosis. OSM signaling via the OSMR is believed to play an important role in bone turnover as Mice lacking the OSMR receptor have osteopetrotic phenotypes. Lack of OSMRŒ≤ activity has also been linked to adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance preceding obesity. OSM in-vivo regulation of hematopoiesis, through stimulation of stromal cells & hematopoietic progenitors - megakaryocytic and erythrocytic progenitors, is carried out by the OSMRŒ≤ receptor.  Heart Disease  Inhibition of the OSMRŒ≤ extracellular subunit has been shown has been shown to prevent OSM-mediated down-regulation of myoglobin in cardiomyocytes and related apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in inflammatory heart failure. OSMRŒ≤ is not only overexpressed in patients with chronic dilated cardiomyopathy but has been shown to control dedifferentiation and loss of sarcomeric structures in myocardial infarction and dilated cardio myopathy. OSM and OSMRŒ≤ mediated dedifferentiation has been shown to increase chances of survival after acute myocardial damage but poor survival rates and compromised pump functions in chronic disease states.  Cancer  OSMR activates STAT3 and transforming growth factor Œ≤ (TGF-Œ≤) effector SMAD3 to regulate expression of genes responsible for inducing a mesenchymal/CSC phenotype. OSM-induced biological effects on breast tumor‚Äì derived cell lines were specifically mediated through the gp130/OSMRB complex. the OSM receptor (OSMR) is overexpressed in cervical squamous cell carcinomas and, independent of tumor stage, is associated with adverse clinical outcomes and higher relative risk of death. OSM and OSMRŒ≤ are co-expressed and lead to STAT 3 activation malignant human ovarian epithelial cells. The OSMR Œ≤ promoter gene is highly methylated in primary Colorectal Cancer tissues and fecal DNA, it is a highly specific diagnostic biomarker of Colorectal Cancer.

The station's \\"104.9 The Gump\\" branding features the frequency of its broadcast translator, W285AJ, rather than its licensed AM frequency. The station is locally owned and operated by Bluewater Broadcasting Company, LLC. The station's studios are located on Wall St. in Midtown Montgomery. The transmitter for WGMP is north of the city, while the translator's transmitter is in midtown near Greenwood Cemetery. WGMP participates in Montgomery rating survey by Arbitron (Market #150) and is monitored by Mediabase. History The station first hit the airwaves in January 1939 as WJJJ, owned by George William \\"Will\\" Covington, Jr. (1170 AM is the second-oldest frequency in use in the Montgomery market, the oldest being 1440 kHz, which began as WSFA, later became WHHY, and finally WLWI.) It broadcast from studios in the Excelsior Hotel in downtown Montgomery. In 1948, Covington changed the call letters to WCOV, naming it after himself. It would eventually spawn Montgomery's first television station, which still has the WCOV-TV call letters. Covington died in 1949, and his family kept the station until selling it to Gay-Bell Corporation in 1964, earning a substantial return on their investment of 25 years earlier. The station changed its call letters to WACV in November 1984, after Gay-Bell sold it. As WACV, it adopted a talk radio format. In March 2004, Montgomery Broadcast Properties Ltd. (Allan Stroh, CEO) reached an agreement to sell this station to Bluewater Broadcasting LLC. The sale was part of a four-station deal valued at a reported $15.3 million. The deal was approved by the FCC on April 21, 2004, and the transaction was completed on June 21, 2004. At the time of the sale, WACV was broadcasting a news/talk format. 1170 logo In late March 2009, WACV began simulcasting on WJAM-FM as \\"News Talk 107.9 FM\\". On Thursday, April 2, 2009, the FM station changed its calls to WMRK-FM, and WACV became known as \\"News Talk 107.9, WMRK-FM\\". The original lineup included news from Bob Jackson, with updates from WAKA CBS8. Locally originated programs, such as \\"Viewpoint\\", continued on \\"News Talk 107.9\\" with Dan Morris and Mark Montiel, and Greg Budell continued \\"Happy Hour\\". Nationally syndicated talk programming features Laura Ingraham, Glenn Beck, Rusty Humphries, Jerry Doyle, Roy Masters, and Neal Boortz. In November 2009, the news/talk programming was re- branded and moved to WMRK-FM as part as of an LMA with Alexander Communications. WACV changed formats to oldies music and branded itself as \\"Good Time Oldies WACV\\". This format was short-lived and on July 30, 2010, WACV changed its format again to alternative rock and re-branded itself as \\"104.9 The Gump\\". On August 13, 2012, the station changed its call sign to WGMP. This station was reported to be off the air in April 2017; it has been running on a special temporary authority antenna since December 2016 due to lightning damage to their daytime transmitter. As such, if they are on the air at all, they are only operating at 4 watts. On April 12, 2017, the station was granted a Federal Communications Commission construction permit to simplify their transmitter setup significantly, decreasing from 10 kW to 850 watts daytime and from a directional antenna to a non-directional antenna. Nighttime power will increase from 4 watts to 7 watts.Alabama Broadcast Media Page - Updates 20 April 2017Construction Permit - Federal Communications Commission Programming WGMP plays mostly Alternative Rock, and plays many Modern Rock songs. Core artists include: Foo Fighters, The Black Keys, Green Day, Pearl Jam, Weezer, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Blink 182, Cake, Seether, Soundgarden, Janes Addiction, Linkin Park, Neon Trees, Metallica, Garbage, The Offspring, Bush, and more. WGMP also features news and weather updates from CBS 8 WAKA, and traffic from Montgomery Skywatch Traffic. There are no disc jockeys, but rather, non-stop music with limited breaks for commercials and station identifications. Technical information WGMP broadcasts with a Continental Electronics transmitter at 10,000 watts (daytime) into a two-tower AM directional array. It powers down to 4 watts at night to protect KFAQ in Tulsa and WWVA in Wheeling, West Virginia. Translators WGMP programming is also carried on a low-powered FM broadcast translator, mainly to improve the station's nighttime coverage. The AM transmitter's four-watt nighttime signal renders it barely listenable even in Montgomery.

The purpose is to accentuate any pain that may be associated with a joint or soft-tissue structure, allowing the practitioner to localize a lameness to a specific area, or to alert a practitioner to the presence of sub-clinical disease that may be present during a pre-purchase exam. Performing a flexion test The animal's leg is held in a flexed position for 30 seconds to up to 3 minutes (although most veterinarians do not go longer than a minute),Baxter, Gary (2011). Manual of Equine Lameness. Wiley-Blackwell. . and then the horse is immediately trotted off and its gait is analyzed for abnormalities and unevenness.Ramey, DW. Prospective Evaluation of Forelimb Flexion Tests in Practice: Clinical Response, Radiographic Correlations, and Predictive Value for Future Lameness. Proc. AAEP, 1997, Vol. 43; 116-119. Flexions stretch the joint capsule, increase intra-articular and subchondral bone pressure, and compress surrounding soft tissue structures, which accentuates any pain associated with these structures. An increase in lameness following a flexion test suggests that those joints or surrounding soft tissue structures may be a source of pain for the horse. The horse may take a few uneven steps, or may be lame for several minutes following the procedure. Flexion tests are considered positive if lameness is increased, although usually lameness is forgiven for the first few steps following flexion. The horse's response should be graded with each flexion and recorded. This allows comparison in lameness when rechecking after treatment has been implemented. In addition to watching for lameness in the flexed limb, the examiner also looks for lameness in the standing, contralateral (opposite) limb. An increase in lameness associated with the contralateral limb can suggest certain causes pain, such as bilateral hock or carpal disease. Distal limb flexion The distal (lower) limb flexion applies the most pressure to the fetlock, pastern, and coffin joints. This flexion is usually performed by pulling the toe of the hoof backward towards the cannon bone, and holding sustained pressure on the joints. The fetlock and phalanges may be somewhat isolated by changing technique, but these joints are never completely isolated from the others, especially in the hind limbs. False positive results from this flexion are especially common in the front fetlock joints. Carpal flexion The carpal (knee) flexion test is performed by pulling the cannon bone up towards the radius. In a normal horse, the heels of the foot should contact the animal‚Äôs elbow. Positive results are usually strongly supportive of carpal disease, but negative results do not rule it out. Elbow flexion Elbow flexion is usually only performed when joint abnormality is found during physical examination. Flexion may be performed by lifting the forelimb (antebrachium) so that it is parallel to the ground, while allowing the knee and distal limb to hang free to help prevent pressure on these joints. Unfortunately, elbow flexion often produces some flexion in the shoulder, and these joints are difficult to localize. Upper forelimb flexion There are two main methods of upper forelimb flexion. The first method involves pulling the limb forward, so that the elbow flexes and the shoulder extends. This method tends to place more strain on the structures of the caudal elbow and cranial shoulder, and is best at localizing lameness to the bicipital bursa or the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, but also places strain on the biceps and triceps muscles and tendons, and the olecranon. The alternative method involves pulling the limb caudally, which flexes the shoulder and extends the elbow. Hock flexion Hock flexion is almost always accompanied by flexion of the fetlock, stifle, and hip joints, so a positive flexion does not clearly indicate hock pain. A very marked response is actually more common with stifle pain, rather than hock pain.Dyson SJ. Lameness Associated with the Stifle and Pelvic Regions. Proc. AAEP, 2002, Vol. 48; 387-411. The flexion is performed by pulling the cannon bone upward so that the upper joints of the leg flex, while avoiding flexion of the fetlock joint or significant pressure on the flexor tendons. A flexion test that produces lameness on the contralateral, standing limb usually occurs with sacroiliac disease. Navicular wedge test The navicular wedge test is used to localize any cause of lameness in the heel of the hoof. A wedge is placed directly under the frog, which applies pressure to the frog. A second method, involving placing the hoof on a wedge so the toe is lifted up relative to the heel, subsequently increases deep digital flexor tendon tension and pressure on the navicular bone. In both cases, the opposite limb is held off the ground to force weight onto the affected limb. The horse is held in this position for 1 minute, then trotted off as in other flexion tests. Problems with flexion tests Flexion tests are rather nonspecific, as each test flexes multiple joints. So while they can help localize a lameness issue to one particular leg, or even to a few joints in the leg, they can not pinpoint it. Additionally, flexion tests affect not only the joints that are being flexed, but also the surrounding soft tissue structures around the joint. Flexion tests may also produce false positives and false negatives. Both the force applied and the time a flexion test is performed can affect outcome.Keg PR, van Weeren PR, Back W, Barneveid A. Influence of the force applied and its period of application on the outcome of the flexion test of the distal forelimb of the horse. The Veterinary Record 1997, 141(18):463-466. For this reason, it is best if the same person performs flexions of a joint on both legs, and for the same amount of time, to help standardize the response. The degree of lameness can increase significantly with repeated flexions. Certain areas, such as tissues of the fetlock joint, are more sensitive to flexion tests over other tissues, such as those in the pastern and hoof.KEARNEY, C. M., Van WEEREN, P. R., CORNELISSEN, B. P. M., Den BOON, P. and BRAMA, P. A. J. (2010), Which anatomical region determines a positive flexion test of the distal aspect of a forelimb in a nonlame horse?. Equine Veterinary Journal, 42: 547‚Äì551. The flexion test is less useful to evaluate for subclinical joint disease, since a significant number of sound, unaffected horses can produce slightly positive results.Busschers, E. and Van Weeren, P. R. (2001), Use of the Flexion Test of the Distal Forelimb in the Sound Horse: Repeatability and Effect of Age, Gender, Weight, Height and Fetlock Joint Range of Motion. Journal of Veterinary Medicine, Series A, 48: 413‚Äì427. Additionally, forelimb flexion tests have been shown to have poor predictive value for future soundness or unsoundness, and are best interpreted in cases of clinical lameness, joint effusion, reduced range of motion, or pain on palpation. Unfortunately, a positive response to forelimb flexion tests is one reason horses may be deemed unsuitable for purchase during the prepurchase exam. The wide range of significance attributed to these tests varies according to opinion and the experience of the examiner. While there have been many purchase exams discontinued solely because a positive response to a flexion test in one or both forelimbs, there‚Äôs really nothing in the veterinary literature to support such an action. Due to the variable response to the test depending on such things as the force applied, duration of the test, age of the horse and the day of examination, discontinuation of a prepurchase examination based solely on a failed forelimb flexion test is probably unwarranted.Ramey 2008, \\"Flex Test\\" References Category:Equine injury and lameness ","title":"Flexion test"},{"id":"11757869","text":"The sign for Northport Northport is an unincorporated census-designated place located in the town of Mukwa, in Waupaca County, Wisconsin, United States.

It serves the Franklin Line, and is located just off exit 14 of Interstate 95/Route 128. It serves mostly as a park-and-ride location for inbound riders. The station consists of two platforms (each a long low asphalt platform with a short high-level platform for accessibility) serving the Franklin Line's two tracks. Previous stations named Dedham Junction (1881-1884 and 1888-1899) and Rust Craft (1955-1977) were located near the modern site. History Dedham Junction The Norfolk County Railroad completed their Midland Division from Islington to Boston in January 1855. No station was originally located at the modern location, which was in the middle of a swamp until the middle of the 20th century. The line passed through several operators and finally to the New York and New England Railroad in 1875. In 1881, the NY&NE; built a branch from Dedham Junction (near the modern station site) to Dedham to replace the Norfolk County's original route to Dedham. This allowed the railroad to (unsuccessfully) compete with the Boston and Providence Railroad's Dedham Loop for Boston-Dedham commuter traffic. The branch was closed in 1884, but reopened in 1888 by state commission order. In 1890 a short leg allowing Dedham-Islington travel for the Old Colony Railroad's Wrentham Branch was opened; trains using this route skipped Dedham Junction station. By 1898, the New Haven Railroad had acquired the Old Colony, NY&NE;, and the Boston & Providence. With the New Haven having no need for four routes to the small town of Dedham, the southern branch was soon abandoned. Service via Dedham Junction ended in 1899 and via Islington in 1904. Rust Craft On May 2, 1955, the New Haven Railroad opened Rust Craft station off Rustcraft Road, slightly east of the modern station location. The station served the 1,500 employees of the Rust Craft greeting card plant, which opened that July. It was the first reverse commute-focused station on the MBTA system and was \\"hailed as the start of a new era\\". Rust Craft station was closed in 1977 due to low ridership. On October 25, 1977, a group of teenagers blocked a Conrail freight train by placing a tree across the tracks near the station, then looted the stopped train. Dedham Corporate Center The 2014-built kiss- and-ride lane in 2015 In the late 1980s, the Dedham Corporate Center office park was built nearby due to convenient access to Route 128 and Route 1. The developer, National Development, constructed the station platforms and a temporary 500-space parking lot at a cost of $527,000. The size and temporary nature of the parking lot was intended to avoid lengthy environmental review. National Development had previously donated land for Forge Park/495 station, which had opened in 1988. The development and station were opposed by some residents and local politicians concerned about additional traffic at the East Street rotary. Dedham Corporate Center station was opened on January 15, 1990. The station initially failed to attract ridership; six weeks after opening, just 44 cars were counted in the parking lot one weekday. The MBTA offered free parking during August 1990 in an attempt to attract riders. A planned parking garage on the north side of the station and a road bridge over the tracks were never constructed. Accessible mini-high platforms were added by 1992. In 1994, Boston‚Äì service for events at Gillette Stadium was shifted to the Franklin Line. Dedham Corporate Center was added as a stop then or soon after. There was initially no access to the station from Rustcraft Road on its north side; a nearby apartment complex was forced to operate a shuttle bus to avoid a two-mile walk to the station. A crosswalk and sidewalk providing access were added around 2007. In late 2014, a kiss and ride dropoff lane was built on the north side of the station off Rustcraft Road.

The series ran for one season of 13 half-hour episodes. The series is about a group of eight troubled 6th grade students from Benedict Arnold Middle School in Oak Forest who continually find themselves in detention. The kids are constantly trying to stay out of detention and out of trouble. Since 2018, the show has been available on iTunes and on DVD in Region 1 as a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release that is only available through the Warner Archive website and other online stores. Characters * Shareena Wickett (voiced by Tara Strong) ‚Äì A 12-year-old goth girl that prefers to be a free spirit and finds pleasure in the sublime. Shareena's beliefs are never taken seriously by her parents. Her hobbies include reading horror stories and a talent of s√©ances. * Emmitt Roswell (voiced by Billy West) ‚Äì A conspiracy theorist who explains that intelligent life exists in outer space and is determined to make contact with aliens. As stated in Boyz 'n The Parenthood, Emmitt has an estranged father. * Jim Kim (voiced by the series' writer Roger Eschbacher) ‚Äì A shy kid with a love for comic book superheroes. He takes on the characters' attributes at inopportune times. * Ramone \\"Gug\\" Gugleamo (voiced by Carlos Alazraqui) ‚Äì A short Latino kid with a short temper. Constantly left out of competitive sports, Gug constantly picks fights with kids twice his own size and has even wanted to take down Miss Kisskillya. He and Emmitt have their occasional rivalries, however, they both agree on their lack of patience with Jim. * Duncan Bubble ‚Äì A quiet boy who is always playing with a yo-yo and he's not speaking. He instead uses his yo-yo to spell out messages (for example, \\"Thanks guys\\", \\"Boring\\", and \\"Yeah\\"), accompanied by an electronic voice (done by the series' creator Bob Doucette) reading the message. He is based on a deaf friend Doucette had during production. * Lemonjella and Orangejella LaBelle (voiced by Tia Mowry and Tamera Mowry) ‚Äì A pair of identical twins. They have been known to get themselves in trouble by hacking into the school computers and removing library fines. Their scientific descriptions tend to confuse Miss Kisskillya and the other kids, so they would simplify them to make sense. They have shown to be competitive with each other. * Shelley Kelly (voiced by Pamelyn Ferdin) ‚Äì An optimistic and peppy girl who wears a same Ladybug Scout uniform and the only kid in detention who did not due to the rule breaking but because she is Ms. Kisskillya's assistant. She constantly kisses up to Miss Kisskillya and has a crush on Emmitt. As a result, she is often detested by the other kids, whom she wishes to be friends with (she seems to have succeeded with Shareena to an extent). However, on some occasions, Shelley is an ally to the other kids. * Eugenia P. Kisskillya (voiced by Kathleen Freeman) ‚Äì The gym teacher and detention monitor of Benedict Arnold Middle School. Having been a military sergeant in the Marine Corps, Miss Kisskillya bosses the children around like such, calls other people by rankings in the army, and usually pronounces \\"detention\\" as \\"dee- tennnn-shun!!\\" The only student she likes is Shelley Kelly, who serves as her \\"Teacher's Pet\\" and whom she refers to as \\"Private Kelly\\". Despite usually being oftentimes tyrannical towards the children, she has been shown to be a nice person. She is based on creator Bob Doucette's grade school teacher who was a nun, as well as Freeman's character, the strict Sister Mary Stigmata, from The Blues Brothers and Blues Brothers 2000. Her personality is very similar to Bradley Buzzcut from Beavis and Butt-Head. Episodes In Fall 1999, the show aired on Saturdays at 10:30 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. EST. In Spring 2000, the show moved to 11:30 a.m. EST on Saturdays. Reruns of the TV series aired on the Kids' WB Friday afternoon lineup from September 8, 2000 until August 31, 2001.

It is a statement about the scalar curvature of Riemannian manifolds: By computing a formula for how the scalar curvature of relates to that of , this statement can be rephrased in the following form: The mathematician Hidehiko Yamabe, in the paper , gave the above statements as theorems and provided a proof; however, discovered an error in his proof. The problem of understanding whether the above statements are true or false became known as the Yamabe problem. The combined work of Yamabe, Trudinger, Thierry Aubin, and Richard Schoen provided an affirmative resolution to the problem in 1984. It is now regarded as a classic problem in geometric analysis, with the proof requiring new methods in the fields of differential geometry and partial differential equations. A decisive point in Schoen's ultimate resolution of the problem was an application of the positive energy theorem of general relativity, which is a purely differential-geometric mathematical theorem first proved (in a provisional setting) in 1979 by Schoen and Shing-Tung Yau. There has been more recent work due to Simon Brendle, Marcus Khuri, Fernando Cod√° Marques, and Schoen, dealing with the collection of all positive and smooth functions such that, for a given Riemannian manifold , the metric has constant scalar curvature. Additionally, the Yamabe problem as posed in similar settings, such as for complete noncompact Riemannian manifolds, is not yet fully understood. The Yamabe problem in special cases Here, we refer to a \\"solution of the Yamabe problem\\" on a Riemmannian manifold (M,\\\\overline{g}) as a Riemannian metric on for which there is a positive smooth function \\\\varphi:M\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}, with g=\\\\varphi^{-2}\\\\overline{g}. On a closed Einstein manifold Let (M,\\\\overline{g}) be a smooth Riemannian manifold. Consider a positive smooth function \\\\varphi:M\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}, so that g=\\\\varphi^{-2}\\\\overline{g} is an arbitrary element of the smooth conformal class of \\\\overline{g}. A standard computation shows : \\\\overline{R}_{ij}-\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\overline{R}\\\\overline{g}_{ij}=R_{ij}-\\\\frac{1}{n}Rg_{ij}+\\\\frac{n-2}{\\\\varphi}\\\\Big( abla_i abla_j\\\\varphi+\\\\frac{1}{n}g_{ij}\\\\Delta\\\\varphi\\\\Big). Taking the -inner product with \\\\textstyle\\\\varphi(\\\\operatorname{Ric}-\\\\frac{1}{n}Rg) results in :\\\\varphi\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\overline{\\\\operatorname{Ric}}-\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\overline{R}\\\\overline{g},\\\\operatorname{Ric}-\\\\frac{1}{n}Rg\\\\right\\\\rangle_g=\\\\varphi\\\\Big|\\\\operatorname{Ric}-\\\\frac{1}{n}Rg\\\\Big|_g^2+(n-2)\\\\Big(\\\\big\\\\langle\\\\operatorname{Ric},\\\\operatorname{Hess}\\\\varphi\\\\big\\\\rangle_g-\\\\frac{1}{n}R\\\\Delta\\\\varphi\\\\Big).

Let \\\\textstyle\\\\varphi:M\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} be a positive smooth function so that the Riemannian metric \\\\varphi^{-2}\\\\overline{g} has constant scalar curvature. As established above, \\\\varphi^{-2}\\\\overline{g} is an Einstein metric. Since it is conformal to a metric with vanishing Weyl curvature, it has vanishing Weyl curvature itself. By the Weyl decomposition, it follows that the assumptions of the Schur's lemma for the Riemann tensor are met; the conclusion of the Schur lemmma is that \\\\varphi^{-2}\\\\overline{g} has constant curvature. In summary: In the special case that (M,\\\\overline{g}) is the standard -sphere, it follows that every solution to the Yamabe problem has constant positive curvature, since the -sphere does not support any metric of nonpositive curvature; otherwise there would be a contradiction to the Cartan-Hadamard theorem. Since every two Riemannian metrics on the sphere which have the same constant curvature are isometric, one can conclude: The non-compact case A closely related question is the so-called \\"non-compact Yamabe problem\\", which asks: Is it true that on every smooth complete Riemannian manifold which is not compact, there exists a metric that is conformal to g, has constant scalar curvature and is also complete? The answer is no, due to counterexamples given by . Various additional criteria under which a solution to the Yamabe problem for a non- compact manifold can be shown to exist are known (for example ); however, obtaining a full understanding of when the problem can be solved in the non- compact case remains a topic of research.

While the surrounding land might appear rather nondescript, is one of the most biologically unique locations in the world. The name Taxara is also synonymous with the shallow lake that marks the center of the region. At about 14,000 feet above sea level, it is an extremely high lake. Another unusual characteristic is that it is a salt lake. Throughout the year, it bustles with many species of aquatic fowl, including three types of flamingo--the Chilean flamingo, the Andean flamingo, and the James's flamingo--which are drawn to the lake by its wide expanse of shallow plateaus abounding with algae that constitute the birds' primary food source. Because it is the only sizable body of water in the region, it often attracts species of bird that would usually not be found in such a region. Most species thrive off the seed that is provided by the arid grassland that characterizes the environment.

In SUVSM, a single smooth muscle cell in a bundle is innervated by an autonomic nerve fiber. An action potential can be propagated through neighbouring muscle cells due to the presence of many gap junctions between the cells. Due to this property, SUVSM bundles form a syncytium that contracts in a coordinated fashion (such as uterine muscles do during childbirth). Single-unit visceral smooth muscle is myogenic; it can contract regularly without input from a motor neuron (as opposed to multiunit smooth muscle, which is neurogenic - that is, its contraction must be initiated by an autonomic nervous system neuron). A few of the cells in a given SUVSM unit may behave as pacemaker cells, generating rhythmic action potentials due to their intrinsic electrical activity. Because of its myogenic nature, single-unit smooth muscle is usually active, even when it's not receiving any neural stimulation.

Function  The leukemia inhibitory factor is a polyfunctional cytokine that affects the differentiation, survival, and proliferation of a wide variety of cells in the adult and the embryo. LIF action appears to be mediated through a high- affinity receptor complex composed of a low-affinity LIF binding chain (LIF receptor) and a high-affinity converter subunit, gp130. Both LIFR and gp130 are members of a family of cytokine receptors that includes components of the receptors for the majority of hematopoietic cytokines and for cytokines that affect other systems, including the ciliary neurotrophic factor, growth hormone and prolactin.  Interactions  Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor has been shown to interact with Glycoprotein 130. LIFR has also been identified as a breast cancer metastasis suppressor that functions through the HIPPO-YAP pathway.

Aerospace Publications Pty Ltd, 2003. . Design and development In September 1957, Sikorsky won a United States Navy development contract for an amphibious anti- submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter capable of detecting and attacking submarines. The XHSS-2 Sea King prototype flew on 11 March 1959. Production deliveries of the HSS-2 (later designated SH-3A) began in September 1961, with the initial production aircraft being powered by two General Electric T58-GE-8B turboshafts. Sikorsky was quick to develop a commercial model of the Sea King. The S-61L first flew on 2 November 1961, and was longer than the HSS-2 to carry a substantial payload of freight or passengers. Initial production S-61Ls were powered by two GE CT58-110 turboshafts, the civil version of the T58. The S-61L features a modified landing gear without float stabilisers.

The average price of a ticket was 25 rupees. It was the world's largest commercial helicopter network at the time. On 7 August 1962, the S-61N made its first flight. Otherwise identical to the S-61L, this version is optimized for overwater operations, particularly oil rig support, by retaining the SH-3's floats. Both the S-61L and S-61N were subsequently updated to Mk II standard with improvements including more powerful CT58-140 engines giving better hot and high performance, vibration damping and other refinements. The Payloader, a stripped-down version optimized for aerial crane work, was the third civil model of the S-61. The Payloader features the fixed undercarriage of the S-61L, but with an empty weight almost less than the standard S-61N. Carson Helicopters was the first company to shorten a commercial S-61.

As many as 360 helicopter flights a day were planned by New York Airways after the 59-story Pan Am building was completed in 1963, but a bitter public outcry delayed the first few flights until December 21, 1965 ... The operation proved unprofitable, however, since the helicopters carried an average of only eight passengers, and the heliport, which had cost $1 million to build, closed in 1968 ... After another round of hearings ‚Äì and renewed protests ‚Äì flights resumed in February 1977.

Of the 13 people reportedly on board, one other pilot and three firefighters survived the crash with serious or critical injuries. The NTSB determined that the probable causes were the following actions by Carson Helicopters: 1) the intentional understatement of the helicopter's empty weight, 2) the alteration of the power available chart to exaggerate lift capability, and 3) the use of unapproved above-minimum specification torque in performance calculations that, collectively, resulted in the pilots‚Äô relying on performance calculations that significantly overestimated load-carrying capacity and without an adequate performance margin for a successful takeoff; and insufficient oversight by the U.S. Forest Service and the Federal Aviation Administration. Contributing factors were the flight crew's failure to address the fact that the helicopter had approached its maximum performance capability on two prior departures from the accident site as they were accustomed to operating at its performance limit. Contributing to the fatalities were the immediate, intense fire due to a fuel spillage upon impact from the fuel tanks that were not crash-resistant, the separation from the floor of the cabin seats that were not crash-resistant, and the use of an inappropriate release mechanism on the seat restraints.

After entering the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, he was ordained to the priesthood on June 23, 1929. Finishing his Roman studies in 1931, he then did pastoral work in Colombo until 1945, whilst teaching at St. Joseph's College and serving as a university chaplain. He also became rector of the Oblate seminary in Sri Lanka. Episcopate On December 14, 1945, Cooray was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Colombo and Titular Archbishop of Preslavus by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on March 7, 1946 from Archbishop Leo Kierkels, with Bishops Edmund Peiris, OMI, and Bernardo Regno, OSB, serving as co-consecrators. Cooray succeeded the late Jean-Marie Masson, OMI, as Archbishop of Colombo on July 26, 1947, becoming the first local-born head of the see.

The essay was first published in France in 2002, as L'Edit de caracalla. In Empire 2.0, Debray's fictitious acquaintance, Xavier de C***, argues that the political enfranchisement of Europe by the United States of America and the official consolidation of the West into an enlarged United States of the West, is the best solution to confronting the current ideological threats and political challenges the West faces from radical Islam, international terrorism, competition for finite resources and responsible resource management, as well as population decline, and would be the only effective safeguard against any future claims to a \\"Confucian\\" or Asian empire, asserted by an ascendant, militarized, and aggressive China. Outline Epilogue Debray begins the epilogue with the lines: \\"A man of quality went off to war, and never came home. From the other shore of America, he wrote to an old friend from university days, a mellowed Parisian with the perspective of distance.\\" The Letter The letter to Debray from Xavier, begins: \\"The past is over. You can guess which past I mean, since I'm no longer writing you in our common lingo.\\" Debray's Xavier de C***, formerly a French citizen, government official, political consultant, and international military advisor, then recounts to Debray how he swore his oath of allegiance in New York City and gained American citizenship in September 2001, immediately after the 9/11 attacks. Xavier's Argument for A United States of the West Xavier discusses the current state of the world, world history, American and European styles of government, western culture, the intellectual traditions of France, the failures of the European Union, NATO and the United Nations to effectively address serious crises, and his own conception of the Western cultural tradition and Western philosophy, as well as what the events of 9/11 and the inevitable American response which will shortly follow, portends for both men. In his letter, de C*** states that currently, only the United States is in a position to take physical and moral responsibility for the stability of the political and economic order, as well as the preservation of the shared values and culture of Western nations, because the United States is the only Western political entity capable of effectively and decisively using force against the ideological enemies of the distinctly \\"Western\\" values and traditions which Europeans and Americans share, thus the United States is the only truly politically empowered nation in the Western world. Xavier argues that there is essentially already an informal arrangement between many nations and the United States, and that if Europe, namely France, wants to play any serious role in her own domestic affairs, as well as a leading role in guiding or shaping international relations, then European citizens must gain many of the rights currently afforded solely to U.S. citizens in regards to the administration of the U.S. government. Xavier believes that France and other nations could preserve their local and regional governments and cultural identities, and could refine the more base aspects and tendencies of inferior American culture, much as Greece contributed to Rome in the classical era. While France and Europe would contribute to a larger whole by electing presidents and assuming roles in the U.S. government, instead of wasting time trying to counter U.S. hegemony economically but not militarily, through the European Union and other economic entities, which all ultimately fail to govern because they lack the \\"force\\" of law, they would sacrifice little in Xavier's eyes, and gain individual political rights, in tune with the Western democratic tradition. Xavier argues that because Europeans and other \\"Occidental\\" or Westernized societies continue to deny the reality of their near complete military and economic dependency on the United States, as well as their commonality with American culture out of pretension, and fail to admit the gravity of the situation that the entire West at-large faces from distinctly intolerant, illiberal, and un-Western ideologies and cultures quickly spreading throughout the world, Europeans will face cultural extinction, a further disintegration of economic security, free trade, and free conscience, as well as political oppression within a few hundred years. In de C***'s eyes, as American power wanes from lack of coherence, guidance, and grand strategy, which only European knowledge and insight can provide, Europeans will find themselves in a much more degraded state, and at the mercy of social and political ideologies and forces which are incompatible with Western virtues and conceptions of individuality; a decline that must be avoided and reversed by either a large influx of new citizens into the American structure or expanded national, civic and cultural awareness, among a broadened, cohesive citizenry. Xavier advises Debray, and the French to lead the effort for this \\"official merger\\" between Europe and the United States, instead of persisting along the current path, because the current tendencies of European governments have led to a precarious situation and continuing along this trajectory only serves to preserve a kind of servile, political half-life among European nations and citizens, either as \\"junior partners\\" in U.S. led ventures, or conversely, as merely resentful, reluctant critics in ineffective organizations such as the United Nations and NATO or other naive, self-deluding social organizations. Xavier states that France is in danger of losing individual rights, political freedoms, and even the ability to co-exist with other nations, because Totalitarian Islam continues to acquire influence as a legitimate reaction to Western economic and military practices, and Islamic culture in general, will soon have over 2 billion adherents. As Europe faces a serious depopulation crisis, and \\"the West\\" only constitutes about 1/4 of the world's current population, there is no reason to believe that any Western values will be transmitted down through any of the generations beyond the next 200 years. Xavier asks rhetorically, if individual liberties, namely women's rights, religious freedom and tolerance, political stability and domestic order, would be better preserved if Europe were to accommodate totalitarian Islamists as France and England did with Hitler at Munich, or alternately whether Europe and the West would survive the ideological and political machinations of China, if China were allowed to become the world's only economic and military hyperpower, following U.S. military overstretch or economic depression resulting from this lack of Western cohesion, and the blowback effects of U.S. unilateralism operating without a moderating European influence. He firmly believes that the United States should extend United States citizenship (through a modernized Edict of Caracalla to all Canadians, Latinos, Europeans, Japanese, Koreans, New Zealanders and Australians, in order to formalize the political center of Western civilization, which in fact, already exists and is tacitly understood, thus formally extending democracy to people who are already governed by U.S. economic and security policies, as well as dominated by American cultural forms, yet have no vote or official representation in the U.S. government, and thus no real say in strategic or economic affairs. Who is Xavier de C*** ? In his \\"Epitaph,\\" following the end of the letter, Debray describes Xavier as a \\"man of letters against his will,\\" a \\"man of action, always preferring to be 'on the ground,'\\" who specialized in classical studies, specifically the Roman Empire. He goes on to state that he was a \\"strategist, resolute and without illusions...(who) had intelligence, without the morose of self-indulgence that so often accompanies it.\\" Related writings Cullen Murphy in his book, Are We Rome?

mantle in various styles. The man on the right wears a gardcorps, and the one on the left a Jewish hat. Women wore linen headdresses or wimples and veils, c. 1250 Costume during the thirteenth century in Europe was very simple for both men and women, and quite uniform across the continent. Male and female clothing were relatively similar, and changed very slowly, if at all. Most clothing, especially outside the wealthier classes, remained little changed from three or four centuries earlier.Fran√ßoise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; Dress in the Middle Ages; p. 39; Yale UP, 1997; The century saw great progress in the dyeing and working of wool, which was by far the most important material for outerwear. For the rich, colour and rare fabrics such as silk from the silkworm was very important. Blue was introduced and became very fashionable, being adopted by the Kings of France as their heraldic colour.Piponnier & Mane, op cit, p. 60 Men's clothing Men wore a tunic, cote or cotte with a surcoat over a linen shirt. One of these surcoats was the cyclas, which began as a rectangular piece of cloth with a hole in it for the head. Over time the sides were sewn together to make a long, sleeveless tunic. When sleeves and sometimes a hood were added, the cyclas became a ganache (a cap-sleeved surcoat, usually shown with hood of matching color) or a gardcorps (a long, generous-sleeved traveling robe, somewhat resembling a modern academic robe). A mantle was worn as a formal wrap. Men also wore hose, shoes, and headdress. The clothing of royalty was set apart by its rich fabric and luxurious furs. Hair and beard were moderate in length, and men generally wore their hair in a \\"pageboy\\" style, curling under at necklength. Shoes were slightly pointed, and embroidered for royalty and higher clergy.Payne, Blanche: History of Costume from the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century, Harper & Row, 1965 Working men's clothing Working men wore a short coat, or tunic, with a belt. It was slit up the center of the front so that they could tuck the corners into their belt to create more freedom of movement. They wore long braies or leggings with legs of varying length, often visible as they worked with their cotte tucked into their belt. Hose could be worn over this, attached to the drawstring or belt at the waist. Hats included a round cap with a slight brim, the beret (just like modern French ones, complete with a little tab at the top), the coif (a little tight white hood with strings that tied under the chin), the straw hat (in widespread use among farmworkers), and the chaperon, then still a hood that came round the neck and over the shoulders. Apart from aprons for trades like smithing, and crude clothes tied round the neck to hold seed for sowing, special clothes were not worn for working.Piponnier and Mane, op cit pp. 49‚Äì52 Style gallery Image:Braies.jpg|1 ‚Äì Work clothes Image:Man in shirt and coif.jpg|2 ‚Äì Shirt File:Falconry Book of Frederick II 1240s detail falconers.jpg|3 - Tunics Image:Cotton Claudius B VII f.224 Merlin Vortigern.jpg|4 ‚Äì Tunics and mantles Image:Maciejowski Bible cappa.png|5 ‚Äì Cappa or chaperon File:Symphonia Cantigas Sta Mar√≠a 160.jpg|6 - Tunics File:CantigasDeSantaMariaPanPipes.jpg|7 - Tunics with hanging sleeves #Men working in linen braies, tunics, and coifs, from the Maciejowski Bible, c. 1250.

The tunic on the left is an early example of mi-parti or particolored clothing, made from two fabrics. Cantigas de Santa Maria, mid-13th century, Spain. #Pan-pipe players wear tunics with hanging sleeves over long-sleeved undertunics. Both wear coifs. Cantigas de Santa Maria, mid-13th century, Spain. Women's clothing Woman in a barbette and coif, sleeveless surcoat, gown and mantle. Sketch by Villard de Honnecourt, c.1230 Overview Dress for women was modest and restrained, and a narrow belt was uniform. Over it was worn the 'cyclas' or sleeveless surcoat also worn by men. More wealthy women wore more embroidery and their mantle, held in place by a cord across the chest, might be lined with fur. Women, like men, wore hose and leather shoes. Headdresses and hairstyles Individuality in women's costume was expressed through their hair and headdress. One distinctive feature of women's headwear was the barbette, a chin band to which a hat or various other headdresses might be attached. This hat might be a \\"woman's coif\\", which more nearly resembled a pillbox hat, severely plain or fluted. The hair was often confined by a net called a crespine or crespinette, visible only at the back. Later in the century the barbette and coif were reduced to narrow strips of cloth, and the entire hairdress might be covered with the crespine, the hair fashionable bulky over the ears. Coif and barbettes were white, while the crespine might be colored or gold. The wimple and veil of the 12th century still seen on nuns today was still worn, mainly by older women and widows. Women also wore long tunics that went down to their ankles. This was worn over a shirt. Wealthier Women's Jewelry Wealthy women often wore clothes lined with fur. They wore jewelry and jewels such to make them look rich and wealthy. However, rings and brooches were not worn as gemstone cutting was only invented in the 15th century. Style gallery Image:Maciejowski Bible Woman.jpg|1 ‚Äì From the Morgan Bible, c. 1250: the wife of Manoah wears a veil and wimple. Note striped hose. Sumptuary laws The Fourth Council of the Lateran of 1215 ruled that Jews and Muslims must be distinguishable by their dress, beginning the process that transformed the conical or pointed Jewish hat from something worn as a voluntary mark of difference to an enforced one. Previously it had been worn but had been regarded by European Jews as \\"an element of traditional garb, rather than an imposed discrimination\\".Fran√ßoise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; Dress in the Middle Ages; p. 138, Yale UP, 1997; . Seals from Norman Roth, op cit. Also Schreckenburg p. 15 & passim. A law in Breslau in 1267 said that since Jews had stopped wearing the pointed hats they used to wear, this would be made compulsory.Medieval Jewish History: An Encyclopedia. Edited by Norman Roth, Routledge The Yellow badge also dates from this century, although the hat seems to have been much more widely worn. Sumptuary laws covering prostitutes were introduced (following Ancient Roman precedent) in the 13th century: in Marseilles a striped cloak, in England a striped hood, and so on. Over time these tended to be reduced to distinctive bands of fabric attached to the arm or shoulder, or tassels on the arm.Piponnier and Mane:139‚Äì141 These probably reflected both a growing concern for control over the increasing urban populations, and the increasing effectiveness of the Church's control over social issues across the continent. Footwear Shoes began to develop a pointed toe at this time however, they were much more restrained than they were in the 14th century. The usual shoe for men opened at the front, from the instep to the toe. Commoners also wore stockings with leather sewn to the sole, and wooden clogs. Woollen garters were also worn by commoners.

It involves an endocrine system response in which corticosteroids are released. While the immediate effects of stress hormones are beneficial in a particular short-term situation, long-term exposure to stress creates a high level of these hormones. This may lead to high blood pressure (and subsequently heart disease), damage to muscle tissue, inhibition of growth, suppression of the immune system, and damage to mental health.  Historical development  Hans Selye (1907‚Äì1982), known as the \\"father of stress\\", is credited with first studying and identifying stress. He studied stress effects by subjecting lab mice to various physical, antigenic, and environmental stressors, including excessive exercise, starvation, and extreme temperatures. He determined that regardless of the type of stress, the mice exhibited similar physical effects, including thymus gland deterioration and the development of ulcers. Selye then developed his theory of general adaptive syndrome (GAS) in 1936, known today as \\"stress response\\". He concluded that humans exposed to prolonged stress could also experience hormonal system breakdown and subsequently develop conditions such as heart disease and elevated blood pressure.. Selye considered these conditions to be \\"diseases of adaptation\\", or the effects of chronic stress caused by heightened hormonal and chemical levels. His research on acute and chronic stress responses introduced stress to the medical field.  Physiology  Animals exposed to distressing events over which they have no control respond by releasing corticosteroids. The sympathetic branch of the nervous system is activated, also releasing epinephrine and norepinephrine. Stress has a role in humans as a method of reacting to difficult and possibly dangerous situations. The \\"fight or flight\\" response when one perceives a threat helps the body exert energy to fight or run away to live another day. This response is noticeable when the adrenal glands release epinephrine, causing the blood vessels to constrict and heart rate to increase. In addition, cortisol is another hormone that is released under stress and its purpose is to raise the glucose level in the blood. Glucose is the main energy source for human cells and its increase during time of stress is for the purpose of having energy readily available for over active cells. Chronic stress is also known to be associated with an accelerated loss of telomeres in most but not all studies.  Response  Different types of stressors, the timing (duration) of the stressors, and genetic inherited personal characteristics all influence the response of the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis to stressful situations. The hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìthyroid axis and other endocrine axes are also involved in the stress response. Those with a wealthy background have a stronger response to stress than those in the lower strata. Resilience in chronic stress is defined as the ability to deal and cope with stresses in a healthy manner. There are six categories of resources that affect an individual's coping resources: *Personality (Empathy/Sympathy, Commitment, Optimism) *Ego- related traits (Self-esteem, Self-confidence, Self-control) *Social Connectivity (Social network, Available support) *Cultural Views (Religious beliefs, Moral beliefs) *Behavioral Skills (Social Skills, Response to emotions management) *Other (Socioeconomic status, General Health)  Symptoms  Chronic stress causes the body to stay in a constant state of alertness, despite being in no danger. Prolonged stress can disturb the immune, digestive, cardiovascular, sleep, and reproductive systems. Other symptoms people may experience include anxiety, depression, sadness, anger, irritability, social isolation, headache, skin problems, menstrual problems, abdominal pain, back pain and difficulty concentrating. Other symptoms include panic attacks or a panic disorder. Chronic stress can increase an individual's risk for psychiatric disorders and some physical disorders such as cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Since chronic stress is due to a wide variety of environmental, nutritional, chemical, pathological, or genetic factors, a wide range of physiological systems can be damaged. Stress can cause such things as atrophy of muscles, push the body to store energy as fat, and keep blood sugar abnormally high. All of these are symptoms of diabetes. Overexposure to glucocorticoids can also cause hypertension (high blood pressure) and atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), which increases heart attack risk. Chronic stress also reduces resistance of infection and inflammation, and might even cause the immune system to attack itself. Regarding to effects on the brain, chronic stress inhibits neuron growth inside the hippocampus (which impairs memory). It also suppresses neural pathways active in cognition and decision-making, speeding up aging. Also, being chronically stressed worsens the damage caused by a stroke and can lead to sleep disorders. (Cortisol causes wakefulness, so overexposure causes stress-induced insomnia.)

She was of the VC2-S-AP5 Victory ship design type that saw service in World War II. She was named for Neshoba County, Mississippi. Construction Neshoba laid down 3 July 1944, under Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MCV hull 564, by Permanente Metals Corporation, Yard No. 2, Richmond, California; launched on 7 October 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Wendall E. Adams; and commissioned 16 November, Commander Martin J. Drury, USN. The conversion to an attack transport was made at Hunter's Point Ship Yard in San Francisco. The conversion consisted of installing Navy radio and radar equipment, armament, adding Welin davits for landing craft, and loading the landing craft themselves. Service history World War II At the conclusion of this conversion, Neshoba took her shakedown, a coastal run from San Francisco to San Diego. During this cruise she attained her top speed of . At San Diego, she was committed to Amphibious Training at which time the new boat crews got a feel of their craft. She acted as flagship for Transport Squadron Thirteen whose commanding officer at that time was Commodore John G. Moyer, USN. The training was supposed to last a period of two weeks, but sudden changes in the Pacific Fleet organization made Neshobas entrance on the scene of action imperative and the training was cut short. She proceeded to San Pedro, California, where final repairs and checkups were performed. Ten days were allotted for this work, then she loaded with a cargo of food at San Francisco and received her first set of combat sailing orders ‚Äì telling her merely to \\"Proceed Pearl Harbor\\". Upon arriving at Pearl Harbor, the cargo was dispatched and its place was taken by a \\"human cargo\\" of hundreds of Seabees. Neshoba was instructed to sail for the Philippine Islands, stopping off at Eniwetok, Ulithi, and Palau on the way. After twenty days at sea, Neshoba arrived in Leyte Gulf on 20 February 1945. The Seabees were taken off and brought into Samar Island. While at Leyte Gulf, Neshoba was designated as the flagship of Commander Transport Division Forty Two, Captain Edwin T. Short, USN. Preparations were underway at this time for the eventual invasion and occupation of Okinawa Shima in the Ryukyu Islands. Combined with Transport Divisions Forty and Forty-one, they made up Transport Squadron Fourteen commanded by Commodore Richardson, USN. It was decided to hold extensive maneuvers in Leyte Gulf for the ships and troops scheduled to take part in the forthcoming operation. Transport Squadron Fourteen was to carry troops and equipment of the 96th Infantry Division to the assault, so these troops were made subject to the maneuvers in Leyte Gulf. Maneuvers were to last for six days, during which time, two \\"dry runs\\" were made on the island of Leyte. Everything worked out as planned, and the high command set the date for the invasion of Okinawa on 1 April, Philippine time. Transport Squadrons Thirteen and Fourteen got underway from Leyte Gulf on 27 March 1945, for the four-day trip north to Okinawa. Boats from Neshoba were assigned to take in the first six waves of assault troops. Since the landings were virtually unopposed, no casualties were inflicted on the crew, and upon completion of the unloading phase, many transports were ordered by Admiral Richmond K. Turner to return to Pearl Harbor. Captain Short, aboard Neshoba, was named Officer in Tactical Command {OTC) of fifteen ships in convoy, which left Okinawa on 5 April, and proceeded to Pearl, via Guam. At Guam she was loaded with ninety Japanese prisoners of war and sailed from Guam with her convoy on 10 April, bound for Pearl. Captain Short was relieved as CTD 42 by Captain Andrew R. Mack, USN. He continued as OTC for the remainder of the trip. The convoy arrived on time at Pearl Harbor on 22 April, and many of the ships received sailing orders for the United States. Neshoba was not among them. Instead, she was ordered by AdComPhibspac to take part in training maneuvers at Maui. OTC for the training schedule was ComTransRon 19. It was during these practice runs that Neshoba achieved the remarkable record of lowering all her boats into the water in the record time of nine minutes. Upon conclusion of these maneuvers, she proceeded back to Pearl Harbor where her new orders read, \\"REPORT SAN FRANCISCO FOR LOADING\\". She was on her way early the next day, and 24 May, saw Neshoba passing under the Golden Gate Bridge. Most of the crew took a few days' leave and when they returned, Neshoba was ready to sail again. This time, it was Okinawa with a load of Naval Ship Repair Unit personnel. The first leg of the trip carried her all the way to Eniwetok Island non-stop. Due to unloading difficulties in Okinawa, ships were held at all ports in the Pacific to wait their turn to go there. Neshoba was held for three weeks at Eniwetok. On 9 July 1945, Neshoba sailed in convoy to Ulithi, then to Okinawa. This trip to Okinawa did not find the same peaceful conditions as prevailed on D-Day. Attacks by kamikazes of the Japanese air forces were in full swing at the time. During the ship's five-day stay there, she was under several air raids, which did not come near the berth, and all hands were relieved when her orders came to depart on 29 July. Once again, it was convoy duty for Neshoba, but one of a very different nature. She was not in a convoy of ships of her type, but was the mother ship to upwards of seventy craft, ranging in size from LST's down to fleet ocean tugs. Captain Mack was in command of this convoy as it set out for Saipan. During the trip, a small, but very annoying typhoon was encountered, but all ships and craft weathered the storm and sailed into Saipan harbor on 6 August. Army and Navy dischargees were taken aboard as passengers, and on 8 August 1945, Neshoba was told to take to the Pacific. The original orders read to proceed at top speed to San Francisco, but through some change of administrative orders, Neshoba was told to change course and head for Pearl Harbor. This order was carried out, but not for long, because further orders were soon forthcoming with instructions to bypass San Francisco and report to the Thirteenth Naval District, Seattle, Washington. The arrival at Seattle was heralded by a shore- based ovation. Following the debarkation of the passengers, the ship was brought over to the Bremerton Navy Yard for repairs. The yard workers concentrated mostly on the boilers, which were in serious need of attention. Temporary repairs took one week after which the headquarters detachment of the 97th Infantry Division was embarked at Pier Forty-two. The commanding general aboard was Brigadier General Partridge. Neshoba once again put out to sea with original orders to carry her passengers to Leyte Island in the Philippines. A stop at Pearl Harbor was ordered and Neshoba made her reappearance there on 17 September 1945. Since there were only seven hundred army passengers on board, the Navy found it very convenient to embark an additional seven hundred men ‚Äì sailors, marines, and Seabees ‚Äì who were bound for Guam. The ship left Pearl Harbor on 20 September, a three-day stopover was made at Guam to disembark the new passengers, and the ship received her orders to continue with the 97th Infantry on to Yokohama, Japan. Following her arrival, the troops were disembarked and Neshoba lay at dock, her holds and compartments empty, waiting to receive more passengers. It was during the brief stay in Yokohama that Neshoba was assigned to Task Group 16.12, popularly known in the Navy as \\"The Magic Carpet\\". Commanded by Rear Admiral Kendall, USN, in Pearl Harbor, the \\"Magic Carpet\\" fleet had the specific duty of moving eligible dischargees from overseas to the United States. The remaining units of the 43rd Infantry Division were embarked at Pier Four in Yokohama for return to San Francisco over the shortest possible route. The Captain and the Commodore jointly agreed on taking the Great Northern Route, which is about , so it cuts off about from the southern route. Upon arriving in San Francisco and debarking troops, Neshoba headed for Mare Island Navy Yard for minor repairs. Captain Drury and Lieut. Comdr. Davis were relieved of duty by Captain E. J. Sweeney, USNR, and Lt. D. M. Newbern as the executive officer, later promoted to lieutenant commander. Neshoba at this time was in dry dock, its first time, and only five short days were taken in the repairs, before she once more had to be readied for a non-stop voyage to Guam. On this trip the crew expected to celebrate the first birthday of the ship, but it so happened that they crossed the International Date Line, thereby \\"gaining\\" a day and skipping 15 November, the ship's \\"birthday\\", so the anniversary was celebrated on 16 November. (Neshoba was commissioned on 16 November 1944, so 16 November 1945, was her actual \\"birthday\\".) The ship arrived at Guam 23 November, where she was loaded with Marines to carry to China. With the escort of the to clear mines in the Yellow Sea, the crew experienced cold weather for the first time and for most of the trip. On 30 November the hook dropped in the Yellow Sea about from the coast and liberty was granted for all hands in Tientsin. After a short stay in China the orders read once more for statewide and on 5 December, the ship departed for San Diego, California. Post-war duties Christmas and New Year's Day were spent tied up at the Destroyer Base in San Diego, awaiting more orders and passengers. They both came, and the ship headed for Guam on 11 January, and arrived on 26 January, debarking troops. After a very short stay in Guam, orders arrived for a return to San Francisco. There it was learned that Neshoba would be put out of active service on 13 March. With a new paint job, sealing of guns, compartments and everything ready for the storeroom, Neshoba, commonly known as the \\"Mighty N\\", left Mare Island for Stockton, California. She was to be a \\"mother ship\\" for five other ships tied together. Decommissioning Decommissioned at Stockton, 4 December, she remained a unit of the Pacific Reserve Fleet until 4 September 1958, when she was transferred to the custody of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) and transferred to the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Suisun Bay Group, Benecia, California. She was struck from the Navy List, 1 October 1958. On 5 March 1975, she was sold to American Ship Dismantlers, Inc., for $210,001, to be scrapped. She was removed from the fleet on 26 March 1975.

During World War II he was a member of a bomber crew shot down and taken POW but escaped and served as a BBC war correspondent behind enemy lines and fought with the Polish resistance Armia Krajowa (Home Army) participating in the Warsaw Uprising in occupied Poland being wounded in action against the SS controlled German forces. Early life Ward was born in December 1918 the Kings Norton district of Birmingham and grew up in the nearby suburb of Ward End where he was educated at the local council school.England & Wales, Birth Registrations, 1918 Royal Air Force service He joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1937 aged 18, as an Aircraftman 2nd class, to train for aircrew as a wireless operator/air gunner and by 1939 was serving with No. 226 Squadron RAF based at RAF Upper Heyford.Williamson (2012), p.220 On 2 September 1939 the squadron was part of the RAF contingent which moved to France ready for war. Under the Advanced Air Striking Force it was based at Rheims.Franks (1994), pp.13-19 Prisoner of war RAF Fairey Battle light bombers over France, 1940 Ward was an Aircraftman 1st class and member of the crew of a No. 226 Squadron RAF Fairey Battle light bomber (serial number \\"K9183\\") on 10 May 1940 when it was shot down by the Luftwaffe during the Fall of France.Chorley (1992), p.49 Tasked to bomb German troop convoys as they advanced south-west of Luxemburg, four aircraft from the squadron took off at 17:00 hours GMT from Rheims, Champagne. After locating a column of 30 to 40 vehicles they made several dive bombing attacks in the face of heavy defensive fire. They suffered one aircraft shot down in flames (K9183) and another which crashed after being badly shot up.Franks (1994), pp.86-87 All three crew of Ward's crew were taken prisoner wounded, although the fatally injured pilot died three days later.Chorley (1992), p.49 Ward was captured and held as a prisoner of war. He was at Stalag Luft I near Barth, Western Pomerania in December 1940 before being moved to an unnamed labour camp in Upper Silesia in January 1941. At the end of March 1941 he was sent to a labour camp near Lissa in Poland. British Escapers - John G Ward (Poland) Escape and the Polish resistance Polish Cross of Valour. On 17 April 1941, Ward was with a working party of twenty prisoners supervised by two German soldiers when he hid, changed into civilian clothes and escaped. At Gostyn he was arrested in the railway marshalling yards and taken to the police station where he escaped through a window at night. In six days Ward travelled to Sieradz where he was directed to the local Roman Catholic priest who provided an introduction to the Polish Home Army. On 30 April 1941, he was taken by train to Lodz. At the end of May Ward was taken by bus to Warsaw. The plan had been to get Ward across the border to the Soviet Union but when the Germans invaded it in June 1941 that became impractical. Ward met Otto Gordzialowski, a lawyer who ran an underground newspaper called Dzien, and worked for him transcribing British Broadcasting Company (BBC) radio broadcasts for translation into Polish for the newspaper. In September 1941, the Gestapo located the newspaper and captured the printers and distributors but failed to catch Gordzialowski or Ward. During 1942 Ward began to build wireless receivers and transmitters which were supplied to Polish resistance groups. In June 1942, he opened his own newspaper, the Echo, and after building it up passed it to the ZWZ organisation in February 1943. During this period he trained a number of Poles as radio operators. British Escapers - John G Ward (Poland)Williamson (2012), p.220 Operating with the Polish resistance, he was tasked with facilitating communication between the British government and the Polish underground. From 1941 to 1945 Ward was the communications liaison between the British government and the Armia Krajowa (Polish Home Army); he also worked as a war correspondent for the London Times including over two years in occupied Warsaw.

Ward escaped from Czestochowa with help from a German guard bribed with US dollars and joined the 7th Polish Partisan Division serving with them until December 1944. He travelled to Raszkow and avoided the initial wave of Soviet Red Army troops who committed serious atrocities on the Polish civil population on 18 January 1945, arresting all educated Poles and anyone suspected of being with the Polish Home Army. On 20 January 1945, a Soviet NKVD Secret Police officer questioned Ward having learned that he was English. He was ordered not to move but on 1 February 1945 with Mrs Gordzialowski he travelled to Kielce where he sent a radio message to London and then continued on to Podkowa Le≈õna where he contacted General Leopold Okulicki \\"Kobra\\" (Cobra), then head of the Polish Home Army. Ward returned to Warsaw on 5 March 1945 and reported to the Soviet occupation commandant but was immediately arrested, interrogated and put in a cell.

It is analogous to the perceptual centre (aka \\"p-centre\\") in speech. It is different from both the physical onset (i.e., the time at which the sound's acoustic energy first begins) and the perceptual onset (i.e., the subjective time at which a listener first notices that the sound has begun). For a very percussive sound such as a note played on a closed hi hat cymbal the perceptual attack time may be just a few milliseconds, while for a note bowed slowly on a violin the perceptual attack time may be as much as 50‚Äì100 milliseconds after the physical onset. Applications Understanding the perceptual attack time of recorded sounds is important when scheduling those sounds to be played by a computer. For example, suppose you want to play a melody on a series of notes from different instruments. If the notes' physical onsets are equally spaced, the result will probably sound a little bit unsteady or out of rhythm; to get a rhythmically correct result it's necessary to account for each sound's perceptual attack time, i.e., to schedule the notes so that their perceptual attack times, not their onsets, are spaced according to the rhythm of the melody.

Amazon reviewed the album saying \\"Matt Gresham's fresh, spirited album entitled Good Times reflects upon his recent live performances and new found modern blues style, with integrated country and reggae influences, demonstrating that he is a songwriter of proven talent, versatility and audience-pleasing cleverness.\\" In 2009, Gresham released June.

Amazon reviewed the album saying \\"June shows Gresham at his melodic best, ranging from tender ballads to full-on rocking country and blues & roots numbers.\\" In November 2012, Gresham released his third studio album, See the World. 2013: The X Factor After years of gigging around Fremantle, in 2013, Gresham auditioned for the fifth season of The X factor Australia. Gresham made it to the top 24, but decided he could not commit to the competition and was replaced by eventual winner Dami Im. In 2016, Gresham reflected \\"The show really helped me develop confidence and a strong work ethic but, in the end, it just wasn't the direction I wanted to go. But I don't regret it at all (leaving the competition): it was a great experience and I learnt a lot.\\" In 2020, added \\"As a creative, they (The X Factor contracts) don't give you much freedom when it comes to artistic direction which is the whole purpose of being in the arts. And they don't really tell until you're at the crunching point, where you have to make a choice.\\" 2014-2019: International recognition In May 2014, Gresham released the track \\"Whiskey\\". Gresham said the song is a reflection of a dark time in his life. \\"My partner had recently left me ‚Äì we were married actually ‚Äì and I was having trouble accepting that it was over ‚Äì so the song, for me, was a healing song; getting out all the heavy emotions that come along with a break-up.\\" \\"Whiskey\\" won Song of the Year in the Blues and Roots category at the 2014 Western Australian Music Awards. In December 2014, Gresham released his fourth studio album, The Beautiful Emptiness. Lukas Murphy from The Music said the album is \\"wrought with the tender emotions of a tragic journey through love and loss\\" adding \\"these songs are meaningful and profound, with wisdom, life and worlds of experience behind them\\" The songs on the album were recorded all around the world. In February 2016, Gresham released \\"Small Voices\\", which was co-written with Los Angeles based producer Jaymes Young. Gresham said the original concept for the song was about his mother being forced to live a city life and how she missed mother nature, but the song evolved into a story about a man missing his daughter from a prison cell. In March 2016, Gresham played at the South by Southwest (SXSW).. Shortly after, Gresham relocated to Berlin and signing with Warner Music Germany. In September 2016 Gresham released \\"Survive on Love\\", which was again, co-written with Young.

In August 2018, Gresham learned that his best friend Luke Liang took his own life aged 28 and Gresham struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Gresham said \\"It was tough. I didn't really know much about PTSD before I had it. I thought it was something that you acquire from war or things like that.\\" 2020: The Voice  In 2020 Gresham auditioned for the ninth season of The Voice Australia where he joined team Delta Goodrem.

Subsequently he held various ministerial posts working under President Robert Mugabe in the President's Office. He was Minister of State for Presidential Affairs from 2009 to 2014 and also served as ZANU-PF's Secretary for Administration.Cris Chinaka, \\"Zanu-PF decides plan of action\\", Reuters, 4 April 2008. Family background and education Didymus Mutasa was born in 1935 in Rusape, a town close to the Zimbabwe/Mozambique border in Africa. He was the sixth child of a devout Christian couple. Mutasa was a student of Fircroft College of Adult Education in Birmingham, UK, where he attended the Access to Higher Education Course. He studied at Birmingham University on a British Council scholarship. Mutasa was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Social Science (DSocSc) by the University of Birmingham in 1990. Political career Before Zimbabwean independence, he was chairman of the Cold Comfort Farm society, a non-racial co-operative community near Salisbury (as it then was). This was located on a farm formerly belonging to Lord Acton. It was promoted by Guy Clutton-Brock and others.(Personal visit in 1971). Following independence, Mutasa was Zimbabwe's first Speaker of Parliament from 1980 to 1990.Trevor Grundy, sector=OPIN \\"Whatever Happened to Didymus Mutasa?\\", Institute for War Reporting (kubatana.net), 2 October 2006.

In April 1998, Mutasa, in defending President Robert Mugabe, said that if Mugabe were pressed to step down, then the entire Cabinet and Politburo should step down along with him, because, in Mutasa's view, if Mugabe had truly \\"stayed for too long and misgoverned\\", then those who had governed with him, \\"including those who are calling on Mugabe to step down\\", must have done so as well. In 2002, he controversially said that it would be a good thing if the population were halved: \\"We would be better off with only six million people, with our own people who supported the liberation struggle. We don't want all these extra people.\\" He was appointed as Minister of Special Affairs in the President's Office in charge of the Anti-Corruption and Anti-Monopolies Programme on 9 February 2004; he was then appointed as State Security Minister in mid-April 2005, following the March 2005 parliamentary election, later Minister of State for National Security, Lands, Land Reform and Resettlement in the President's Office., Parliament of Zimbabwe.gov.zw In the March 2008 parliamentary election, Mutasa was nominated by ZANU-PF as its candidate for the House of Assembly seat from Headlands constituency in Manicaland.\\"Zimbabwe: Zanu-PF Names Poll Candidates\\", The Herald, 15 February 2008. He won the seat with 7,257 votes against 4,235 for Fambirayi Tsimba of the Movement for Democratic Change, according to official results.Results page for Headlands , sokwanele.com. In 2007, he was involved in a bizarre hoax involving a witch doctor and refined diesel gushing from a rock. Mutasa was identified with a faction in ZANU-PF that wanted Vice-President Joice Mujuru to become President Mugabe's successor. In late 2014, the Mujuru faction was accused of plotting against Mugabe, and in that context Mutasa failed to win re-election to the ZANU-PF Central Committee in November 2014.\\"Manicaland Rejects Didymus Mutasa\\", THe Herald, 25 November 2014. He was dismissed from his ministerial post on 8 December 2014, at the same time that Mujuru and others allied with her lost their posts in the government.MacDonald Dzirutwe, \\"Zimbabwe's Mugabe fires deputy, seven ministers\\", Reuters, 9 December 2014.  Background  In 2002 the Zimbabwean government seized the farms of ten citizens of the Netherlands who resided in Zimbabwe, ostensibly as part of the government's land reform. An international tribunal in Paris, France summoned Mutasa to testify about the seizure in November 2007. Mutasa acknowledged on 12 August 2007 that the Zimbabwean government took their farms without their permission and without compensating them monetarily. The farmers are represented by British lawyer Matthew Coleman, assisted by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, and pay no legal fees as these are picked up by AgricAfrica, a British-Zimbabwean organisation. The court is expected to rule on their case by March 2008. The farmers are asking for US$48 million (33 million euros) in compensation and the government has pledged to reimburse them when it is financially possible. If the government does not compensate the farmers and the court rules in their favour then they may seize any property of the government equivalent to what they are owed as long as that property is outside Europe, including foreign aid from the World Bank. The government also seized the farms of 50 Europeans, citizens of Switzerland, Germany, and Denmark who will soon be heard by the tribunal. The European Union sanctioned top-members of Zimbabwe's government with a visa ban in protest of the government's abuses, but lifted the sanction so Mutasa could defend the government at the tribunal.Mugabe Government Admits Zimbabwe White Farmers Were Wronged Voice of America On 12 June 2007, Mutasa announced the government planned to deport all whites, saying, \\"The position is that food shortages or no food shortages, we are going ahead to remove the remaining whites. Too many blacks are still clamoring for land and we will resettle them on the remaining farms.\\" The Zimbabwe Guardian In December 2009 it was again claimed that Mutasa was behind some of the farm invasions.

The company was founded in 1991 by Gatineau area businessman Jean-Luc Brazeau. While the first years of operations were concentrated in the Outaouais side of the National Capital Region, stores were later opened all across Ottawa until 2004. After enjoying some success, especially in the Outaouais in which it won an award from the Outaouais Chamber of Commerce in 1996, the company started to endure several financial difficulties most notably due to the fierce competition by grocery and retail giants such as Costco, Loeb, Loblaws as well as another local business Farm Boy which sells similar products. By the start of 2006, Market Fresh decided to concentrate its activities once again in Gatineau only due to decreasing profits from the Ontario stores. All stores, including the newest ones in Kanata and Bayshore Shopping Centre, were closed before the year ended. The Bayshore location, which filled some of the gap left by the former Les Ailes de la Mode store, was opened for 14 months, while the Kanata location was opened for an even shorter period. Stores that opened in 1998 at St. Laurent Shopping Centre and Place d'Orleans as well as the first Ottawa store in Vanier and the Bank Street location were also affected. Workers were only informed one day prior to the closure. A criminal fire destroyed its Aylmer store in 2005 but it re-opened several months later. However, like the Ottawa stores, it was closed on January 2, 2008 for financial reasons. In 2006, the company faced bankruptcy but avoided it after an offer was accepted and kept its current four Gatineau stores open for business, saving over 200 jobs in the region.

The resort grounds cover and feature of cross-country ski trails, an alpine ski area with 16 trails, five glade areas and a terrain park. There is also a nine-hole golf course and an 18-hole championship course called \\"Panorama\\" which was designed by Donald Ross. History The Balsams c. 1915 Located along the old Co√∂s Trail (now Route 26) through Dixville Notch, it first opened just after the Civil War as the Dix House, a 25-room summer inn established by George Parsons. In 1895, it was purchased by Henry S. Hale, a Philadelphia inventor and industrialistNorm and Lily Goldman, The Balsams Grand Resort Hotel -- Combining History With Romance who had been a regular guest. He renamed it \\"The Balsams\\", and over time enlarged and augmented the facilities. In 1918, Hale completed the Hampshire House, the towering wing which doubled the resort's capacity to 400 guests.The Balsams -- A History The Ballot Room of The Balsams is where Dixville Notch's presidential primary votes are cast just after midnight on the day of the New Hampshire primaries since the 1960s. These votes cast by Dixville Notch residents are among the first to be cast, counted, and reported nationally. Current operations The Balsams closed to the public after being purchased by new owners for $2.3 million in December 2011, and remains closed as of February 2020 as its owners continue to seek financing for their redevelopment and expansion efforts. In 2014, former American Skiing Company head Les Otten joined the Balsams redevelopment effort. Included in Otten's current plan is a massive expansion of the ski area to around 1,000 acres and the addition of multiple lifts, including a year-round gondola to the summit and a lift connection across Route 26 to the hotel complex. The expanded ski area would be quadruple its current size and be one of the largest ski areas in the Northeast. Plans also call for the renovation of the main hotel buildings, the Dix and Hampshire houses, as well as a new hotel wing, and renovations to the golf course clubhouse. The plans also call for the conversion of a portion of the existing buildings from hotel rooms to condominiums as well as the potential construction of additional condominium units. Otten has stated the project to redevelop the hotel and resort would cost an estimated $170 million. After years of effort by the owners of the property, New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu signed the so-called \\"Balsams Bill\\" into law in May 2019, allowing the Co√∂s County Commissioners to create a tax increment financing district around the Balsams. Otten seeks to sell $28 million of bonds under the municipal finance structure in order to begin the redevelopment. No buyer for the bonds had been found as of January 2020.

He played for Clermont Auvergne in the Top 14, commonly in the Number 8 position. Career Early years Chouly first appeared on the professional scene in 2004 when playing for Brive in the then Top 16. He played for Brive for three years, appearing for the club 50 times and scoring 2 tries (10 points). For the 2007‚Äì08 Top 14 season, Chouly signed for the growing Perpignan side, and in his debut season he made 25 appearances for the club. He was part of a solid pack that helped guide the club to fourth in the regular season, but getting knocked out by Clermont (21‚Äì7) in the semi-final. He played in all but 5 matches in the 2008‚Äì09 Top 14 season, making only 3 appearances of the bench in the 28 appearances. He played the full 80 minutes in the Top 14 final against Clermont, coming out victors 22‚Äì13 in Damien's second season with Perpignan. However, Clermont gained revenge the following season, beating Perpignan 19‚Äì6 in the 2009‚Äì10 Top 14 season final. Since that loss to Clermont, Perpignan failed to progress to the knock-out stages finishing 9th and 11th in Chouly's final two season with Perpignan. Clermont In 2012, Damien Chouly signed with Perpignan's close rival Clermont Auvergne on a three-year contract. He was head coach Vern Cotter's favoured N8, and helped form a strong pack to put Clermont top of the table in the regular season on Chouly's debut season. However, Clermont was knocked out by seed 4 team Castres Olympique in the semi-final, losing 25‚Äì9. He also helped Clermont make the 2013 Heineken Cup Final in Dublin, but lost to Toulon 16‚Äì15. He continued to develop in his second season at Clermont, taking up the vice captain roll. During the 2013‚Äì14 Top 14 season, Clermont were convincingly beaten on many occasions. Some include; a 30‚Äì19 loss to newly promoted Oyonnax, 43‚Äì3 loss to Montpellier, and most notable a 46‚Äì6 loss to Saracens in the 2013‚Äì14 Heineken Cup semi-final. In addition to this, Chouly was also part of the team that lost to Castres in the Top 14 semi-final at home ‚Äì which was Clermont's first loss at home in 77 matches. In the 2014‚Äì15 Top 14 season, Damien was named captain of Clermont by new head coach Franck Az√©ma. France Damien Chouly first represented France at Under 21 level in 2006. He was part of the U21 squad that won the 2006 Under 21 Rugby World Championship, after beating South Africa U21 24‚Äì13.

He wasn't selected again for France until 2009, when he toured New Zealand and Australia in the June test window, after putting in strong performances for Top 14 Champions Perpignan. After signing with Clermont in 2012, he returned to the French set-up after nearly 3 years out of the International scene. He did however represent the France A side in the 2010 Churchill Cup, making 2 appearances against Canada and the United States.

Prentice, the editor of the Louisville Journal. Prentice opposed the heavy-handed military rule of General Stephen G. Burbridge in Kentucky during the American Civil War. History Union Major General Stephen G. Burbridge was given command over the Commonwealth of Kentucky in June 1864, after the state's Unionist population had suffered numerous guerrilla raids and murders. He declared martial law. Prentice created the \\"Sue Mundy\\" persona to portray Burbridge as an incompetent commander, unable to protect Kentucky citizens. Guerrilla groups operated in Kentucky late in 1864 and in 1865 (as they did in neighboring Tennessee). Most were bandits, part of a breakdown in social order during the war, and they preyed on persons affiliated with either side for their own gang. Some claimed to be part of \\"Sue Mundy's gang\\" because of the popular image and instant notoriety. Prentice published articles about guerrilla terrorism in the Louisville Journal, attributing it to activities of \\"Sue Mundy\\". He emphasized what he considered the incompetence of Burbridge to protect residents of the area. In the first editorial Prentice wrote about the figure, he spelled her name 'Munday', but in every other editorial he spelled the name 'Mundy'. He portrayed her as a guerrilla. The 20-year-old guerrilla Marcellus Jerome Clarke, a Confederate captain, was known to wear his hair long and had smooth-faced features. Some thought or alleged that he was the model for or actually \\"Sue Mundy.\\" Caught by Federal soldiers in Meade County on March 12, 1865, Clarke was tried in Louisville and hanged a few days later. All along, Prentice vehemently denied that Clarke was Mundy. By some accounts, including his own, Henry C. Magruder (another guerrilla riding with Clarke) was the original Sue Mundy. Magruder made this claim in his posthumous memoir, Three Years in the Saddle: The Life and Confession of Henry Magruder: The Original Sue Munday, The Scourge of Kentucky (1865). The gang of guerrillas were captured and arrested after robbing a bank. As noted above, Clarke was convicted and executed by hanging soon after capture in March 1865. Magruder, having been shot in the lungs during capture, was allowed to recover his health in jail before he was hanged.Henry Magruder, Three Years In The Saddle: The Life and Confession of Henry Magruder: The Original Sue Munday, The Scourge of Kentucky, (published by his captor, Major Cyrus J.

The archdiocese's motherchurch and its archbishop's see is the cathedral of St. Mary of the Flight into Egypt, who is also the archbishopric's patron. The archdiocese is headed by the Archbishop of Cape Town, the Most Reverend Archbishop Stephen Brislin and is assisted by The Right Reverend Sylvester David OMI, the Auxiliary Bishop.  History  It was erected as the Apostolic Vicariate of Cape of Good Hope (and adjacent territories) on 18 June 1818 by Pope Pius VII, on territories split off from the then‚ÄìTerritorial Prelature of Mozambique and Diocese of Tom√©. On 4 April 1819, it gained territory from the suppressed Apostolic Prefecture of New Holland. It repeatedly lost territory, to establish: in 1834 the Apostolic Vicariate of New Holland and Van Diemen's Land and again on 6 June 1837 to establish the Apostolic Vicariate of Mauritius. It was renamed the Apostolic Vicariate of Cape of Good Hope, Western District on 30 July 1847, losing territory to establish the Apostolic Vicariate of Cape of Good Hope, Eastern District. On 3 August 1874, it lost territory to establish the Apostolic Prefecture of Cape of Good Hope, Central District. It was renamed the Apostolic Vicariate of Cape Town on 13 June 1939. Pope Pius XII elevated it to the rank of a metropolitan archdiocese on 11 January 1951. On 18 August 1986, it lost territory to establish the Mission sui juris of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha off its Atlantic Coast.  Extent  The geographical area of the Archdiocese of Cape Town is divided up into 80 parishes. Each parish is obliged to have its own pastoral council as well as a finance council. Representatives from these parish councils ‚Äì as well as of other bodies ‚Äì together form the Archdiocesan Pastoral Council, whose task it is to advise the archbishop in certain matters. In total the archdiocese covers an area of 30 892 square kilometres with a total population of 3 324 539 people, of whom 215187 are Catholics. The administrative centre of the archdiocese is called a chancery and is located at 12 Bouquet Street in Cape Town. Its postal address is P O Box 2910, Cape Town, 8000. The telephone number for all departments in the chancery is (021) 462-2417; the fax number is (021) 461-9330 and the e-mail address is infoatcatholic- ct.org.za The archdiocese is centred on the city of Cape Town and includes the southernmost tip of the continent of Africa; its area is bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, on the north by the southern boundaries of the Van Rhynsdorp district, on the east by the western boundaries of the Calvinia, Ceres, Tulbagh, Worcester, Robertson and Swellendam districts, and on the south by the Indian Ocean. The civil districts within the ecclesiastical area of the archdiocese are the districts of Cape, Wynberg, Simon's Town, Bellville, Somerset West, Stellenbosch, Paarl, Wellington, Caledon, Bredasdorp, Malmesbury, Piketberg and Clanwilliam. About the Most Reverend Stephen Brislin, Archbishop of Cape Town: Born in Welkom on 24 September 1956. Schooling at St Agnes' Convent, Welkom andCBC, Welkom Seminary: Philosophy at St John Vianney,Pretoria and Theology at the MissionaryInstitute, London Ordained a priest on 19 November 1983. Ordained Bishop of Kroonstad on 28 January 2007\\\\. Installed as Archbishop of Cape Town on 7 February 2010, on the Solemnity of Our Lady of the Flight into Egypt, thepatronal feast of the Archdiocese of Cape Town.  Context  The Catholic Church throughout the world is divided into administrative units called dioceses. Each diocese is headed by a bishop. In some cases (as in South Africa) those dioceses which are of greater importance are called archdioceses and are headed by an archbishop. In South Africa there are five such archdioceses, one of which is Cape Town. Each diocesan bishop in the world (ecclesiastically called an ordinary to distinguish him from other bishops who work in an administrative capacity) is responsible directly to the Pope. In order to facilitate and co- ordinate various matters of national interest such as seminaries, the bishops of South Africa are associated into the Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference (SACBC). This conference is affiliated to two other such conferences: IMBISA (the Inter-regional Meeting of Bishops of Southern Africa) and SECAM (the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar). A representative of the Pope was appointed in 1922 as the Apostolic Delegate. In 1994 the Holy See (the diocese of Rome and the Papal administration) and South Africa established diplomatic relations, setting up an Apostolic Nunciature for the Holy Seein Pretoria and a South African Embassy in the Vatican. To help him administer the Archdiocese of Cape Town, the Archbishop has appointed two vicars general. A chancellor is appointed in each diocese, whose task it is to act as a notary or someone who authenticates any official document which the archbishop might issue. To help in the ministry of the various departments of the Archdiocese of Cape Town, a number of priests have been appointed as vicars or heads of those departments. Together with an equal number of other priests elected by the priests serving in Cape Town, these constitute the presbyteral council, and it is from this body that the archbishop chooses his consultors or advisors. In order to co-ordinate the pastoral function of the various parishes in Cape Town, five deans have been elected by the priests as their spokesmen in certain matters. The body of deacons constitutes the Council of Deacons and the Archbishop appoints a co-ordinator as a liaison between himself and the deacons.

The congregation is affiliated with the Union for Reform Judaism.  History  Anshe Hesed, once spelled as Anschai Chesed,Bates, Samuel P., History of Erie County, Pennsylvania, Part III, Chapter IV, Churches \\"was incorporated on 23 May 1862 and organized as a classical Reform congregation on October 24, 1875, making it one of the oldest Reform communities in Pennsylvania.\\" Temple Anshe Hesed webpage The synagogue's name literally means \\"people of benevolence\\" (or kindness) in Hebrew. In his history of the region, Samuel Bates reports that eight to ten members of this congregation began meeting in 1858. Members first met in an upstairs room at the corner of Fifth Street and French Street (the Lyons property) and subsequently met in temporary facilities on French Street, Holland Street, State Street; and then at another location on French Street. Built in 1882, the congregation's first synagogue was \\"a brick structure trimmed in stone and an ornament to the city\\". The land was purchased and the synagogue was built for a total cost of $13,000. It was located on the north side of West Eighth Street, between Myrtle Street and Sassafras Street.According to an Erie street map dated circa 2003, this entire block is part of Gannon University, but a personal visit to the site revealed privately owned apartment buildings. A building at 230-232 West 8th Street is the only likely candidate for the old synagogue among extant buildings on the block. At the time Samuel Bates published his history, the membership of Anshe Hesed was 35. The Tenth Street location was dedicated on 27 June 1930.

It sits on part of the site of what was once the Fremont Dragstrip/Baylands Raceway Park and the Skyways Airport, a glider field. Given Fremont's location at the Northern tip of Silicon Valley, Catellus originally planned the development to house primarily high-tech research and development operations with a moderate amount of retail and restaurant space, a convention center, and a hotel. Until the dot-com bubble, Cisco Systems had planned to relocate its headquarters to Pacific Commons and consolidate substantially all of its San Francisco Bay Area operations to a large campus in Pacific Commons, which would have consisted of several high-rise office buildings. With the downturn in the technology industry, however, Cisco put its plans on hold. While it is unclear whether Cisco will ultimately relocate its headquarters to Fremont, in 2011 Cisco purchased 149 acres of vacant land in Fremont, most of it from Catellus, fueling speculation that, at some point, it will move forward with its headquarters move to Pacific Commons. To mitigate environmental impacts caused by the massive of the project, Catellus donated hundreds of acres of land along the southern and western boundaries of Pacific Commons to the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge. Further environmental mitigation involved building a causeway as a portion of Cushing Parkway over the wetlands preserve from Pacific Commons southward to Fremont Boulevard and Interstate 880 near the Fremont Marriott Hotel. Today, Pacific Commons contains more than one million square feet of research and development and industrial space, including a half-million square-foot distribution center for Office Depot. More than one hundred acres of land slated for research and development uses remains undeveloped. Pacific Commons Retail District A large portion of Pacific Commons was re-entitled by the City of Fremont to retail use in early 2004, and by October of that year Catellus opened the regional shopping center. The shopping district, a hybrid regional shopping center, retail power center, and lifestyle center, is anchored Costco, Lowe's Home Improvement, Kohl's Department Store, Target, and Nordstrom Rack, as well as several other national retailers. There are also junior anchor national chain stores, including DSW Shoes, Old Navy, Total Wine & More, and Jo-Ann Fabrics. In addition, a number of restaurants and eateries operate locations at Pacific Commons, including PF Changs China Bistro, Claim Jumper, Market Broiler, Five Guys Burgers and Fries, and In-N-Out Burger. A major expansion of the retail district opened in March 2012. The expansion is a shopping and entertainment sub-district called The Block @ Pacific Commons and includes a lifestyle center atmosphere anchored by Target and a 16-screen Century Theater. The Block also features a promenade consisting of shops, restaurants and eateries leading from the Target store to the theater. The shop frontage along Pacific Commons Boulevard is about the sidewalks, giving it a downtown feel. After The Block @ Pacific Commons was completed, the Pacific Commons retail district now contains just under of gross leasable space on and is the largest shopping center in Southern Alameda County.

Most of the land has since been purchased by Cisco Systems.Oakland A's sign Fremont land deal The land had been purchased in the late 1990s in anticipation of company growth by Cisco that never occurred due to the dot com bust. Additional land was also purchased by Lewis Wolff's development group to bring the total land up to approximately at the ballpark village site. The plan called for the to be developed into a combination of commercial, retail, and residential spaces in addition to the construction of a 34,000-seat baseball only facility. It would have been the smallest stadium in Major League Baseball. The planned development was similar to the Santana Row development in nearby San Jose with the addition of the baseball park. The planned name for the park was Cisco Field as first announced by the Fremont city council after meeting with Wolff on November 8, 2006. The stadium would have been privately financed primarily from sales of the surrounding \\"ballpark village\\" residential and commercial properties to offset the cost of the stadium. The site plan proposed of commercial space adjacent to the ballpark, and would have included a hotel, restaurant, movie theater and several parking garages of varying size. Its plans also called for 2,900 homes. More than 580 of those residences ‚Äî including 12 each behind the left- and right-field bleachers ‚Äî would have been sprinkled into retail space north and east of Cisco Field, a 32,000-seat stadium with an estimated $450 million price tag. In addition, 2,318 town homes would have been built on south and west of the ballpark. The housing would have been built in phases, and designs showed that a team-owned parcel would have provided nearly 6,000 parking spaces until the town homes were built there. The earliest the stadium would have opened was for the 2011 season.

Kaiser (born June 7, 1947) is an American historian whose published works have covered a broad range of topics, from European warfare to American League baseball. He was a Professor in the Strategy and Policy Department of the United States Naval War College from 1990 until 2012 and has taught at Carnegie Mellon, Williams College, and Harvard University. Early life The son of a diplomat, Kaiser spent his childhood in three capital cities: Washington D.C., Albany, New York, and Dakar, Senegal. He attended Harvard University, graduating with a B.A. in history in 1969. He then spent several years at Harvard University where he gained a PhD in history, in 1976. He served in the Army Reserve from 1970 to 1976. Published works His works include: Economic Diplomacy and the Origins of the Second World War, Postmortem: New Evidence in the Case of Sacco and Vanzetti (with William Young), Politics and War: European Conflict from Philip II to Hitler, and Epic Season: The 1948 American League Pennant Race. His book, American Tragedy: Kennedy, Johnson, and the Origins of the Vietnam War, was winner of the 2001 ForeWord Magazine Book of the Year Award (History Category). The Road to Dallas, (2008) examined the evidence in the Kennedy Assassination. In December 2008 he published a collection of his blog entries History Unfolding : Crisis and Rebirth in American Life 2004-2008. No End Save Victory (2014) described Franklin Roosevelt's leadership and the growing involvement of the United States in the Second World War in 1940-1. Baseball Greatness: Top Players and Teams According to Wins Above Average, 1901-2017(2018) analyzed the contributions of individual players to winning teams over the whole history of major league baseball, and developed a new, simple way to identify the greatest players. A Life in History (2018) combines an account of Kaiser's own life and career with a commentary on changes in academia over the last half century and their broader effects. The Road to Dallas The Road to Dallas, about the Kennedy assassination, was published by Harvard University Press in 2008. The book accepts the Warren Commission's finding that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman, but posits that he was an opponent of Castro used by mafia leaders who wanted Kennedy and Castro dead. Publishers Weekly's review stated: \\"While plenty of authors have argued that the Mafia and anti-Castro Cubans were behind the assassination of President Kennedy, few have done so as convincingly as... Kaiser.\\" Kirkus Reviews said that \\"the narrative‚Äôs level of detail, sober style, strict adherence to its double-track theory and plausible argument make it worthy of consideration.\\" Timothy Naftali review for The Washington Post stated that he did not find Kaiser's arguments to be plausible or persuasive and described The Road to Dallas as \\"manic and unreadable\\". In a lengthy review for Washington Decoded, Max Holland stated The Road to Dallas was \\"the most embarrassing work about the assassination ever printed by a scholarly press\\". No End Save Victory No End Save Victory: How FDR Led the Nation into War was published by Basic Books in 2014. In the book, Kaiser argued that Franklin D. Roosevelt did not lead the United States into World War II prior to 1941 because the country did not have the arms to do so. In a review for The Washington Post, H. W. Brands wrote: \\"David Kaiser focuses on the critical months between May 1940 and December 1941. Others have written about this period, but few with his precision and insight.\\" Michael Beschloss of The New York Times described the book as \\"David Kaiser‚Äôs judicious, detailed and soundly researched history of Roosevelt‚Äôs tortuous process of first preparing America psychologically, politically and militarily, and then nudging the country into that apocalyptic struggle.\\" Beschloss added, \\"Kaiser has brought us a careful, nuanced, credible account of the events and complex issues surrounding America‚Äôs entry into World War II, which, however historical fashions change, is likely to wear well over the years.\\" Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Alonzo L. Hamby stated: \\"Mr. Kaiser's important story of internal discussion makes a substantial contribution to knowledge.\\" Hamby also wrote: \\"What gets largely passed over in his account is the high public drama of the period‚Äîthe intense interventionist-isolationist debate (including the rhetorical duel between Roosevelt and Charles A. Lindbergh); the crucial commitment-laden visits to Britain and the Soviet Union by the president's close adviser Harry Hopkins ; and FDR's unprecedented campaign for a third term in 1940.\\" Kirkus Reviews described No End Save Victory as \\"[a]n admiring, richly textured portrait of a leader confronting the unthinkable.\\" It also characterized Kaiser as \\"an unabashed fan of FDR in this detailed description and analysis of U.S. foreign policy from May 1940 to Pearl Harbor. Repeatedly, he pauses to praise the president.\\" A Life in History Kaiser's autobiography, A Life in History, became available at MountGreylockBooks.com late in 2018. The book tells the story of his own education, teaching, authorship and academic career, while simultaneously commenting on changes in academia in general and the historical profession in particular over the last half century. Prof. Anne Rose of Penn State University describes it as \\"a probing, sometimes searing look at the professional life of an intellectual during the past half century\\" and \\"a personal answer to how to sustain the life of the mind and to ensure a public presence for bold thinking.\\" Morley Winograd of the University of Southern California's Annenberg School writes that the book \\"captures a rare quality these days--the ability to stand for what you believe and base those beliefs on facts, not trendy opinions.\\" References  Further reading  * External links * Interview with Kaiser on \\"New Books in History.\\" Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American historians Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Carnegie Mellon University faculty Category:Williams College faculty Category:Harvard University faculty ","title":"David E.

The station, established in 1965, is owned by Cumulus Media and its broadcast license is held by Cumulus Licensing, LLC. Its studios are in Pensacola and its transmitter is near Robertsdale, Alabama. History WJTQ was an automated beautiful music station when it debuted as WCOA-FM. In the mid-1970s the format was switched to Top 40 with live and local disc jockeys and moniker \\"Q100,\\" with the call sign WJLQ. In the early 1990s the branding was changed by Barry Richards to \\"Super Q 100.7\\" with an emphasis on rhythmic and dance music. As a hit music station, WJLQ competed at different times with WABB-FM and WKRG-FM, which were both Mobile stations. When new owners grew weary of the \\"Super Q\\" moniker, the station began a gradual shift to the Adult Contemporary format and returned to the familiar branding of \\"Q100.7\\". WJLQ shifted from top 40 to Adult Contemporary in the early 1990s, maintaining its \\"Q100\\" identity. In 1993, WJLQ shifted to Urban Adult Contemporary as \\"Magic 100.7\\", which lasted only about a year before the station became \\"Arrow 100.7\\" with a classic rock format on April Fools' Day 1994, with the WWRO call letters being assigned on April 22, 1994. Classic rock lasted until September 2000, when the station reverted to Top 40, regaining the WJLQ call letters and heritage \\"Q100\\" branding. This time, however, WJLQ focused more on the Pensacola side, while sister station WYOK served Mobile as a separate Top 40 station. In 2003, the top 40 format moved exclusively to WYOK as \\"Hot 104\\" and WJLQ shifted to a Hot Adult Contemporary format. After six years as a hot AC outlet, the station began stunting for a format change on the morning of Tuesday, November 3, 2009. On November 5, 2009 at noon, the station switched to Top 40 as \\"i100, Today's Hit Music\\", mirroring similar (and Cumulus owned) contemporary hit radio stations KLIF-FM in Dallas, Texas and WNFN in Nashville, Tennessee. On August 31, 2011, the station began stunting again, this time with TV show theme songs from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. It also advertised a change on Friday, September 2 at 1 pm, which at that time, WJLQ launched a 1980s/1990s adult hits format, branded as \\"Journey 100\\". The station began the \\"Journey\\" format with Journey's \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\".I100 WJLQ Becomes Journey 100 The Format Change Archive (accessed September 5, 2011) On Monday, April 23, 2012, at midnight, WJLQ dropped its 1980s/1990s hits format after just eight months on the air and replaced it with an FM simulcast of sister station WCOA. The final song on the \\"Journey\\" format was \\"What You Need\\" by INXS. Cumulus also applied to change the station's call sign back to WCOA-FM, which it carried during the 1960s and early 1970s; the change of calls was accepted the day of the format change. On February 28, 2014, WCOA-FM changed its format from news/talk to classic hits, branded as \\"Jet 100.7\\" under new call letters, WJTQ.Jet Takes Off in Pensacola HD radio Cumulus Broadcasting began upgrading its stations to HD Radio broadcasting in 2005.

The board was originally created as the United Cricket Board of South Africa in 1991. History During South Africa's absence from international cricket, a number of different organisations ran domestic cricket: initially the South Africa Cricket Association (SACA), South African Cricket Board of Control (SACBOC) and the South African Cricket Board (SAACB). In 1976 these three organisations agreed to establish one single board to govern South African cricket, and that all future cricket in the country would be played on an integrated basis regardless of race or colour. However, the new board ‚Äì the South African Cricket Union (SACU) ‚Äì was not recognised by a small dissenting group in the SACBOC, who set up the South African Cricket Board (SACB). In June 1991, the South African Cricket Union and the South African Cricket Board merged to form the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCB). The unification ended enforced racial separation, and only a month later, on 10 July 1991, South Africa was re-admitted as a full member of the ICC. Suspension In September 2020, South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee suspended Cricket South Africa for 'maladministration and malpractices' and took over the cricket operations in the country. International Cricket Council could suspend South Africa due to government interference, which is against their rules, as they suspended Zimbabwe Cricket in 2019. Domestic competitions South Africa's three major domestic competitions are the Sunfoil Series (four-day first-class competition), the Momentum One Day Cup (List A one-day competition) and T20 Domestic Cup (domestic Twenty20 competition). CSA Provincial Competitions include a three-day first-class competition, a List A one-day competition and the T20. Generally encompassing more than one provincial associate team, six first-class teams take part in these competitions. In June 2017, the new South African T20 league franchise called the T20 Global League were set to begin on 16 November 2017. However, the competition was postponed due to lack of sponsorship and logistics problems. The competition was set moving forward to begin at the 2018 season and the league was renamed as Mzansi Super League.

The Intelliscore is used for commercial organizations in a manner similar to the way the FICO score is used for individuals. The Intelliscore is given by Experian, which is one of the largest Credit Reporting Agencies in the United States. The higher the score, the greater the likelihood of a company paying its suppliers and vendors on time. There are a few versions of Intelliscore, often referred to as Intelliscore Plus. The Commercial Intelliscore predicts the likelihood of a business becoming seriously delinquent in paying its bills within the next 12 months. \\"Seriously delinquent\\" is defined as more than 90 days beyond terms or bankrupt. One variant of the Intelliscore is referred to as \\"Blended\\" and combines the personal credit history of a small business owner with commercial credit history. This version can be more predictive in assessing credit risk for smaller or micro businesses. The Intelliscore Plus is regarded in the credit industry as quite predictive and economical. It incorporates statistical modeling using over 800 commercial and owner variables - including tradeline and collection information, recent credit inquiries, public filings, new account activity, key financial ratios and other performance indicators. The score is easily interpreted within a 1-100 Score Range where credit analysts and marketers can screen out businesses that are below a certain score threshold (or conversely accepting only those for credit terms above a certain threshold). For example, by only accepting new business customers with a score of 26 to 100; 75% of orders can be approved automatically while 79.1% of \\"Bads\\" are eliminated in the process (a 23 to 1 ratio of \\"Goods\\" to \\"Bads\\"). In a strategic alliance between Infogroup (formerly infoUSA) and Experian in 2009, both companies now offer the score as a value-added component of the Infogroup Business information database, regarded as the most complete and accurate in the industry.

A native of New Hampshire, he immigrated to the Oregon Country in 1837 to work at the Methodist Mission, and there would participate in the Champoeg Meetings. Willson served as the first treasurer of the Provisional Government of Oregon. Early life William Willson was born on April 14, 1805, in the state of New Hampshire.Corning, Howard M. (1989) Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 271.Salem Online History: William H. Willson On the East Coast of the United States he worked as a whaler, a cooper, and as a carpenter on a ship. Willson was recruited to work at the Methodist Mission founded by the Reverend Jason Lee in the Willamette Valley as a layperson. He traveled by ship on the brig Diana, where he was instructed informally in medical training by Dr. Elijah White during the voyage. Oregon On May 18, 1837, Willson and other recruits for the Methodist Mission arrived in what was known as the Oregon Country, a region whose control was under dispute primarily between Great Britain and the United States. At the mission, he worked as a lay worker as a doctor and carpenter, and was also sent with David Leslie to establish the Nisqually Mission by Fort Nisqually near the Puget Sound. Willson returned to the Willamette Valley in 1839 and claimed land at the site of present-day Salem. Willson married fellow missionary Chloe Clark, who became the first teacher at the Oregon Institute in 1844.\\"1840-1990 Keepsake Edition: Willamette University\\", Statesman Journal, October 26, 1990, p. 15. They had three children. Willson gave land to the Oregon Institute in 1846. He platted and named Salem that year, choosing the name because it means \\"City of Peace\\", and donated some land to serve as a park. Political career While Willson was in the region, settlers began to look at establishing a government in the unorganized area. These led to the holding of several meetings in 1841 and again in 1843. During the May 2, 1843, Champoeg Meeting, Willson served as secretary, and voted in favor of creating a provisional government, which passed with a 52-50 vote. He was also elected as the first treasurer of the new Provisional Government of Oregon at the election that adopted the Organic Laws of Oregon and served from July 5, 1843 to May 14, 1844. In 1845, he was elected as the president of the bench in the Champoeg District. During the Cayuse War of 1847 to 1850 he was appointed to the commission that worked to raise the money to fight the war that was born out of the Whitman Massacre. Willson participated in the Oregon Exchange Company in 1849 that minted the Beaver Coins prior to the arrival of U.S. authority in the region. He ran for territorial delegate to Congress in 1851, but lost to Joseph Lane. Later years In 1853, Willson served as a member of the board of trustees at Willamette University, which was the new name of the Oregon Institute. The following year he served as a commissioner for the proposed and later built Oregon and California Railroad. William Holden Willson died in Salem on April 17, 1856, at the age of 51 and was interred in Salem Pioneer Cemetery.Salem Pioneer Cemetery: William Holden Willson Willson owned a bookstore in Salem at one time, and when his daughter Frances married Joseph K.

The subsidivions were based on the French model following the erection of the Duchy of Warsaw by Napoleon. The departments were in turn subdivided into traditional Polish powiats (counties). Initially six departments were created out of the province of South Prussia (1793/95 - 1807) in the Kingdom of Prussia. After the 1809 Polish‚ÄìAustrian War, and the Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn, their number increased to ten (as the Duchy territory was expanded following the annexation of West Galicia). Each department was named after its capital city. The departments were divided into powiats, and the powiats were divided into urban and rural gminas. Each department was governed by a prefect, while counties were administered by a prefect deputy (Polish: podprefekt). Main cities of the Duchy (Warsaw, Poznan, Kalisz, Torun, Lublin, Krak√≥w and Sandomierz) were administered by mayors (Polish: prezydent), who were nominated by King Frederick Augustus I. The initial six departaments were created by a Napoleon‚Äôs decree of January 14, 1807. In January 1807 the Duchy of Warsaw was divided into the following departaments: *Departament warszawski (Warsaw Department) *Departament pozna≈Ñski (Pozna≈Ñ Department) *Departament kaliski (Kalisz Department) *Departament bydgoski (Bydgoszcz Department) *Departament p≈Çocki (P≈Çock Department) *Departament ≈Çom≈ºy≈Ñski (≈Åom≈ºa Department) - for the first few months known as Bia≈Çystok Department (Departament bia≈Çostocki) Duchy in 1811.

He trained originally as a landscape and seascape artist but achieved renown through natural history scientific illustrations, especially of birds. Cooper also became a qualified taxidermist in his teenage years. Life The first book for which Cooper supplied the pictures was Portfolio of Australian Birds, written by Keith Hindwood in 1967. Later, he illustrated Parrots of the World, Birds of Paradise and Bowerbirds, Australian Parrots, Kingfishers and Related Birds, The Cockatoos (a Portfolio of all Species), and Turacos (a Portfolio of all Species) all authored by Joseph Forshaw. In 1992 the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, presented Cooper with its gold medal for \\"artistic endeavors and life's work which have contributed to mankind's better understanding and appreciation of living things\\". He was the first Australian recipient in the academy's 190-year history. Then, in 1994, Cooper was awarded the Order of Australia (AO) for his contribution to art and natural history.It's an Honour. Retrieved 11 May 2015 Cooper's work is held in many collections and institutions around the world, including the National Library of Australia. Papua New Guinea's government purchased entire collections of his published works and commissioned from him two sets of postage stamps. He also illustrated Visions of a Rainforest by Stanley Breeden and Fruits of the Australian Tropical Rainforest by Wendy Cooper. In 2011 he wrote and illustrated Capturing the Essence, a book that illustrates and describes techniques for artists. The hard-won knowledge of his subjects which Cooper acquired is evident in his paintings, which display extreme precision, and he usually insisted on painting the birds in their distinct natural environments, down to the exact foods they eat. Preferring to draw from life, rather than depending on photographs as the main source of material for his work, he would often venture into wild, untamed parts of the world to capture the exact display of the birds he painted. He lived with his wife, Wendy Cooper, a self- taught botanist who has authored two substantial books, in north Queensland where his studio was surrounded by tropical rainforest. Sir David Attenborough described Cooper as \\"Australia's greatest living scientific painter of birds; he is possibly the best in the world\\". In 1993, Sir David made a film about Cooper, called Portrait Painter to the Birds. A biography, An Eye For Nature ‚Äî The Life and Art of William T.

The index is based on a set of statistical algorithms developed by Lawrence B. Martin and Anthony Olejniczak. It measures the annual amount and impact of faculty scholarly work in several areas, including: * Publications (how many books and peer-reviewed journal articles have been published and what proportion of the faculty is involved in publication activity?) * Citations of journal publications (who is referring to those journal articles in subsequent work?) * Federal research funding (what and how many projects have been deemed of sufficient value to merit federal dollars, and at what level of funding?) * Awards and honors (a key indicator of innovative thinking and/or scholarly excellence that has impacted the discipline over a period) The FSPI analysis creates, by academic field of study, a statistical score and a ranking based on the cumulative scoring of a program's faculty using these quantitative measures compared against national standards within the particular discipline. Individual program scores can then be combined to demonstrate the quality of the scholarly work of the entire university. This information is gathered for over 230,000 faculty members representing 118 academic disciplines in roughly 7,300 Ph.D. programs throughout more than 350 universities in the United States. Rankings approach Unlike other annual college and university rankings, e.g., the U.S. News & World Report annual survey, the FSPI focuses on research institutions as defined by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. It draws on the approach used by the United States National Research Council (NRC), which publishes a ranking of U.S.-based graduate programs approximately every ten years, but focuses on providing a more frequently-gathered set of benchmark measurements that do not include the qualitative and subjective reputation assessments favored by the NRC and other ranking systems. History The system for evaluating university programs that forms the basis of the FSPI was developed by Lawrence Martin and Anthony Olejniczak of Stony Brook University. Martin had been studying, speaking, and writing about faculty scholarly productivity since 1995. During that period, a series of discipline-specific, per-capita regression models was created and tested to evaluate their accuracy and the feasibility of predicting the academic reputation of the faculty of doctoral programs. These prototype materials employed data from the National Research Council's 1995 publication Continuity and Change (and the subsequent CD-ROM publication of data), describing and evaluating American Ph.D. programs by field. Martin and Olejniczak found that the reputation of a program (as measured by faculty scholarly reputation from a survey conducted by the National Research Council) could be predicted well using a discipline-specific regression equation derived from quantitative, per capita data available for each program (the number of journal articles, citations, federally funded grants, and honorific awards). Reputation could be predicted with high statistical significance but important deviations from the regression line were also apparent; that is to say, some schools were outperforming their reputation, while others were under-performing. The prototype materials based on this method, and the data from the 1995 NRC study, were subsequently presented at numerous academic conferences from 1996 to 2004, and have formed the basis on which the FSP Index was developed. Unfortunately, like many academic productivity algorithms, the FSPI is not without major flaws. It fails to adequately differentiate among and apply appropriate measures to evaluating the very distinct academic fields represented in most colleges and universities. Furthermore, a number of specific objections have been raised about how the FSPI measures scholarly productivity. Among them are: 1) inadequate‚Äîor inconsistent‚Äîweighting of quality of journals in which publications appear; 2) failure to differentiate labor involved in producing different types of publications (publications based on secondary sources and those based on tedious and deep research are not differentiated‚Äîhence departments with many faculty members who write much but research little are better rated; 3) failure to differentiate between scholarly concentrations of departments. Departments with faculty who are more involved in obscure, non-mainstream research are less cited than those involved in fashionable, mainstream areas of research and scholarship; 4) citation indexes, extensively used in scholarly productivity indexes, do not measure citations in books; 5) citation indexes are more appropriate for hard science disciplines and less appropriate for humanities disciplines; 6) non- conventional publications, which are increasing in number (e.g. - Web sites and on-line publications, audio and media productions) are ignored; 7) use of such indexes promotes \\"researching and publishing to the index\\" in order to preserve and enlarge university, government, and private grant support‚Äîand indirectly promote conservative, safe, mainstream research and publications.

It was the birthplace and childhood home of Whitney M. Young, Jr. (1921-71), an American civil rights leader. Young became prominent for his leadership of the National Urban League between 1961 and 1971. The house is now managed by the Lincoln Foundation, a successor to the Lincoln Institute, as a museum to its and Young's history. The house appears on the National Register of Historic Places and was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1984. Description and history The Lincoln Institute was founded by Berea College in 1912 after Kentucky passed legislation forbidding mixed-race colleges, and operated until 1966. The Whitney Young Birthplace stands on its former campus, south of United States Route 60 west of Shelbyville. It is a modest two-story wood frame structure with a clapboarded exterior and hip roof. A porch extends across the front, supported by stuccoed square columns. Young was born in the house in 1921 and lived there through his high school years.We Shall Overcome - Whitney M. Young Birthplace Particularly in his role as leader of the National Urban League (1961-71), Young was influential in improving conditions for African Americans with respect to housing, education, and employment opportunity. Young's birthplace and childhood home remained the property of the Lincoln Institute, and its successor, the Lincoln Foundation. After Young's death in 1971, the house was dedicated as a shrine to his memory. Today, numerous photographs, articles, and other items related to Young and the Lincoln Institute are on display inside the house. The house is now a museum, accessed through the Whitney M.

Its studios and transmitter are located separately on the northside of Tallahassee. History The station's original call-letters were WLOR - LOR for \\"Land of Roses\\". It morphed into country formatted \\"South 107\\" with call letters WSTT serving Thomasville and Thomas County, Georgia. In 1990, the station was granted an upgrade to full C1 status. Its new 100,000 watt signal from the tower of Tallahassee's WTWC television, between Tallahassee and Thomasville, gave the station full Tallahassee market coverage. The station's studios moved to NE Capital Circle in Tallahassee and the call letters were changed to WSNI for Sunny 107. The new format was 1960s and 1970s based oldies - a format that had not been done live in the Tallahassee market. Bob Walker from WCKT in Ft. Myers was hired as the station's first PD. Bob and Carol Chastain from sister station WTSH in Rome Georgia were the first morning team. Joe Chrysdale formerly of Florida Radio Networks was the first midday jock and April Crowley formerly of WGLF later assumed the shift. Dan Murray from WCGQ in Columbus, Georgia was the afternoon drive talent, Charles Kinney from WPAP in Panama City hosted nights and James \\"The General\\" Sherman hosted over-nights. When Chastain left to host mid-days at cross-town Kix 100, market veteran Sara Michaels who had co-hosted mornings at WBGM (now WBZE) before moving to Detroit to work for ABC news - was hired to co-host mornings with Walker. The new \\"Bob and Sara in the Morning\\" program included Tim Bryant from WJAD in Bainbridge and former WCTV- TV sports anchor Jim Loftus hosting sports. The show endeared itself to listeners while Michael's toddler daughter underwent open-heart surgery. Michaels shared on-going details with WSNI listeners and talked about the strength of community she and her family felt from their thoughts and prayers. In 1997, the station was sold to Paxson Communications and soon after to current owner iHeartMedia, Inc. (then-called \\"Clear Channel Communications\\"). Studios were moved to the current John Knox Road location and the station's \\"Sunny\\" name was dropped in favor of \\"Cool 107,\\" WOKL. Steven Christian from crosstown Z-Rock 106, now WQTL, replaced Bob Walker as morning show host. Steve and Sara continued the strong morning show tradition even as Clear Channel Communications morphed the station to Soft AC as Magic 107.1 with new call letters WTLY. In 2009 the station began using the popular \\"My\\" moniker as \\"My 107.1\\" WGMY with syndicated morning show host Elvis Duran and a Hot AC music format. On September 16, 2011 WGMY changed their format to CHR, branded as \\"107.1 Hit Music Now\\".

This single Chinese term expresses a range of similar, yet differing, meanings. The first meaning may refer to spirits or gods that are intimately involved in the affairs of the world. Spirits generate entities like rivers, mountains, thunder and stars. A second meaning of shen refers to the human spirit or psyche; it is the basic power or agency within humans that accounts for life, and in order to further life to its fullest potential the spirit must be grown and cultivated. A third understanding of shen describes an entity as spiritual in the sense of inspiring awe or wonder because it combines categories usually kept separate, or it cannot be comprehended through normal concepts. A starting point for an understanding of shen is the meeting place of Heaven and Earth, which is mankind. Heaven is the origin of the spiritual aspect of humanity and provides ongoing spiritual influences, while Earth is the origin of the physical aspect of humankind. The ongoing harmonious interaction of Heaven and Earth in man is essential to maintaining life. In Chinese religious tradition, balancing yin and yang is important to provide organization of life and prevent harm to body and spirit. Pronunciation Sh√©n (in rising 2nd tone) is the Modern Standard Chinese pronunciation of \\"god, deity; spirit, spiritual, supernatural; awareness, consciousness etc\\". Reconstructions of sh√©n in Middle Chinese (ca. 6th-10th centuries CE) include d≈∫'jƒõn (Bernhard Karlgren, substituting j for his \\"yod medial\\"), ≈∫i…™n (Zhou Fagao),  ëin (Edwin G. Pulleyblank, \\"Late Middle\\"), and zyin (William H. Baxter). Reconstructions of sh√©n in Old Chinese (ca. 6th-3rd centuries BCE) include *djƒõn (Karlgren), *zdjien (Zhou), *djin (Li Fanggui), *Ljin (Baxter), and *m-lin (Axel Schuessler). Although the etymological origin of shen is uncertain, Schuessler (2007:458) notes a possible Sino-Tibetan etymology; compare Chepang gli≈ãh \\"spirit of humans\\". The Chinese shen \\"spirit; etc.\\" is also in other East Asian languages. The Japanese Kanji is pronounced shin () or jin () in On'yomi (Chinese reading), and kami (), k≈ç (), or tamashii () in Kun'yomi (Japanese reading). The Korean Hanja is pronounced sin (). The Zihui dictionary notes that had a special pronunciation shƒìn (level 1st tone, instead of usual 2nd sh√©n) in the name Shen Shu , one of two \\"gods of the Eastern Sea\\", along with Yu Lu . In the Vietnamese language, it is pronounced as th·∫ßn. Semantics Shen's polysemous meanings developed diachronically over three millennia. The Hanyu dazidian, an authoritative historical dictionary, distinguishes one meaning for shƒìn (\\"Name of a deity ()) and eleven meanings for sh√©n translated below: # Celestial god(s)/spirit(s) of stories/legends, namely, the creator of the myriad things in heaven and earth and the supreme being. () # Spirit; mind, mental faculties; consciousness. Like: concentrated attention; tire the mind; concentrate one's energy and attention. () # Expression, demeanor; consciousness, state of mind. () # Portrait, portraiture. () # Magical, supernatural, miraculous; mysterious, abstruse. Like: ability to divine the unknown, amazing foresight; highly skilled doctor; genius, masterpiece. () # Esteem, respect; valuable, precious. () # Rule, govern, administer. () # Cautious, careful, circumspect. () # Display, arrange, exhibit. () # Dialect. 1. Dignity, distinction. () 2. Entrancement, ecstasy. () 3. Clever, intelligent. () # Surname, family name. () This dictionary entry for shen lists early usage examples, and many of these 11 meanings were well attested prior to the Han Dynasty. Chinese classic texts use shen in meanings 1 \\"spirit; god\\", 2 \\"spirit, mind; attention\\", 3 \\"expression; state of mind\\", 5 \\"supernatural\\", and meaning 6 \\"esteem\\". The earliest examples of meaning 4 \\"portrait\\" are in Song Dynasty texts. Meanings 7-9 first occur in early Chinese dictionaries; the Erya defines shen in meanings 7 \\"govern\\" and 8 \\"cautious\\" (and 6, which is attested elsewhere), and the Guangya defines meaning 9 \\"display\\". Meaning 10 gives three usages in Chinese dialects (technically \\"topolects\\", see Fangyan). Meaning 11 \\"a surname\\" is exemplified in Shennong (\\"Divine Farmer\\"), the culture hero and inventor of agriculture in Chinese mythology. The Chinese language has many compounds of shen. For instance, it is compounded with tian \\"sky; heaven; nature; god\\" in tianshen \\"celestial spirits; heavenly gods; deities; (Buddhism) deva\\", with shan \\"mountain\\" in shanshen \\"mountain spirit\\", and hua \\"speech; talk; saying; story\\" in shenhua \\"mythology; myth; fairy tale\\". Several shen \\"spirit; god\\" compounds use names for other supernatural beings, for example, ling \\"spirit; soul\\" in shenling \\"gods; spirits, various deities\\", qi \\"earth spirit\\" in shenqi \\"celestial and terrestrial spirits\\", xian \\"Xian (Taoism), transcendent\\" in shenxian \\"spirits and immortals; divine immortal\\", guai \\"spirit; devil; monster\\" in shenguai \\"spirits and demons; gods and spirits\\", and gui \\"ghost, goblin; demon, devil\\" in guishen \\"ghosts and spirits; supernatural beings\\". The earliest discovered character form for shen suggests two components. The right side of the character gives the basic meaning and pronunciation, as well as providing a graphic representation of flashing lightning from the clouds. This visual displays ancient people‚Äôs belief that lightning was the manifestation of god.1 The left side displays a modified character shi which pertains to ritual ceremonies, worship, or prayer. This concept originally referred to stone table used for offering ceremonial sacrifices to the gods. Wing-Tsit Chan distinguishes four philosophical meanings of this guishen: \\"spiritual beings\\", \\"ancestors\\", \\"gods and demons\\", and \\"positive and negative spiritual forces\\". The primary meaning of shen is translatable as English \\"spirit, spirits, Spirit, spiritual beings; celestial spirits; ancestral spirits\\" or \\"god, gods, God; deity, deities, supernatural beings\\", etc. Shen is sometimes loosely translated as \\"soul\\", but Chinese hun and po distinguishes hun \\"spiritual soul\\" and po \\"physical soul\\". Instead of struggling to translate shen , it can be transliterated as a loanword. The Oxford English Dictionary (2nd ed.) defines shen, \\"In Chinese philosophy: a god, person of supernatural power, or the spirit of a dead person.\\" In acupuncture, shen is a pure spiritual energy devoid of memory and personality traits, whereas hun is the spiritual energy associated with the personality and po the energy tied to the sustenance of the physical body. In this system, shen resides in the heart and departs first at death, hun resides in the liver and departs second, and po resides in the lungs and departs last.Reilly, Christopher, L.Ac., The Spirit of Acupuncture, Times-Union.com, posted Feb. 18, 2009, downloaded Dec. 1, 2014de Morant, G. S., Chinese Acupuncture, Paradigm Publications, 1994, pp. 87-88 Shen plays a central role in Christian translational disputes over Chinese terms for God. Among the early Chinese \\"god; God\\" names, shangdi or di was the Shang term, tian was the Zhou term, and shen was a later usage (see Feng Yu-Lan 1952:22‚Äì6, 30‚Äì1). Modern terms for \\"God\\" include shangdi, zhu , tianzhu (esp. Catholics), and shen (esp. Protestants). Graphics The character for shen exemplifies the most common class in Chinese character classification: x√≠ngshƒìngz√¨ \\"pictophonetic compounds, semantic-phonetic compounds\\", which combine a radical (or classifier) that roughly indicates meaning and a phonetic that roughly indicates pronunciation. In this case, combines the \\"altar/worship radical\\" or and a phonetic of shƒìn \\"9th Earthly Branch; extend, stretch; prolong, repeat\\". Compare this phonetic element differentiated with the \\"person radical\\" in shen \\"stretch\\", the \\"silk radical\\" in shen \\"official's sash\\", the \\"mouth radical\\" in shen \\"chant, drone\\", the \\"stone radical\\" in shen \\"arsenic\\", the \\"earth radical\\" in kun \\"soil\\", and the \\"big radical\\" in yan \\"cover\\". (See the List of Kangxi radicals.) Chinese shen \\"extend\\" was anciently a phonetic loan character for shen \\"spirit\\". The Mawangdui Silk Texts include two copies of the Dao De Jing and the \\"A Text\\" writes shen interchangeably as and : \\"If one oversees all under heaven in accord with the Way, demons have no spirit. It is not that the demons have no spirit, but that their spirits do not harm people.\\" (chap. 60, tr. Mair 1990:30). The Shuowen Jiezi defines shen as shen and says that in the 7th lunar month when yin forces increase, bodies shenshu \\"bind up\\". The earliest written forms of shen \\"spirit; god\\" occur in Zhou dynasty bronzeware script and Qin dynasty seal script characters (compare the variants shown on the \\"Chinese etymology\\" link below). Although has not been identified in Shang dynasty oracle bone script records, the phonetic shen has. Paleographers interpret the Oracle script of as a pictograph of a \\"lightning bolt\\". This was graphically differentiated between dian \\"lightning; electricity\\" with the \\"cloud radical\\" and shen with the \\"worship radical\\", semantically suggesting both \\"lightning\\" and \\"spirits\\" coming down from the heavens.

Description   Preparation  A solution containing antibody is added to a heated medium such as agar or agarose dissolved in buffered normal saline. The molten medium is then poured onto a microscope slide or into an open container, such as a Petri dish, and allowed to cool and form a gel. . A solution containing the antigen is then placed in a well that is punched into the gel. The slide or container is then covered or closed to prevent evaporation. . The antigen diffuses radially into the medium, forming a circle of precipitin that marks the boundary between the antibody and the antigen. The diameter of the circle increases with time as the antigen diffuses into the medium, reacts with the antibody, and forms insoluble precipitin complexes.(1) (2) . The antigen is quantitated by measuring the diameter of the precipitin circle and comparing it with the diameters of precipitin circles formed by known quantities or concentrations of the antigen. . Antigen-antibody complexes are small and soluble when in antigen excess. Therefore, precipitation near the center of the circle is usually less dense than it is near the circle's outer edge, where antigen is less concentrated. Expansion of the circle reaches an end point and stops when free antigen is depleted and when antigen and antibody reach equivalence. However, the clarity and density of the circle's outer edge may continue to increase after the circle stops expanding.  Interpretation  For most antigens, the area and the square of the diameter of the circle at the circle's end point are directly proportional to the quantity of antigen and are inversely proportional to the concentration of antibody. Therefore, a graph that compares the quantities or concentrations of antigen in the original samples with the areas or the squares of the diameters of the precipitin circles on linear scales will usually be a straight line when all circles have reached their end points (equivalence method). Circles that small quantities of antigen create reach their end points before circles that large quantities create. Therefore, if areas or diameters of circles are measured while some, but not all, circles have stopped expanding, such a graph will be straight in the portion that contains the smaller quantities or concentrations of antigen and will be curved in the portion that contains the larger quantities or concentrations. While circles are still expanding, a graph that compares the quantities or concentrations of the antigen on a logarithmic scale with the diameters or areas of the circles on a linear scale may be a straight line (kinetic method). . However, circles of the precipitate are smaller and less distinct during expansion than they are after expansion has ended. Further, temperature affects the rate of expansion, but does not affect the size of a circle at its end point. In addition, the range of circle diameters for the same quantities or concentrations of antigen is smaller while some circles are enlarging than they are after all circles have reached their end points. The quantity and concentration of insoluble antigen-antibody complexes at the outer edge of the circle increase with time. The clarity and density of the circle's outer edge therefore also increase with time. As a result, measurements of the sizes of circles and graphs produced from these measurements are often more accurate after circles have stopped expanding than they are when circles are still enlarging. For those reasons, it is often more desirable to take measurements after all circles have reached their end points than it is to take measurements while some or all circles are still enlarging. Measurements of large circles are more accurate than are those of small circles. It is therefore often desirable to adjust the concentration of antibody and the quantity of antigen to assure that precipitin rings will be large.

It was first broadcast on 13 January 1995. Synopsis The episode begins in the flat's kitchen, where Richie is at the stove cooking a sausage that is on fire as Eddie brings in the morning paper. They both are disappointed to learn that they didn't win the paper's \\"Spot the Ball\\" competition, and Richie mistakes Eddie's questions about breakfast for sexual innuendo (\\"How's your sausage?\\" \\"Maybe we should eat our flakes.\\" \\"Can I drink your juice?\\"). Eddie then goes to answer a knock at the front door, and is greeted by three boys dressed in devil costumes playing trick or treat. Eddie first believes he is hallucinating, then denies the boys any sweets because he believes it's a \\"set-up\\". The boys respond to Eddie's actions by ramming a toy trident into his crotch. Meanwhile, Richie concocts a drink to cure Eddie of his DT's. Eddie faints after consuming the drink through his nose, and manages to knock Richie out with the trident still rammed in his crotch. Realizing that it is Halloween, Richie forms a plan; he and Eddie will go trick-or- treating to raise money for a party which will feature, in Richie's words, \\"plenty of booze and jugged-up babes, shaggy-shaggy-shag!\\" They go down to the local costume shop, where Richie returns wearing a woman's devil outfit and Eddie ends up dressed up in a giant banana costume. To make sure that people give them money, Richie asks Eddie to bring along an electric cattle prod which they have somehow obtained; unfortunately, when Richie tries to use it, the electricity arcs back and causes Richie to soil himself, ruining one of his three pairs of tights. Later on, Richie and Eddie arrive at Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi Cul-de-Sac for further trick-or-treating. Eddie then spots the three boys that had speared him earlier in the episode, and Richie suggests that he and Eddie beat the boys up and take their sweets. However it's the young boys that beat up Richie and Eddie, and take 20 pence \\"from the incontinent girl\\" and five bottles of Malibu Rum \\"from the banana\\". Determined to press on, Richie knocks on the door of the next house they come to, which turns out to be owned by Eddie's friend Spudgun. When it turns out that he does not even know what trick-or-treating is, Richie orders Eddie to zap him with the cattle prod. Eddie misinterprets the request however and zaps Richie instead, causing Richie to soil himself again. After changing his tights for the second time, Richie takes the cattle prod and tries to zap Spudgun, only for the electricity to arc back on himself again, resulting in his final pair of tights being ruined. A humiliated Richie then changes his plan and tells Spudgun that he and Eddie are having a party that night, but everyone has to put in some money for drinks. Spudgun gives Eddie ¬£2.50, and Richie tells Spudgun to invite everyone he knows. While preparing for the party, Eddie creates a homebrew and batch of exploding carrots, and Richie creates snacks called Sprouts Mexicane from sprouts that are nearly a year out of date, a large amount of curry spices and gunpowder. Richie tries to prove that they are safe to eat, but passes out immediately after eating one, and awakes an hour and a half later, now (unknowingly) shooting flames out of his backside whenever he breaks wind. Spudgun arrives, but it turns out that Dave Hedgehog is the only person he knows apart from Richie and Eddie, and Richie's planned \\"shagathon\\" ends up reduced to the four sitting around and drinking Eddie's highly corrosive homebrew. While Eddie, Spudgun and Hedgehog do not mind this, Richie is sorely disappointed, and goes on a rant against God, claiming that he would be better off selling his soul to the Devil for a 25 year sex session. This gives him the idea to try and call up the Devil in a half- hearted Satanic ritual with the other three serving as his acolytes. Richie forces the others to eat his sprouts as an offering to the Devil, then does so himself, and they all pass out. The four wake up some time later (now all with flaming flatulence), and on the stroke of midnight hear a knocking noise from the front door. Richie answers it with some apprehension, and finds a teenage girl named Doreen wearing a Halloween Devil's mask, causing Richie to think that she is the Devil. He invites her in and asks for twenty-five years of non-stop sex in exchange for giving her his earthly soul. Richie tells everyone to \\"clench\\" after he farts fire again, then he tells Eddie to offer Doreen some of his blood to drink as it's \\"90 percent proof\\". Reacting to the increasingly strange situation, Doreen then removes her mask and reveals herself as Dave's daughter. She has been sent by her mother to find out why her father is out so late. Eddie cuts his wrist and blood starts rapidly shooting out, and Dave grabs a glass to get the devil's drink only to stop when he recognizes his daughter - and then asks her if she had any \\"tips for the 3:30 at Chepstow\\". Spudgun farts fire after he is allowed to \\"unclench\\" while a blood-soaked Eddie collapses into unconsciousness. Spudgun breaks wind again and the episode ends with the jet of flame from his rear end detonating the box of explosive carrots Eddie had prepared earlier.

They all become nervous when they find out the Devil drinks virgin's blood. However, in previous episodes, Eddie has mentioned that he has had sex with several girls (Ethel Cardew in \\"'S Up,\\" Lady Natasha in \\"Digger,\\" and two casual girlfriends, one of whom 'works in Sketchley's on a Saturday afternoon,' the other who lives in Chiswick, in \\"'S Out\\") and Hedgehog even has a daughter - who appears in this very episode when she is mistaken for the Devil. *When Richie is about to go and get his Ladybird Book of Witchcraft to construct a pentangle, the scene switches to Eddie, Spudgun, and Hedgehog. Eddie can clearly be seen holding his laughter in from a blooper from the previous scene. Editing errors After Richie and Eddie set off to go trick or treating, the shot cuts to a pan-down shot to the two men walking down the street. When it cuts to there, there is an awkward pause usually filled by the scene change music.

It is closely related to the silver lamprey (I. unicuspis) and may represent an ecotype of a single species with I. unicuspis. Description Northern brook lampreys are jawless fishes, also known as cyclostomes. Northern brook lamprey are considered non-parasitic lamprey. They have poorly developed teeth and a round, disc-like, subterminal mouth, called an oral-disc, for suction. Northern brook lampreys have a single dorsal fin that continues along their entire length until it connects with the caudal fin.http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/rsg/profile.html?action=elementDetail&selectedElement;=AFBAA01030# This dorsal fin can be notched as well. Their coloration is gray-brown dorsally with a light line down the back and an even lighter ventral side. The length of adult northern brook lampreys does not typically exceed 16 cm and the body is attenuate. While the ammocoetes look similar to the adult lampreys the ammocoetes have a hooded mouth instead of an oral-disc and no eyes. Geographic range Northern brook lampreys can be found in most of the Midwest and northeast regions of the United States. They inhabit the Mississippi drainage basin in Wisconsin and the Lake Erie tributary in New York.http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Ichthyomyzon_fossor/ They can be found in parts of Canada as well. Habitat The northern brook lampreys are found in various habitats throughout their lives. Ammocoetes start off their lives burrowed beneath fine sediment or organic matter in quiet waters while the adults live in sand or gravel in swift moving waters. They are typically found in the headwaters of streams that are moderately warm and clean.http://www.naturalheritage.state.pa.us/factsheets/11247.pdf Diet As larve (ammocoetes), the northern brook lamprey are filter feeders; feeding primarily on detritus, zooplankton, algae, diatoms, bacteria, pollen and a host of other microorganisms as they remain burrowed in fine substrate in calm waters. The juveniles and adults have non-functional intestines and do not feed; juveniles drift for 4‚Äì6 months and the adults spawn and die shortly after spawning. Reproduction and life cycle Spawning occurs around boulders and crevices of large rocks; 3-7 northern brook lamprey will build a nest together and then spawn in groups of 10-30. Once the eggs are fertilized they are often covered and left alone with no parental care given to the young, as the lamprey die soon after. Northern brook lampreys begin spawning at 6 years of age once they have reached sexual maturity. Spawning is triggered by the warming of the water in the spring. Males begin building nests and females lay between 1200Leach, W.J. 1940. Occurrence and life history of the northern brook lamprey, Ichthyomyzon fossor, in Indiana. Copeia, 1940: 21‚Äì34. and 1524 eggs to combat high mortality rates of young. Once the ammocoetes emerge from the eggs 2 weeks after fertilization, they spend the next 5‚Äì6 years feeding on algae and bacteria in burrows. They emerge in the fall as non-feeding juveniles after a 2-3 month metamorphosis and drift for 4‚Äì6 months until spawning begins. They then become sexually mature adults, partake in spawning and then die shortly thereafter. Conservation Northern brook lamprey populations are decreasing in the great lakes area and the great lakes drainage basin from lampricides, habitat degradation, and added stressors. A study of Pennsylvania streams found that two of the six species of lampreys normally found breeding in the streams were not there.Shan, Li, Karl-M. Werner, and Jr., Jay R. Stauffer. \\"An Examination Of Petromyzontidae In Pennsylvania: Current Distribution And Habitat Preference Of Lampreys.\\" Northeastern Naturalist 21.4 (2014): 606-618. EBSCO MegaFILE. Web. 21 Apr. 2016. One of the species not found was the northern brook lamprey. It is speculated that the main reason for population decline is due to the presence of sea lamprey and the lampricides used to be rid of them. In Minnesota, northern brook lampreys are considered a special concern species as they are believed to be declining due to lampricide use and habitat degradation. The lampricide treatments are used in response to the invasive species, sea lampreys, that are currently plaguing the great lake region. The increasing populations of sea lampreys and the increasing use of lampricides in response to sea lampreys has had negative impacts on most populations of lampreys, including the northern brook lamprey.

The island, and its surrounding waters, were classified as a \\"Zapovednik\\" (a \\"strict nature reserve\\") in 1976 and, as such, receive the highest level of protection and exclude practically all human activity other than for scientific purposes. The Chukotka Regional government extended the marine protected area out to in 1999. As of 2003, there were four rangers who reside on the island year-round, while a core group of about 12 scientists conduct research during the summer months. Geography Wrangel Island is about long from east to west and wide from north to south, with an area of . It is separated from the Siberian mainland by the Long Strait, and the island itself is a landmark separating the East Siberian Sea from the Chukchi Sea on the northern end. The distance to the closest point on the mainland is . The island's topography consists of a southern coastal plain that is on average wide; a wide east-west trending central belt of low-relief mountains, with the highest elevations at the Tsentral'nye Mountain Range; and a roughly wide northern coastal plain. The highest mountain on this island is Gora Sovetskaya with an elevation of above mean sea level, although mostly the mountains are a little over above mean sea level. The island's mountain ranges terminate at sea cliffs at either end of the island. Blossom Point is the westernmost point and Waring Point (Mys Uering) the easternmost point of the island. Despite the mountainous terrain and the high latitude, Wrangel Island is not glaciated. Wrangel Island belongs administratively to the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of the Russian Federation. The island has a weather station at Blossom Point and, formerly, two Chukchi fishing settlements on the southern side of the island (Ushakovskoye and Zvyozdny on the shore of Somnitelnaya Bay). Geology True colour MODIS photograph of Wrangel Island, taken in June 2001 Wrangel Island consists of folded, faulted, and metamorphosed volcanic, intrusive, and sedimentary rocks ranging in age from Upper Precambrian to Lower Mesozoic. The Precambrian rocks, which are about thick, consist of Upper Proterozoic sericite and chlorite slate and schist that contain minor amounts of metavolcanic rocks, metaconglomerates, and quartzite. These rocks are intruded by metamorphosed gabbro, diabase, and felsic dikes and sills and granite intrusions. Overlying the Precambrian strata are up to of Upper Silurian to Lower Carboniferous consisting of interbedded sandstone, siltstone, slate, argillite, some conglomerate and rare limestone and dolomite. These strata are overlain by up to of Carboniferous to Permian limestone, often composed largely of crinoid plates, that is interbedded with slate, argillite and locally minor amounts of thick breccia, sandstone, and chert. The uppermost stratum consists of of Triassic clayey quartzose turbidites interbedded with black slate and siltstone. A thin veneer of Cenozoic gravel, sand, clay and mud underlie the coastal plains of Wrangel Island. Late Neogene clay and gravel, which are only a few tens of meters thick, rest upon the eroded surface of the folded and faulted strata that compose Wrangel Island. Indurated Pliocene mud and gravel, which are only a few meters thick, overlie the Late Neogene sediments. Sandy Pleistocene sediments occur as fluvial sediments along rivers and streams and as a very thin and patchy surficial layer of either colluvium or eluvium.

During the summer it is visited by many types of birds. Arctic foxes also make their home on the island. Cetaceans such as bowhead whales, gray whales, and belugas can be seen close to shore. Woolly mammoths survived there until 2500‚Äì2000 BC, the most recent survival of all known mammoth populations. Isolated from the mainland for 6000 years, about 500 to 1000 mammoths lived on the island at a time. Domestic reindeer were introduced in the 1950s and their numbers are managed at around 1,000 in order to reduce their impact on nesting bird grounds. In 1975, the musk ox was also introduced. The population has grown from 20 to about 200 animals. In 2002, wolves were spotted on the island; wolves lived on the island in historical times.[whc.unesco.org/uploads/nominations/1023rev.pdf Natural System of Wrangel Island Reserve Chukotka, Russian Federation], United Nations Environment Program, World Conservation Monitoring Centre. March 2001; last updated March 2005. Accessed 30 July 2010. The flora includes 417 species of plants, double that of any other Arctic tundra territory of comparable size and more than any other Arctic island. For these reasons, the island was proclaimed the northernmost World Heritage Site in 2004. Climate Arctic tundra on Wrangel Island Wrangel Island has a severe polar climate (K√∂ppen ET). The region is blanketed by dry and cold Arctic air masses for most of the year. Warmer and more humid air can reach the island from the south-east during summer. Dry and heated air from Siberia comes to the island periodically. Wrangel Island is influenced by both the Arctic and Pacific air masses. One consequence is the predominance of high winds. The island is subjected to \\"cyclonic\\" episodes characterized by rapid circular winds. It is also an island of mists and fogs. Winters are prolonged and are characterized by steady frosty weather and high northerly winds. During this period, the temperatures usually stay well below freezing for months. In February and March there are frequent snow-storms with wind speeds of or above. There are noticeable differences in climate between the northern, central and southern parts of the island. The central and southern portions are warmer, with some of their valleys having semi-continental climates that support a number of sub-Arctic steppe-like meadow species. This area has been described as perhaps being a relict of the Ice Age Mammoth steppe, along with certain areas along the northwestern border between Mongolia and Russia. The short summers are cool but comparatively mild as the polar day generally keeps temperatures above . Some frosts and snowfalls occur, and fog is common. Warmer and drier weather is experienced in the center of the island because the interior's topography encourages foehn winds. As of 2003, the frost-free period on the island was very short, usually not more than 20 to 25 days, and more often only two weeks. Average relative humidity is about 83%. Waters on and around Wrangel According to a 2003 report prepared by the Wrangel Island Nature Preserve, the hydrographic network of Wrangel Island consists of approximately 1,400 rivers over in length; five rivers over long; and approximately 900 shallow lakes, mostly located in the northern portion of Wrangel Island, with a total surface area of . The waters of the East Siberian Sea and the Sea of Chukchi surrounding Wrangel and Herald Islands are classified as a separate chemical oceanographic region. These waters have among the lowest levels of salinity in the Arctic basin as well as a very high oxygen content and increased biogenic elements. History First human settlements and the extinction of the woolly mammoth This remote Arctic island is believed to have been the final place on Earth to support woolly mammoths as an isolated population until their extinction about 2000 BC, which makes them the most recent surviving population known to science. Initially, it was assumed that this was a specific dwarf variant of the species originating from Siberia. However, after further evaluation, these Wrangel island mammoths are no longer considered to have been dwarfs. The presence of modern humans using advanced hunting and survival skills probably hastened their demise on this frozen isle, which until recently was ice bound for most years with infrequent breaks of clear water in some Arctic summers. A mirror development can be found with the dwarf elephant on Malta, originating from the European species. Evidence for prehistoric human occupation was uncovered in 1975 at the Chertov Ovrag site. Various stone and ivory tools were found, including a toggling harpoon. Radiocarbon dating shows the human inhabitation roughly coeval with the last mammoths on the island c. 1700 BC. Though no direct evidence of mammoth hunting has been found, it remains a scientific hypothesis. The presence of mammoths on Wrangel Island more than 5000 years after their extinction on the mainland, is considered possible evidence that climate change was not the cause of the quaternary extinction event. This is a different scenario than the extinction of woolly mammoth on Saint Paul Island in modern-day Alaska. Many authors today argue that the most likely cause of extinction of the mammoth in the continents was excessive hunting. Research published in 2017 suggested that the mammoth population was experiencing a genetic meltdown in the DNA of the last animals, a difference when compared with examples about 40,000 years earlier, when populations were plentiful. These data bear the signature of genomic meltdown in small populations, consistent with nearly- neutral genome evolution. They furthermore suggest large numbers of detrimental variants collecting in pre-extinction genomes, a warning for continued efforts to protect current endangered species with small population sizes. Paleoeskimos established camps on the southern side of the island for marine hunters. By the time Wrangel Island was discovered by Europeans there was no aboriginal population. A legend prevalent among the Chukchi people of Siberia tells of a chief Krachai (or Kr√§choj, Krahay, Khrakhai), who fled with his people (the Krachaians or Krahays, also identified as the Onkilon or Omoki ‚Äì Siberian Yupik people) across the ice to settle in a northern land. Though the story may be mythical, the existence of an island or continent to the north was lent credence by the annual migration of reindeer across the ice, as well as the appearance of slate spear-points washed up on Arctic shores, made in a fashion unknown to the Chukchi. Retired University of Alaska, Fairbanks linguistics professor Michael E. Krauss has presented archaeological, historical, and linguistic evidence that Wrangel Island was a way station on a trade route linking the Inuit settlement at Point Hope, Alaska with the north Siberian coast, and that the coast may have been colonized in late prehistoric and early historic times by Inuit settlers from North America. Krauss suggests that the departure of these colonists was related to the Krachai legend.Krauss, Michael E. (2005) Eskimo languages in Asia, 1791 on, and the Wrangel Island-Point Hope connection √âtudes/Inuit/Studies, vol. 29 (1‚Äì2), 2005, pp 163‚Äì185. Outside discovery In 1764, the Cossack Sergeant Stepan Andreyev claimed to have sighted this island. Calling it Tikegen Land, Andreyev found evidence of its inhabitants, the Krahay. Eventually, the island was named after Baron Ferdinand von Wrangel, who, after reading Andreyev's report and hearing Chukchi stories of land at the island's coordinates, set off on an expedition (1820‚Äì1824) to discover the island, with no success.Von Wrangel, Ferdinand Petrovich (1840). Narrative of an expedition to the polar sea, in 1820, 1821, 1822 & 1823\\\\. Edited by Major Edward Sabine. James Madden and Company, London. 465 pp. British, American, and Russian expeditions In 1849, Henry Kellett, captain of HMS Herald, landed on and named Herald Island. He thought he saw another island to the west, which he called Plover Island; thereafter it was indicated on British admiralty charts as Kellett Land. Eduard Dallmann, a German whaler, reported in 1881 that he had landed on the island in 1866. Sketch of Wrangel Island as it appeared from the top of Herald Island, 1881 In August 1867, Thomas Long, an American whaling captain, \\"approached it as near as fifteen miles. I have named this northern land Wrangell [sic] Land ... as an appropriate tribute to the memory of a man who spent three consecutive years north of latitude 68¬∞, and demonstrated the problem of this open polar sea forty-five years ago, although others of much later date have endeavored to claim the merit of this discovery.\\" An account appeared in the Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1868 (17th Meeting, at Chicago), published in 1869, under the title \\"The New Arctic Continent, or Wrangell's Land, discovered 14 August 1867, by Captain Long, of the American Ship Nile, and seen by Captains Raynor, Bliven and others, with a brief Notice of Baron Wrangell's Exploration in 1823\\". Map of Wrangel Island produced by the USS Rodgers Survey, as reproduced in John Muir's Cruise of the Corwin George W. DeLong, commanding USS Jeannette, led an expedition in 1879 attempting to reach the North Pole, expecting to go by the \\"east side of Kellett land\\", which he thought extended far into the Arctic. His ship became locked in the polar ice pack and drifted westward, passing within sight of Wrangel before being crushed and sunk in the vicinity of the New Siberian Islands. A party from the USRC Corwin landed on Wrangel Island on 12 August 1881, claimed the island for the United States and named it \\"New Columbia\\".Muir, John, 1917, The Cruise of the Corwin: Journal of the Arctic Expedition of 1881 in search of De Long and the Jeannette. Norman S. Berg, Dunwoody, Georgia. (John Muir's description of the 1881 exploration of Wrangel Island.) The expedition, under the command of Calvin L. Hooper, was seeking the Jeannette and two missing whalers in addition to conducting general exploration. It included naturalist John Muir, who published the first description of Wrangel Island. In the same year on 23 August, the USS Rodgers, commanded by Lieutenant R. M. Berry during the second search for the Jeannette, landed a party on Wrangel Island that stayed about two weeks and conducted an extensive survey of the southern coast.George W. De Long, Raymond Lee Newcomb, Our Lost Explorers: The Narrative of the Jeannette Arctic Expedition. p. 60 In 1911, the Russian Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Expedition on icebreakers Vaygach and Taymyr under Boris Vilkitsky, landed on the island.Great Soviet Encyclopedia, entry on \\"–í–∞–π–≥–∞—á\\" In 1916 the Tsarist government declared that the island belonged to the Russian Empire. Stefansson expeditions In 1914, members of the Canadian Arctic Expedition, organized by Vilhjalmur Stefansson, were marooned on Wrangel Island for nine months after their ship, Karluk, was crushed in the ice pack.Niven, Jennifer, The Ice Master, The Doomed 1913 Voyage of the Karluk. Hyperion Books, New York, New York. 431 pp. The survivors were rescued by the American motorized fishing schooner King & WingeNewell, Gordon R., 1966, H.W. McCurdy Maritime History of the Pacific Northwest, Superior Publishing, Seattle, Washington, 242 pp. after Captain Robert Bartlett walked across the Chukchi Sea to Siberia to summon help. In 1921, Stefansson sent five settlers (the Canadian Allan Crawford, three Americans: Fred Maurer, Lorne Knight and Milton Galle, and I√±upiat seamstress and cook Ada Blackjack) to the island in a speculative attempt to claim it for Canada.Niven, Jennifer (2003). Ada Blackjack: A True Story Of Survival In The Arctic. Hyperion Books, New York, New York. 431 pp. The explorers were handpicked by Stefansson based upon their previous experience and academic credentials. Stefansson considered those with advanced knowledge in the fields of geography and science for this expedition. At the time, Stefansson claimed that his purpose was to head off a possible Japanese claim. An attempt to relieve this group in 1922 failed when the schooner Teddy Bear under Captain Joe Bernard became stuck in the ice. In 1923, the sole survivor of the Wrangel Island expedition, Ada Blackjack, was rescued by a ship that left another party of 13 (American Charles Wells and 12 Inuit). Wrangel Island Inuit inhabitants on board Krasnyy Oktyabr, 1924 In 1924, the Soviet Union removed the American and 13 Inuit (one was born on the island) of this settlement aboard the Krasny Oktyabr (Red October). Wells subsequently died of pneumonia in Vladivostok during a diplomatic American- Soviet row about an American boundary marker on the Siberian coast, and so did an Inuit child. The others were deported from Vladivostok to the Chinese border post Suifenhe, but the Chinese government did not want to accept them as the American consul in Harbin told them the Inuit were not American citizens. Later, the American government came up with a statement that the Inuit were 'wards' of the United States, but that there were no funds for returning them. Eventually, the American Red Cross came up with $1600 for their return. They subsequently moved through Dalian, Kobe and Seattle (where another Inuit child drowned during the wait for the return trip to Alaska) back to Nome.Kenney, Gerard \\"When Canada Invaded Russia\\" The Canadian Encyclopedia During the Soviet trip, the American reindeer owner Carl J. Lomen from Nome had taken over the possessions of Stefansson and had acquired explicit support (\\"go and hold it\\") from US Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes to claim the island for the United States,Dudley-Rowley, Marilyn (1998) \\"The Outward Course of Empire: The Hard, Cold Lessons from Euro-American Involvement in the Terrestrial Polar Regions\\" presented at the Founding Convention of the Mars Society, August 13‚Äì16, 1998, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, United States a goal about which the Russian expedition got to hear during their trip. Lomen dispatched the MS Herman, commanded by captain Louis L. Lane. Due to unfavorable ice conditions, the Herman could not get any further than Herald Island, where the American flag was raised. In 1926, the government of the Soviet Union reaffirmed the Tsarist claim to sovereignty over Wrangel Island. Soviet administration thumb thumb In 1926, a team of Soviet explorers, equipped with three years of supplies, landed on Wrangel Island. Clear waters that facilitated the 1926 landing were followed by years of continuous heavy ice surrounding the island. Attempts to reach the island by sea failed, and it was feared that the team would not survive their fourth winter.Berkeley Daily Gazette Jan 29, 1929 p. 4 \\"Wrangel Island holds the fate of lost colony\\" In 1929, the icebreaker Fyodor Litke was chosen for a rescue operation. It sailed from Sevastopol, commanded by captain Konstantin Dublitsky. On 4 July, it reached Vladivostok where all Black Sea sailors were replaced by local crew members. Ten days later Litke sailed north; it passed the Bering Strait, and tried to pass Long Strait and approach the island from south. On 8 August a scout plane reported impassable ice in the strait, and Litke turned north, heading to Herald Island. It failed to escape mounting ice; August 12 the captain shut down the engines to save coal and had to wait two weeks until the ice pressure eased. Making a few hundred meters a day, Litke reached the settlement August 28. On September 5, Litke turned back, taking all the 'islanders' to safety. This operation earned Litke the order of the Red Banner of Labour (January 20, 1930), as well as commemorative badges for the crew. According to a 1936 article in Time Magazine, Wrangel Island became the scene of a bizarre criminal story in the 1930s when it fell under the increasingly arbitrary rule of its appointed governor Konstantin Semenchuk. Semenchuk controlled the local populace and his own staff through open extortion and murder. He forbade the local Yupik Eskimos (recruited from Provideniya Bay in 1926) to hunt walrus, which put them in danger of starvation, while collecting food for himself. He was then implicated in the mysterious deaths of some of his opponents, including the local doctor. Allegedly, he ordered his subordinate, the sledge driver Stepan Startsev, to murder Dr. Nikolai Vulfson, who had attempted to stand up to Semenchuk, on 27 December 1934 (though there were also rumours that Startsev had fallen in love with Vulfson's wife, Dr. Gita Feldman, and killed him out of jealousy).John McCannon, Red Arctic: Polar Exploration and the Myth of the North in the Soviet Union, 1932-1939 (Oxford University Press US, 1998: ), p. 156-157. The subsequent trial in May‚ÄìJune 1936, at the Supreme Court of the RSFSR, sentenced Semenchuk and Startsev to death for \\"banditry\\" and violation of Soviet law, and \\"the most publicised result of the trial was the joy of the liberated Eskimos.\\".Anonymous, 1936, Crazy Governor. Time (magazine), vol. XXVI, no. 22, pp. ??-??. (June 1, 1936).Yuri Slezkine, Arctic Mirrors: Russia and the Small Peoples of the North (Cornell University Press, 1994: ), p. 288. This trial had the result of launching the career of the prosecutor, Andrey Vyshinsky, who called the two defendants \\"human waste\\" and who would soon achieve great notoriety in the Moscow Trials. In 1948, a small herd of domestic reindeer was introduced with the intention of establishing commercial herding to generate income for island residents. Aside from the main settlement of Ushakovskoye near Rogers Bay, on the south-central coast, in the 1960s a new settlement named Zvyozdny was established some to the west in the Somnitelnaya Bay area, where ground runways reserved for military aviation were constructed (these were abandoned in the 1970s). Moreover, a military radar installation was built on the southeast coast at Cape Hawaii. Rock crystal mining had been carried out for a number of years in the center of the island near Khrustalnyi Creek. At the time, a small settlement, Perkatkun, had been established nearby to house the miners, but later on it was completely destroyed. Establishment of Federal Nature Reserve Resolution #189 of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) was adopted on 23 March 1976, for the establishment of the state Nature Reserve \\"Wrangel Island\\" for the purpose of conserving the unique natural systems of Wrangel and Herald Islands and the surrounding waters out to five nautical miles. On 15 December 1997, the Russian Government's Decree No. 1623-r expanded the marine reserve out to 12 nautical miles. On 25 May 1999, the (regional) Governor of Chukotka issued Decree No. 91, which again expanded the protected water area to 24 nautical miles around Wrangel and Herald Islands. By the 1980s, the reindeer-herding farm on Wrangel had been abolished and the settlement of Zvezdnyi was virtually abandoned. Hunting had already been stopped, except for a small quota of marine mammals for the needs of the local population. In 1992, the military radar installation at Cape Hawaii (on the southeast coast) was closed, and only the settlement of Ushakovskoe remained occupied. Post-Soviet era According to some American activists, eight Arctic islands currently controlled by Russia, including Wrangel Island, are claimed by the United States. However, according to the United States Department of State*Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, 2003, Status of Wrangel and Other Arctic Islands. U.S. Department of State, Washington, D.C. (Fact sheet on Wrangel Island). no such claim exists.See also Brooks Jackson, \\"Alaskan Island Giveaway?\\", FactCheck.org, 27 March 2012 (accessed 28 July 2017); Carole Fader, \\"Fact Check: No Alaskan island giveaway to the Russians\\", The Florida Times-Union, 12 May 2012 (accessed 28 July 2017).

On 1 June 1990, US Secretary of State James Baker signed an executive agreement with Eduard Shevardnadze, the USSR foreign minister. It specified that even though the treaty had not been ratified, the U.S. and the USSR agreed to abide by the terms of the treaty beginning 15 June 1990. The Senate ratified the USSR‚ÄìUSA Maritime Boundary Agreement in 1991, which was then signed by President George Bush. In 2004, Wrangel Island and neighboring Herald Island, along with their surrounding waters, were added to UNESCO's World Heritage List. Russian naval base In 2014, the Russian Navy announced plans to establish a base on the island.; Itar/Tass Russian Pacific Fleet stations naval base on Wrangel Island The bases on Wrangel Island and on Cape Schmidt on Russia's Arctic coast reportedly consist of two sets of 34 prefabricated modules. In literature In Jules Verne's novel C√©sar Cascabel, the protagonists float past Wrangel Island on an iceberg. In Verne's description, a live volcano is located on the island: \\"Between the two capes on its southern coast, Cape Hawan and Cape Thomas, it is surmounted by a live volcano, which is marked on the recent maps.\\" In Chukchi author Yuri Rytkheu's historical novel A Dream in Polar Fog, set in the early 20th century, the Chukchi knew of Wrangel Island and referred to it as the \\"Invisible Land\\" or \\"Invisible Island\\".

It is named after Ferdinand Wrangel, a Baltic German explorer in Russian service, and government official. From 1867 to 1877 it was a U.S. military post; later it became an outfitting point for hunters and explorers, and for miners using the Stikine River route to the Yukon. The island contains the city of Wrangell, Alaska. Wrangell Island is heavily forested and contains an abundance of wildlife. The only other community is Thoms Place on the southwest side, across the Zimovia Strait from Etolin Island. Wrangell Island's total population was 2,401 at the 2000 census.

Sometimes trail use is regulated. Trail ethics deals with ethics as it applies to the use of trails. It is similar to both environmental ethics and human rights in that it deals with the shared interaction of humans and nature. There are multiple agencies and groups that support and encourage ethical behavior on trails. Trail ethics applies to the use of trails, by pedestrians, dog walkers, hikers, backpackers, mountain bikers, equestrians, hunters, and off-road vehicles.  Etiquette  Sometimes conflicts can develop between different types of users of a trail or pathway. Etiquette has developed to minimize such interference. Examples include: * When two groups meet on a steep trail, a custom has developed in some areas whereby the group moving uphill has the right-of-way. * Trail users generally avoid making loud sounds, such as shouting or loud conversation, playing music, or the use of mobile phones. However, in bear country, making noise is a safety precaution. * Trail users tend to avoid impacting on the land through which they travel. Users can avoid impact by staying on established trails, and durable surfaces, not picking plants, or disturbing wildlife, and carrying garbage out. The Leave No Trace movement offers a set of guidelines for low-impact hiking: \\"Leave nothing but footprints. Take nothing but photos. Kill nothing but time. Keep nothing but memories\\". * The feeding of wild animals is dangerous and can cause harm to both the animals and to other people. * Mountain bikers must yield to both hikers and riders on horses (equestrians), unless the trail is clearly designated and marked for bike-only travel.

He was a native of Scotland, and in December, 1730, he was commissioned as a naval officer of the port of New York by Governor John Montgomerie. From 1732 to 1739 he served as Sheriff of Albany, New York. By patents dated from 1736 to 1741, Lindesay acquired about 20,000 acres (80 km¬≤) of public land throughout the Province of New York. In 1740, he moved to his land at present-day Cherry Valley with his wife, her father Lieutenant Congreve, and their servants. He named the place Lindesay's Bush. Being inexperienced at farming, and with the French and Indian War at hand, Lindesay returned to the military and in 1744 was sent as a reinforcement to Fort Oswego on the western frontier. He was in Schenectady, New York in the winter of 1746-47.

This film biopic is about the true experiences of Marine hero Pfc. Guy Gabaldon (played by Hunter), a Los Angeles Hispanic boy raised in the 1930s by a Japanese American foster family, and his heroic actions during the Battle of Saipan. Sessue Hayakawa played the role of Japanese commander at Saipan. Plot In Depression-era Los Angeles, Guy Gabaldon gets into a fight at school when another boy snitches about his breaking into a grocery store. After Japanese-American Kaz Uni (the brother of Guy's physical education teacher and friend George) learns that Guy's mother is in the hospital and his father is dead, he invites Guy to stay with his family. As Kaz's parents speak little English, Guy begins to learn Japanese. Then, when Guy's mother dies, the Unis adopt him. He becomes especially close to Kaz's mother. After the attack on Pearl Harbor and the US entry into World War II, Gabaldon's foster family is sent to an internment camp: Camp Manzanar. Gabaldon is drafted, but fails his physical exam due to a perforated eardrum. When Gabaldon goes to visit the Unis, he learns that George and Kaz have been allowed to join the Army and are fighting in Italy with the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. After making sure that \\"mama-san\\" does not object, he manages to enlist in the Marines on the strength of his language skills. Gabaldon does not make a good first impression on Platoon Sgt. Bill Hazen at Camp Pendleton, but wins him over. When they are shipped to Hawaii to join the Regimental Intelligence section of the 2nd Marines, 2nd Marine Division, he gets himself, Hazen and Cpl. Pete Lewis bottles of whiskey and dates with two Japanese-American women and standoffish reporter Sheila Lincoln. Sheila is disgusted by the behavior of the rowdy Marines, but eventually warms up to Gabaldon after a few drinks. Going ashore on Saipan, he freezes at first when he comes under fire for the first time, but regains his composure. He uses his Japanese language skills to persuade Japanese soldiers to surrender. In fighting against a banzai charge, Lewis is killed, and later during the bloody campaign for the island, Hazen is shot in the leg and then killed by a Japanese swordsman. Gabaldon then gets mad, stops talking Japanese soldiers into surrender and starts killing them ruthlessly. After he sees two civilians kill themselves rather than surrender, he remembers George and \\"mama-san\\" and changes back to the way he was. During the final battle, he convinces the Japanese general to order approximately 1000 Japanese soldiers and 500 civilians to surrender.

Previously, it had been featured on the TV show This Is Your Life. Phil Karlson called it \\"one of the most important pictures that I may ever make because it was the true story of the Nisei, what happened in this country. But Allied Artists, even at that point, looked at it as a great war story that you could make for a price. They had no idea what I was doing.\\"Todd McCarthy and Richard Thompson. ‚ÄúPhil Karlson: Interview, November 19, 1973‚Äù Kings of the Bs; Working Within the Hollywood System, eds. Todd McCarthy and Charles Flynn (New York: E.P. Dutton, 1975), pp. 327-345. Rpt. Cine Resort, Oct. 7 2014 The film was shot on location in Okinawa.  DVD release  The DVD of the film was released on June 5, 2007 in the United States.  Novelization  A worthwhile novelization of the screenplay was written by American writer Edward S. Aarons (1916-1975), published in a mass market, tie-in paperback edition (first printing cover price 25¬¢) under the Gold Medal Books imprint, with 1960 copyright assigned to Fawcett Publications. The book's presentation falls under the category of \\"implied novelization,\\" as there is no attribution anywhere to the screenplay, the screenstory or their respective authors, and the front cover action illustration of two soldiers only suggests star Jeffrey Hunter in the foreground; however the back cover contains, along with brief descriptive info, a romantic still from the movie and a blurb about the film, naming the studio, the production company and the stars. Even these indicia were removed, however, with the release of a second printing, probably a year or two later. Save for the uptick in price (40¬¢), the front cover illustration is identical, but the back cover is white, displaying only the brief descriptive info and the symbol of the U.S. Marine Corps. Implications of the film as source material were no doubt obliterated from the book to make the most out of the by-line, as Aarons was one of Gold Medal's most popular (and prolific) authors, and would remain so until the end of his career. (Aarons is best known for his prolific \\"Assignment\\" espionage series, featuring agent Sam Durell.)

Virtual zoos are basically websites that are created to simulate a visit to a zoo, and the visitors to these sites can view exhibits about animals and their habitats. Many Zoos as well as schools have developed virtual zoos. For example, instead of actual animals a virtual zoo will have articles and photos as exhibits. There are many virtual zoos that have been created; most are small and unremarkable, while some have hundreds of exhibits. Many of these projects focus on photos of animals or the sale of animal products. Some virtual zoos are strictly educational. Zoos on the web are good sources of animal information. History The first virtual zoo was created in 1994 by Ken Boschert, DVM. Boschert created his site as a way of informing people about animals and how to care for them. His site has been recognized by Education World and \\"Web 100\\". In 2017, Hari Kunduru founded Zoptiks, a modern virtual zoo. Where you can find zoologist backed information about animals and dinosaurs as well as explore them via augmented reality. Similarily, Zoptiks is a zoo directory where you can find zoos, aquariums, wildlife sanctuaries and other zoological organizations around the world. Purpose The validity of virtual zoos have met with some resistance. However, many view virtual zoos as the way of the future for conservation. Zoos have faced ethical issues surrounding the capture and keeping of wild animals. Virtual zoos can provide information and experience without any disturbance to habits or ecosystems. According to Zoos Victoria, the stated purpose of a zoo is to be centers for wildlife experience, education, conservation and research. Virtual Zoos can contribute to these stated purposes, such as education and research, with little impact to animal life.

In 1992, Bruton was awarded the Department of Defense Distinguished Civilian Service Award, the highest Department of Defense award given to civilians requiring the approval of the Secretary of Defense.Andrews, BF, The Ogden C. Bruton Award, American Academy of Pediatrics Website, accessed February 18, 2009 His papers are held at the National Library of Medicine. Discovery of Bruton‚Äôs Agammaglobulinemia While at Walter Reed during his second tour, Bruton studied an 8-year-old boy, Joseph S. Holtoner, Jr., who had recurrent pneumonia infections and who lacked gamma globulin in his serum. This type of agammaglobulinemia is now called Bruton's syndrome or X-linked agammaglobulinemia, which was later found by others to be an X-linked congenital condition. The gene defect has since been mapped to the gene code for Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk), at band Xq21.3.Terry Chin, Emedicine article on Bruton Agammaglobulinemia Bruton wrote to medical schools in the United States of America that had a pediatric service to ask if they had any such patients with agammaglobulinemia. His findings were published in June 1952 in the journal \\"Pediatrics\\". Bruton was also the first physician to provide specific immunotherapy for this X-linked disorder by administering intramuscular injections of IgG immunoglobulin. Time magazine featured Bruton and his medical discovery in the May 18, 1953 issue. There is also a milder form of X-linked congenital Swiss-type agammaglobunemia referred to as Bruton- Gitlin syndrome. It is characterized by decreased amounts of humoral gammaglobulin in serum, with cellular functional deficiencies as well. There is also a defect in the Btk gene in this condition. The Ogden C.

She was one of the most popular Mexican vedettes during the 1970s and 1980s, a popular sex symbol, and one of the main stars of Ficheras cinema.  Early years  Born in Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico, she is the granddaughter of a Chinese immigrant. During her childhood, Liliana helped with household expenses by selling souvenirs to tourists. Eventually she worked as a waitress in a restaurant. There, she met her first husband, a Mexican sailor, with whom she settled in Mexico City. After five years of marriage and the birth of their two daughters, Liliana separated from her husband alleging physical violence and sexual abuse.  Career Back in Acapulco, Liliana began to work in the cabaret \\"El Zorro\\", as a dancer. Eventually she worked at the Tropicana cabaret in Acapulco, where she alternated with the popular Mexican comedian Germ√°n Vald√©s \\"Tin Tan\\". After her successful season with Tin Tan, Liliana traveled to Mexico City, where television presenter Raul Velasco hired her as a dancer in the program Siempre en Domingo. There, she joined the program's ballet, headed by the popular vedette Olga Breeskin. On the TV show, Liliana learned, with a professional instructor, to dance tribal, Hawaiian, and Tahitian dances. In 1970, Liliana was hired by the businessman Enrique Lombardini, who at that time managed the Teatro Esperanza Iris. However, the young dancer was not prepared for the kind of burlesque shows that were taking place in the city theater. According to Lyn May, the first day she stepped on the stage of the Teatro Iris, she was heavily booed by attendees, who, accustomed to the artistic nudes of vedettes like Gloriella and Cleopatra, protested the musical number of the young aspirant to vedette. After battling for a week at the Teatro Iris, Liliana performed her first nude, causing a furor among the male audience. Lombardini bestowed on her the pseudonym \\"Lyn May: The Goddess of Love.\\" As a vedette, Lyn May included singing in her shows in nightclubs and cabarets. She had a long stay at the Teatro Blanquita in Mexico City. In 1975, filmmaker Alberto Isaac chose Lyn as one of the main protagonists of the famous film T√≠voli, which portrays with nostalgia the nocturnal atmosphere of Mexico City in the 1940s and 1950s. With the success of the film, Lyn became fully incorporated into Mexican Cinema, particularly the genre known as Ficheras film of the 1970s and 1980s. But in the late 1980s, this film genre declined in popularity, forcing May to retire from the stage. In 1991, she participated in the telenovela Yo no creo en los hombres, produced by Televisa. In 1998, May's career resurfaced after participating in the music video of the song Mr. P. Mosh by Mexican rock band Plastilina Mosh. She also began to appear frequently as a guest on the Univision television show El Gordo y La Flaca. In 2016 also appeared in a music video of the song Si tu me quisieras, of the Chilean singer Mon Laferte. She currently works as a Tahitian dance instructor at the Plaza Caribe Hotel in Cancun, Mexico and gives performances on weekends in the bar of the same establishment. In 2016, Lyn was featured in the documentary film Beauties of the Night, by the filmmaker Mar√≠a Jos√© Cuevas, along with other vedettes like Olga Breeskin, Rossy Mendoza, Wanda Seux and Princesa Yamal. Personal life During the peak of her career, she was involved with important politicians and business leaders. May has said she had an affair with a former President of Mexico, but did not name him. The President is speculated to be Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo, who also had an affair with, and later married actress Sasha Montenegro. May had a ten-year relationship with film producer Guillermo Calder√≥n. Shortly after ending things with Calder√≥n, May married businessman Antonio Chi Su. The couple opened a Chinese restaurant on Avenida Bucareli in Mexico City. Chi Su was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2004 and died in 2008. Plastic surgery Various media outlets made a point of the significant changes May's facial features underwent through her career. May has said that she received shots of what she later learned was baby oil from a woman who claimed it would help her keep a youthful appearance. No negative side effects were felt in the short term, but the procedure eventually resulted in serious abscess in her face. May had to go through multiple surgeries to remove the foreign material. At one point, she contemplated suicide as a result of the physical pain and what she felt were excessive tabloids on her condition.

The angle of climb can be defined as the angle between a horizontal plane representing the Earth's surface and the actual flight path followed by the aircraft during its ascent. The speed of an aircraft type at which the angle of climb is largest is called VX. It is always slower than VY, the speed for the best rate of climb. As the latter gives the quickest way for gaining altitude levels, regardless of the distance covered during such a maneuver, it is more relevant to cruising. The maximum angle of climb on the other hand is where the aircraft gains the most altitude in a given distance, regardless of the time needed for the maneuver. This is important for clearing an obstacle, and therefore is the speed a pilot uses when executing a \\"short field\\" takeoff. VX increases with altitude and VY decreases with altitude until they converge at the airplane's absolute ceiling. Best angle of climb (BAOC) airspeed for an airplane is the speed at which the maximum excess thrust is available. Excess thrust is the difference between the total drag of the aircraft, and the thrust output of the powerplant. For a jet aircraft, this speed is very close to the speed at which the total minimum drag occurs.  See also  * Rate of climb.

The two-day weekend event, held on September 5‚Äì6, 2003, was billed as \\"SilkROAD2003: An Experience in Chinese Theater\\", led by one of the most popular modern Chinese opera stars, Li Baochun ‚Äî son of one of the most acclaimed Chinese opera legends, Li Shaochun, and received a near sellout audience of over 5,000 plus at Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Hall. The production received a favorable review by New York Times acclaimed opera critic James R. Oestreich. Prior to the event, an average Chinese opera performance in North America did not exceed no more than 800 attendees per performance. SilkROAD2003 was co-produced by one of Liao's companies, Hydra Ventures, along with a family friend, Taiwan's billionaire tycoon Koo Chen-fu, and his non-profit foundation, called the Koo Foundation. For Liao's \\"important contributions he has made to the cultural life of New York City,\\" as quoted by City Coucilman John Liu, the New York City Council offered to present Liao with a Proclamation. Liao declined to personally receive this honor and requested instead that the New York City government present the Proclamation to all of his colleagues at Hydra Ventures. In January 2004, Liao was also involved in a musical production with the world renown cellist, Yo-Yo Ma, Silk Road Project, and Peabody Essex Museum in the presentation of \\"Creative Exchanges: Sights and Sounds of the Silk Road,\\" a series of innovative performance, educational and cultural activities at PEM's newly transformed museum of art and culture. Additionally, Liao sponsored a popular Chinese opera artist, Wu Hsing-Kuo, to perform the role of the Ying-Yang Master alongside the opera legend, Pl√°cido Domingo, in the 2006 international premier of \\"The First Emperor\\" opera production at the famed Lincoln Center Metropolitan Opera House. The First Emperor's production team included China's leading film director, Zhang Yimou, and Academy Award composer, Tan Dun. Controversy In November 2006, just prior to the fallout of the 2007-2008 Wall Street financial crisis and the global economic meltdown, Liao authorized one of his companies, which was managing his mother-in-law's real estate portfolio to utilize a portion of such assets to meet the company's operating expenses, payroll and holiday bonus commitments for employees. A family scandal ensued as a result of this misappropriation of funds. This led to a complaint being filed to the District Attorney's office and was followed by a government investigation of this one company. An out-of-court agreement was eventually reached between all parties involved. In the meantime, after nearly three years of investigation and negotiation, the government refused to dismiss its case against Liao. The District Attorney's office leveraged this family scandal as an opportunity to lead a public crusade to clean up Wall Street's management irregularities by corporate executives. As a result of intense media coverage in the United States and China, and an opportunity to garner publicity for the government, the District Attorney was able to successfully force an unusually lengthy and severe plea agreement in the matter of People v. Liao - by arguing that \\"although a family matter, notwithstanding, no act is justifiable when an offense in law was committed.\\" Family history Liao's grandfather, Liao Zhong-Mai (1912‚Äì1975), who was educated in Japan and a sugarcane tycoon, became one of the first legislators in China to be elected without the backing of the Communist Party or the Nationalist Party, a position he held for a record six consecutive legislative terms. Considered the patriarch of the Liao clan in southern China, including Hong Kong and Taiwan, he was lionized as a daring independent politician and a revolutionary political voice during China's various experimental phases with grassroots democracy in the turbulent era of the 1940s through 1960s. Liao is a descendant of a direct line of ancestry from the Zhang-Zhou Prefecture in Fujian Province. The official record placed a man bearing a surname, Zhang, as the first generation of this lineage. Record shows that on or about the 1360s (the period between the Yuan Dynasty, 1271‚Äì1368, and the Ming Dynasty, 1368‚Äì1644), Zhang Yuan-Zi, a scholar from a family of limited means, was solicited (married into the family) to become the husband to the only daughter of a wealthy Liao family. The couple only gave birth to one son. Soon after, an agreement was struck between the two families, Zhang and Liao, that all future generations to follow must \\"live on earth as Liao, and rest in eternity as Zhang.\\" This pact, in effect, was meant to preserve the legacy of the Liao family, while never forget the hereditary origin of the founding Zhang patriarch. Liao is the 21st generation of the Zhang-Liao lineage. Just like all of his forefathers, he will one day revert to the full name of \\"Zhang Shixiang\\" or \\"Shih-Siang Shawn Zhang.\\" Trivia * Liao played NCAA Division I collegiate basketball during the same period that the more high profiled China national basketball team member, Ma Jian, played for the University of Utah from 1993-1995. At the time, Ma was projected to be the first Chinese basketball player to enter the NBA (he was cut by the Los Angeles Clippers in 1995). Both players were the only Asians playing NCAA Division I collegiate basketball in the early 1990s. Ma and Liao were considered pioneers who cleared the way for other players from China to enter the NBA, such as Wang Zhizhi, Yao Ming, and Mengke Bateer.

From 1860 to 1861 he was a representative of the Victoria District in the House of Assembly of the Colony of Vancouver Island. He was also the first colonial Superintendent of Education from 1865 to 1867 and was an advocate of free public education. Waddington is also remembered for planning the ill-fated Waddington's Road at Bute Inlet. The road was intended to be a shorter route to the Cariboo Gold Rush goldfields and was intended to run from the Pacific Coast via Bute Inlet to Fort Alexandria, but instead resulted in the tragedy of the Chilcotin War. Early years Alfred Waddington completed his early education in England, attended a school in Paris and then attended the University of G√∂ttingen in Germany. In 1850, he moved to California and joined a partnership of wholesale grocers. In 1858, Waddington moved north to Victoria, British Columbia. Although the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush was in full swing, Waddington was not interested in gold seeking. Instead, he wanted to encourage settlement in the colony and wrote Fraser Mines Vindicated, the first book ever published in the Colony of Vancouver Island that was not from a government source.The Homeroom: Alfred Waddington In 1860, he was elected to the House of Assembly on a platform of religious equality, women's rights and small government. In 1861, he resigned from the House and in 1862, he helped draft the charter of the City of Victoria, but declined a nomination to be its first mayor. Waddington's Road In 1862, Waddington began lobbying the press and his political allies for support for a wagon road from Bute Inlet to Fort Alexandria where it would connect to the Cariboo Road and continue on to the goldfields at Barkerville. He received approval for the construction early in 1863.Alfred Penderell Waddington In spring 1864, when members of the Tsilhqot'in (Chilcotin) First Nations learned of the plans to build the road through the Homathko River Valley, they feared both infringement on their territory and the increased threat of smallpox, an epidemic that had already killed many of their people. Eight Tsilhqot'in men, led by Klatsassin, attacked one of Waddington's work camps, killing fourteen road construction workers. Waddington's Road was never completed because of the war, but was examined in later years as one of the main possible routings for the mainline of the Canadian Pacific Railway. However, the railway chose Burrard Inlet, which as a result became today's Vancouver. Superintendent of Education In 1865, Alfred Waddington was appointed Superintendent of Education for the colony Vancouver Island, but when the Island was annexed into British Columbia in 1866, the Board of Education no longer had any authority. He also served two terms as a member of the Vancouver Island Assembly. Waddington resigned in 1867 and the rest of the Board decided to close all of the schools on Vancouver Island. By 1868, all of the Board members had resigned to protest against the new government's attitudes towards free public schools. Meanwhile, Waddington had never forgotten his Bute Inlet route and began campaigning (against Walter Moberly) for a transcontinental railway to be built along that route, selling his rights to the federal government in 1871. He was in Ottawa lobbying for this very purpose when he died of smallpox on February 26, 1872.

The story is about a love affair and the journey of a foreign correspondent set during the final years of Ferdinand Marcos' presidency in the Philippines, from the assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr. in 1983 to the People Power Revolution in 1986, as well as other key events that led to the ouster of Marcos. The film stars Gary Busey as American news correspondent Tony O'Neill, and Rebecca Gilling as his estranged journalist wife Angie. It also stars Tessie Tomas as Imelda Marcos and Laurice Guillen as Corazon Aquino, whose performances received critical acclaim. It was shot on location in Manila, Philippines, Colombo, Sri Lanka and Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne in Australia. Plot After being informed by Fabian Ver of Senator Ninoy Aquino's arrival, Imelda Marcos tells her husband Ferdinand about her warning to Ninoy about not returning to the Philippines due to dangers to his life. American news correspondent and journalist Tony O'Neill, who has just been flown to the Philippines, is driving with his cameraman and technical operator Ramon to Manila International Airport to cover the arrival of Senator Aquino from the United States. At a nearby hotel, Rolando Galman is handed a Philippine Airlines maintenance engineer's uniform by colleagues before they leave. Inside the airport's two-year old modern terminal, he and other journalists witness the arrival of the aircraft, a China Airlines Boeing 767 and enter the airbridge to await the senator's entry. Seconds later, Ninoy is shot along with Galman and several other gunshots force Tony and the other journalists to leave the scene as Ninoy's body is loaded to a van. Fleeing to the arrival concourse, O'Neill asks Ramon if he filmed the entire incident, wherein the latter only responds that he failed to do so as everything \\"happened too fast\\". Meanwhile in Boston, a telephone call awakens Corazon Aquino. The caller tells of her husband's death and asks her to confirm it to which she states that she never received such news. She and her family fly home from the United States and during the wake of Ninoy, she tells her two daughters that they shall vow to avenge his death and identify the perpetrators. The day after the assassination, Marcos and Olivas preside over the initial investigation of Aquino's assassination. After answering the questions of the journalists, Marcos condemns the previous day's incident and warns everyone not to make any dangerous assumptions. O'Neill covers Aquino's funeral and calls it as \\"larger than that of Gandhi's\\". At a phone call in his residence, he asks his superior Alex to allow him to stay longer in Manila due to the recent events, to which Alex agrees. Cast Fictional characters *Gary Busey as Tony O'Neil, an American television journalist and news correspondent who is sent to Manila to cover Ninoy Aquino's return and chooses to stay longer after finding himself in the midst of a revolution against Marcos and decides to cover it for the news. *Rebecca Gilling as Angie Fox, the estranged wife of Tony O'Neill. Prior to the ending, during the Malaca√±ang Palace riot scene, she and Tony reconcile and later return to the United States. *James Handy as Mike Heseltine *Roy Alvarez as Col. \\"Tiger\\" Tecson, a fictional colonel who is the colleague of Lt. Col. Kapunan and Col. Honasan. In real life, Alvarez has a physical resemblance to Col. Gringo Honasan and due to this, he was supposed to play him in the film but the producers felt he was better suited as Angie's love interest. *Guy Stone as Peter *Alexander Cortez as Raoul *Jaime Fabregas as Ben Balamo, a Manila newspaper company owner who makes articles on what is going on after the Aquino assassination. He befriends Tony in the film after their meeting during a press conference with Marcos on Aquino's assassination in Malacanang.

She later joins the New People's Army but later leaves. She is then abducted from Tony's home and killed by one of Marcos' henchmen; her corpse is then dumped in Tondo's Smokey Mountain site. After Tony finds her body, he works to find ways to reconcile with his wife Rebecca. Though uncredited in the film, her performance was highly praised by Philippine media. *Spanky Manikan as Ramon, Tony's Filipino cameraman, assistant, and friend *Grace Parr as New York Times secretary *Arthur Sherman as Alex, the president and chief broadcaster of the news company Tony works for. *Betty Mae Piccio as a computer operator Historical figures *Ruben Rustia as President Ferdinand Marcos, the sitting Philippine president in the film's setting. Despite some of his attitudes in the film are similar to the real Marcos, his healthy living is the only inaccuracy in his portrayal although he is depicted in early stages of ailing health. The real Ferdinand Marcos was in a critical state of deteriorating health in real life. *Laurice Guillen as Corazon Aquino, the widow of Benigno Aquino Jr. who later becomes the president in the film's few minutes to ending. Despite Guillen's portrayal of Aquino being praised by Philippine media, it was also heavily criticized due to the inaccurate design of her prosthetic nose makeup. The real Corazon Aquino is shown in archival footage addressing the US Congress in the final scene. *Tessie Tomas as First Lady Imelda Marcos *Cris Vertido as Salvador \\"Doy\\" Laurel *Robert Talabis as Joker Arroyo *Mervyn Samson as Gen.

An uncredited actor plays him during the assassination scene Production Production credits *Robert Markowitz - director *Brian May - composer *James Bartle - cinematographer Controversy Although the film was shot on location in the Philippines, some scenes were shot in Sri Lanka, mostly due to political and legal pressures from Juan Ponce Enrile who also appreciated the film but did not like the way he was represented (albeit as a fictional version as portrayed by Joonee Gamboa). Other reasons were that the producers had experienced similar conflicts when filming a similar film, The Year of Living Dangerously in 1981 in Manila. Some scenes were shot in Australia. The scene of the late Butz Aquino calling from Camp Crame was shot in Sydney.

Critical response Manila Standard columnist Emil P. Jurado disparaged A Dangerous Life, calling it an \\"insult to the Filipino people... and to the heroes of EDSA in particular\\" for its poor acting, conspicuously Sri Lankan extras, and treatment of foreigners as the main heroes. Jurado, however, noted \\"flashes of brilliance\\" from the performances of Laurice Guillen and Tessie Tomas as Corazon Aquino and Imelda Marcos respectively.

He was a pupil of Bishop Gozbald, who died on 20 September 855; Arn was elected bishop in his place.AF, 855 (p. 37 and n1). Arn was a warrior-prelate, recorded fighting against almost every external foe of the Germans at one point in his career or another. In his first year in office, the cathedral of W√ºrzburg was destroyed by lightning and Arn had to rebuild it. He was an active participator in the East Frankish government of Louis the German (who appointed him), Charles the Fat, and Arnulf of Carinthia. In 871, Louis the German held an assembly at Frankfurt and from there sent Arn and Ruodolt, Margrave of the Nordgau, to defend the border between the Duchy of Bavaria and Great Moravia because he had heard that the Moravians were planning an invasion. The Moravians had constructed a very large, circular wall to force the Germans through a very narrow opening and thus cut them off from fleeing. Arn, however, aware of the trap, caught a Moravian army leading back a Bohemian bride offguard and forced it into the trap.AF, 871 (p. 66&67). The Moravian were forced to abandon their horses and flee on foot. In 872, however, he assisted Carloman of Bavaria against Svatopluk of Moravia and was defeated.AF, 872 (p. 68). In 884, Arn and Henry of Franconia led the forces of all East Francia against a Viking army invading Saxony and were victorious.AF(M), 884 (p. 95). In 892, Arn, on the advice of Poppo, Duke of Thuringia, had undertaken an expedition against the Wends and was killed, either during a mass on the Chemnitz near Frankenburg or, after withdrawing to Sandberg (perhaps Wiederau or Taurastein), in a decisive battle with the Slavs.Reuter, 124 n9. Some sources make him murdered after the battle was lost. Poppo was deposed from his office for his poor counsel and Arn was replaced by Rudolf, a member of the Conradine family. He is buried in St- Aegidien in Colditz and was immediately reckoned a martyr. He was finally canonised in the 18th century. Around 1250, a chapel was built in his honour at Mittweida.

He was the interim men's head basketball coach at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). Early life and college career After graduating from Putnam City High School in Warr Acres, Oklahoma in 1976, Johnson attended East Central Oklahoma State University. At East Central Oklahoma State, Johnson was basketball co-captain in his senior season. Johnson graduated from East Central Oklahoma with a B.A. in education in 1981. He then earned an M.A. from Henderson State University in 1982. Coaching career Assistant coach and junior college head coach After earning his master's degree, Johnson began his coaching career in 1982 at East Central Oklahoma State and coached there for three seasons. In 1985, Johnson worked his first head coaching position at Northern Oklahoma Junior College and coached there for two seasons. In 1987, Johnson became head coach at Seminole Junior College, also in Oklahoma. In his three seasons coaching Seminole, Johnson led Seminole to the 1988 state championship and 1989 Bi-State Conference championship. Johnson moved to the NCAA ranks in the 1990‚Äì91 season as an assistant under J. D. Barnett at Tulsa. The following season, Johnson began what would be several stints as an assistant coach under Tim Floyd at New Orleans. In Johnson's second season as assistant, New Orleans qualified for the 1993 NCAA Tournament and finished the season ranked #17 in the AP Poll and first in the Sun Belt Conference.https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/new- orleans/1993-schedule.html Johnson then became an assistant at Arizona under Lute Olson for five seasons from 1993 to 1998, including the 1997 national championship team. In every season with Johnson as assistant, Arizona was ranked in the year-end AP Polls.https://www.sports- reference.com/cbb/coaches/lute-olson-1.html First stint at San Jose State In 1998, Johnson began one of two stints as San Jose State head coach. San Jose State improved from 3‚Äì23 in the 1997‚Äì98 season to 12‚Äì16 in the 1998‚Äì99 season, including wins over Jerry Tarkanian's Fresno State and Don Haskins's UTEP.https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/san-jose- state/1999-schedule.htmlhttps://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/san-jose- state/1998-schedule.html Chicago Bulls assistant In his first professional coaching position, Johnson was an assistant coach for the Chicago Bulls from 1999 to 2002, again under Tim Floyd; Johnson remained on staff under Bill Cartwright, after Floyd resigned in December 2001 following a 4‚Äì21 start. Second stint at San Jose State In 2002, Johnson returned to San Jose State to be head coach. San Jose State went 7‚Äì21 in the 2002‚Äì03 season, then 6‚Äì23 the following season.https://www.sports- reference.com/cbb/coaches/phil-johnson-1.html On February 25, 2004, San Jose State and the Western Athletic Conference both reprimanded Johnson for what San Jose State described as a \\"verbal confrontation with a UTEP fan\\" during the February 19 game against UTEP. This was six years before Johnson became an assistant coach at UTEP. San Jose State athletic director Chuck Bell stated: \\"While recognizing that the fan's verbal harassment of Coach Johnson throughout the game led to the confrontation, under no circumstances can a coach allow himself to be placed in a situation that jeopardizes the safety of the players and the fans in an arena.\\" The same day of the reprimand, the San Jose Mercury News revealed that Johnson had a suspended driver's license due to three arrests for drunk driving from 2002 and 2003. San Jose State fired Johnson after the 2004‚Äì05 season, in which San Jose State finished 6‚Äì23 for the second straight season. In 2008, the NCAA reduced the number of scholarships for San Jose State men's basketball by two, as a result of an unsatisfactory four-year Academic Progress Rate of 886 (the minimum satisfactory APR is 925) that spanned Johnson's final two seasons (2003‚Äì04 and 2004‚Äì05) and the first two seasons of succeeding head coach George Nessman (2005‚Äì06 and 2006‚Äì07). Assistant at USC and UTEP From 2005 to 2010, Johnson was an assistant coach at USC under Tim Floyd. For his first four seasons at USC, Johnson served under Tim Floyd, and Johnson remained on staff in the 2009‚Äì10 season under Kevin O'Neill. Johnson helped USC make the 2007, 2008, and 2009 NCAA Tournaments and the 2009 Pac-10 Tournament. However, in 2010, the NCAA vacated all of USC's wins from the 2007‚Äì08 season. For the fourth time, Johnson became an assistant coach on Tim Floyd's staff in 2010, with UTEP. UTEP made the 2011 National Invitation Tournament and 2014 College Basketball Invitational in Johnson's time at UTEP. On February 24, 2011, Johnson was ejected from UTEP's game at East Carolina for receiving two technical fouls. On January 30, 2015, C-USA issued a reprimand to Johnson for throwing a piece of paper on the court during UTEP's game against Marshall. Johnson served as interim head coach for the February 28, 2015 game at Southern Miss because regular head coach Tim Floyd was suspended for violating league conduct policy. UTEP lost, 63-60. However, Floyd was still credited for the win. Interim head coach at UTEP On November 28, 2017, Johnson was named interim head coach of the Miners following Floyd's abrupt retirement.

Born in Langley, British Columbia, Canada on September 11, 1962, his family was in the dairy farming business. His love of learning and art led him to pursue studying art history and film. Dealing with themes of identity, representation, and desire, his films were widely shown in both gay and academic festival contexts. His films were experimental and highly poetic in form, but more often than not included documentary characteristics (didactic tone, prosaic voiceovers). He was a lecturer on the topic of Art and Culture Studies at Simon Fraser University's School for the Contemporary Arts, and was an active member of Vancouver's contemporary film and art community. By the time Anderlini left his teaching position at SFU in 2002, his health was suffering, and making time for self care was, in addition to pursuing a Ph.D., part of the reason for his departure. Anderlini was HIV positive by this time, but soon began to develop neurological issues of unknown origin (attributed to AIDS), which eventually led to his declining health, returning to live with his family on their dairy farm, and eventual death at the age of 45.Vancouver Sun Obituaries Vancouver Sun Obituaries The Vancouver Sun.\\"In Memorandum\\", Mix Catalogue 2007 Education Anderlini held a B.A. in History from the University of British Columbia and a Masters in film from Simon Fraser University.

During his years teaching at Simon Fraser University in the 1990s and into the early 2000s, he was notorious for teaching the introductory contemporary art theory class FPA 111 \\"Issues in the Fine and Performing Arts\\", which was taken by virtually all students undertaking majors or minors in contemporary arts. The course material was disturbing to some, as Anderlini introduced students to various well known contemporary artists, including dance, film, music, visual arts, and performance and body art, often showing shocking examples, such as videos of some of Chris Burden's body art performances. Anderlini also frequently taught intensive senior level interdisciplinary art theory courses at the school. Despite being passionate about interdisciplinary and contemporary art, he had many criticisms towards SFU's School for Contemporary Arts, much of it tied to insufficient funding, and delayed promises for new arts facilities on campus. Activism and volunteerism  Independent and queer film Anderlini was a great proponent of independent film, particularly Canadian film, and film on contemporary gay and body politics. He participated in the Vancouver International Film Festival for the better part of a decade in various capacities, including as programmer of the Canadian Images section of the VIFF. He was also involved in other film organizations and festivals in Vancouver, including as a curator for Out On Screen Film and Video Festival,Queer Resources Directory and as a programmer at Video In Studios (now VIVO Media Arts Centre).Tainted: Christopher Lefler and the Queer Censorship Chill (1997) Maureen Bradley: Independent Canadian Filmmaker HIV/AIDS denialism Anderlini moderated a website and forum called \\"AIDS Myth Exposed\\", and was known as an AIDS denialist. He co-authored a rebuttal to what is known as \\"The Gallo Document\\" and openly criticized and questioned the use of antiretroviral drugs in people who are HIV positive. Anderlini's death was attributed to AIDS, but there were allegedly some questions and doubts regarding whether his neurological condition was appropriately diagnosed and adequately treated, because of its being attributed to the disease. Jersey dairy cattle and horticulture As Anderlini was part of a family of dairy cattle farmers, he maintained an interest in Jersey cattle breeding and organic gardening, as it reads in his obituary: \\"Ken was also a devoted fan of the Jersey cow and remained closely involved in the breeding of the registered cattle at his family's farm, Valtallina Jerseys. He had an extensive knowledge of the history of Jerseys in Canada and could recite a cow's pedigree for many generations. He also enjoyed organic horticulture, growing his own vegetables and fruit as well as carefully developing a beautiful flower garden as a lasting legacy.\\" Vancouver Sun Obituaries Vancouver Sun Obituaries The Vancouver Sun.

Devery satirized in Harper's Weekly on September 6, 1902 by William Allen Rogers. William Stephen \\"Big Bill\\" Devery (January 9, 1854 - June 20, 1919) was the last superintendent of the New York City Police Department police commission and the first police chief in 1898. Devery and Frank J. Farrell later co-owned the New York Yankees baseball team. Biography He was born in New York City in 1854. In 1878, at age 24, he was hired as a patrolman. On September 16, 1881, he was made a roundsman, and on May 28, 1884, he was promoted to a sergeant. On December 30, 1891, after 13 years on the force, he was promoted to captain. As a police captain he once told his men, \\"They tell me there's a lot of grafting going on in this precinct. They tell me that you fellows are the fiercest ever on graft. Now that's going to stop! If there's any grafting to be done, I'll do it. Leave it to me.\\" On February 5, 1897, he was arrested and charged with bribery and extortion. After conviction, he was dismissed from the force. He appealed his conviction in the New York Court of Appeals. It was overturned and he was reinstated to the force and promoted to inspector on January 7, 1898, and Deputy Chief on February 14, 1898. He was then appointed Chief of Police on June 30, 1898. In 1899, Theodore Roosevelt and Republican state legislators established a committee, headed by Robert Mazet, to investigate Tammany Hall corruption under the leadership of Richard Croker. Lincoln Steffens, a popular journalist of that time wrote of Devery, \\"As a Chief of Police, he is a disgrace, but as a character, he is a work of art.\\"In 1901, the Police Department was re- organized again, and has been headed ever since by a Police Commissioner. The first Commissioner Michael C. Murphy appointed Devery as his Deputy Commissioner. Both Murphy and Devery went out of office on January 1, 1902, when Seth Low became Mayor of New York. Later, with Frank J. Farrell, he bought the Baltimore, Maryland American League baseball team and moved it to New York and renamed it the Highlanders. The team almost won the American League pennant in 1904, but otherwise had poor records during the Farrell- Devery ownership era. For $300K, they sold the team in 1915 to Jacob Ruppert, Jr. and Tillinghast L' Hommedieu Huston. He died on June 20, 1919 at 4:15 p.m. of apoplexy in Far Rockaway, New York.

There are 21 prisons in the country: one in each dzongkhag for those punished for up to third degree felonies, plus Central Prison (Tshoenkhang Yoema) for those who commit first or second degree felonies. There are also Youth Development and Rehabilitation Centres for juvenile (under age 18) convicts. The Division personnel consist of a senior superintendent, superintendent, and additional superintendent; officers in charge of the central (national) and dzongkhag prisons; prison wardens and guards; and medical officers. Personnel begin as police, undergo training in prison administration at government-run Training Institutes, and occupy their posts for two year terms. Under the Prison Act, the police chief, in consultation with the Minister of Home Affairs, may declare \\"any house, building, enclosure or place, or any part thereof\\" to be a prison or reformative training centre. Prisoners themselves are categorized as \\"civil prisoners,\\" criminal prisoners, prisoners charged under the National Security Act, and military personnel convicted in military court. Detainees are classed as those under criminal investigation, detainees under trial, and other detainees \\"as directed by court for civil cases.\\" Populations of civil, criminal, and political prisoners are to be separated from each other while inside. Prisoners may wear their own clothing, subject to a dress code, and may even raise children on prison grounds through age nine. Prisoners are allowed spousal conjugal visits, provided female prisoners agree to prevent conception. These benefits are balanced by six-day weeks of hard labour within the prisons, imposed on all but juveniles, the physically and mentally infirm, political prisoners, and prisoners with pending trials. Royal Bhutan Police Service Board Under the Act of 2009, the Royal Bhutan Police Service Board formulates policies, rules, regulations, and guidelines for the police concerning organization; administration; staffing; promotion, classification, and grading of services; higher or continuing policing education; performance evaluation and appraisal; development of efficient police process; Police Support Selection Examinations; Police Support Cadre Selection Procedures; and police office and material management.Police Act 2009: ¬∂ 30 All policies, Service Rules, and regulations formulated and decided by the Board are submitted to the Chief of Police for endorsement and for submission to the Home and Cultural Affairs Minister for approval.Police Act 2009: ¬∂ 38 The Royal Bhutan Police Service Board consists of eleven members appointed by the Minister for Home and Cultural Affairs upon recommendation of the Chief of Police. Its members include Additional Chief of Police (Chair); the Head of the Law and Order Bureau within the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs; one Deputy Chief of Police (Member Secretary); one Senior Superintendent of Police; one director of the Police Training Institutes; two Superintendents of Police from Field Divisions; two Superintendents of Police from the Special Division; one Additional Superintendent of Police from the Field Division; and one Officer Commanding of the Police Station not below the rank of Yongzin. The first two are permanent members; all others serve two-year terms with a limit of two consecutive terms.Police Act 2009: ¬∂¬∂ 27‚Äì29 History of the Royal Bhutan Police The Royal Bhutan Police was formed on 1 September 1965 with 555 personnel reassigned from the Royal Bhutan Army, and had grown to over 1,000 by the late 1970s. Since its establishment, Indian police advisers and instructors have been used. Starting in 1975, Bhutanese instructors, trained in India for one year, began training recruits at the Zilnon Namgyeling Police Training Centre. Advanced training for selected police officers in fields such as criminology, traffic control, and canine corps has taken place in India and other countries. In 1988, following specialized training in India, a female second lieutenant established a fingerprint bureau in Thimphu. Besides having access to training at the Indian Police Academy in Hyderabad, some students were also sent to the Police Executive Development Course in Singapore. Besides performing their standard police functions, members of the Royal Bhutan Police also served as border guards and firefighters and provided first aid. In 1975, in response to the increased number of traffic accidents resulting from the development of roads and the increase number of motor vehicles, the police established an experimental mobile traffic court staff with Royal Bhutan Police personnel and a judicial official to make on-the-spot legal decisions. On September 19, 2005 Bhutan became a member of Interpol. Interpol maintains a National Central Bureau at Royal Bhutan Police headquarters in Thimphu. As of 2005, recruits were trained at the Police Training Centers in Zilnon Namgyeling - Thimphu, Jigmeling - Gelephu and Tashigatshel - Chukha. A nine-month basic training course for constables included physical exercise and drills, weapons training, martial arts (taekwondo), law, public relations, riot control, investigation techniques, check post duties, traffic control, VIP escort and driglam namzha. An additional six-week course provided scientific investigation techniques, photography, administration, accounting, canine handling and other related subjects. A six-week refresher course was also conducted. Selected officers were sent for basic and advanced training abroad. In India, Royal Bhutan Police officers were trained at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy in Hyderabad and the Punjab Police Academy. Officers were sent to Australia to specialise in DNA analysis and other advanced techniques of forensic science. Officers have also attended a Police Executive Development course in Singapore.

There were police headquarters in each district and subdistrict. In 1991, the police was headed by the Chief of Police under whom there are commissioned officers, non-commissioned officers, and constables. In April 2008, the Chief of Police was Maksi Gom (Colonel) Kipchu Namgyel. The headquarters of the Royal Bhutan Police in Thimphu was divided into three branches directly under the Chief of Police: General Division * General welfare of the Royal Bhutan Police * Prison administration Crime Division * Crime prevention and detection * Investigation of criminal cases * Maintenance of crime records * Research work * Traffic control Administrative Division * Training * VIP security * Motor transport * Communications systems * Arms and ammunition * Publications * Sports activities The Royal Bhutan Police structures districts into \\"ranges\\" which are under the administrative control of \\"range police officers.\\" A \\"district police officer\\" heads the police force in a district. There are a number of police stations, outposts, and checkpoints in a district and the highest- ranked officer is usually designated the Officer-in-Charge of that particular area.

Highly praised by critics, it has been called \\"Fletcher's best comedy.\\"Clifford Leech, quoted in Logan and Smith, p. 40. The drama was initially published in the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647. Date and performance The second Beaumont/Fletcher folio of 1679 provides a cast list for the original King's Men's production, which includes Henry Condell, Joseph Taylor, John Lowin, William Ecclestone, Richard Sharpe, John Underwood, Robert Benfield--and Thomas Pollard, the comic actor who filled the title role. This is the only cast list that includes both Taylor and Condell; Taylor joined the company in the spring of 1619, to replace Richard Burbage after his death in March of that year; and Condell is thought to have retired not long after--which appears to date the play fairly securely to 1619. Manuscript In addition to the printed texts in the two folios, the play exists in a manuscript version, a presentation copy prepared by the professional scribe Ralph Crane for Sir Kenelm Digby. Crane sent the MS. to Digby on 27 November 1625. In Crane's text, the play is longer by some 70 lines; the printed texts provide a stage version trimmed for acting. The MS. is titled Demetrius and Enanthe, and attributes the play to Fletcher alone --a verdict that is generally accepted, since Fletcher's distinctive stylistic profile is continuous through the play. The MS. has been called \\"the most beautiful example of Crane's calligraphy that we have.\\"F. P. Wilson, quoted in Logan and Smith, p. 70. After 1642 Comic material from the play was adapted into a droll during the Interregnum period. Like many plays in Fletcher's canon, The Humorous Lieutenant was revived at the start the Restoration era, in 1660. When the new Theatre Royal at Drury Lane opened on 8 April 1663, The Humorous Lieutenant was the first play staged, and ran for twelve nights in a row--highly unusual in the repertory system of the time. The play remained popular and was performed repeatedly, in various adaptations, into the early eighteenth century.Sprague, pp. 4-5, 10, 15, 20, 76, 109, 121-3. Adapted forms of the play were published in 1697 and 1717, while the manuscript text was first printed by Alexander Dyce in 1830.Potter, p. 9. The plot The Humorous Lieutenant has no known source in the previous literature,Logan and Smith, p. 41. and seems to be that rare item in English Renaissance drama: an original plot. It is set in the ancient Middle East after the death of Alexander the Great, and features the major historical figures of the era: Antigonus, his son Demetrius, and Seleucus, Ptolemy, and Lysimachus. The plot centers on the love between Demetrius and an obscure young woman named Celia--who at the end of the play turns out to be Enanthe, the daughter of King Seleucus and so a suitable match for a prince. The title character is the play's main comic relief: an otherwise-unnamed lieutenant who is capable of fighting ferociously in battle but is a profound hypochondriac the rest of the time. He is \\"humorous\\" in the seventeenth-century sense of the word: his bodily humours are out of balance. Notes References Leech, Clifford. The John Fletcher Plays.

He studied medicine in Berlin, W√ºrzburg and Vienna, earning his doctorate in 1858. From 1859 he worked in Berlin, where he later became an assistant to Wilhelm Griesinger (1817-1868). In 1879 he replaced Heinrich Curschmann (1846-1910) as director of the Moabit Hospital, where one of his students was pediatrician Hugo Neumann (1858-1912). From 1885 to 1893 he was an editor of the Journal f√ºr praktische Aerzt. He is remembered for work with neurologist Albert Eulenburg (1840-1917) involving research of the sympathetic nervous system. With Eulenburg he published Die Pathologie des Sympathicus auf physiologischer Grundlage, a work that was considered at the time to be the best written book on the pathology of the sympathetic system from a physiological basis. As a result of this publication, the two physicians were awarded the 1877 Astley Cooper Prize. However, this honor was later overturned due to a technicality that the book had two authors. Guttmann also made contributions in his research of tuberculosis and malaria.

Requirements For most organizations, a business activity generates unrelated business income subject to taxation if: #It is a trade or business, #It is regularly carried on, and #It is not substantially related to furthering the exempt purpose of the organization. A trade or business includes the selling of goods or services with the intention of having a profit. An activity is regularly carried on if it occurs with a frequency and continuity, similar to what a commercial entity would do if it performed the same activity. An activity is substantially related to furthering the exempt purpose of the organization if the activity contributes importantly to accomplishing the organization's purpose, other than for the sake of producing the income itself. Examples A university runs a pizza parlor that sells pizza to students and non-students alike. The university is a tax-exempt organization and its pizza parlor generates unrelated business income. While the tuition and fees generated by the university are tax exempt, its income from the pizza parlor is not tax-exempt because the pizza parlor is unrelated to the university's education purpose. A counter-example is a social-service nonprofit that holds a one-time bake sale. While the sale is unrelated to their mission, it is tax-exempt because it is not regularly carried on. Business activities of an exempt organization ordinarily are considered regularly carried on if they show a frequency and continuity, and they are pursued in a manner similar to comparable commercial activities of nonexempt organizations. If a nonprofit organization receives income from providing services to outside entities and the performance of those services does not further the organization's mission of the organization, the income may be unrelated business income.Gries, Karen. \\"Nonprofits: Avoiding the Snares of Unrelated Business Income (UBI)\\". CliftonLarsonAllen LLP. March 21, 2017. If a nonprofit organization sells advertising in print or on the organization's web site, the income is typically unrelated business income if the advertisements promote the advertiser's business and not the nonprofit organization. If a nonprofit organization licenses its intangible property and promotes an outside entity's business, the income may be unrelated business income. On the other hand, if the nonprofit organization licenses its intangible property and performs no other services related to the licensing, then the income is consider passive income and it is typically not unrelated business income. If a nonprofit organization has ownership in an S corporation, the income from the S corporation is typically unrelated business income. Gain or loss from the sale of stock in the S corporation stock is also typically unrelated business income. Under Internal Revenue Code section 514, property held for the production of income and subject to acquisition or improvement indebtedness is typically unrelated business income. In most of the above examples, the income may not be considered unrelated business income if the activity is not regularly carried on or if the organization does not intend to recognize a gain from the activity. Exclusions Certain types of income are not considered unrelated business income, such as income from dividends; interest; royalties; rental of real property; research for a federal, state, or local government; and charitable contributions, gifts, and grants. In addition, unrelated business income does not include income derived from the work of unpaid volunteers, income from the sale of donated goods, income from trade shows and conventions, income from legal gaming. The Internal Revenue Service does not consider the receipt of assets from a closely related tax-exempt organization to be unrelated business income. Tax rate The IRS taxes unrelated business income at the corporate tax rates (IRC section 11) except for certain section 511(b)(2) trusts which are taxed at trust tax rates. UBIT in an Individual Retirement Account Individual retirement accounts generally are subject to tax on income that is taxable to most U.S. tax-exempt entities under 26 U.S.C. ¬ß511. 26 U.S.C. ¬ß408 contains many of the rules governing the treatment of Individual retirement accounts. ¬ß408(e)(1) states: \\"Any individual retirement account is exempt from taxation under this subtitle unless such account has ceased to be an individual retirement account by reason of paragraph (2) or (3). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any such account is subject to the taxes imposed by section 511 (relating to imposition of tax on unrelated business income of charitable, etc. organizations).\\" In addition, the IRS unequivocally confirms this in the first few paragraphs of Chapter 1 of the November 2007 revision of Publication 598 that IRAs are \\"subject to the tax on unrelated business income\\". Minimizing the Impact of the UBIT Tax for Retirement Account Investors ‚Äì The C Corporation Blocker Strategy The primary way investors have tried to limit the reach of the UBIT tax is by employing a strategy known as a \\"C Corp Blocker\\". The \\"C Corp Blocker\\" strategy involves the retirement account holder establishing a C Corporation and then investing the retirement funds into the C Corporation before the funds are ultimately invested into the planned investment. For example, if a retirement account investor is seeking to invest retirement funds into a business operated through a LLC, she can establish a C Corporation, invest her IRA funds through the C Corporation, and then have the C Corporation invest the funds into the business LLC. All income received by the C Corporation would be subject to the new reduced corporate tax rate of 21%, which is less than the 37% maximum UBIT tax rate and less than the old maximum corporate tax rate of 35%. History Since at least 1928,\\"Revenue Act of 1928\\". Section 103. United States Congress. 1928. tax- exempt organizations could earn tax-free income from both mission-related activities and commercial business activities that were unrelated to the purpose for which they were exempt, as long as they used the net profits for exempt purposes.Arnsberger, Paul; Ludlum, Melissa; Riley, Margaret; Stanton, Mark. \\"A History of the Tax-Exempt Sector: An SOI Perspective\\".

Mueller Company, a pasta manufacturing company, to New York University Law School with the intention of the company's profits being used to fund the law school's educational activities.\\"C. F. Mueller Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue\\". 190 F.2d 120 (3d Cir. 1951).Rose-Ackermant, Susan. \\"Unfair Competition and Corporate Income Taxation\\". Faculty Scholarship Series. Yale Law School. Paper 584. 1982. C.F. Mueller Company did not pay income tax on its profits because it now considered itself a charitable organization. The Internal Revenue Service challenged it. New York University Law School won the case because, at that point, tax-exempt organizations were not subject to income tax on their revenue from any source as long as the revenue was used towards the organization's tax-exempt purpose. In 1950, Congress amended the tax law to introduce the concept of unrelated business income. Congress enacted the law because it was concerned about nonprofit organizations having an unfair advantage competing in the same activities as for-profit organizations. From that point on, revenue would be considered tax-exempt based on the source of the funds, rather than the use of the funds.

They were led by singer-guitarist Grant McLennan, formerly in The Go-Betweens. McLennan started the group with Ross MacLennan (no relation) on drums (ex-Turtlebox), bass player Adele Pickvance (from Davey Graney Band) and Powderfinger's guitarist Ian Haug. It was a side project for most of its members, other than Ross MacLennan, as they were in other bands which were in hiatus. The group's name is a reference to the rock supergroup, Far Corporation. In November 1997 McLennan was asked to provide an ambient audio track for a music-arts project, Occiput Hammerings, held at Brisbane's Metro Arts Theatre. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described them as a \\"conceptual art group with a pop orientation.\\" Far Out Corporation was initially a one-off group to fulfil the commission and performed live at one of the six nights of the Occiput Hammerings display early in 1998. The group then continued to gig at various Brisbane venues. In October 1998 they released their first and only album, FOC, which is an initialism of their name. It was produced by Tim Whitten and Far Out Corporation. McFarlane felt the album \\"successfully blended a pop sensibility with a more cerebral orientation (reminiscent of Underground Lovers, New Order or Velvet Underground).\\" It provided the CD single, \\"Don't Blame the Beam\\". In late 1999 The Go-Betweens unexpectedly reformed and McLennan brought Pickvance into a new Go-Betweens line-up; Far Out Corporation were disbanded by 2000. On 6 May 2006 Grant McLennan died.

Plot Luke Malloy and his friends, A.J. and Riley, perform together as a band named Steel Monkey. They are starting middle school in two days, warned by Luke's older sister Diana of the dangers of junior high (especially the possibility that Luke's friends might leave him behind for the \\"cooler crowd\\") and intimidated by the looming presence of the bully, Meat, who constantly threatens incoming sixth graders. Luke dismisses Diana's warnings and the boys sleepover in a tent that night at A.J.'s house. The following morning, the boys visit a carnival, where Steel Monkey is scheduled to perform in a talent show. Luke embarrasses himself in front of his crush, Alice, and the boys encounter Meat and his friends, who threaten them. They later visit a skate park, where experienced skateboarder Snake advises them about skating. Steel Monkey is nervous about the show, fearing their reputation in middle school is at stake. Luke wishes the day would never end and that he could do all he wanted with his final day of summer. Immediately afterward, and moments before their band is scheduled to perform onstage at the carnival, he is knocked unconscious by a large wooden board while returning a Frisbee. He awakens in the same tent he woke up in that morning, realizing his wish has sent him back in time. He repeats the day, trying to impress Alice, teach kindness to Meat, and impress Snake, but he is unsuccessful. He tries to avoid the board this time, but it still knocks him out. He is sent back to that morning over and over again moments before Steel Monkey's performance every single day, always getting knocked unconscious by some different, unforeseeable method, such as a football, a skateboard, and even a falling meteor. Every time, he never survives to the talent show. Luke begins to grow weary of the carnival as the same repeated day grows into weeks, and he starts to spend more time at the skate park, trying to impress Snake and his gang again and again to join their skate group known as \\"The Pound\\". Each time, Luke competes against a teenager named Gus who is also trying out for The Pound; Luke consistently embarrasses himself by screwing up the challenge, since the level of skateboarding is far beyond him; in the end, he always ends up returning to the carnival with A.J. and Riley, during which he encounters the bully Meat again and again, always trying different methods of dealing with him. He tries to relate to Meat's home life, but realizes he's making incorrect assumptions which lead Meat and his buddies to chase him down. Other days, Luke simply avoids Meat; once, he even gets revenge on Meat by tying an industrial cord to a porta potty Meat's using, and the other end to a departing truck. Worrying more about Diana's warning, fearing he may be left behind soon, Luke focuses less on his friends and more on the skate park, where the \\"cool\\" people are. He begins to ditch A.J. and Riley every morning, and they always find him later at the park. After the repeated day has accumulated over several months, Luke finally has developed enough skill that he beats Gus at the Pound tryout, and his friends are shocked when he abandons them to eagerly join the impressed members of the skate group. Diana steps in and tells Snake Luke is too young to join their group, but Snake insists that Luke can never be too young for the three N's: \\"hangN, rideN, and partyN\\". Luke, surprised that The Pound is nothing like his real friends, realizing maybe he isn't cut out for the group, returns to the carnival to find them. A.J. and Riley are angry with him for his lies, and blow him off. The next morning, Luke is gone when A.J. and Riley wake up in the tent. He is sitting on a park bench crying, when Diana shows up and comforts him. Luke swears he's been repeating the same day, and he manages to prove a skeptical Diana by taking her to the carnival and pointing out numerous random events before they occur. Diana sympathizes with his situation, telling him she didn't mean to scare him with her warning about friends, but was only teasing him. She tells him that maybe the reason he's stuck is because he needs to change his day for the better; when his crush Alice walks by and says hi to him, Diana smiles at Luke, suggesting he begin there. She encourages him to be ready for the approaching school year and be more confident. Luke confronts Meat again, this time warning him against bullying, and claiming he'll tell the whole middle school Meat's real name is Melvin if he doesn't start being nicer to people. Confused, Meat agrees, and leaves. He makes a positive effort to communicate with Mr. Molesky, a teacher for the upcoming year whom Luke has previously not done a good job making an impression with over the repeated cycle. He manages to admit his feelings to Alice, and she tells him she's glad they're going to be in class that year. When Luke and his friends are waiting backstage before the concert, Luke retrieves the Frisbee that resets the cycle. However, nothing happens to him; unexpectedly, he makes it to the talent show, and though their introduction is shaky, Diana encourages Luke on; Snake joins in, and soon the crowd is cheering them on. The boys eagerly begin their song, The Last Day of Summer. Steel Monkey's performance is received warmly. However, right after they finish, Luke is knocked out again, this time by a chipmunk that falls from the top of the stage. Luke wakes up on the first day of school, but discovers he has to stay home due to his head injury. A.J. and Riley visit Luke after school starts, and Luke looks ahead to school the next day.

Originally, the Schenley Apartments were home of Pittsburgh's well-to-do, including for a time its architect Henry Hornbostel, and consisted of 1,113 rooms in 238 apartments throughout the five buildings. The University acquired them in December 1955 at a cost of $3 million ($ in dollars), and renovated them into residence halls for another $1 million ($ in dollars).

The building is named for the founder of the University, Hugh Henry Brackenridge. Bruce Hall Detail of the scalloped cornice on Bruce Hall, one of the Schenley Quadrangle residences at the University of Pittsburgh Bruce Hall houses 212 men and women, primarily freshman, in four- and six-person suites. Starting in 2014-2015, Bruce Hall will be home to the freshman College of Business Administration Living Learning Community. The building is named for the first chancellor after the University was renamed from the Pittsburgh Academy to the Western University of Pennsylvania, Robert Bruce. Bruce Hall served as a university office building until those offices were moved into Posvar Hall thereby allowing Bruce Hall to be converted into housing suites beginning in 1978.  Basement and First Floor  The basement and first floor of Bruce Hall are actually on the street level with Forbes Avenue, and are rented out to The UPS Store and 7 Eleven. 7 Eleven closed in the start of the Fall 2017 semester and was turned in to a grocery stored operated by the university and Sodexo.  Second Floor  The second floor is the main entrance for residents, as well as the location of the University of Pittsburgh Residence Life offices.  Third through Eleventh Floors  The third through eleventh floors are entirely student suites. Each floor has 6 suites: 3 four-person suites, 2 three-person suites, and 1 six-person suite with laundry facilities on each floor. The 6-person suites on the upper floors have an exceptional view of the Cathedral of Learning, Schenley Plaza, and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History out of the common room's windows.  Twelfth Floor  The twelfth floor is home to the University's catering service, as well as a meeting room in suite 1201 reserved for activities held by the President or Vice President of the University. It was usually impossible to get to the twelfth floor without an elevator key, although recently access to the twelfth floor has not been as restrictive as in the past. A five bedroom, four-bath suite on the twelfth floor of Bruce Hall also once served as the University's chancellor residence.http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi- bin/t/text/pageviewer- idx?c=pittmiscpubs&cc;=pittmiscpubs&xc;=1&idno;=00c50130m&g;=documentingpitt&xg;=1&q1;=Schenley+Apartments&frm;=frameset&view;=image&seq;=279  The Ghost of 1201 Bruce Hall  Many students and university employees, as well as various outside sources, believe that a ghost or two haunts the 1201 suite of Bruce. The owner of the Schenley Apartments once lived with his family on the twelfth floor. Rumor has it that his mistress and/or wife committed suicide in the 1201 by either hanging herself or throwing herself out the window. Students and staff have reported hearing footsteps in the stairwells and the halls, as well as a woman's voice, while some have reported poltergiest-like activity. Others have heard stories of the elevators not stopping on their floor, and continuing up to the twelfth floor and refusing to go back down. Traditionally referred to as \\"Harriet,\\" the ghost, for which Pitt staff have even hung Christmas stockings for, has only been known to visit the 12th floor, the 11th floor, and suite 8B on the 8th floor, where she is said to have lived.

Holland Hall is directly ahead, McCormick Hall is to the left, and Amos Hall is to the right. The top of Litchfield Tower B can be seen behind Holland Hall. Holland Hall is divided into two wings, North and South, and houses 600 upperclass and first-year women and, since the 2017 school year, men in single, double, triple, and quad accommodations. There is a kitchenette on each floor as well as communal bathrooms and showers. The penthouse features a lounge, study area, and laundry facilities. It originally served as a men's dormatory. Since January, 1960, the University Store, the primary book store for the university, has been located on the ground floor of Holland Hall, accessible from either the Schenley Quadrangle or from Fifth Avenue. At the time of its opening, it was hailed as the largest college bookstore in the nation. The store completed a $9.43 million renovation that included insertion of a skylight, a caf√©, a technology area, an Espresso Book Machine, and various reading nooks, as well as the creation of a new entrance on the Forbes Avenue side of Holland Hall. Holland Hall is named after University Chancellor William Jacob Holland, who led the University from 1891 to 1901 when it was known as the Western University of Pennsylvania. McCormick Hall McCormick Hall houses 132 mostly upperclass men and women in two-, three-, five-, and seven-person suites. Each suite features a kitchenette with refrigerator and one or more private bathrooms. Laundry facilities are available in the penthouse. Adjoining McCormick Hall is the William Pitt Union. McCormick Hall is named after Samuel B. McCormick who served as University Chancellor from 1904-1921 during which time the University moved from Pittsburgh's North Side to its current location in Oakland and also changed its name from the Western University of Pennsylvania to the University of Pittsburgh.

He was posthumously awarded the second highest Indian military honour, the Maha Vir Chakra for bravery on the battlefield. Early life Adhikari was brought up in Nainital. a town in the Kumaon hills of northern India. He completed his schooling from St. Joseph's College in 1987, Intermediate from Government Inter College, Nainital and B.Sc. from Kumaon University in the year 1992. Career He attended the Indian Military Academy, a premier military academy in India. Major Rajesh Singh was commissioned on 11 December 1993 from the Indian Military Academy. After graduating from the Academy, he joined the 2 Mech. Infantry of the Indian Army. He was posted in 18 Grenadiershttp://twdi.in/node/1080 at the time of Kargil War. Kargil War When heavy fighting broke out in the Kargil region of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir owing to planned infiltration by Pakistan army Northern Light Infantry regulars dressed as militants, the Indian Army was ordered to clear the heights of those intruders. Many tough battles took place in the region. The Mechanized Infantry's Major Rajesh Singh Adhikari, the second army officer to die in the operations against infiltrators, had caused heavy casualties to the intruders and forced them to withdraw before succumbing to injuries in Drass sector. It was one of the most significant battles, the Battle of Tololing, where Rajesh made a valiant sacrifice. On 30 May 1999, as a part of battalion operations to capture the Tololing feature, Major Rajesh Singh Adhikari, 18 Grenadiershttp://twdi.in/node/1080 was tasked to secure the initial foothold by capturing its forward spur where the enemy held a strongly fortified advance position. The post was located in a treacherous, mountainous terrain at about 15,000 feet and covered with snow. While Major Rajesh Singh Adhikari was leading his team towards the objective, he was fired at from two mutually supporting bunkers with universal machine guns. The officer immediately directed the rocket launcher detachment to engage the bunker and without waiting, rushed into the bunker and killed two intruders in close quarter combat. Thereafter, the officer, displaying presence of mind under heavy fire, ordered his Medium Machine Gun (MMG) detachment to fix position behind a rocky feature and engage the enemy. The assault party continued to inch their way up. Despite suffering grievous bullet injuries, Major Rajesh Singh Adhikari continued to direct his sub unit. Refusing to be evacuated, the officer charged at the second bunker and killed one more occupant, thus capturing the second bunker at Tololing which later facilitated capture of Point 4590. For conspicuous gallantry and supreme sacrifice, Major Rajesh Singh Adhikari was posthumously awarded the second highest Indian Army decoration Maha Vir Chakra for his actions in the battle.

The film is an adaptation of the 1995 novel of the same name by the Portuguese author Jos√© Saramago. The film was written by Don McKellar and directed by Fernando Meirelles, starring Julianne Moore as the doctor's wife and Mark Ruffalo as the doctor. Saramago originally refused to sell the rights for a film adaptation, but the producers were able to acquire it with the condition that the film would be set in an unnamed and unrecognizable city. Blindness premiered as the opening film at the Cannes Film Festival on May 14, 2008, and the film was released in the United States on October 3, 2008.  Plot  The film begins with a young Japanese professional suddenly going blind in his car while at an intersection, with his field of vision turning white. A seemingly kind passerby offers to drive him home. However, he then steals the blind man's car. When the blind man's wife returns home, she takes him to an ophthalmologist who can identify nothing wrong and refers him for further evaluation. The next day, the doctor goes blind, and recognizes that the blindness must be caused by a communicable disease. Around the city, more citizens are struck blind, causing widespread panic, and the government organizes a quarantine for the blind in a derelict asylum. When a hazmat crew arrives to pick up the doctor, his wife lies that she has also gone blind in order to accompany him. In the asylum, the doctor and his wife are first to arrive and agree they will keep her sight a secret. They are joined by several others, including the driver, the thief, and other patients of the doctor. At this point, the \\"white sickness\\" has become international, with hundreds of cases reported every day. The government is resorting to increasingly ruthless measures to try to deal with the epidemic, including refusing aid to the blind. As more blinded people are crammed into what has become a concentration camp, overcrowding and lack of outside support cause hygiene and living conditions to quickly degrade. The doctor serves as the representative of his ward, and his sighted wife does what she can to assist her fellow inmates without revealing her ability. Anxiety over the availability of food undermines morale and introduces conflict between the prison's wards, as the soldiers who guard the camp become increasingly hostile. A man with a handgun appoints himself \\"king\\" of his ward, and takes control of the food deliveries, first demanding the other wards' valuables, and then for the women to have sex with their men. In an effort to obtain necessities, several women reluctantly submit to being raped. One of the women is killed by her assailant, and the doctor's wife retaliates, killing the \\"king\\" with a pair of scissors. In the ensuing chaos, the building catches fire, with many inmates dying. The survivors who escape the building discover that the guards have abandoned their posts, and they venture out into the city. Society has collapsed, with the city's population reduced to an aimless, zombie-like struggle to survive. The doctor's wife leads her husband and a few others from their ward in search of food and shelter. She discovers a well- stocked basement storeroom beneath a grocery store, barely escaping with aid from her husband when the throng around her smell the fresh food she is carrying. The doctor and his wife invite their new \\"family\\" to their apartment, where they establish a mutually supportive long-term home. The next day, just as suddenly as his sight had been lost, the driver recovers his sight. They celebrate and their hope is restored.  Cast  * Julianne Moore as the Doctor's Wife, the only person immune to the epidemic of blindness. Her sight is kept a secret by her husband and others, though as time goes on, she feels isolated in being the only one with sight. Moore described her character's responsibility: \\"Her biggest concern in the beginning is simply her husband. But her ability to see ultimately both isolates her and makes her into a leader.\\" The director also gave Moore's character a wardrobe that would match the actor's skin and dyed blond hair, giving her the appearance of a \\"pale angel\\". * Mark Ruffalo as the Doctor. The doctor also becomes something of a leader; in an early scene, he reveals that he has been elected as his ward's official representative to the rest of the community. Meirelles originally sought to cast actor Daniel Craig as Doctor, but negotiations were not finalized. Ruffalo said that his character loses the illusion of his self- perspective and perceives his wife as being a person he could aspire to. Ruffalo said, \\"That's a very difficult moment for anybody, to have all their perceptions completely shattered, but I think the Doctor finally comes to a peace about his inabilities and his downfall, and admits to an admiration for his wife's strengths.\\" The actor wore a layer of makeup to appear older and also wore contact lenses to be blind while having his eyes open. The actor said of the experience as a blind character, \\"At first it's terrifying and then it's frustrating and then it gets quiet... we're tormented by our eyesight... you don't know this until you go blind... As an actor I suddenly felt free.\\" * Danny Glover as Man with Black Eye Patch. Glover described his character: \\"The Man with the Black Eye Patch comes into this new world of blindness already half blind, so I think he understands where he is within his own truth, within himself. I did feel like this character was very much like Saramago because he is completely unapologetic‚Äîhe is who he is and he accepts who he is.\\" Glover explained his involvement with the role, \\"When you are blind you try to adopt another kind of sensitivity, so this role is definitely a challenge from a physical point of view.\\" * Gael Garc√≠a Bernal as Bartender/King of Ward 3, one of the film's villains. In defiance of the doctor's democratic efforts and election as leader of Ward 1, the bartender declares himself \\"King of Ward 3\\" and gains immediate popularity from his \\"subjects\\" by prioritizing food over his ward's community responsibilities such as burying the dead. He somehow obtains a revolver and uses it to bully the other wards by controlling the food supply. Meirelles followed the advice of Brazilian stage director Antunes Filho and changed the character from the novel by making him more ambiguous, explaining, \\"In the book, he is really a mean guy, terribly evil from the beginning... but I thought it was more interesting to have him be not evil but more like a child with a gun.\\" Bernal described the result of his character, \\"I think the King is just very practical, very pragmatic. He appears cold because he is not an idealist and does not see hope, but he is a survivor, the same as all the others.\\" The doctor's wife kills him with a pair of medical scissors to the neck. His death marks the point when Ward 1 takes back control, with the doctor's wife's threat to kill one of the men from Ward 3 for every day her ward goes without food. * Maury Chaykin as Accountant, who helps the King of Ward 3 bully the members of the other wards. Because he has been blind since birth, the Accountant is much more used to relying on his other senses, which gives him a major advantage over the other prisoners; he assumes control over Ward 3 and the food supplies for the community after the King is murdered. * Alice Braga as Woman with Dark Glasses. Braga described her character as mysterious, believing, \\"While she does sleep with men because it is easy money, I did not want to treat her purely as a prostitute. She starts out quite tough, but she develops very strong maternal feelings.\\" Meirelles explained that the character's glasses and cascading hair gave her a cold appearance, but through her scenes with the orphaned Boy with the Squint, she develops warmth. Secondary characters include: * Don McKellar as Thief. McKellar, who wrote the screenplay for the film, had also acted in the past and was cast as the character. The screenwriter described the Thief, \\"I like the trick where you think the Thief is a bad guy. He's a pathetic character you first believe is the villain of the piece and then you realize that, no, he's not even close to that. There's something charming about his desperation because, after a point, you meet the King of Ward Three and learn what real desperation is.\\" * Sandra Oh as Minister of Health. * Yusuke Iseya as First Blind Man. * Yoshino Kimura as First Blind Man's Wife. * Mitchell Nye as Boy. * Susan Coyne as Receptionist. * Martha Burns as Woman with Insomnia. * Joe Pingue as The Taxi Driver. * Tracy Wright as Thief's Wife. * Niv Fichman as Israeli Scientist. * Gerry Mendicino as Silver Haired Doctor. * Fabiana Guglielmetti as Mother of the Boy. * Joe Cobden as Policeman. * Amanda Heibert as Hotel Maid. * Michael Mahonen as Sergeant. * Tom Melissis as Engineer. * Matt Gordon as Minister's Assistant. * Joseph Motiki as Guard. * Joris Jarsky as Hooligan. * Billy Otis as Hoodlum. * Linlyn Lue as Emissary from Ward Two. * Toni Ellwand, Mariah Inger, Nadia Litz as Woman of Ward One. * Mpho Koaho as Pharmacist's Assistant. * Douglas Silva as Onlooker #1 in the opening scenes. Silva has previously acted in many Meirelles films: he starred in Meirelles' short film Golden Gate (Palace II) in 2000; the 2002 film City of God; its 2002 to 2005 spin-off television series Cidade dos Homens (English translation: City of Men); and the movie City of Men in 2007. * Daniel Zettel as Onlooker #2. Meirelles chose an international cast. Producer Niv Fichman explained Meirelles' intent: \\"He was inspired by [Saramago's] great masterwork to create a microcosm of the world. He wanted it cast in a way to represent all of humanity.\\" Production Development The rights to the 1995 novel Blindness were closely guarded by author Jos√© Saramago. Saramago explained, \\"I always resisted because it's a violent book about social degradation, rape, and I didn't want it to fall into the wrong hands.\\" Director Fernando Meirelles had wanted to direct a film adaptation in 1997, perceiving it as \\"an allegory about the fragility of civilization\\". Saramago originally refused to sell the rights to Meirelles, Whoopi Goldberg, or Gael Garc√≠a Bernal. In 1999, producer Niv Fichman and Canadian screenwriter Don McKellar visited Saramago in the Canary Islands; Saramago allowed their visit on condition that they not discuss buying the rights. McKellar explained the changes he intended to make from the novel and what the focus would be, and two days later he and Fichman left Saramago's home with the rights. McKellar believed they had succeeded where others had failed because they properly researched Saramago; he was suspicious of the film industry and had therefore resisted other studios' efforts to obtain the rights through large sums of money alone. Conditions set by Saramago were for the film to be set in a country that would not be recognizable to audiences, and that the canine in the novel, the Dog of Tears, should be a big dog. Meirelles originally envisioned doing the film in Portuguese similar to the novel's original language, but instead directed the film in English, saying, \\"If you do it in English you can sell it to the whole world and have a bigger audience.\\" Meirelles set the film in a contemporary large city, seemingly under a totalitarian government, as opposed to the novel that he believed took place in the 1940s (actually, the book is more likely to take place in the 80s or later, as evident by the fact that the characters stumble upon a store with modern appliances like microwave ovens and dishwashers, and referral to AIDS as a feared disease). Meirelles chose to make a contemporary film so audiences could relate to the characters. The director also sought a different allegorical approach. He described the novel as \\"very allegorical, like a fantasy outside of space, outside the world\\", and he instead took a naturalistic direction in engaging audiences to make the film less \\"cold.\\" Writing Don McKellar said about adapting the story, \\"None of the characters even have names or a history, which is very untraditional for a Hollywood story. The film, like the novel, directly addresses sight and point of view and asks you to see things from a different perspective.\\" McKellar wrote the script so audiences would see the world through the eyes of the protagonist, the doctor's wife. He sought to have them question the humanity of how she observes but does not act in various situations, including a rape scene. He consulted Saramago about why the wife took so long to act. McKellar noted, \\"He said she became aware of the responsibility that comes with seeing gradually, first to herself, then to her husband, then to her small family, then her ward, and finally to the world where she has to create a new civilization.\\" The screenwriter wrote out the \\"actions and circumstances\\" that would allow the wife to find her responsibility. While the completed script was mostly faithful to the novel, McKellar went through several drafts that were not. One such saw him veer away from the novel by creating names and backstories for all the characters. Another significantly changed the chronology. Only after these abortive attempts did McKellar decide to cut the backstories and focus primarily on the doctor and his wife. He attempted to reconnect with what originally drew him to the novel: what he called its \\"existential simplicity\\". The novel defines its characters by little more than their present actions; doing the same for the adaptation became \\"an interesting exercise\\" for McKellar. McKellar attended a summer camp for the blind as part of his research. He wanted to observe how blind people interacted in groups. He discovered that excessive expositional dialogue, usually frowned upon by writers, was essential for the groups. McKellar cut one of the last lines in the novel from his screenplay: \\"I don't think we did go blind, I think we are blind. Blind but seeing. Blind people who can see, but do not see.\\" McKellar believed viewers would by that point have already grasped the symbolism and didn't want the script to seem heavy-handed. He also toned down the visual cues in his screenplay, such as the \\"brilliant milky whiteness\\" of blindness described in the novel. McKellar knew he wanted a stylistically adept director and didn't want to be too prescriptive, preferring only to hint at an approach. Filming and casting Filming in S√£o Paulo Meirelles chose S√£o Paulo as the primary backdrop for Blindness, though scenes were also filmed in Osasco, Brazil; Guelph, Ontario, Canada; and Montevideo, Uruguay. With all the characters aside from Julianne Moore's character being blind, the cast was trained to simulate blindness. The director also stylized the film to reflect the lack of point of view that the characters would experience. Meirelles said several actors he talked to were intimidated by the concept of playing characters without names: \\"I offered the film to some actors who said, 'I can't play a character with no name, with no history, with no past. With Gael (Garc√≠a Bernal), he said, 'I never think about the past. I just think what my character wants.'\\"\\"Fall Movie Summer Preview, September: Blindness.\\" Entertainment Weekly, Iss. #1007/1008, August 22/29, 2008, pg.55. By September 2006, Fernando Meirelles was attached to Blindness, with the script being adapted by Don McKellar. Blindness, budgeted at $25 million as part of a Brazilian and Canadian co-production, was slated to begin filming in summer 2007 in the towns of S√£o Paulo and Guelph. Filming began in early July in S√£o Paulo and Guelph. Filming also took place in Montevideo, Uruguay. S√£o Paulo served as the primary backdrop for Blindness, as it is a city mostly unfamiliar to North American and European audiences. With its relative obscurity, the director sought S√£o Paulo as the film's generic location. Filming continued through autumn of 2007. The cast and crew included 700 extras who had to be trained to simulate blindness. Actor Christian Duurvoort from Meirelles' City of God led a series of workshops to coach the cast members. Duurvoort had researched the mannerisms of blind people to understand how they perceive the world and how they make their way through space. Duurvoort not only taught the extras mannerisms, but also to convey the emotional and psychological states of blind people. One technique was reacting to others as a blind person, whose reactions are usually different from those of a sighted person. Meirelles described, \\"When you're talking to someone, you see a reaction. When you're blind, the response is much flatter. What's the point [in reacting]?\\" Filmmaking style Director Fernando Meirelles alludes to Pieter Bruegel the Elder's 1568 painting The Parable of the Blind in the film Blindness. Meirelles acknowledged the challenge of making a film that would simulate the experience of blindness to the audience. He explained, \\"When you do a film, everything is related to point of view, to vision. When you have two characters in a dialogue, emotion is expressed by the way people look at each other, through the eyes. Especially in the cut, the edit. You usually cut when someone looks over. Film is all about point of view, and in this film there is none.\\" Similar to the book, blindness in the film serves as a metaphor for human nature's dark side: \\"prejudice, selfishness, violence and willful indifference.\\" With only one character's point of view available, Meirelles sought to switch the points-of-view throughout the film, seeing three distinct stylistic sections. The director began with an omniscient vantage point, transited to the intact viewpoint of the doctor's wife, and changed again to the Man with the Black Eye Patch, who connects the quarantined to the outside world with stories. The director concluded the switching with the combination of the perspective of the Doctor's Wife and the narrative of the Man with the Black Eye Patch. The film also contains visual cues, such as the 1568 painting The Parable of the Blind by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Allusions to other famous artworks are also made. Meirelles described the intent: \\"It's about image, the film, and vision, so I thought it makes sense to create, not a history of painting, because it's not, but having different ways of seeing things, from Rembrandt to these very contemporary artists. But it's a very subtle thing.\\" Release Theatrical run Prior to public release, Meirelles screened Blindness to test audiences. A screening of his first cut in Toronto resulted in ten percent of the audience, nearly 50 people, walking out of the film early. Meirelles ascribed the problem to a rape scene that takes place partway through the film, and edited the scene to be much shorter in the final cut. Meirelles explained his goal, \\"When I shot and edited these scenes, I did it in a very technical way, I worried about how to light it and so on, and I lost the sense of their brutality. Some women were really angry with the film, and I thought, 'Wow, maybe I crossed the line.' I went back not to please the audience but so they would stay involved until the end of the story.\\" He also found that a New York City test screening expressed concern about a victim in the film failing to take revenge; Meirelles ascribed this as a reflection of what Americans have learned to expect in their cinema. Focus Features acquired the right to handle international sales for Blindness. Path√© acquired UK and French rights to distribute the film, and Miramax Films won U.S. distribution rights with its $5 million bid. Blindness premiered as the opening film at the 61st Cannes Film Festival on May 14, 2008, where it received a \\"tepid reception\\". Straw polls of critics were \\"unkind\\" to the film. Blindness was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2008 as a Special Presentation. The film also opened at the Atlantic Film Festival on September 11, 2008, and had its North American theatrical release on October 3, 2008. Critical reception Despite being on a number of critics top 10 lists for 2008, the film has received mixed reviews overall, with a 44% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 158 reviews, and an average rating of 5.25/10. The consensus reads, \\"This allegorical disaster film about society's reaction to mass blindness is mottled and self-satisfied; provocative but not as interesting as its premise implies.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 45 out of 100 based on reviews from 31 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Screen International's Cannes screen jury which annually polls a panel of international film critics gave the film a 1.3 average out of 4, placing the film on the lower-tier of all the films screened at competition in 2008. Of the film critics from the Screen International Cannes critics jury, Alberto Crespi of the Italian publication L'Unit√†, Michel Ciment of French film magazine Positif and Dohoon Kim of South Korean film publication Cine21, all gave the film zero points (out of four). Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter described Blindness as \\"provocative but predictable cinema\\", startling but failing to surprise. Honeycutt criticized the film's two viewpoints: Julianne Moore's character, the only one who can see, is slow to act against atrocities, and the behavior of Danny Glover's character comes off as \\"slightly pompous\\". Honeycutt explained, \\"This philosophical coolness is what most undermines the emotional response to Meirelles' film. His fictional calculations are all so precise and a tone of deadly seriousness swamps the grim action.\\" Justin Chang of Variety described the film: \\"Blindness emerges onscreen both overdressed and undermotivated, scrupulously hitting the novel's beats yet barely approximating, so to speak, its vision.\\" Chang thought that Julianne Moore gave a strong performance but did not feel that the film captured the impact of Saramago's novel. Roger Ebert called Blindness \\"one of the most unpleasant, not to say unendurable, films I've ever seen.\\" A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated that, although it \\"is not a great film, ... it is, nonetheless, full of examples of what good filmmaking looks like.\\" Stephen Garrett of Esquire complimented Meirelles' unconventional style: \\"Meirelles [honors] the material by using elegant, artful camera compositions, beguiling sound design and deft touches of digital effects to accentuate the authenticity of his cataclysmic landscape.\\" Despite the praise, Garrett wrote that Meirelles' talent at portraying real-life injustice in City of God and The Constant Gardener did not suit him for directing the \\"heightened reality\\" of Saramago's social commentary. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called it \\"an intelligent, tightly constructed, supremely confident adaptation\\": \\"Meirelles, along with screenwriter Don McKellar and cinematographer Cesar Charlone, have created an elegant, gripping and visually outstanding film. It responds to the novel's notes of apocalypse and dystopia, and its disclosure of a spiritual desert within the modern city, but also to its persistent qualities of fable, paradox and even whimsy.\\" \\"Blindness is a drum-tight drama, with superb, hallucinatory, images of urban collapse. It has a real coil of horror at its centre, yet is lightened with gentleness and humour. It reminded me of George A Romero's Night of the Living Dead, and Peter Shaffer's absurdist stage-play Black Comedy. This is bold, masterly, film-making.\\" The Boston Globe's Wesley Morris raved about the leading actress: \\"Julianne Moore is a star for these terrible times. She tends to be at her best when the world is at its worst. And things are pretty bad in \\"Blindness,\\" a perversely enjoyable, occasionally harrowing adaptation of Jos√© Saramago's 1995 disaster allegory. [...] \\"Blindness\\" is a movie whose sense of crisis feels right on time, even if the happy ending feels like a gratuitous emotional bailout. Meirelles ensures that the obviousness of the symbolism (in the global village the blind need guidance!) doesn't negate the story's power, nor the power of Moore's performance. The more dehumanizing things get, the fiercer she becomes.\\" The film appeared on some critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008. Bill White of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer named it the 5th best film of 2008, and Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle named it the 8th best film of 2008.  Author's reaction  Meirelles screened the movie privately for Saramago. When the movie ended, Saramago was in tears, and said: \\"Fernando, I am as happy to have seen this movie as I was the day I finished the book.\\" Protests The film has been strongly criticized by several organizations representing the blind community. Dr. Marc Maurer, President of the National Federation of the Blind, said: \\"The National Federation of the Blind condemns and deplores this film, which will do substantial harm to the blind of America and the world.\\" A press release from the American Council of the Blind said \\"...it is quite obvious why blind people would be outraged over this movie. Blind people do not behave like uncivilized, animalized creatures.\\" The National Federation of the Blind announced plans to picket theaters in at least 21 states, in the largest protest in the organization's 68-year history. Jos√© Saramago has described his novel as allegorically depicting \\"a blindness of rationality\\". He dismissed the protests, stating that \\"stupidity doesn't choose between the blind and the non-blind.\\" See also *The Day of the Triffids, the 1951 John Wyndham novel (and its many adaptations) about societal collapse following widespread blindness. *\\"Many, Many Monkeys\\", an episode from The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series) with a similar premise. *The Country of the Blind a short story by H.G.

She first appeared in Countdown #46 (August 2007), and was created by Jimmy Palmiotti, Justin Gray and Jesus Saiz. Fictional character biography Viza Aziv's origin story, as well as the history of her race, is depicted in Countdown to Adventure #1. The Forerunners' planet is the Earth of an alternate universe, ravaged by years of destructive war. The other \\"Nine Houses\\" (planets and dwarf planets) of the Solar System declared the planet a War World in which they would battle for occupancy. Survivors of the wars - the strongest and fittest - remained on the planet and interbred, unknowingly guided to do so by the Monitors. The process produced the Forerunners, a species possessing traits of the beings from other planets such as Green Martians and Saturnians. When the Nine Houses decided that the Forerunners were a threat that had to be eliminated, the Monitors intervened and formed a pact with the Nine Houses: the Monitors would keep the Forerunners from moving against the Nine Houses. For their own purposes, the Monitors would appoint one Forerunner as their Instrument of Righteous Death whom they also called Harbinger. Viza is a member of a genetically engineered race of warriors tasked with serving the Monitors, and was assigned by a Monitor to kill anomalous beings inhabiting the Multiverse. In her first appearance, she battled Jason Todd and Donna Troy during their investigation of the death of Duela Dent.Countdown #46 (June 2007) After failing to eliminate the two, she was denounced by one of the Monitors and suffered a crisis of confidence. Vowing to stay on Earth until she regained the trust of the Monitors, Forerunner was later contacted by Captain Atom (now called Monarch) who recruited her to aid him in his plans. He accused the Monitors of deploying a Harbinger, Dark Angel, to wipe out the Forerunner race. Monarch granted Forerunner an entire Bleed-based armada with which to wage war against the Monitors.Counting down with Mike Marts: Countdown #45 - Newsarama Countdown to Final Crisis Monarch discloses that Viza Aziv was chosen as the Monitors' warrior because they feared something in her: she was an unexpected outcome of the breeding program which created the Forerunners. Viza is sent by Monarch to recruit the JLA's of Earth-10 and the Conjurers of Earth-33. The Conjurers were forewarned of Viza's arrival by Dark Angel, who disguised herself as an Oracle. Forerunner is captured, Dark Angel reveals herself; Forerunner ultimately strikes her down. Dark Angel escapes; when Monarch arrives Viza rebukes his attempts to gather new recruits. When they return to the Bleed, Monarch attacks Forerunner for questioning his authority. She attacks him, but realizes that damaging Monarch's suit would unleash a catastrophic explosion, and she relents. Monarch informs Forerunner that the Arena tournament is about to begin, and that he doesn't need her services any longer. He teleports her to an unknown region of space. Forerunner is rescued by a passing freight ship, which is attacked by pirates. Forerunner boards the pirate ship, kills the captain, and evicts all non-necessary crew members. The ship is attacked by a Thanagarian fleet. The flagship, seeking the ship's original captain, demands her surrender. In response, Forerunner challenges their leader, Golden Eagle, to single combat. Viza invokes the law of choice, a custom on her home world, empowering the victor to take any prize they desire. After defeating Eagle and his troops, Viza takes him as her prize; he's an initially unwilling sex slave. The ship reaches the Source Wall, which has a gaping hole at its center. The crew encounter an Earth space shuttle with a young boy in cryogenic stasis, whom they bring aboard. Forerunner commands the crew to pass through the wall, where they see Monarch's forces battling the Monitors. Forerunner locates the Monitors' base, which leads to events seen in Countdown to Final Crisis #15: she attacks the Monitor named Solomon; Superman-Prime arrives and brutally bests her. In #13, she attacks Solomon again while Prime fights Monarch, again to no avail. Before Solomon can finish her, Darkseid appears, and convinces Solomon to join him on Apokolips. After returning to the ship, Forerunner is told that passing through the Source Wall depleted the ships energy reserves, and that they only have forty-eight hours of power and oxygen left. The ship ends up trapped in no-space, and the crew are contacted by a sentient planet, who offers them the fuel they need in return for escorting a young planet across the sector. During the trip, they are attacked, and, at the young planet's request, Forerunner places a drop of her blood onto its land, allowing it to create antibodies from her DNA. When their task is completed, it is revealed that the young planet will soon make a new Forerunner race from Viza's blood. Viza decides to stay with the planet, and become the new race's Thought Mother. Powers and abilities Viza Aziv possesses considerable superhuman strength and resistance to injury. She was able to resist gunfire from an automatic rifle and is tough enough that Donna Troy was injured simply by punching her. Forerunner can move at speeds well in excess to that of a normal human being. Her rate of acceleration and maximum velocity has yet to be determined but she was fast enough that a normal human could not follow her movement. However, it seems, while generally faster than a normal human, these feats of considerable superhuman speed are only temporary boosts. Because of the general life-style of her species she has excessive weapon and hand-to-hand combat training. She has defeated numerous Supermen in the Multiverse although she proved no match for Superman-Prime. She possesses telepathy and the ability to become temporarily invisible, presumably from her Martian ancestry. She has also been seen throwing various types of spikes at enemies. Viza also wears gloves with sharply tipped fingers that she can use as a weapon to slash at enemies.

For several years he was on the WABC 77 morning show, with Curtis Sliwa and Ron Kuby in New York City. He did periodic news updates throughout the morning, as well as joining in conversation with the hosts about those news stories. He was found stabbed to death in his home on March 20, 2009, at the age of 47. Career Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Weber began his radio career at WBUX (AM) in Doylestown. He then went on to WAEB in Allentown, where he worked for two and a half years as a reporter and news anchor. After contacting Phil Boyce, then news director at Denver station KIMN, he received an offer to be a street reporter and anchor with that station. Two and a half years later (after KIMN's demise) Weber went to crosstown rival KOA, where he began a new career as the host of a night-time talk show. Some other important stops on his way to a full-time job with WABC were KGO, KOGO, KTLK, and KMPC. As a former tobacco user, he has been featured in radio advertisements for KickTheHabitNow.com. Weber was fired by WABC at the same time as John R. Gambling in February 2008. Financial problems at ABC, coupled with the fact that ABC's new morning show Imus in the Morning had its own newsman, Charles McCord, led to his dismissal. In April 2008, Weber obtained a new assignment doing news updates for the ABC Radio Network. Personal life A number of Weber's stories and investigations were based around experiences in his private life. He often reported about his neighborhood in New York and his two dogs featured in some of his stories. The last story on his website was published on the same day he died, March 20, 2009, and described an outbreak of bed bugs around his Carroll Gardens neighborhood. Murder On Friday, March 20, 2009, George Weber was killed in his Brooklyn apartment on Henry Street in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn.Hauser, Christine; and Moynihan, Colin. \\"16-Year-Old Arrested in Killing of Radio Journalist in Brooklyn\\", The New York Times, March 25, 2009. Accessed October 18, 2017. \\"Mr. Weber, 47, who recently had been working as a freelance anchor for ABC News Radio, the national network, was found in his apartment in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, on Sunday.\\" A co-worker became concerned when he didn't show up for work on Saturday, so police were dispatched to Weber's apartment on Sunday at 12:30am, but they noticed nothing amiss, and left. When the co-worker called again at 8:30 a.m., cops returned to the building, where a neighbor said he heard water running in the newsman's apartment all night. Police entered the apartment and discovered Weber's body, with his hands and feet bound. Weber had been stabbed more than 50 times in the neck, chest and arms, and his guest bedroom had been ransacked. The water was still running in the apartment's bathtub and kitchen sink, and investigators believe Weber's killer used the water to clean himself after the murder. Authorities said there was no sign of forced entry. On March 25 police arrested 16-year-old student John Katehis of East Elmhurst, Queens, New York for the murder. He was lured to a rendezvous with detectives by his father, who promised to give him $300, and was arrested without incident. Katehis confessed to the crime when apprehended, also claiming to be a Satanist and a sadomasochist. Katehis told police that he and Weber had met through a personal ad Weber had posted on Craigslist for \\"rough sex,\\" but stabbed Weber in self-defense after Weber tried to stab him. This led to the media referring to Katehis as a Craigslist killer. Katehis was charged as an adult with second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon, and pleaded not guilty, despite his confession. Katehis's lawyer claimed there was an ongoing relationship between Weber and Katehis.\\"Confessed Teen Slayer Pleads Not Guilty\\", nypost.com, March 26, 2009. Following a mistrial, Katehis was convicted in 2011 at retrial, and sentenced to 25 years to life. Author David McConnell, in his book American Honor Killings: Desire and Rage Among Men explored the Katehis case as a main example of lethal hate crimes on homosexual men where the perpetrators exhibited some degree of homosexuality themselves.

(2000). \\"American Canals as a Source of Revitalization\\". The millennium link: the rehabilitation of the Forth & Clyde and Union Canals. London: Thomas Telford. pp. 48‚Äì51. In 1969, the American Society of Civil Engineers declared him the \\"Father of American Civil Engineering\\".  Life and career  Wright was born in Wethersfield, Connecticut, to Ebenezer Wright and Grace Butler. In 1789, at age 19, he moved with his family to Fort Stanwix (now Rome, New York), where he became a land surveyor. In the next decennia, he worked as a land surveyor and engineer, especially on the construction of the Erie Canal and later on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. In addition to his engineering work, Wright was also elected to the New York State Legislature in 1794 and was appointed a New York county judge. Wright returned to New York in about 1833. He continued to work primarily as a consultant on a number of canal projects, but also began doing surveys for railroads, which were in the early stages of development at the time. Wright married Philomela Waterman on September 27, 1798; they had nine children (five of whom became civil engineers). One of them, Benjamin Hall Wright (1801-1881) went to West Point and graduated as part of the Class of 1822. As a civil engineer, the younger Wright promoted the establishment of Railroads in the Island of Cuba, with the survey the Havana-Guines railroad in 1834. He was also involved with the engineering of the Cardenas and Bemba Railroad, Cuba in 1836 and of Nuevitas and Puerto Principe Railroad (1837‚Äë42). \\"Register of Officers and Graduates of the United States Military Academy, Class of 1819\\", Cullum's Register, created by W. Thayer. The elder Benjamin Wright is buried in the New York Marble Cemetery in Manhattan.  Projects   Oneida and Oswego counties  Wright began his career surveying the frontier areas of Oneida and Oswego counties.Benjamin Wright, 1770-1842 - American Society of Civil Engineers, 1996-2014. Accessed 10.2014 In 1794 Wright was hired as a surveyor and planner by the noted English canal designer William Weston. Working for Weston, he helped lay out canals and locks on the Mohawk River. After Weston returned to England in 1801, Wright was commissioned to survey the Mohawk River between Schenectady and Rome, and then to the Hudson River. Wright initially surveyed of the Mohawk River from Rome to the Hudson River on behalf of the Western Inland Lock Navigation Company, but that company didn't have the resources to build the canal. Profile of the original Erie Canal, ca 1830s.  Erie Canal  Wright surveyed the same route of the Mohawk River from Rome to the Hudson River again for the New York State Canal Commission in 1811, and by 1816 funding for the Erie Canal was in place. Its construction began in 1817. The ASCE (1996) explained: :What crested challenges for the canal construction were the multiple elevation changes along the route. Hence, the supply of water to the canal and the drainage of excess water were far trickier than single sloped canals. To keep water flowing, an elaborate system of feeders and waste weirs was created. Furthermore, the east-west canal had to transverse multiple north-south running rivers, which called for numerous aqueducts, the largest employing 11 Roman-style arches to span 802 feet across the Genesee River Valley. The following year Wright was appointed senior engineer in charge of construction of the middle section of the Erie Canal, and later, he was placed in charge of the eastern section as well. He led thousands of unskilled laborers as they built the canal with wheelbarrows, hand tools, horses, and mules. In Wright's honor, the first boat to traverse the canal system was named the Chief Engineer.  Other canal work  Proposed route of Chesapeake and Ohio Canal In 1822 Wright was engaged by the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Company to be the canal's chief engineer. While holding that position, he caused John Randel Jr. - who had surveyed the route taken by the canal, and who had been hired as an engineer to build its difficult eastern section - to be fired by the company. Randel sued the company for breach of contract, and tried to sue Wright as well, but that case was thrown out. In 1834 a jury returned an award to Randel of $226,885.84 (), a tremendous amount for the time. The canal company's appeals went as high as the United States Supreme Court, which affirmed the award. The company attempted to avoid paying the judgment, but the state legislatures of both Maryland and Delaware passed bills requiring the canal company to pay off its debts within five years. The huge award almost bankrupted the company. Wright was approached in 1825 by the Wurts brothers of Philadelphia to survey a possible route from the coalfields of Northeastern Pennsylvania to the Hudson, where anthracite could be shipped by boat downriver to New York City. Wright consented, and served as chief engineer on the Delaware and Hudson Canal for about a year. At that point, he stepped down and became a consulting engineer; the job of chief was taken by John B. Jervis, who had worked under Wright on the Erie Canal. In 1828, Wright was made Chief Engineer of the newly organized Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, which operated on a route along the Potomac River between Washington, D.C. and Cumberland, Maryland. Within a year, Wright had let contracts for a massive construction effort that encompassed about 6,000 men and 700 horses.

The Billung March was formed in 936, when Otto II, Duke of Saxony and King of East Francia, made Hermann Billung (margrave, literally \\"prince of the militia\\"), granting him control of the border with rule over the West Slavic Obotrite tribes, including the Polabians, Warnabi and Wagri, as well as the Redarii, Circipani, and Kissini tribes of the Veleti confederation, and the Danes, who had repeatedly campaigned the territory.Thompson, 487. This event is recalled by the Annales Corbeienses, Widukind of Corvey, Thietmar of Merseburg, and Adam of Bremen. Major parts of the land of the Liutizi and the Hevelli lay beyond Hermann's sphere in the . The Slavs of this region were often mutually hostile and so no organised resistance was met. Nevertheless, in 955 the Obotrite chief Nako took the chance and allied with Hermann's nephews, the Saxon counts Wichmann the Younger and Egbert the One-Eyed in their domestic quarrel with their uncle. Their open revolt culminated in the Battle on the Recknitz, where the Obotrites were completely defeated by King Otto's troops. Hermann was given a great deal of autonomy in his march and he is sometimes called the \\"Duke of Saxony\\", a title which was actually held by Otto, because of the great deal of authority the king delegated to him as his deputy. The disjointedness of the Germanisation of the eastern marches led to many centuries of warfare; the Roman Catholic Church, however, \\"more foresighted than the crown ... made use of the tithe in the colonial lands from the very beginning.\\"Thompson, 487. Ecclesiastical policy led to earlier and longer-lasting Christianisation than Germanisation. Like the adjacent Northern March, the March of Billung was finally abandoned following the uprising of the Obotrites and Veleti in 983. Sources *Thompson, James Westfall.

Life St Molua was an Irish priest of the 6th century who like Columba and Gall trained in the monastery at Bangor, County Down (about twelve miles from Belfast). The saint's real name was originally Lughaidh (pronounced Lua).

Molua was the founder of Killaloe (), which bears his name Lua. Molua had his oratory on Friar's Island, later replaced by a stone church near the present village of Killaloe. Like most Irish saints he appears to have been very hospitable, believing that in entertaining others he was entertaining Christ.

Twelve years after its establishment, Vogt set up production with John Harwood, inventor of the automatic wristwatch. In 1926, Fortis released the patented Harwood Automatic, the first self-winding wristwatch, at Baselworld. In 1937, Fortis commemorated the company's 25th anniversary by manufacturing and marketing its first chronographs, including the Rolls and the Autorist. The Autorist was also designed by John Harwood and used the movement of the strap to power the watch. By 1943, Fortis introduced some of the world's first waterproof watches with the Fortissimo models. Official Cosmonauts Chronograph Automatic photo. Lemania 5100 movt. Fortis B-42 Marinemaster, Official Cosmonauts 20 ATM , PVD Titanium coated , carbon fiber dial, Powered by Automatic ETA-2836-2 In 1962 the Spacematic automatic was constructed to hold up in extreme conditions and temperature changes. The watch was tested by the seven members of a US space mission. In 1994 Fortis introduced strict endurance tests. This same year the Star City Training Center chose the Fortis Official Cosmonauts Chronograph as part of its issued equipment. Fortis automatic wristwatches have proven their space capability inside and outside of the protection of the space station. Since 1994 Fortis has been the exclusive supplier of manned space missions authorized by the Russian Federal Space Agency. In 1997 the same watch, the Fortis Official Cosmonauts Chronograph, became the official watch of the German-Russian space mission MIR 97. During Fortis' 75th anniversary year, it introduced a new edition of the Flieger automatic collection. In 2004, the Flieger Chronograph was awarded the inaugural trophy of the European Aviation Watch of the Year. Fortis has supplied unique watches to many military squadrons worldwide, including: *Jagdgeschwader (Germany) * Swiss 11 Fighters (Switzerland) * Hellenic Tigers (Greece) * NATO Forces (Hungary) * Immelmann 51 (Germany) * Thunder Tiger Aerobatic Team (Taiwan) * Papa Squadron (Hungary) In 1994, Fortis became the equipment supplier of the Juri-Gagarin-Kosmonautentrainingszentrums, which is a cosmonaut training centre in Russia. During a docking manoeuvre of the U.S. Space Shuttle Atlantis in September 1994, the model \\"Official Cosmonauts Chronograph\\" was worn on the space station Mir by the cosmonauts during the mission Sojus TM-19. In 1998, FORTIS launched the development of the world's automatic chronograph with mechanical alarm function, which was patented with the patent number EP 0806712. The construction of this watch was done by Zurich watch engineer Paul Gerber. In 2017, FORTIS experienced some financial difficulties. The company filed for definitive debt restructuring moratorium. Soon afterwards, the company brand and location was taken over by a private investor and FORTIS fan, Mr. Jupp Philipp. This led to the renaming of FORTIS Uhren AG into FORTIS Watches AG.

It is an advanced derivative of Alenia Aeronautica's earlier G.222 (C-27A Spartan in U.S. service), equipped with the engines and various other systems also used on the larger Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules. In addition to the standard transport configuration, specialized variants of the C-27J have been developed for maritime patrol, search and rescue, C3 ISR (command, control, communications, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), fire support and electronic warfare and ground-attack missions. In 2007, the C-27J was selected as the Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA) for the United States military; these were produced in an international teaming arrangement under which L-3 Communications served as the prime contractor. In 2012, the United States Air Force (USAF) elected to retire the C-27J after only a short service life due to budget cuts; they were later reassigned to the U.S. Coast Guard and United States Special Operations Command. The C-27J has also been ordered by the military air units of Australia, Bulgaria, Chad, Italy, Greece, Kenya, Lithuania, Mexico, Morocco, Peru, Romania, Slovakia, and Zambia (on order). Design and development In 1995, Alenia and Lockheed Martin began discussions to improve Alenia's G.222 using C-130J's glass cockpit and a more powerful version of the G.222's T64G engine and four-blade propellers. In 1996, a program began on an improved G.222, named C-27J; it used a U.S. military type designation based on the G.222's C-27A designation. In 1997, Alenia and Lockheed Martin formed Lockheed Martin Alenia Tactical Transport Systems (LMATTS) to develop the C-27J. The design changed to use the C-130J Super Hercules's Rolls-Royce AE 2100 engine and six-blade propeller.Frawley, Gerald. \\"LMATTS C-27J Spartan\\". The International Directory of Military Aircraft, 2002/2003. Fishwyck, ACT: Aerospace Publications, 2002. . Other changes include a fully digital MIL- STD-1553 systems and avionics architecture, and an updated cargo compartment for increased commonality. The C-27J has a 35% increase in range and a 15% faster cruise speed than the G.222. A C-27J Spartan on the assembly line in Italy By 2005, the U.S. Army had identified the need to replace its aging Short C-23 Sherpa lifter. In lieu of adequate fixed-wing airlift availability, the CH-47 helicopter fleet was being worked hard on the \\"last tactical mile\\" to supply forward-placed troops; thus the U.S. Army sought the C-27J for its direct support capabilities, and to reduce demands on the CH-47 fleet. In 2006, LMATTS was dissolved when Lockheed Martin offered the C-130J in 2006 as a contender in the same U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA) competition in which the C-27J was competing.Fulghum, David and Andy Nativi. \\"LM To Join JCA Competition With Four-Engine Offering.\\" Aviation Week, 1 May 2006.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed October 5, 2012 tributary of the Minnesota River in western Minnesota in the United States. Via the Minnesota River, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of in an agricultural region. The headwaters region of the Pomme de Terre River is the northernmost extremity of the Minnesota River's watershed. Etymology The name Pomme de Terre is French and means literally \\"soil apple,\\" usually meaning \\"potato.\\" In this case, the river was named by early French explorers for a different root vegetable, the potato-like prairie turnip (Psoralea esculenta), which was commonly eaten by the Sioux. Geography The Pomme de Terre River issues from Stalker Lake in Tordenskjold Township, approximately three miles (5 km) northeast of Dalton in southern Otter Tail County, and flows generally southwardly through eastern Grant and Stevens Counties and western Swift County, through the cities of Barrett, Morris, and Appleton. It flows into Marsh Lake on the Minnesota River in southwestern Swift County, approximately four miles (6 km) southwest of Appleton. Marsh Lake was formed by a backup of water caused by the Pomme de Terre's delta, and is presently maintained by a manmade dam. In its upper course the river flows through a morainic region of numerous lakes, in a course characterized by meadows and wooded hills, as well as marshy stretches near areas where the river passes through lakes. The largest lakes on the river include Ten Mile Lake in Otter Tail County; Pomme de Terre and Barrett Lakes in Grant County; and Perkins Lake in Stevens County. The water levels of several lakes on the river's course are maintained by small dams. Downstream of Morris, the river flows on till plains between eroding banks and becomes increasingly turbid. According to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, approximately 81% of the land in the Pomme de Terre River's watershed is used for agriculture; of this area, half is used for the cultivation of corn and soybeans, and 43% for that of hay and small grains. Flow rate At the United States Geological Survey's stream gauge in Appleton, eight miles (13 km) upstream from the river's mouth, the annual mean flow of the river between 1931 and 2005 was 132 cubic feet per second (4 m¬≥/s). The highest recorded flow during the period, resulting in part from a dam failure, was 8,890 ft¬≥/s (252 m¬≥/s) on April 7, 1997. Readings of zero were recorded on numerous days during several years.

It served the Oregon Country of the Pacific Northwest of North America from 1843 until early 1849 at a time when no country had sovereignty over the region. This democratically elected legislature became the Oregon Territorial Legislature when the territorial authorities arrived after the creation of the Oregon Territory by the United States in 1848. The body was first termed the Legislative Committee and later renamed the House of Representatives. Over the course of its six-year history the legislature passed laws, including taxation and liquor regulation, and created an army to deal with conflicts with Native Americans. Many of the legislators would become prominent figures during the territorial years of Oregon. At first the body was a small committee of nine people, but the group was altered when the Organic Laws of Oregon were revised in 1845 with the legislative branch of the Provisional Government becoming the Oregon House of Representatives with a minimum of 13 members. Once the government was dissolved in 1849, all the laws remained in effect, except for the one that authorized the minting of coins. Territorial Governor Joseph Lane nullified that law, because it was in conflict with Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution, giving Congress the sole right to coin money, thus ending production of the Beaver Coins. Background On May 2, 1843, by a vote of 52 to 50, the European American settlers of the Oregon Country (mainly those from the Willamette Valley), created a provisional government at Champoeg.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. In May and June, a nine-person committee met in Oregon City and drafted the Organic Laws of Oregon as a pseudo-constitution that was subsequently ratified on July 5, 1843.Gray, William H.

O'Neil, Robert Moore, William H. Gray, William P. Dougherty, David Hill, Robert Shortess, Thomas J. Hubbard, Robert Newell, and Alanson Beers met for three days to draft laws.Oregon Legislative Assembly (2nd Pre-Provisional) 1843 Meetings The group met again for two days starting on June 16, with George LeBreton serving as the recorder and Moore as the chairman for both sets of meetings. The laws drafted became the Organic Laws of Oregon and were ratified on July 5. Committees on land claims, appropriations, military, the judiciary, and districting were also formed at that meeting. The organic laws were based on the laws of Iowa Territory.Oregon Legislative Assembly History. Oregon State Archives. Retrieved on February 17, 2012. The document outlined the legislative branch and its powers, vested in a unicameral or single body. At that time the title of the legislature was the Legislative Committee and it consisted of nine elected representatives apportioned by population to the four established districts (which later became counties). The Organic Laws required the legislature to meet in June and December of each year. 1844 The first meeting of the 1844 legislature took place June 18 at the home of Felix Hathaway in Oregon City.Oregon Legislative Assembly (3rd Pre- Provisional) 1844 Meetings.

This session lasted until June 27, and another session was held from December 16 to 21 at the residence of John E. Long, also in Oregon City. At the December meeting, Executive Committee members Peter G. Stewart and Osborne Russell presented a message to the group regarding the opposing claims of the United States and Great Britain. Among the laws passed during the 1844 session was the \\"Lash Law\\", which banned Blacks from living in the territory with violators subject to 20‚Äì39 lashes across the back every six months, until the person left the region.

After this, the Organic Laws were replaced with the Organic Act of 1845, which altered the legislature in several ways. First the number of representatives was increased to include a minimum of 13 and a maximum of 61. Second, the name was changed to the House of Representatives. All members of the body were to be elected by popular vote with vacancies filled using special elections. The body also received new powers to impeach any civil official by a 3/4ths vote, apportion the legislators among the districts, create post offices, levy taxes, declare war, organize and call out the militia, create lower courts, pass laws concerning the general welfare of the region, regulate trade with the Native Americans, regulate liquor sale and manufacture, and regulate the police power of the government, among other powers.

Beginning on February 5, a session was organized that conducted the final business of the Provisional Government. The session lasted until February 16. During this session a law forbidding the sale of firearms and supplies to Native Americans was repealed, and a law was passed to authorize the minting of gold coins. The law concerning the coins allowed for the creation of the Beaver Coins, which had a higher gold content than United States minted coins.

Plot Lord Will Arlington- Spencer (Martin Kemp) and his best friend, actor Tom Marks (Chris Barrie) are actually a pair of confidence tricksters who have carried out various scams in the name of restoring the economy of England, including selling London's Tower Bridge several times over. During their escapades, they are hounded by Inspector Jarvis (Dennis Waterman), a police officer determined to prove the pair are crooks. After one close call too many, Will asks Margaret Thatcher for assistance, and she takes away not only Jarvis' job, but also his pension. Feeling responsible, Will takes Jarvis on as his manservant, and over time he and Tom lose touch. Years later, the (fictional) British Space Agency unveils a prototype highly secret robotic Lunar Explorer. Fiona Arlington-Spencer (Joanna Taylor), Will's niece and a publicist for the BSA is secretly working with Tom's son Travis (Stefan Booth), a computer hacker, and they plan to steal the Explorer and sell it to both the Chinese and Russians. Unfortulately because they lack the plan and resources to pull off this job, they approach Will for help. Will agrees and reaches out to Tom and the two reunite. However, Will reveals that although he is not a policeman anymore, he suspects Jarvis is still trying to prove Will and Tom are crooks. An initial plan is made to sell to the Chinese and take the money before they can see the Explorer, however the Chinese are wary of the British (largely due to Will and Toms exploits in the past), and refuse to discuss a price until they see the Explorer in person. Realising there is no other way, the team plan to steal the Explorer from the BSA. Unfortunately, Travis is kidnapped by impatient Russian goons as 'encouragement' for the sale, but because they need his help, Will and Tom trade an unsuspecting Jarvis for Travis. They successfully infiltrate the BSA at night, break through the Agency's security and steal the plans only to find the Explorer shown during the unveiling is a large polystyrene block, part of a Stage illusion. It is revealed that whole project is a con: the vehicle exists only as a table-top model, due to budgetary constraints. To carry through the plan, they decide to construct the vehicle themselves, but before they do the Russians agree to release Jarvis because he was annoying them. Over lunch, Jarvis comes to Will and asks to be cut in, having had enough of being on the outside, and Will agrees. After acquiring an assortment of second-hand parts, and basing the entire vehicle on a motorised lawn mower, they soon create a full-sized Explorer. The Russians are convinced enough to hand over the money, which as part of the plan, Jarvis takes away before the deal is closed. The Russians leave but it is revealed that they have driven away with the polystyrene block. Will and Tom reveal they are changing the plan: they intend to now destroy the Explorer, which despite being a fake was built using the genuine plans, to prevent it falling into foreign hands. The Russians quickly discover they were duped, and try to make off with the Explorer, but Will, Tom and Travis are able to escape with the vehicle. During a chase, the vehicle falls apart and is finally sunk in a flooded quarry. The group manage to evade police and Russians, but Jarvis still has the money. It is revealed that whilst prisoner, Jarvis and his Russian captors (2 lowly grunts) made plans to take the money themselves. However Will had suspected this all along, and thanks to a careful trick Jarvis and the Russian grunts are caught and arrested by Inspector Covington (Alison King), and Jarvis is imprisoned for masterminding the theft. The money is turned over to the Director (Brian Blessed) of the Agency, revealed to be a friend of Will and was aware of the plan all along, who now plans to actually complete the project.

The band's main community and offices are located on the Semiahmoo Indian Reserve which is sandwiched between the boundary of White Rock, British Columbia and the Canada‚ÄìUnited States boundary and Peace Arch Provincial Park.  History   Demographics  In 1790, Europeans estimated the Semiahmoo population at 300. By 1854, the band's numbers were reduced to 250 due to smallpox and warfare. In 1909 there were 38 band members in British Columbia. In 1963, the number had reached 28 and then just 25 by 1971. Between 1996 and 2001, the reserve population dropped 34.5 per cent, from 200 people to 131, and currently they have 98 registered members and 53 members who live on site The Semiahmoo remain one of the smallest First Nations in the region with about 74 band members, of whom 40 live on Reserve. In fact, Semiahmoo has more non-Aboriginals living on its reserve than band members. As of 2003, the median age of the Semiahmoo population was 42.5 years: higher than the average for all people living on Indian Reserves in Greater Vancouver (which was 39.2 years).  Reserve and governance  The Semiahmoo Reserve was established by the Canadian government in 1887. Renowned Haida artist Robert Davidson currently works from a studio on the reserve. From 1942 to 1996, or more than half the reserve's area was leased by the band to the Municipality of Surrey for recreational \\"parkland\\" purposes. The City of White Rock and the City of Surrey both used the land, known as \\"Semiahmoo Park\\" for landfill and municipal infrastructure purposes. In 2014, the First Nation announced that it was endeavouring to remediate the soil which was contaminated by the municipalities' usage.  Relations with federal government  In 2003/04, the Semiahmoo received $243,500 in federal funding.First Nation Detail , Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, Retrieved on June 18, 2007 In 2006, the Semihamoo reserve was listed by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada as a high-priority community for drinking-water improvements.

Backgrounder - Priority List of First Nation Communities With High Risk Water Systems and Drinking Water Advisories , Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, March 21, 2006, Retrieved on June 19, 2007 In 2014, the First Nation criticized the federal government's new requirements for annual public transparency about the band's expenditures. Until the new regulations took effect, the most recent public financial documents were related to 2006 ($225,792 in federal funding). Although the band claimed to have mailed their report by the November 2014 deadline, the federal government had listed them among the 42 bands that had not submitted information. In August 2015, shortly after the start of the federal election campaign, the Semiahmoo First Nation's financial report received national attention due to the $267,309 tax-free remuneration in 2013/14 to Chief Willard Cook which may have represented the highest compensation to a politician in Canada.  Treaty negotiations  A June 2003 report for the Greater Vancouver Regional District indicated that the Semiahmoo First Nation is not affiliated with any tribal council and is not involved in treaty negotiations. However, a 2007 newspaper article said that the Semiahmoo First Nation and three other First Nations (Tsartlip, Tsawout and Pauquachin) make up the Sencot'en Alliance, which says their traditional territory stretches south to the northern end of Puget Sound, including both the San Juan Islands and the Gulf Islands, across southern Vancouver Island to include sites north of the Canada/U.S. border, on the lower Fraser River and on all adjacent land.

Removal of the remaining swings would follow soon after. In 2010, the Semiahmoo First Nation erected a 6 foot high fence that extends east from the reservation and follows the length of their land to prohibit access by non-band members. In addition to restricting access to band land, this fence also prevents access to all East beach areas and certain areas of the Little Campbell River. In 2013, the First Nation threatened legal action if the City of Surrey approved construction of a $100 million casino (a developer's proposal eventually refused by city council) near King George Boulevard a few kilometres away from the reserve. Concerns were that it might affect the First Nation's plans to build a five-star hotel, conference centre and gaming centre on the reserve near the US border. In 2015, Semiahmoo appealed to the City of Surrey for connection to the Metro Vancouver water system after the City of White Rock announced future termination of their city's water system connection to the Indian Reserve. In 2018, Semiahmoo struck a deal with the City of Surrey, who will provide water and sewage connection to Semiahmoo in 2019; infrastructure upgrades are underway.  Aboriginal policing  The Surrey detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police provides policing service through the Surrey First Nation Policing Service to both the Semiahmoo First Nation and Tsawwassen First Nation under tripartite framework agreements. The Provincial Auxiliary Constable Program has five Auxiliary Constables on the reserve. The Semiahmoo First Nation uses an Apology Ceremony to deal with minor offences committed within the community. The offender must make an apology to the victim and those who have been affected. The offender provides a gift to the victims and prepares a meal. After the gift is presented a meal is provided that is prepared by the offender. The Chief and Council, Elders, and community members are involved in the ceremony.Community Profiles > Southwest District >Surrey (Semiahmoo), Aboriginal Policing Services 'E' Division, RCMP website, Retrieved on June 13, 2007 See also * Coast Salish peoples * Musqueam Indian Band * Kwantlen First Nation * Lummi * Halkomelem (language) * North Straits Salish (language) * Sto:lo Nation * Tsawwassen First Nation  References  * A Profile of Aboriginal People, First Nations and Indian Reserves in Greater Vancouver, Policy and Planning Department, Greater Vancouver Regional District, June 2003  External links  * First Nation Profile - Semihamoo First Nation Details, Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada * Semiahmoo First Nation - BC Assembly of First Nations * Semiahmoo Wiki - a joint project of Surrey School District, White Rock Museum and Archives and the Semiahmoo First Nation * The Semiahmoo People - a website based on the unpublished Sociology Anthropology Master's thesis by Surrey resident and teacher Jack Brown Category:Coast Salish governments Category:First Nations governments in the Lower Mainland ","title":"Semiahmoo First Nation"},{"id":"11761200","text":"John Cornwell may refer to: *Jack Cornwell (1900‚Äì1916), British sailor posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry at the Battle of Jutland *John J.

Pitt alumni began a fund raising campaign to construct a sorely needed new building. The campaign was deemed a smashing success in that it raised $670,000 ($ in dollars), at the time $70,000 more than was needed due at least in part to both the excitement of alumni with the championship caliber play of the Pitt football team (national champions or undefeated in 1910, 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918 and 1920), a $100,000 ($ in dollars) contribution directly from the Athletic Committee's football receipts, and profits from the productions of the student theatre's Cap and Gown Club. During construction which started in January 1920, it was discovered that the hillside was undercut with coal mines, some of which were on fire and emitting smoke upon digging. The mines were filled as construction progressed with the last fire being extinguished about a year after Eberly Hall was completed. By 1921 Eberly Hall (then called Alumni Hall), was dedicated and signified a departure from and end to the original design for the university's campus, a hill side Acropolis Plan by Henry Hornbostel. Ironically, Eberly Hall's architect, Benno Janssen, was the runner-up to Hornbostel in a national architectural competition for the design of the original campus plan. Eberly Hall received its current name on September 11, 1998 in recognition of the Eberly family's long-term support of the university. The Eberly Family Foundation and the Eberly Family Charitable Trust, have supported student scholarships, the Shakespeare-in-the-Schools program, and a chaired professorship in biotechnology. Their most recent gift will be used in conjunction with state funds to renovate Eberly Hall to support teaching and research activities of the chemistry department. Among the participants at the building rededication were Robert E. Eberly, his sister Carolyn Blaney, and Robert E. Eberly III. Usage The front of entrance of Eberly Hall. Eberly Hall has served many university departments throughout its history. It housed the Department of Chemistry after being remodeled in 1937, and by 1941, the entire department was housed there until it was moved into Chevron Science Center which sits directly in front of it. Eberly Hall still houses the Chemistry library at Pitt. The hall also housed the Department of Psychology until 1946 , and housed the Department of Computer Science until 2002, when the department was moved into Sennott Square. That year, Eberly Hall underwent a $1.5 million renovation to house Pitt's Center for Molecular Materials Simulations and support services from Chevron Science Center. In 2010‚Äì11, $3.4 million in renovations are scheduled for its Chemistry Electronics Shop and its Nanoscience Laboratory in order to create new synthetic and spectroscopy laboratory suites. Currently, Eberly Hall houses the memorial room for chemist Alexander Lowy. The memorial previously resided in Clapp Hall, but has since been relocated.‚Äô‚ÄôAlexander Lowy‚Äô‚Äô.

The Apracharaja capital, known as Apracapura (also Avacapura), was located in the Bajaur district of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Apraca rule of Bajaur existed from the 1st century BCE to the 1st century CE. Its rulers formed the dynasty which is referred to as the Apracharajas. Origins Before the arrival of the Indo-Greeks and the Indo- Scythians, Apracan territory was the stronghold of the warlike Aspasioi tribe of Arrian, recorded in Vedic Sanskrit texts as Ashvakas. The Apracas are known in history for having offered a stubborn resistance to the Macedonian invader, Alexander the Great in 326 BCE. The Indo-Scythians of the Apracharajas dynasty were successors of the Indo-Scythian king Azes.

The ruin lies high above the Baybach valley. William I of Heinzenberg built the fortress in 1150 and, in so doing, established the \\"Boos-Waldeck\\" family which was later to become widespread. The mediaeval castle endured several wars, and was partially destroyed by the French in 1689 during the course of the Nine Years' War, known in Germany as the War of the Palatine Succession (Pf√§lzischer Erbfolgekrieg). The castle was used until 1833 when the family of Boos von Waldeck sold its holdings in the Rhineland. Historical background The first documentary mention of a castle in the vicinity of today's ruins dates to the year 1243. In that document, the knights ‚Äì Heribert, Udo (Rudolf) and Winand (surnames Boos von Waldeck, Boose of Walthecce) ‚Äì gave their castle Elector of Cologne, Konrad von Hochstaden, who in turn enfeoffed them. Around 1250, Rudolf (Udo) Boos von Waldeck built the lower bailey and both wards are mentioned in a document in 1285. The archbishop authorized the family to act as landlords of the area, through commercial contracts with Cologne, thus establishing the aristocratic line of the family that endured until 1833. This main seat would be the central administration of mills, offices, and the residence for barons, counts, and noble visitors during the summer. Political connections through deals, commerce and military control against the French guaranteed almost six hundred years of influence. The surname Boos is related to ancient mediaeval German words meaning \\"lead\\", \\"nobleman\\", or \\"angry\\", possibly used to indicate the residents of the castle, hence the name variation \\"Castle of Boos-Waldeck\\" seen in some documents. In French it is cited as the castle of \\"Bois Walthecce\\" or \\"Boosse de Walthecce\\". Below, nearer the valley, the lower bailey was established, possibly to enclose the houses of the joint owners of the castle. It is possible that the lower ward had been built around 1250 by the aforesaid Rudolf (Udo). Some documents mention both wards of the castle in 1285. The remnants of the lower bailey were only rediscovered and identified as such in recent years when the land was prospected. With the new building of the comital-Palatine tower, the castle now consisted of three parts: a new tower that had been built over the previous two wards (today the so-called upper bailey) and two lower baileys: the old upper (now lower bailey) and the old lower bailey.  Timeline  1124 First mention of Archbishop Konrad about \\"Waldeck area\\" . 1242 The knights Heribert, Udo (Rudolf) and Winand (Boos of Waldeck) buy the rights to use their assets from the Archbishop of Cologne. 1250 Building of the bailey by Rudolf Boos von Waldeck. 1325 First well-known attempt to host multiple families (coheirs) of the castle was regulated. Beside the sex of the Waldeckers, in three lines (Winandsche, Rudolfsche and Boos¬¥sche (Heribert's) line) were also the families of Hartwin von Winningen, Metz, Sabershausen (since 1398). 1331-36 The knights of the castles Eltz and Boos-Waldeck set up a resistance force of 50 knights against the arrival of Archbishop Baldwin, but were defeated near Gegenburgen. 1361 The brothers Johann and Emmerich Boos von Waldeck recognize the authority of the Archbishop of Cologne, which was acknowledged as a chivalrous, but would not give any access to the castle. 1370 Johann IV Boos von Waldeck (d. 1370) married Else of Montfort. The great-grandchild of this married couple, Simon Boos von Waldeck, received earnings, until 1480, the ruin of Montfort (nearby). Henceforth the descendants of this bloodline would be called ‚ÄúBoos von Waldeck und Montfort‚Äù. 1398 Ruprecht from Pfalz conquered the castle, after Johann Boos von Waldeck had died. In the peace treaty of 29 March, Ruprecht was granted access for living in the new tower, to keep occupied \\"on the neck\\" (thus on the upper castle). Thus the authority of the Palatinate became a neighbour enhancing the influence of the family in the business of the region. 1469 Geopolitical changes partially affect the administration. 1557 Beside the Boos von Waldeck there are only two families living in the castle (von Metz and the Counts Palatine). 1689 The French partially destroy the castle. 1720 Colonel William Lothar Baron Boos von Waldeck, who lived in Koblenz, settled a summer house in the bailey. 1833 The Boos von Waldeck, facing new geopolitical trends after the Napoleonic Wars, sold all its holdings in the Rhineland, thus also the newly built Boos-Waldeck Castle. 1850 Some of the landmarks, support stones, were removed from the castle to build other houses on the ward area, accelerating the castle's decay into ruins.

The 10,000-pound statue depicts a mother-figure wearing academic robes and flanked by two attendant figures representing \\"Learning\\" and \\"Labor\\", after the University's motto \\"Learning and Labor.\\" Sited at the corner of Green and Wright Streets at the heart of the campus, the statue is an iconic figure for the university and a popular backdrop for student graduation photos. It is appreciated for its romantic, heraldic overtones and warmth of pose. The statue was removed from its site at the entrance to the university for restoration in 2012 and was returned to its site in the spring of 2014. Description Sculpture in 2014 after restoration The Alma Mater is a bronze figure of a woman in academic robes. She stands in front of a stylized throne, or klismos, with her arms outstretched in welcome. The attendant figure \\"Labor\\" is a male who stands to her proper right and wears a blacksmith's apron. At his feet lies a sheaf of papers. The proper left figure \\"Learning\\" is a female robed a classical gown with a sun bas-relief on front. Learning and Labor extend their hands in a handshake over the throne. The work stands approximately 13-feet tall. The granite base carries three inscriptions: * Front: \\"ALMA MATER / To thy happy children / of the future / those of the past / send greetings\\" * Left (Green St side): \\"Given to the University / by the sculptor / the alumni fund / and the senior classes of / 1923, 1924, 1925, 1926, 1927, 1928, 1929.\\" * Right (Altgeld side): \\"Her children arise up and call her Blessed\\" Proverbs 31:28. The long flowerbed stretching from the front of the Alma Mater to the corner of Green Street and Wright Street is known as the Alma Mater Plaza. History Taft's Alma Mater contrasts with the cold reserve of Daniel Chester French's Alma Mater at Columbia University in New York. In the winter showing Altgeld Hall in the background. Lorado Taft wrote in correspondence that he began sculpting on the theme of \\"Labor and Learning\\" while home from Paris in 1883, after having graduated from the University of Illinois in 1879. Taft envisioned a sculpture that students would climb on and, indeed, climbing on the statue and sitting on the throne have become campus traditions. The 1883 piece was a relief with just two figures and was not preserved. He began to seek funding for the project in 1916, a year after Daniel Chester French's Alma Mater was unveiled at Columbia University. Taft was familiar with French's reserved, seated Alma Mater treatment and desired to create a more generous and \\"cordial\\" figure suitable for a Midwest mother.\\" He began to correspond that year about the work, writing of it on a grand scale and in terms of the figures in position, pose and dress. The central matriarch would stand \\"at least twelve feet high\\" and risen from her throne, advancing a step with outstretched arms, \\"a gesture of generously greeting her children.\\" On the theme of the motto, he would pose two more figures on the same scale yet subordinate. He based Learning on Lemnia Athena as an heraldic gesture, clasping hands with a sturdy figure of Labor over the back of the chair. The subordination of figures was accomplished by sculpting them \\"with less accent\\" so as to make them appear \\"out of focus.\\" According to financier Roland R. Conklin, an alumnus of the class of 1880, an initial completion date of October, 1918 was pushed back due to Taft's other commissions. Having secured the necessary patronage, Taft and Conklin announced the gift on November 27, 1916. The plaster cast was presented at the annual convocation of the Alumni Association at 3:00 PM on June 13, 1922. So although the plaque beneath has stated the statue was conceived in 1922, it was nearly half a century in the making. The Alma Mater was cast in 1929 by the American Art Bronze Foundry with materials paid for by donations by the Alumni Fund and the classes of 1923-1929, and with time donated by the sculptor himself. Taft insisted that his aim was not personal glory: he wished that his signature appear on the bronze and nowhere else, and even spoke decidedly of forgoing the dedication ceremony. But attend he did, and at the statue's dedication on June 11, 1929, the university bestowed on Taft an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. For 33 years, the statue's provisional location was on the south campus behind Foellinger Auditorium, but the Alumni Association moved Alma Mater to Altgeld Hall on August 22, 1962, despite student dissent. The Daily Illini protested the new location as in the \\"worst possible taste; it makes the Alma Mater a debased, commercial ‚Äòadvertisement‚Äô for the University.‚Äù Taft, whose father was the first geology professor at the University, lived for many years in Champaign at 601 E. John Street, less than two blocks from the site at Altgeld. 2012‚Äì14 restoration On August 7, 2012, the statue was removed for a planned, $100,000 restoration to repair surface corrosion, cracks, and water penetration into the sculpture. According to the campus historic preservation officer, a previous 1981 attempt to waterproof the statue by university staff had the unintended effect of sealing water inside the sculpture, causing serious internal damage. The statue was restored by Conservation Sculpture and Objects Studio Inc. of Forest Park, Illinois. \\"Learning\\" of the Alma Mater Statue at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, showing the surface after the restoration The Alma Mater was expected to return before the commencement for the Class of 2013. However, the director of the restoration, Andrzej Dajnowski, reported that the damage was worse than original estimates and that the timeline was to be extended. Restoration costs tripled original estimates to more than $360,000. The statue was not returned until April 2014. Rumors amongst the student body speculated that the statue had actually been damaged, lost, or stolen. Anticipating student reaction to the statue's absence for the 2013 commencement, the University announced extensive plans to provide alternative photo opportunities, including replica statues by School of Art and Design to be placed around campus, green screen photos for a virtual photo with the statue, and improving other landmarks on the campus. The University decided to restore the original bronze color of the statue rather than leave the natural green patina that is associated with the image. Initially, the restoration committee had not announced a decision on the issue. The oxidation was removed by laser, and the metal was sealed with a wax compound. Symbol and impact The Alma Mater has long been a public symbol of the University of Illinois. Her image is currently the profile image for the official University Twitter account, figures prominently on the University website, and the statue is featured on the i-Card, the official university identification card for the flagship Urbana-Champaign campus. The Alma Mater statue at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign during the 2012 commencement week. The statue is sometimes adorned to reflect current events. In 2005, during the Final Four, the Alma Mater sported an Illini jersey. In late 2007, the Alma Mater was decorated with a variety of red, orange, and blue roses to signify the Illinois football team's 2008 Rose Bowl appearance. In 2010, the Alma Mater was decorated with a UIUC cap and gown custom-made by Herff Jones to signify the University's graduation exercises. In the 2012-13 absence of the statue, it was popular for students to don costumes mimicking the Alma Mater's robes and pose on the empty granite base.

A traffic congestion fee will go into effect in New York City by 2022, that will charge vehicles traveling into or within a predetermined area in the Manhattan central business district. First proposed in 2007, this congestion pricing plan was approved and implemented in the 2019 New York State budget. This will be the first such fee scheme enacted in the United States. Since the early 20th century, there have been proposals for traffic congestion fees or limit for vehicles traveling into or within the Manhattan central business district. A recurring proposal has included adding tolls to all crossings of the East River, which separates Manhattan from Long Island; currently, four bridges across the East River do not charge any tolls. In the 1970s, after New York City was deemed to be in violation of the Clean Air Act, Mayor John Lindsay proposed limiting cars in Lower Manhattan and tolling all crossings of the East River, but ultimately withdrew the proposal. Lindsay's successor Abraham Beame subsequently opposed the tolling scheme. Beame's successor Ed Koch attempted to restore limits on vehicles entering Manhattan, but the federal government preempted his plan. New York City was judged to be compliant with the Clean Air Act in 1981, and through the 1980s and 1990s, other proposals to limit congestion in New York City stagnated. A congestion pricing scheme was first proposed in 2007 by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, but the proposal stalled in the New York State Assembly. The congestion pricing charge proposed in 2007 by Mayor Michael Bloomberg was part of a plan to improve the city's future environmental sustainability while planning for population growth, entitled PlaNYC 2030: A Greener, Greater New York. However, the proposal did not succeed, as it was never put to a vote in the New York State Assembly. Since then, there have been several similar proposals. In 2015, transportation engineer Sam Schwartz suggested placing tolls on all East River bridges. Two years later, Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed a similar congestion pricing scheme in response to the New York City Subway's state of emergency, during which the subway was found to have ongoing reliability and crowding problems due to chronic funding deficits. Cuomo's scheme would take advantage of open road tolling technology. In 2019, following another two years of negotiation, Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio agreed to implement congestion pricing in order to solve the city's ongoing transit crisis. However, the implementation of congestion pricing was delayed by the lack of approval from the U.S. government.  Early plans  A gridlocked intersection in Manhattan, as seen from above Plans for reducing vehicular traffic in New York City's central business districts, as well as adding tolls to crossings into Manhattan, date to the early 20th century. In particular, many proposals involved adding tolls to the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg, and Queensboro Bridge across the East River, which separates Long Island from the island of Manhattan. These bridges originally had tolls, but these were removed before the Great Depression. In 1933, in the midst of the Depression, the New York City Comptroller proposed reinstating tolls on the bridges in order to raise money for the city. This received opposition from residents of Brooklyn and Queens, in western Long Island, because the four free bridges were the only means of traveling freely to and from Long Island. Civic groups also opposed the proposal. In June 1933, Mayor John P. O'Brien acquiesced to a plan to charge city residents annual fees for any vehicles they owned, and to add a surcharge to all taxi trips. Out-of-town residents would pay tolls to cross the East and Harlem Rivers on the east side of Manhattan; since motorists already paid tolls to cross the Hudson River on the west side of Manhattan, this plan would have effectively created a congestion charge to enter and exit Manhattan. Several groups came together to protest against O'Brien's proposal, and his successor Fiorello H. La Guardia canceled O'Brien's proposed traffic fees when he entered office the next year. In 1952, city planner Goodhue Livingston suggested that tolls be added on the four free East River bridges in order to fund the New York City Subway. By 1966, New York City Mayor John Lindsay was considering implementing tolls on all East River crossings, as well as raising prices on existing tolled crossings. In 1968, an outgoing member of the then-new Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which controlled New York City's transit system as well as the city's tolled crossings, suggested adding tolls to the East River crossings in order to encourage mass transit use. The proposal was brought up again in 1971. In the early 1970s, the office of Mayor Lindsay experimented with limiting and banning private cars in downtown Manhattan following federal pressure to improve city air quality. His original proposal, to ban noncommercial midday traffic in Manhattan's Financial District, was reduced to a parking ban at the request of business executives. The parking ban, announced in September 1970, affected a triangular 50-block area south of Fulton Street and upset truckers and merchants who worked in the area. A later transportation commissioner said that the plans were fashionable [but] unfeasible due to unexamined commerce relationships and lack of preemptive buy-in from merchants. Lindsay's future proposals were restricted in scale. In 1970, the government enacted the Clean Air Act, a series of federal air pollution regulations. Since New York City was in violation of these new regulations, it was given until 1975 to be compliant; this was later pushed back to 1977 after the state was given a 2-year delay in implementing the standards. Mayor Lindsay and the federal Environmental Protection Agency developed a plan to collect tolls on twelve free bridges across the Harlem and East Rivers, banning midtown parking, and significantly reducing the number of parking spaces south of 59th Street. They also proposed to retrofit air filtering devices on cars entering New York City's main business districts. The successive mayor, Abraham Beame, refused to implement the plan, even after federal order in 1975, but environmentalists received a court order in 1976 to proceed with implementation. Yet as the federal legislature forbade the bridge tolls and taxi restrictions went into effect, the parking ban remained the most controversial and consequential aspect of the act, and its forced implementation was poorly executed. In April 1977, Beame's administration released a report that opposed the addition of tolls, a proposal that future Mayor Michael Bloomberg's congestion pricing plan would address thirty years later. The report supported a bill in the New York State Legislature that, if passed, would permanently ban tolls on the East River bridges. Although such a plan would generate revenue for the city, the administration concluded that tolling the free crossings would cause congestion and pollution without enticing drivers to use public transportation. The state departments of environment and transportation concurred with Beame's position, and in a May 1977 report, recommended that tolls not be enacted, despite the fact that the pollution standards had yet to be met. An intersection in Midtown Manhattan Mayor Ed Koch too explored possibilities for a ban on private cars in 1979, only permitting mass transit, delivery, and emergency vehicles. In January of that year, the state unveiled another plan for reducing emissions in the New York City area, with the goal of being in compliance with the Clean Air Act by December 1982. As part of the state's plan, transit fares would be kept low, while passenger cars would undergo emissions tests every year. The same June, passenger vehicles were banned from traveling along 49th and 50th Streets in Midtown Manhattan during weekdays. According to the city's transportation commissioner, this had the intended effect of reducing traffic. The next year, Koch's office sought to ban single-occupancy cars from the East River bridges during weekday morning rush hour, but the State Supreme Court ruled that the city did not have that authority. Other actions, such as bicycle and bus lanes, a reduction in parking spaces, and automobile inspections, were left in place. In 1981, the national administration deemed New York City in compliance with the federal air pollution regulations after a decade of noncompliance. Carbon monoxide levels decreased over the decade with improvements in car emissions. The number of cars inbound to Manhattan continued to rise and vehicle exhaust remained the top source of pollution in New York City.  Bloomberg's 2008 proposal  On December 12, 2006, Mayor Bloomberg announced his goals for long-term sustainability through the year 2030. On April 22, 2007 (Earth Day), PlaNYC 2030 was unveiled. Along with transportation initiatives, the plan outlined steps to clean up brownfields, create affordable housing, utilize open spaces, provide cleaner and more reliable and efficient energy sources, improve water quality and infrastructure, achieve cleaner air quality, and address climate change issues. The transportation initiatives support greater use of mass transit through various improvements and additions to transit infrastructure and services. In addition, the initiatives also include increased use of cycling, expanded ferry services, increased traffic violation enforcement, and installations of Muni Meters and an intelligent transportation system. Of the 16 proposed transportation initiatives in PlaNYC, the congestion pricing program is the only component that has to be approved by the New York State Legislature with financial support from the State; the remainder is within New York City's or its regional jurisdiction and is to be funded by a new Sustainable Mobility and Regional Transportation Financing Authority, which would also take in revenue from the congestion fees, estimated at $380 million. New York City applied to be part of the United States Department of Transportation's Urban Partnership Program, which would allocate money to cities that were willing to fight urban traffic congestion through tolling programs, express bus services or bus rapid transit, telecommuting, or technologies designed for the purpose. In June 2007, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Mary Peters said that out of the nine finalist cities applying for the program, New York City was the farthest along in its traffic reduction planning and the city was eligible for up to $500 million for funding the congestion pricing plan. Since the final funding decision would be announced in August, Peters wrote in a letter to Governor Eliot Spitzer that if state approval was not met by July 16, \\"it is unlikely that New York City would be selected.\\" Although a commitment was not established by that date, on July 19, the State legislature approved the creation of a 17-member commission that would study different plans to reduce traffic in the city, including congestion pricing. Signed by Spitzer on July 27, the bill authorized New York to apply for at least $200 million in federal funds. On August 14, 2007, the U.S. Department of Transportation awarded from the Urban Partnership program $354 million to New York City. It was the largest of the five grants awarded to cities, which included San Francisco, King County, Washington (Seattle), the Minneapolis area, and Miami. Only $10.4 million is allocated for launching the congestion pricing program and $2 million for research. The rest of the grant will fund transportation infrastructure and services: $213.6 million to improve and build new bus depots, $112.7 million to develop bus rapid transit routes, and $15.8 million for expanded ferry services. The idea of congestion pricing was endorsed by Spitzer, Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, and other New York City politicians, such as City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, and Representative Joseph Crowley of Queens and the Bronx, as well as the U.S. Department of Transportation. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and other politicians expressed skepticism about the plan, raising several questions about its viability, its environmental effects on neighborhoods bordering the congestion zone, the lack of state control in Bloomberg's proposal, and the imposition of a regressive tax on some commuters. Components Bloomberg's proposal cited comparable congestion pricing in London, Singapore and Stockholm., p. 88 New York City's was to be a three-year pilot program, at the end of which the City and State would decide if the program should be made permanent. Upon final legislative approval, the program could be put into effect within 18 months. A toll booth for the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel, which would have been one of the entrances into the congestion pricing zone. Drivers going into the congestion zone would have paid the difference between the tunnel toll and the congestion zone toll. The proposed congestion pricing zone was defined as the island of Manhattan, bordered by the East and Hudson Rivers south of 60th Street. The northern border of the congestion zone was originally slated to be 86th Street, but this changed after the commission's recommendation released on January 10, 2008. Exempted roadways within the zone include the FDR Drive, New York Route 9A (West Side Highway and Henry Hudson Parkway included), the Battery Park Underpass, and the East River bridges (Queensboro Bridge, Williamsburg Bridge, Manhattan Bridge and Brooklyn Bridge) and their approaches. A free route from the East River bridges to the FDR Drive and from the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels to Route 9A would be designated. Drivers who use toll crossings to or from the zone (e.g. Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and Queens-Midtown Tunnel) would be charged the difference between the toll and the congestion charge. The charge would apply on weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Proposed fees would be $8 for cars and commercial vehicles and $21 for trucks entering from outside the zone. Transit buses, emergency vehicles, taxis and for-hire vehicles, and vehicles with disabled parking plates would not be charged the fee. Taxi and livery trips that begin, end or touch the zone would have a $1 surcharge. Vehicles would be charged only once per day. Operations for monitoring vehicles within the congestion zone will be barrier-free and includes E-ZPass transponders and a license plate recognition system that involves cameras. The system for monitoring congestion pricing will be made separate from existing red-light camera systems. Drivers would be able to pay by a debit from their E-ZPass account or a debit from a pre-paid non-E-ZPass account linked to the vehicle's license plate number. For drivers without traffic payment accounts, they would have 48 hours to pay via phone, the Internet, text messaging, or cash transactions at participating retailers. Reaction The Campaign for New York's Future supported congestion pricing throughout the political discussion. They argued that the plan would reduce road congestion, shorten commutes, reduce air pollution, and raise funds for long-term mass transit upgrades. The Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a member of the Campaign for New York's Future, released an analysis of Census data showing that the vast majority (approximately 93‚Äì99%) of workers in the MTA service area, and in individual legislative districts, did not drive to work in Manhattan. TSTC stated that the data showed that congestion pricing was progressive policy.Tri-State Transportation Campaign. \\"New Data Proves Congestion Pricing is Progressive Policy ,\\" accessed April 2, 2009 Several other entities, including the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), the Partnership for New York City, and the New York League of Conservation Voters, supported the proposed congestion pricing. The MTA, in particular, would benefit from the proposal; its accelerated Capital Plan for 2008‚Äì2013 details transit investments that revenue from congestion pricing would pay for. These include 44 subway station rehabilitations, increased bus service, new Select Bus Service bus rapid transit in all 5 boroughs, $40 million for suburban park and ride facilities, Metro-North and LIRR station rehabilitations, LIRR third track work, East Side Access, Second Avenue Subway, and Fulton Center. An August 2007 Quinnipiac University poll found that New York City voters opposed the plan 57% to 36%. Most of the opposition came from the outer boroughs, which with the exception of the Bronx would lose their toll-free access under the plan. On the other hand, 58% of voters would support the plan if the funds were used toward improving mass transit. In a subsequent poll conducted in November 2007, the opposition rate had risen to 61%, while support had fallen to 33% A third poll taken in March 2008 found that New York City voters supported congestion pricing by a margin of 67 percent to 27 percent if the money were used for mass transit improvements, and statewide voters supported the plan 60% to 30%, although the majority of New Yorkers surveyed had been unaware that a $1 taxi surcharge was included in the plan. Then-presidential candidate Barack Obama, multiple city and state legislators, and community leaders openly expressed support for the plan. New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who represented the Financial District of Manhattan, opposed the plan, citing several issues. Since motorists would want to avoid the congestion pricing zone, he claimed they would choose to park in neighborhoods just outside the pricing zone, in turn creating massive traffic jams and add more traffic and pollution to those neighborhoods. Silver also stated that because the plan would reduce traffic in Manhattan's central business district but not necessarily elsewhere, neighborhoods with high asthma rates such as Harlem, the South Bronx, and Bedford-Stuyvesant would not benefit. The installation of cameras for tracking purposes might have raised civil liberties concerns. However, Silver did not oppose the entire plan, and said he would continue to work toward an agreement. Other opponents argued that the pricing could become a tax on middle- and lower-class residents, since those citizens would be affected the most financially. At the same time, higher- income commuters would not be turned off by paying the charges; thus the fee would not do much to discourage traffic into the congestion area. The Queens Chamber of Commerce released a report that concluded that implementing congestion pricing would cause a net reduction in the number of people going into Manhattan's central business district each day. The report stated that the congestion pricing plan could cost the city $1.89 billion per year in economic losses. In response to many of these issues, Bloomberg argued that a significant percentage of commuters would switch to public transportation, and most likely for all of their commute; thus cars would be taken off the road outside the Central Business District as well as within it. John Gallagher, a Bloomberg spokesman, also said that \\"toll shopping\\", a tendency for drivers to seek toll-free routes, will end as all commuters who go to the congestion zone will have to pay tolls. On July 9, 2007, Assemblyman Richard Brodsky issued a report that called the proposal thoughtful and bold, but expressing skepticism on points including financial fairness and environmental impact. Brodsky called the proposal a \\"regressive tax\\" on the poor and middle class and harmful to citizens of New York City's outer boroughs.Brodsky's Congestion Specifics, in New York's Premier Alternative Newspaper. The report mentioned several insufficiently studied alternatives, though it did not recommend any of them. These alternatives included road space rationing; better traffic enforcement; time-of day pricing on mass transit; taxes on gasoline, payroll, commuting, or stock transfers; and fees on city parking permits Keep NYC Congestion Tax Free, a coalition of about 80 civic, business and labor organizations and businesses throughout the New York metropolitan area, proposed alternative traffic mitigation measures that were cheaper and had less impact. The group stated that these measures would raise between $428 million and $545 million in annual incidental revenues, and that this revenue would also qualify for the federal grant. It also recommended revenue measures that would raise nearly $1.8 billion to mass transit projects to induce less driving through better transit service. Vote on proposal On January 31, 2008, the New York City Traffic Congestion Mitigation Commission approved a plan for congestion pricing, which was passed by a vote of 13 to 2. Some changes over Mayor Bloomberg's original proposal were introduced, such as reducing the congestion zone, no charges for vehicles which stay within the zone, and a discount for low-emission trucks. The commission estimated that revenues from the congestion charge will generate $491 million a year, which would be committed to improve and expand the region's mass transit. The proposal was approved by the New York City Council on March 31, 2008 by a vote of 30 to 20. The only \\"No\\" votes came from Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. Brooklyn and Queens strongly opposed the bill in the City Council, voting against it by a margin of nearly two to one; both boroughs, which are located on Long Island, become geographically isolated without access to free bridges as Manhattan and the Bronx block their access to the mainland. Another alternative considered by the commission, and promoted by Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, was to restrict access into the congestion zone one day a week based on the last digits of the license plates. This sort of road space rationing system is currently practiced in two of the world's Top 10 megacities, S√£o Paulo and Mexico City. Bloomberg's plan was endorsed by the then new Governor David Paterson, whose support was considered key to approving the bill in Albany. The deadline to approve the plan by the State Assembly was April 7, 2008, for the city to be eligible to receive US$354 million in federal assistance for traffic congestion relief and mass transit improvements. On April 7, 2008, after a closed-door meeting, the Democratic Conference of the State Assembly decided not to vote on the proposal. \\"The opposition was so overwhelming,...that he would not hold an open vote of the full Assembly,\\" said Sheldon Silver, the Assembly Speaker. Afterwards, the USDOT announced that they will seek to allocate those funds to relief traffic congestion in other cities. Shortly thereafter, most of the federal grant that was to have gone to New York City was instead awarded to Chicago for bus-only lanes and more buses, as well as to Los Angeles for high-occupancy toll lanes.(LAC)MTA votes for tolls on some carpool lanes by 2010, accessed May 28, 2008 Coincidentally, by July 2008, gasoline prices of over $4.00 a gallon caused a 5 percent drop in vehicle trips into lower Manhattan. The gasoline price drop was one of the goals that Bloomberg had envisioned for his congestion pricing scheme. The decrease in gas prices confirmed the plan's premise that higher driving costs would in fact reduce congestion. However, at the same time, the gas price increase temporarily rendered the congestion pricing plan unnecessary, at least while fuel prices stayed high.  2015 proposal  Move NY, a 2015 proposal by former Traffic Commissioner Sam Schwartz, incorporates congestion pricing for central Manhattan. It creates incentives to travel around, rather than through, Manhattan. These incentives included the creation of a congestion-priced central business district below 60th Street, where drivers had to pay an $8 cash toll or a $5.54 E-ZPass toll to enter the area. The four free East River bridges, all located below 60th Street, would charge tolls, while outer-borough crossings such as the Throgs Neck Bridge would see reduced tolls. Tolls would also be charged within Manhattan for all drivers traveling below 60th Street. The proposal would raise an estimated $1.5 billion annually, of which 75% would go to the MTA and 25% to the New York City Department of Transportation. The borough president of Queens, Melinda Katz, opposed the proposal. Bills to implement Move NY were introduced at the state level in 2016, but the legislation never passed.  2017 proposal  As complaints about the city subway's delays and disrepair reached a fever pitch in summer 2017, Governor Andrew Cuomo drafted a congestion pricing proposal with lessons from Bloomberg's handling of the State Legislature. Despite having earlier doubted such a plan's viability, Cuomo described congestion pricing as \\"an idea whose time has come\\". London and Stockholm had implemented the concept successfully. Cuomo's plan is expected to differ significantly from Bloomberg's proposal. Its primary intent is to raise funds for city transit and reduce street gridlock, while balancing suburban commuter considerations. The New York Times reflected that Bloomberg's 2008 proposal, which would have raised annually, could have rectified infrastructure issues and emergency repair schedule affecting the subway in 2017. The plan could be implemented through open road tolling, which records E-ZPass transponders and license plates without forcing the vehicles to slow down significantly, thus increasing vehicle throughput. This would coincide with MTA Bridges and Tunnels' ongoing project to convert all of its crossings from a tollbooth- based system to an open road tolling system. This was in contrast to the circumstances during Bloomberg's tenure, when open road tolling was not widely used yet. At the time, New York City had the third worst traffic congestion of any city worldwide, behind Moscow and Los Angeles. In October 2017, the New York State Government created a task force, Fix NYC, to find solutions for fixing mass transit and lowering congestion. The task force was assigned to study traffic on New York City's roadways and report its findings to Cuomo by December. Fix NYC included congestion pricing advocates such as Sam Schwartz, Charles Komanoff, and Alex Matthiessen, who had supported the congestion- pricing proposal even after Bloomberg's plan had been defeated. Initial recommendations The FDR Drive would be one of the few roadways exempted from a congestion charge In December 2017, as part of its report, Fix NYC recommended implementing tolls based on time of day and geographical zone. Cars would pay up to , trucks would pay up to , and taxis would pay a to surcharge per trip if these vehicles drove into Manhattan's central business district during rush hours. Under the task force's plan, the only drivers who would be able to avoid a toll would be those who cross the Brooklyn Bridge or Queensboro Bridge and then immediately exit onto the FDR Drive once they reach Manhattan. Cuomo's administration was supposed to review these proposals in January 2018. The report's findings were preliminary, and Cuomo could modify or reject any of the proposals in the report. It was also unclear where the revenue from the congestion charge should be spent. Final components A congestion pricing proposal in March 2019 was ultimately passed on April 1 as part of the New York State Budget. While there were few details about the proposal, it would include the entire island of Manhattan south of 60th Street, except for the FDR Drive and West Side Highway, as well as the Battery Park Underpass connecting the two highways. Vehicles would be tolled only once per day. As part of the law, the Central Business District Tolling Program would be planned by, implemented by and operated by the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority. The TBTA board will institute a \\"traffic mobility review\\" board, which will consist of a chair and five members, who will be appointed by the TBTA board. One of the members will be recommended by the New York City Mayor, one will live in the Metro-North region, and one will live in the Long Island Rail Road region. This board will recommend the toll amounts between November 15, 2020 and December 31, 2020, or no later than 30 days before the implementation of the tolling program. A public hearing will be held before the board's vote. In the event of a tie, the chair will be given an additional vote. The board will recommend an amount that provides a minimum of $15 billion in funding for the MTA's 2020-2024 Capital Program, not including the costs of the tolling program. This funding will be put into the central business district tolling capital lockbox fund. The majority of the funds, 80%, would be used for the Staten Island Railway, New York City Subway, and MTA Regional Bus Operations, while 10% each would be given to the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad. The traffic mobility review board will also be granted the power to review the MTA's Capital Program. The board will also recommend tolling exemptions, which will be determined by a traffic study of their impact. Authorized emergency vehicles and qualifying vehicles transporting people with disabilities will not be charged the toll. A plan to address charges on for-hire vehicles will be implemented by the TBTA. The TBTA, in conjunction with the NYCDOT, will report on the effects of the tolling program, such as traffic congestion, air quality and emissions, mass transit ridership, and expenditures a year after the implementation of the plan, and every two years afterwards. The exemption of the West Side Highway and the credit given to drivers using the Henry Hudson Bridge and heading into the congestion zone were added to the plan on March 31, 2019. Electrical toll- taking equipment will have to be installed at the more than 30 exits into the cordon from the West Side Highway, at the 11 exits from the FDR Drive, and at the eight avenues that delineate the northern boundary of the congestion zone at 59th Street/Central Park South. Sam Schwartz suggested enforcing the West Side Highway exemption by process of elimination to reduce the cost of the toll readers. The law also exempted people living in the congestion zone who make less than a $60,000 a year by deducting the cost of the tolls from their tax bills. On March 28, 2019, the TBTA issued a request for technology (RFT) for alternate ways to implement the congestion pricing tolling. Options the TBTA included in the RFT are roadside bluetooth readers, connected vehicle technology, smartphone applications, and Global Navigation Satellite System based tolling. Reaction As with the Bloomberg proposal, Queens politicians still opposed Cuomo's proposal because it would potentially add tolls to the remaining free crossings over the East River. David Weprin, a New York State Assemblyman representing parts of Queens, called it \\"an additional tax on people who drive into Manhattan, often not wealthy people, but middle- class people\\". He said that much of Queens and many parts of Brooklyn had little access to mass transit, and that disabled residents from all boroughs would also be negatively affected because the subway was generally not accessible to people with disabilities. Bloomberg's successor, Bill de Blasio, also initially opposed congestion pricing. Instead, de Blasio proposed a tax on wealthy residents to fund the subway, even though a similar tax for universal prekindergarten had previously failed in the state legislature. He also clarified that he opposed Cuomo's plan because his tax on millionaires would be more effective in raising money. De Blasio's opposition came as some of his supporters in the 2017 mayoral election announced support for the plan, including the Working Families Party and Union Local 32BJ. Later in August 2017, it was clarified that de Blasio did not oppose congestion pricing specifically, and that his office was to look at any congestion pricing proposal by Cuomo's administration. In May 2018, New York gubernatorial election candidate Cynthia Nixon proposed implementing both Cuomo's congestion pricing proposal and de Blasio's \\"millionaire tax\\", as well as a third proposal to levy fines on companies that pollute in the state. Nixon, a Democratic primary challenger to Cuomo, stated that all three proposals could be used to raise money for maintaining the city's subway system. Many residents of Brooklyn and Queens opposed Cuomo's congestion pricing proposal because they would be forced to pay a toll to drive to Manhattan. These residents, in turn, had to drive because they lived too far from subway stations. Supporters included Uber, which was planning to begin a \\"six-figure\\" advertising campaign in support of congestion pricing in January 2018. The same month, the Tri-State Transportation Campaign released a report in support of congestion pricing. It found that in most New York State Assembly districts within the city, drivers tended to have higher incomes than mass-transit commuters, and that less than 10% of drivers from every district drove into the proposed congestion pricing area. However, Assemblyman Weprin said that this data was misleading since it did not take into account irregularly scheduled trips to Manhattan, such as for doctor's visits. New Jersey residents also criticized the plan, since there was a possibility that they could be charged twice. This was in response to speculation that the Holland Tunnel and Lincoln Tunnel tolls may be incorporated into the congestion pricing fee, because they entered Manhattan within the congestion pricing zone, while the toll of the George Washington Bridge may likely not be included since it was outside of the zone. Cuomo's plan has faced mixed reviews from the media. A writer for Slate Magazine lauded the proposed charge, saying that it was \\"miraculously and inexplicably free\\" to drive a private car around Manhattan, and comparing it to the several-thousand-dollar average monthly rents for real estate in the borough. The writer noted that the revenues from the congestion charge had yet to be worked out, and that Cuomo needed to be serious about implementing the charge. The New York Post said that the plan had two large flaws. First, none of the East River crossings would receive any congestion pricing revenue for maintenance. Second, the city would not receive revenue, either, even though it was in charge of maintaining the streets. The public overall has generally supported Cuomo's plan. Two Pew Research studies conducted in 2018 and 2019 showed that a majority of many demographic groups, in all geographic areas, endorsed congestion pricing. Additionally, in January 2019, a study by Siena College Research Institute found that up to 52% of New York state registered voters supported congestion pricing. Meanwhile, opposition to congestion pricing declined from 44% in January 2018 to 39% in January 2019. 2019 approval The congestion toll was not included in the state budget that was passed in March 2018. However, a surcharge was levied on taxi, for-hire, and ride-share trips in Manhattan below 96th Street. This consisted of a $2.50 fee for each taxi trip in that area, a $2.75 fee for each privately operated for-hire trip in that area, and a $0.75 fee per rider for each ride-share trip in that area. In a State of the State Address in January 2019, Cuomo announced another state budget. The budget would provisionally include congestion pricing, as well as cannabis legalization, both of which would provide funds for the subway. The following month, Cuomo and de Blasio jointly announced a plan that outlined ten steps to fix MTA operations. One of these steps called for enacting a form of congestion pricing by December 2020, a plan that both men agreed on for the first time. The revenue would go into a so-called lock box that could only be used by the MTA. Other revenue would come from a cannabis tax, but de Blasio's wealth tax would not be implemented. In March 2019, Cuomo's congestion pricing plan was again included in the 2019 New York state budget, though specific details still had to be outlined. The plan was approved at the end of the month. However, such a fee would not go into effect until 2021 at the earliest. With the approval of congestion pricing, New York City would become the first city in the United States to enact congestion pricing. A \\"Streets Master Plan\\", announced in October 2019, would impose a congestion fee at the end of 2020 and speed installation of bus and bicycle lanes. The congestion fee would need to be approved by the Federal Highway Administration. News outlets reported in February 2020 that the congestion fee could potentially be blocked by the federal government of the United States, due to disagreements between Cuomo and U.S. president Donald Trump. The COVID-19 pandemic in New York City resulted in a decrease in people taking mass transit between March and June 2020. Following the city's partial reopening in June, a mayoral panel projected that many people would choose to drive because taking mass transit would increase the possibility of contracting COVID-19, and studied congestion pricing as a solution to lessen road traffic. Even so, congestion pricing was still delayed even though the MTA faced a budget deficit of several billion dollars because of decreased revenue, due to lack of action from the federal government. Janno Lieber, the MTA's Chief Development Officer, said in July 2020 that the congestion fee could be delayed until at least 2022 because the federal government had not approved the scheme, and that it would take one year to install the required infrastructure even after federal approval.

He can project concussive bolts of mystical energy, create protective shields of mystical energy, transform and transmute matter, and is capable of inter-dimensional travel. He also has the magical abilities of mesmerism, thought-casting, and illusion-casting. Dakimh practices a form of sorcery that was mastered and taught to him by the sorceress Zhered-Na. He possesses a greater knowledge and mastery of the arts of magic than possibly anyone on Earth except Doctor Strange. He also possesses extensive knowledge of pre-Cataclysmic Atlantean alchemy. He has a genius intellect, though he is more than a little eccentric. Dakimh possesses an enchanted crystal, through which he can perceive possible futures to a limited extent. He can cause images of past and present events throughout the multiverse to appear in the pool of the Waters of Eternity within his castle. He also possesses a vast library of mystical lore. Through unknown means, Zhered-Na made it possible for Dakimh to live for millennia, during which he aged with extreme slowness. In later years, Dakimh's physical body was weakened by advanced age. Although Dakihm's physical body has died, his spirit now dwells in the extra-dimensional realm of Therea, and can manifest itself on Earth and in other material worlds (away from Therea) for limited periods of time. The limit to the amount of time he can spend on material planes seems to vary from time to time for unknown reasons. Should he exceed these limits, his spirit will \\"die\\", or, in other words, it will no longer be able to exist in material dimensions, only spiritual ones.

It provides Preparatory, Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary education. Background SMCQC is one of the oldest institutions in the Philippines, being the first pontifically approved congregation for women in the country, that offers formal education for girls in the Philippines. The congregation, originally known as the Beaterio de la Compania de Jesus, was founded in 1684 by Venerable Mother Ignacia del Espiritu Santo, a Chinese- Filipino mestiza. A history tracing back to 1684, Ignacia del Espiritu Santo and her beatas started educating young Filipinas as part of their mission as a foundational community. In 1725, they opened a boarding school for girls which became known as Beaterio dela Compania de Jesus. This also marked the first step towards formal education for the school. The Beaterio was opened to Yndias and Chinese mestizas, as well as to Spanish girls. In 1901, the Beaterio became a congregation, eleven years after, the school was formally incorporated and the elementary and secondary course was recognized by the government. In 1939, the name Collegio del Beaterio was officially changed to St. Mary's College. The school was PAASCU accredited in 1975 and 1978. The secondary department used to be exclusively for girls until school year 1997-1998, when it started to accept male enrollees. St. Mary's College is the de jure Generalate of all RVM schools in Luzon, and de facto Generalate of all RVM-controlled schools in the Philippines.

The school still offers limited course opportunities. College course offerings since 1950 included BSE, ETC, Secretarial, Associate in Arts, Bachelor of Music, Associate in Music, BSEED and other special courses. In 1976, the changing political, socioeconomic and cultural climate led the administrators to temporarily suspend the college. There was also a felt need to concentrate on basic education. In its desire to upgrade the equality of instruction, St. Mary's College embarked on a self-evaluation project which led to a formal application for accreditation through the Philippine Accrediting Association for Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU). The High School department was accredited in 1975 and the Grade School department in 1978. Subsequently PAASCU visit confirmed the quality education offered by St. Mary's College. In 1997, St. Mary's College heeded the request of parents to admit boys to High School. With the continuing improvement in its instruction and services, The Board of Trustees thought it was time to resume the college. Preparations were done; in 2002, St. Mary's College was given the permit to start offering a Bachelor's Course in Communication Studies.

History   First century  The school was built when the Bombay port took on new importance as the \\"Gateway to India\\", in the same year as the Suez Canal was built, 1869. At that time it incorporated primary students from the Jesuit St. Mary‚Äôs on Cavel Street that had been opened in 1860. By 1870 there were eight years of school and a seminary on the premises, with boarding facilities for the St. Mary‚Äôs boys and seminarians. The 512 students came from diverse religious backgrounds: 337 Catholic, 98 Hindus, 45 Parsis, 20 Other Christians, 10 Muslims, and 2 Jews. The top floor became the Jesuit residence, then housing sixteen Jesuits. Music was taught from 1873 ‚Äì singing, the harmonium, piano, flute, and violin. A band followed in 1878. Cricket was played at the school since 1874 and football from 1896. German fathers founded and ran the school, but during World War I they were sent to concentration camps; Jesuits from Tarragona Spain and some from Switzerland filled in for them. In 1936, five graduates were in the top twenty among 7,014 successful candidates who passed the Matriculation Examination. In 1940 the East Wing was completed to accommodate the upper standards, including a hall with a capacity for 700. In 1948 a night school was opened with members of the Catholic Young Men‚Äôs Sodality as staff; it soon had an enrollment of 200 for courses like fitting and mechanics.  Memorabilia  Fr. Karl Wagner, S.J., from Mainz, Germany St. Xavier's still occupies the neo-gothic building it had from its foundation by the Jesuits in 1869. Fragments of its history are visible in the corridors of the primary section in the form of stuffed hunted animals shot by priests during the British Raj. Notable among these is the butterfly and bird collection on the first floor and the stuffed tiger on the third floor. The tiger was donated by the Maharaja of Vanzra, Gujrat, who attended St. Xavier's. The butterfly and bird collection is the work of Brother Navarro, a Spanish Jesuit and a naturalist who was associated with the school. At one corner of the primary quadrangle is a section of a ship's propeller which landed there at the time of the Bombay Harbour Explosion of 1944. St. Xavier's High School is approaching its 150th jubilee.  Education  St. Xavier's follows the SSC board which is the state board of the Government of Maharashtra. It runs classes from standard one to standard ten. The primary (standard one to four) and secondary school occupy different buildings. A class has four sections (A to D) with about fifty students per section. All students of the secondary school belong to one of four houses - Claver (blue), Gonzaga (yellow), Britto (red), Berchmans (green). These were earlier known as Ashoka (blue), Tilak (yellow), Nehru (red), and Tagore (green). Each house has an elected House Captain from standard ten and a Vice-Captain from standard nine. Additionally, a School Captain and Vice-Captain are elected from standard ten. There is a sports captain and a sports vice captain also. These student representatives maintain student discipline and lead student and ceremonial activities.

Biography Kreisel was born in Graz and came from a Jewish background; his family sent him to the United Kingdom before the Anschluss, where he studied mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, and then, during World War II, worked on military subjects. Kreisel never took a Ph.D., though in 1962 he was awarded the Cambridge degree of Sc.D., a \`higher doctorate' given on the basis of published research.In Memoriam: Georg Kreisel He taught at the University of Reading from 1949 until 1954 and then worked at the Institute for Advanced Study from 1955 to 1957. He returned to Reading in 1957, but then taught at Stanford University from 1958-1959. Then back at Reading for the year 1959-1960, and then the University of Paris 1960-1962.

Kreisel was elected to the Royal Society in 1966; Kreisel remained a close friend of Francis CrickSome of their correspondence is collected within whom he had met in the Royal Navy during WWII. While a student at Cambridge, Kreisel was the student most respected by Ludwig Wittgenstein. Ray Monk writes, \\"In 1944--when Kreisel was still only twenty-one--Wittgenstein shocked Rush Rhees by declaring Kreisel to be the most able philosopher he had ever met who was also a mathematician.\\"Ray Monk, Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius (Penguin, 1991), 498. Kreisel was also a close friend of the Anglo-Irish philosopher and novelist Iris Murdoch. They met at Cambridge in 1947 during Murdoch's year of study there. Peter Conradi reports that Murdoch transcribed Kreisel's letters into her journals over the next fifty years. According to Conradi, \\"For half a century she nonetheless records variously Kreisel's brilliance, wit and sheer 'dotty' solipsistic strangeness, his amoralism, cruelty, ambiguous vanity and obscenity.\\" Murdoch dedicated her 1971 novel An Accidental Man to Kreisel and he became a (partial) model for several characters in other novels, including Marcus Vallar in The Message to the Planet and Guy Openshaw in Nuns and Soldiers.*Peter Conradi, Iris Murdoch: A Life (HarperCollins, 2001), 264-65. After retirement Kreisel lived in Salzburg, Austria. He wrote several biographies of mathematicians including Kurt G√∂del, Bertrand Russell and Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer. He died in Salzburg, aged 91. Anecdotes When Kreisel was teaching at The University of Reading he would frequently take the train into London. There was a particularly fast train that was timed just right for the shows in London, and he would go to the station at that time. He checked the timetable one day, and that train was canceled. But out of habit one day he showed up at the station at the usual time and the train was there. It seems that it was going from Bristol to London, stopping at Reading only to get water. He got on the train anyway, and from then on took that train regularly. One day he was accosted by the conductor after he got on. \\"The train doesn't stop here sir!\\" \\"In that case I didn't get on here.\\"Kreiseliana: About and Around Georg Kreisel, ed. by Piergiorgio Odifreddi, Wellesley, MA, 1996, (Festschrift) See also * Kreisel‚ÄìPutnam logic References External links * Piergiorgio Odifreddi (ed.), Kreiseliana: About and Around George Kreisel, Wellesley, Massachusetts: A.

He then studied at the Federal Polytechnic Institute in Zurich, Switzerland and at the Prague Institute of Technology, where he earned a doctoral degree in 1917. After serving in First World War, he opened his own architectural and engineering office in Prague and developed his skills in stress analysis of reinforced concrete, pre- stressed reinforced concrete and steel structures. Polivka became an expert in photo-elastic stress analysis, a technique that examines small-scale transparent models in polarized light. In Prague Polivka worked together with avant-garde Czech architect Josef Havl√≠ƒçek on the Habich Building (1927‚Äì28) and Chicago Building (1927‚Äì28). Polivka designed the structural frame of the Czech Pavilion at the Paris International Exhibition of 1937 collaborating with renown Czech architect, Jarom√≠r Krejcar and Czech engineer Ren√© Wiesner. Two years later, he worked with Czech architect Kamil Ro≈°kot to design another Czech Pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair. In 1939 Polivka immigrated to the United States and took a position as research associate and lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1941, he and Victor di Suvero co- invented a structural design technique that received a patent for improvements in structures.

Historically, ziemianie consisted of hereditary nobles (szlachta) and landed commoners (kmiecie; Latin: cmethones). The Statutes of Piotrk√≥w (1496) restricted the right to hold manorial lordships to hereditary nobility. The non-nobles thus had to either sell their estates to the lords or seek a formal ennoblement for themselves (not an easy task), or had their property taken away. A rare exception was the burgesses of certain specially privileged \\"ennobled\\" royal cities who were titled \\"nobilis\\" and were allowed to buy and inherit manorial estates and exercise their privileges (such as jurisdiction over their subjects) and monopolies (over distilleries, hunting grounds, etc.). Therefore, in the szlachta-dominated Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth there was almost no landed gentry in the English meaning of the term, i.e. commoners who owned landed estates. With the Partitions these restrictions were loosened and finally any commoner could buy or inherit land. This made the 20th-century Polish landed gentry consist mostly of hereditary nobles, but also of others. They were the lesser members of the szlachta, contrasting with the much smaller but more powerful group of \\"magnate\\" families (sing. magnat, plural magnaci in Polish), the Magnates of Poland and Lithuania. Compared to the situation in England and some other parts of Europe, these two parts of the overall \\"nobility\\" to a large extent operated as different classes, and were often in conflict. After the Partitions of Poland, at least in the stereotypes of 19th-century nationalist lore, the magnates often made themselves at home in the capitals and courts of the partitioning powers, while the gentry remained on their estates, keeping the national culture alive (for a preserved, non-magnate example, see DƒÖbrowski Manor in Micha≈Çowice). 20th century Although the March Constitution of Poland (1921) abolished the legal class of hereditary nobility, szlachta or ziemia≈Ñstwo was informally recognized and remained an economic and social reality as well as a politically influential group, to a degree greater than hereditary nobility in European countries with more highly developed capitalism (and the remnants of feudalism mostly gone). At the end of World War II, because of the Polish Land Reform Act passed in 1944 by the Polish Committee of National Liberation, landed gentry with larger estates was dispossessed and eliminated as a social group. Many land-owning families were eliminated or had their estates confiscated by the Germans or Soviets, earlier during the war. With the liquidation of the Polish People's Republic (1989), the descendants of Polish landed gentry became politically active, struggling for (and often succeeding in) restoration of land ownership or at least compensation. Attempts to delegitimize the land reform of 1944 have also been made. Prawo w≈Çasno≈õci w dekrecie z 6 wrze≈õnia 1944. Polskie Towarzystwo Ziemia≈Ñskie References *T. Chrzanowski, \\"Dziedzictwo.

Career Non League Born in Manchester, McNeil played local football in the Middleton Sunday leagues and Rochdale Saturday leagues until the age of 20. He then played a few games for Curzon Ashton Reserves before being spotted by the Altrincham Reserve team manager, Bernard Taylor. After turning out good performances in the reserves, he then progressed on into the first team scoring a goal on his debut. He then came on as a substitute in the league cup final against Gainsborough, helping the team to come from behind to win the cup after extra time. In pre-season, McNeil was then scouted by Burnley and Crewe after a fine midfield display against a strong Manchester City side. He was offered a week trial at Burnley in which he completed, and then he was asked to stay longer because Burnley had liked what they had seen. He stayed for a total of three weeks, playing in the reserve league before an injury brought the trial to an end. McNeil was told \\"go back to Altrincham and get fit and we will come and have another look\\". He then got fit, played a few first team games but couldn't hold a regular place down and was loaned out to Woodley Sports. After impressing in a cup tie for Woodley Sports against Stalybridge Celtic he was then quickly snapped up by them in 1999, where he went on to win an Historic Treble and gain promotion to the conference National. McNeil also attracted the attentions of a lot of league clubs throughout the season, with Bury being the most notable. At the end of the season the Management team and several players had left the club for Southport, leaving the club to rebuild for the new season. McNeil and his new teammates found it very difficult in the Conference and he opted to move to Runcorn in January for an undisclosed fee. He helped the club have a strong finish to their season and the following year the club reached the first round proper of the FA Cup, in which he scored in every round. He was then sold to Hyde United, where he won two leagues, two cups plus he was Hyde's supporters player of the year for two years in succession. His form and goals gained the attention of then, Macclesfield Town boss Brian Horton. The Football League McNeil made a scoring and man of the match performance on his professional debut in the 2005‚Äì06 Northern Final, second leg against Carlisle United and took the tie to extra time, but Macclesfield lost on away goals. Following a successful two-month loan spell, he signed a permanent contract with League Two side Macclesfield Town in June 2006. He made 35 league appearances in the 2006‚Äì07 season, scoring five goals. The highlight of the season was playing at Chelsea in the third round of the FA Cup, and getting an assist for the goal in the 6-1 defeat. He Also had a good end to the season, helping keep the club in the football league. He was offered a new contract at Macclesfield, but joined Stockport County in July 2007, where manager Jim Gannon said of him, \\"He has all the qualities we want. He's very strong, hard working and well equipped for his role.\\" He made 22 appearances for Stockport, scoring six goals and won the player of the month for both September and November, before injury interrupted his 2007‚Äì08 season. He returned to feature briefly in Stockport's final game of the season, coming on as a substitute for the final few minutes of their Wembley play-off victory. He was offered a new twelve-month contract by Stockport, but the first half of his 2008‚Äì09 season also turned out to be plagued by injury. After being sent off shortly into the second match of the season, McNeil suffered a knee injury in training, and missed the remainder of August, all of September, and the first half of October. He returned to face Colchester United on 18 October, scoring in the first half, but being hospitalised with a head injury by a clumsy challenge in the second half.McNeil out of Dons clash StockportCounty.com. Retrieved 6 June 2011 After a further month out through injury, McNeil returned to the first team for a spell of games in November, before a recurrence of a back problem forced him to limp out of the pre-match warmup for an FA Cup tie against Gillingham on 9 December, and spend the next six weeks on the sidelines.Stockport vs Gillingham StockportCounty.com. Retrieved 6 June 2011 McNeil was out of contract at the end of the season, and with the club going into administration, plus the management being made redundant, he wasn't offered a new contract. He then had a contract offer from Accrington Stanley, but when the deal was agreed, Accrington then reduced the contract offer, and he felt that the deal didn't suit him. He then went on to train with Rochdale and Bury, but for one reason or another a deal was not offered. At the start of December, McNeil then made a surprise return to Stockport County in League One, where he signed a short-term contract until January, and then he was promised a deal until the end of the season. With the club still in administration, they made some loan signings in January, and some signings on a 6-month contract, but towards the end of January, McNeil was only offered another short-term deal and not the deal until the end of the season as promised, so he decided to leave the club. Return to non- League McNeil signed for Southport on 12 May 2010, after he left Stockport County earlier on in the year. He made a good start to the season, hitting two goals against Kidderminster in a thrilling 4‚Äì3 away win, but soon after that he had a groin injury which kept him out for a few weeks. When he came back he helped the club to a money spinning home tie, live on ITV with league one side Sheffield Wednesday in the first round of the FA Cup. McNeil and his teammates battled on in the league but they couldn't do enough to keep the club from finishing fourth bottom of the Conference. However the club stayed up because Rushden was kicked out of the league due to breaking the rules. He signed for Chester in June 2011, after he left Southport the previous month. McNeil suffered a knee injury in his first pre-season friendly against Tranmere, and missed the rest of pre-season. He then managed to recover in time to make the first game of the season, where he scored on his debut. His season would be cut short due to a career threatening knee injury, which meant he would miss the last 10 games of the season, However, he still went on to win Supporters player of the year and the Managers player of the year. The team also went on to secure the league title and win their second successive promotion in two years. Personal life McNeil's son, Dwight, currently plays for Premier League club Burnley.

Generally less popular than wargames set on land, naval wargaming nevertheless enjoys a degree of support around the world. Both historical and fantasy rulesets are available. Model ships have long been used for wargaming, but it was the introduction of elaborate rules in the early 20th century that made the hobby more popular. Small miniature ships, often in 1:1200 scale and 1:1250 scale, were manoeuvred on large playing surfaces to recreate historical battles. These models were basic representations of ship types, with enough detail to make them recognisable. Firms such as Bassett-Lowke marketed these to the public in England,Head, Derek. Bassett-Lowke Waterline Ship Models London 1996 along with more detailed versions that appealed to collectors. Prior to World War II, the German company Wiking became a leader in the field,Sch√∂nfeld, Peter Wiking-Modelle Die Schiffe und Flugseuge Hamburg 1998 but the war ended its dominance. After World War II, several manufacturers started business in Germany, which remains a major centre of production to this day.Jacobs, Paul 1250 History on the steelnavy.com website Other companies started in Britain and the United States as well, first centering on the wargamer, but as time went by and models became both more detailed and costly, marketing to the collector. There has also been a diversification in scales. Plastic kits in 1/600 and 1/700 became widely available. In the UK Skytrex and Navwar pioneered the \\"micro scale\\" with extensive ranges of ships from pre-dreadnought ironclads to modern vessels in 1/3000. In the US CinC and GHQ followed with slightly larger and more detailed models in 1/2400. In recent years Hallmark have moved the scale down to 1/6000. A separate branch of naval wargaming uses radio control ships capable of firing BB ammo from CO2 powered cannons, with the aim of sinking opposing ships, whose hulls are made of thin balsa wood. Overview Rules The origins of naval-themed board wargaming have obvious connections with the art of making model ships As with other arms of the wargaming hobby, rules can vary greatly in complexity. Commercially available historical rulesets cover practically every era of naval warfare from ancient and medieval ships through the fleets of the Age of Sail, the ironclad and battleship eras to the modern era. Models of most common types of ships are available, but in many cases wargamers have to source their own models, either by conversion or scratch building, especially where more esoteric periods or scales are in use. The ancient Romans staged what were probably the first naval \\"wargames\\", with mock sea battles acted out in Rome's Colosseum, specially flooded for the occasion. (These Naumachiae later provided the inspiration for the title of Rod Langton's ancient naval rules.) Popular naval wargaming began with the inclusion of wargaming rules in early editions of Jane's Fighting Ships by Fred T. Jane. Classifications of ships' armour and armament in Janes' were used directly within the rules. Incarnations of the rules are still in use today.The Fred Jane rules have been reprinted at http://www.wargaming.co Oversized model pirate ships for the Pirates Constructible Strategy Game, at Gen Con Indy in August 2007 A later proponent of popular naval wargaming was American author Fletcher Pratt. As well as publishing his rules Pratt staged large public games in ballrooms and other large meeting rooms, the events being almost as much a social event as a wargaming meeting. As with Janes' rules various incarnations and revisions of the Fletcher Pratt rule system are still in use today.The Pratt rules are available from http://www.wargaming.co The Age of Sail rules for the 1972 Don't Give Up The Ship call for pencil and paper, six-sided dice, rulers and protractors, and model ships, ideally of 1:1200 scale. Single ship engagements can be played on a tabletop, but fleet battles require more space. The rules are elaborate and cover morale, sinking, fires, broken masts, and boarding. Wind speed and direction are determined by a roll of the dice; a protractor is used to measure the angle between the wind and ship directions and hence determine ship speed. The protractor is also used to determine which cannon can fire on an enemy ship, as well as the damage caused and the chance of hitting at short range (4\\") and long range (16\\"). The conclusion of the rulebook provides the statistics necessary to re-enact historical encounters such as during the War of 1812. The second edition added 4 pages of simplified rules for battles between fleets. One of the most popular sets of rules available at present is General Quarters, written by Lonnie Gill. Quick and easy to play, they have established themselves over the years as one of the leading sets of World War I and II era rules.Survey of naval Wargames Rules, NWS journal \\"Battlefleet\\" 1996 General Quarters 1 and 2 feature a slightly abstract combat system and ship definition system reminiscent of naval board wargames. However, this approach led to a fast-playing system that was the root of its popularity (probably coupled to an extensive array of supporting information and ship statistics). GQ1 and 2 have recently been replaced by a less abstract version, GQ3 which covers World War II; a World War I version entitled Fleet Action Imminent was released in January 2008. The 1975 naval wargame Don't Give Up The Ship. Followers of naval wargaming tend to concentrate on historical settings. However, there is a smaller but nonetheless active arm of the hobby that covers fantasy and science fiction naval warfare. The now out-of-print fantasy game Man O' War, set in the realm of Warhammer Fantasy, dealt with sea battles where each player typically controlled half a dozen to a dozen model ships. Each model had a corresponding template to record damage, crew levels, and outbreaks of fire, among other bookkeeping activities. In this regard, the game mechanics proved some limiting factors. Ships were split into three categories: Ships of the Line, Men O'War and \\"Independents\\". The Bretonnian fleet was modelled on ships of the 17th century, while the Empire tended more towards the look of earlier time, with some ships that carried single large cannon or mortars. Dwarf ships were steam powered ironclads, and they also had submarines and balloons. High Elf ships were fast maneuverable sail powered ships, while Dark Elves mainly used great sea creatures as the basis for their \\"ships\\". Land-based miniature wargames have also been adapted to naval wargaming. All at Sea, for example, is an adaptation of The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game rules for naval conflicts. The game's mechanics centred on boarding parties, with options for ramming actions and light artillery in the form of ballistae and other siege engines. As such, the ship's scale ratio corresponds to the 25 mm scale miniatures used by The Lord of the Rings. Model ships are built by hobbyists, just as normal miniature terrain, such as \\"great ships\\" of Pelargir, cogs of Dol Amroth and Corsairs of Umbar galleys. Elsewhere successful adaptations of the DBA and Fire and Fury land warfare rules have been made to ancient and Renaissance naval battles at the fleet action level (where naval battles shared many characteristics of their land based equivalents). An unusual source of recent historical naval wargaming rules has been the adaptation of science fiction starship combat rules (the reverse is also true, as sci-fi tends to treat starships as being an evolution of \\"wet navy\\" shipping). An example of this approach to rule development is Victory at Sea from Mongoose Publishing. This is a simple, \\"entry level\\" set of rules developed from Mongoose's A Call to Arms sci-fi rules. Victory at Sea has also spawned a number of period variants including Ironclad and Age of Sail, and a World War I variant set called \\"Age of dreadnoughts\\" has also been published.Victory at Sea Elsewhere a variant of the Full Thrust science fiction starship combat rules exists that covers age of sail battles. Another example, Battlefleet Gothic (BFG), is based from the Warhammer 40,000 land battle game, both developed by Games Workshop. Every major army in Warhammer 40,000 has its representative fleet in BFG, as it is known colloquially. Classic space navy battle games such as Star Trek: Starship Tactical Combat Simulator corporation or Star Wars: Star Warriors have been heavily influenced by naval terminology. Scales In contrast to land wargaming, naval wargaming almost exclusively uses ratios to express the scale of the models. Popular scales include: 1:1250 scale die-cast models of ships *1:6000, 1:4800, 1:3000, 1:2400 - popular for use in games of the pre-Dreadnought era and later, although some notable ranges in earlier periods are available. * 1:1800 - A growing intermediate scale, made popular by games such as Axis and Allies: War at Sea that use a \\"trading card\\" format. While still less common than smaller and larger scales, the simpler dynamics of \\"casual\\" wargaming makes this an increasingly common introductory scale. *1:1200, 1:1250 - the popular \\"collectors'\\" scale, with models from practically every era and nationality available. *1:900 - an unusual scale, used for ancient naval games. *1:600, 1:700 - generally used for coastal forces gaming set in World War I, World War II or post war periods. Due to the availability of plastic kits in this scale, some naval wargamers use these scales to play \\"in the grand manner\\" for battleship encounters, often playing on areas measured in yards rather than feet. This is also an extremely popular scale for American Civil War riverine and other ironclad era actions. *1:450 - another unusual scale, used for pirate and small Age of Sail actions (e.g. Peter Pig's \\"Pieces of Eight\\" range). *1:400, 1:300, 1:285 - some coastal models are available in these scales. Often used for riverine actions involving close liaison with land forces in similar scales. *10mm or 1:160 - a newer scale for \\"collectible\\" American Civil War naval gaming. Often used for actions involving close liaison with land forces in 10 mm. Notable exceptions to the \\"ratio\\" rule are the use of 15 mm to 25 mm games that emphasise boarding actions, and thus make use of figure ranges in those scales. Radio control combat Large scale model warships in San Diego Rather than simply acting out battles through the use of representative static models, in model warship combat, radio control ships (usually used in ponds) are constructed and outfitted with BB cannons capable of damaging and sinking other vessels. The ships are designed to be realistically sunk, and all clubs have very stringent rules requiring ships not to be built with hulls stronger than is appropriate, typically specifying a thickness of the balsa wood hulls as well as a test of penetrability. To reduce the chance of spectator injuries, and to prevent a vessel from having an unfair advantage, the propellant gas used in the cannons is limited in pressure, and may be tested by the judges, again disqualifying a ship if it is too high. For historic copies any ship traveling faster than the appropriate scale speed may be disqualified or ordered to maintain a slower speed. An inappropriately high top speed gives a ship an unfair advantage, and is frowned upon by other members. 1/144 scale is the most common scale, although others do exist. Some events try to recreate historic events, while others create original scenarios, such as all-out war, a subset of ships defending a port against an attacking enemy, protection of a group of unarmed merchant vessels, or any other scenario the club members decide would be fun. Even in recreations of historic battles, the sequence of events and outcome of the engagements are decided by the actions and luck of the operators, and often do not have much resemblance of the historical events. Depending on the rules, a ship may be allowed to surrender and receive safe passage back to shore where it is removed from play, or other ships may fire on it until it sinks. Ships are designed to tolerate sinking such that a sunken ship need only be retrieved after the battle is over, minor repairs executed, fresh batteries installed, and returned to the water for the next round. Many ships also contain bilge pumps, of a maximum capacity specified by the rules of a specific club for the type of ship, to allow them to sustain minor damage without immediately sinking. In some formats, events are scored by the final results, such as which side has more remaining ships (or survives longest) in a two team game, while others are scored on a point systems, with hits and sinkings assigned differing point values.

He had run textile business initially in Pala, and later on in Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) in 1908; he also established a bus service in Thiruvananthapuram from 1910 onwards.T K Velupillai - Travancore State Manual - Travancore Government Press - 1940. The bank was incorporated under the Travancore Companies Regulation (1092) with the following persons as the initial Promoter-Directors:- * Chairman: Augusti Mathai Kayalackakom * Mg. Director: Joseph Augusti Kayalackakom * Directors: Outha Ouseph Thottumkal, Varkey Ouseph Vellookunnel, Cheriyathu Thommen Menamparambil, George Joseph Kottukappallil and Jacob Cherian Maruthukunnel thumbnailJoseph Augusti Kayalackakom The bank was on a growth track right from the beginning. Its style of functioning was quite different from the other banks of the day. It was more of 'mass banking' than the 'class banking' practised by other banks of those days. This was a welcome change for the people who, for their needs, had largely depended on small moneylenders, most of whom were from Kalladaikurichi in Tamil Nadu. The Tamilians were charging exorbitant rates of interest on loans. In 1929, when the Great Depression struck and Travancore's plantation sector was badly hit, the bank gave liberal assistance to the plantations. The bank, which later changed its name to Palai Central Bank, started expanding its activities by opening branches at several places. When the Bank opened a branch in New Delhi, India's new capital city in 1932, it was the very first bank to do so, ahead of even the established north-Indian banks. The Bank also discovered the potential of Aluva (Alwaye) by opening a branch there, years before Aluva became a major industrial town.A Sreedhara Menon - A Survey of Kerala History - D C Books - 2008. In 1935, the bank introduced electricity in its head office building in Pala by installing oil- powered generator, years before Government's first power project was commissioned at Pallivasal and electricity became common. The bank was also a pioneer in introducing modern advertising, which was quite different from the staid advertisements of other banks of the day.K M Joseph - Pala Innale Innu ['Palai Yesterday and Today' in Malayalam] - Deepanalam Press - 1981. Employees ‚Äì both executives and staff ‚Äì were trained to project the bank's motto of customer service. A young boy coming to deposit the scholarship amount he got received the same service that large depositors enjoyed. It was, therefore, natural that years later, when the bright youngster became District Collector, he still regarded the bank as 'his' bank. The bank's branch managers followed an 'open door' policy making them accessible to everyone. This was in sharp contrast with their counterparts of the Imperial Bank of India, who were totally unapproachable to the common man. The bank's managers, KM Joseph and later KM Augustine in Thiruvananthapuram, George Joseph in Chennai (Madras), KM Chacko in Nagercoil, C J Thomas in Delhi and others enjoyed exceptional popularity and influence.  Dominant position  In 1935, George Thomas Kottukapally, the brother of Director George Joseph Kottukappally, became a Director of Palai Central Bank. As the Travancore Debt Relief Act was coming into existence in 1937, one of the first directors of the bank, Jacob Cherian Maruthukunnel, was nominated to the Sree Chitra State Council to pilot the relative Debt Relief Bill, as it was expected that banks would be affected by the Act. In 1937, two of the major banks of Travancore ‚Äì Travancore National Bank and Quilon Bank merged to form Travancore National and Quilon (TNQ) Bank. However, in the very next year it was liquidated on the orders of C. P. Ramaswami Iyer, Dewan of Travancore. This led to the collapse of more than 60 small banks. However, Palai Central Bank, which was the leading bank then, remained unaffected.Manorama Year Book (1965 Edition) - Malayala Manorama Publications. In 1940, industrialisation received a boost as power supply was started in Travancore from Pallivasal Project and a stream of industries like FACT and Ceramics, Kundara were started. In 1945, the State had another milestone in banking as the State Bank of Travancore was started. With India's independence in 1947, the first popular government assumed power in Travancore in 1948 with Pattom Thanu Pillai as Chief Minister. The new Chief Minister told the bank's management that with the dawn of independence, the bank could make a major contribution in nation building. The bank rose to the occasion, taking the leadership in subscribing to government bonds for large amounts. Development projects of the State that the bank financed included the construction of the Trivandrum-Nagercoil Cement Concrete Road, which now forms part of NH-47. In the 1940s the Bank enjoyed an unprecedented financial position and influence. The chief editor of Malayala Manorama Daily spoke in a TV interview (decades later) about the Palai Central Bank management helping their founder Mammen Mappilai ‚Äì who was struggling to revive the newspaper ‚Äì by offering to take over the paper as a whole or to invest in its shares, as a friendly gesture of Joseph Augusti towards a close family friend. Eventually, an investment of 20% in shares was made. In 1948, K M Joseph Kayalackakom ‚Äì who had become a Director of the bank in 1940 following the death of his father and the first Chairman of the Bank, Augusty Mathai ‚Äì moved from Trivandrum to the bank's head office at Pala. He then became the virtual General Manager of the institution. In 1947, at a time when there were no management schools anywhere in the British Empire, Joseph Augusti sent his cousin KM George to the United States for management studies. KM George took his MBA degree from New York University in 1948, thus becoming the first MBA degree holder in Travancore. In 1949, he joined the bank as an executive. He was to later become the Secretary and chief executive officer of the bank. In the late forties it was found that during the previous few years, the institution had drifted and slowed down from its previous spectacular growth rate. Officials, who had the charge of advances, had not been successful in controlling subordinates sufficiently to ensure discipline over making of advances. Several advances had proved to be doubtful, although their percentage in total advances was not high. Strict discipline was now enforced. A series of innovative schemes, were also introduced which brought not only order to the Bank but also set it on a course of further rapid growth. In 1949, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was nationalised and the Banking Companies Act came into existence (later renamed as Banking Regulation Act). This legislation gave RBI complete control over commercial banks. As RBI entered the picture, it continuously pursued the question of the old doubtful advances of the bank, although it was satisfied with the bank's subsequent operations.Banking Regulation Act, 1949 - Government of India. In 1950, when a new Diocese of the Catholic Church was formed in Pala, it was an open secret that the bank was the prime mover in bringing the Diocese to Pala. Joseph Augusti led a delegation that accompanied the new Bishop Mar Sebastian Vayalil to Rome for the investiture ceremony. The bank also took keen interest in extending assistance to the initial ventures of the new Diocese of Palai. In 1953, the Bank had the honour of according a grand reception to Eugene Tisserant, Dean of Vatican's Sacred College of Cardinals, at the residence of the managing director in Palai during the Cardinal's historic visit to Kerala. In 1953, George Thomas Kottukapally, who was still a Director of the bank, became a member of parliament. Even after that, he continued to be a director. In the same year, when A. J. John (who had become Chief Minister of the integrated Travancore-Cochin State) resigned, he accepted the bank's invitation to join its board of directors.  Hurdles  In January 1955, the ruling Indian National Congress party, at their national conference held at Avadi in Tamil Nadu, passed the resolution to establish socialism in India \\"where the principal means of production are under social ownership or control\\". As the implementation of this began and the nation started moving along the socialist path, in that year itself Government of India nationalised the Imperial Bank of India and formed State Bank of India. In January 1956, life insurance was nationalised and Life Insurance Corporation of India was formed. In 1957, with a view to further advancing socialism, four new taxes were introduced in the country, viz. Wealth Tax, Expenditure Tax, Capital Gains Tax and Gift Tax. Palai Central Bank had by then emerged not only as the biggest enterprise in Kerala ‚Äì bigger than all the private and public undertakings and banks in the State ‚Äì but also as the 17th largest bank in the country, bigger than even some of the State banks. From 1956 onwards RBI started turning down the Bank's repeated requests for opening new branches. In 1956, when RBI asked for the communal break-up of the Bank's depositors, not many could foresee what was to follow. Even without branch expansion, the Bank was, however, making steady growth. With a view to strengthening the calibre of its executives, KM Mathai was sent for training to USA at the Kings County Trust Company and the First National City Bank of New York(Citibank), as well as at Midland Bank in UK. K M Ignatius, another executive, was trained at the First National City Bank of the US. In March 1957, H V R Iyengar became Governor of RBI. He had succeeded B Rama Rau who had resigned due to differences with the Finance Minister after a long period of nearly eight years in office. Iyengar's tenure as Governor was a tumultuous period in the history of Indian banking. The year 1956 saw the birth of Kerala State and a year later in 1957 Kerala registered another first by voting to power the world's first communist government to be elected through the ballot box. Meanwhile, in Delhi, Jawaharlal Nehru's two finance ministers had resigned in quick succession and Morarji Desai became the new Finance Minister in March 1958. Nehru soon became aware of the adamant and uncompromising attitude of Desai. In 1959, seven banks controlled by the erstwhile native states ‚Äì including State Bank of Travancore ‚Äì were nationalised by Government of India and made subsidiaries of State Bank of India. Towards the end of that year RBI, under the influence of the north Indian bankers' lobby, initiated a series of steps in Palai Central Bank. These steps, taken with the stated object of improving the Bank's working, were apparently aimed at wrecking the institution. It asked Joseph Augusti to retire from the board of directors of the Bank. Also, K M George was asked to step down from the post of chief executive officer and to continue as Secretary of the Bank. An outsider ‚Äì an official of the State Bank of India ‚Äì was appointed as the bank's new chief executive officer. Following these moves, some of the bank's depositors lost confidence in the institution and withdrew their deposits. Some people felt that RBI wanted to create a crisis in the Bank to facilitate its closure. However, the crisis did not occur as the run on deposits soon ceased, and some of the depositors even made re-deposits.Report of the Travancore-Cochin Banking Enquiry Commission - Manager of Publications, Government of India - 1956.  Banking crisis  In 1960 February, a new ministry assumed office in Kerala with Pattom Thanu Pillai as Chief Minister. In August that year, the Governor of RBI succeeded in persuading Desai for the closure of Palai Central Bank which, he told him, had too much of doubtful advances. That RBI gave misleading and false data to convince him is something which Desai himself would come to know only much later. The fact that all the doubtful advances were more than a decade old, and related to the period before the introduction of the Banking Regulation Act was not conveyed to him. RBI moved the application in Kerala High Court for the winding up of the Bank under Section 38(3)(b)(iii) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. It may be noted that the Banking Regulation Act does not allow the High Court to go into the merits of RBI's application but specifies that the Court \\"shall order the winding up\\" if an application is made by RBI. Also, RBI can move an application if in the opinion of the RBI \\"the continuance of the banking company is prejudicial to the interests of its depositors\\", which is a rather vague provision. Justice P T Raman Nair, the presiding Judge of the Kerala High Court ordered the winding up on 8 August 1960. After the winding up, Desai vehemently defended his action in Parliament. He, however, had to admit later that the reasons earlier stated were not correct. A banking crisis followed the liquidation of Palai Central Bank. Most of the banks in the State faced a run on their deposits. Even some of the banks outside Kerala were affected. The total deposits of all the 339 commercial banks in India stood at Rs. 20218.4 million in 1960. Out of the 339 commercial banks, 94 were Scheduled Banks and 245 were Non-Scheduled banks. The total deposits of all the 94 scheduled commercial banks, which was Rs. 19719.7 million before the crisis, fell by more than 10% to Rs. 17418.0 million in the 6 months following the crisis. Punjab National Bank, the worst affected among the northern Banks, received special support. But the affected Kerala banks were less lucky. They were amalgamated with other banks in the state or outside.Selected Banking Indicators 1947-1997 - Reserve Bank of India. When the closure of the State's largest bank also led to a crisis in the entire banking system, there was a hue and cry in all quarters, including the press. But out of sheer obstinacy, Desai refused to reconsider the matter. When a group of Kerala MPs met Nehru requesting that the bank be revived, he told them that he would like to, but his insistence will lead to the resignation of Desai. He said there is a feeling that Finance Ministers did not thrive under him and so he did not want another resignation. In the larger interests of the nation, he asked the Kerala MPs to put up with the whole thing. When Chief Minister Pattom Thanu Pillai met Desai to make a personal appeal, he cut him out by asking as to how much money he had lost. A furious Pattom Thanu Pillai told him that like Desai he was also a true Gandhian and he has never had a bank account in his life. He then angrily walked out. With that, all doors for a revival from Government side were closed. A legal battle was then fought. But the delay of the legal process made a revival impossible. In the Supreme Court, the Bank's case was argued among others by Gopal Swarup Pathak, who later became Vice-President of India. The Court ruled in a 3‚Äì2 judgement that with the delay, a revival has been rendered infructuous.http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103959/ After the closure of the bank the first impression of the public was that Palai Central Bank had failed. They assumed foul play. When the Finance Minister of the country states in Parliament that the bank's deposits had hardly 15% asset backing, the people had no reason to disbelieve. They had to wait for years to know that even after bearing several years of liquidation expenses, the depositors got more than 90% of their money ‚Äì but in petty instalments. The people knew only then that as a going concern, the bank could very well have repaid its depositors fully. About 30 years later, in the early 1990s when banks in India faced a crisis of mounting losses and high levels of non-performing assets, an interviewer asked a now-retired Justice P T Raman Nair about his thoughts on the winding-up order of Palai Central Bank three decades ago. He then remarked that today's banks were in much worse condition and that if the current yard stick were applied Palai Central Bank would not have been ordered to be closed. In Volume II of the History of RBI covering the years 1951‚Äì1967,http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/RHvol-2.aspx a 27-page appendix viz. \\"Appendix C: The Palai Central Bank\\" extensively covers the history of the Bank. The following is an extract: \\"While defending the Reserve Bank as 'one of the best central banks in the world' maintaining a 'high level of efficiency', the Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was reported to have acknowledged that it may have made a 'mistake' in closing down the Palai Central Bank. \\"Defending the (Reserve) Bank's action, the (RBI) Governor recalled the representations received from the Kerala Bankers' Association and the Travancore-Cochin Banking Inquiry Commission to 'go slow' on refusing licences to banks in Kerala and pointed out that if the (Reserve) Bank had taken the action it had now taken in any of the previous three years, it would have been subject to even greater criticism. 'This has been the considered judgement of my colleagues and myself in the Bank.' However, (Governor) Iengar conceded, 'someone else could have exercised his judgement differently'.\\" http://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/content/PDFs/90044.pdf The crisis that shook the banking sector of the country led to some changes in that sector. The demand for protecting the interests of depositors in the event of similar crises led to the passing of the Deposit Insurance Act by Parliament in 1961 and the eventual formation of the Deposit Insurance & Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC). Another demand arose from the allegation that RBI is a bureaucratic institution insensitive to the needs of the banking sector. Its advocates called for the formation of a Superintendent of Banking like that in the US to carry out the function of supervision of banking in the country. This demand was partially met years later when Government introduced a policy to appoint a career banker as one of the Deputy Governors of RBI.  Political fallout  When one looks now at the forced closure of an institution like Palai Central Bank, one sees it as a political failure too. Today, if the Central Government considers the closure of an institution (or even its shifting or merger or modification), all-party delegations of MPs and Ministers are seen rushing to Delhi to ensure that no such decision is taken. But way back in 1960, when the nation was barely 13 years into its independent status, the MPs and MLAs and even the Ministers were far less effective. When the largest institution of Kerala was being ordered to be closed by a Central Government agency, Kerala's politicians could not prevent it but had to meekly abide by the dictates of their national leadership. The people of central Kerala, however, felt abandoned, if not betrayed. There was also another aspect. The Bank was considered to be an institution of the Christian community, although members of every religion and community were present among the Bank's innumerable account holders, employees, advisors and well-wishers. Today, if an institution of a minority community is touched by the Government, that community would create such a furore that anyone will think twice before taking a step forward. But minorities were much less aware of their rights away back in 1960. The Christian community, therefore, suffered in silence. In 1964, barely 3 years after the closure of Palai Central Bank, a major upheaval occurred in the Congress Party in Kerala. Fifteen of its MLAs ‚Äì mainly those from central Kerala ‚Äì split and formed a new party, Kerala Congress. It was the beginning of a change in the political equations in the State. The closure of Palai Central Bank is considered by many to be one of the root causes that led to the new chain of events. In the same year, under an ingenious scheme which came to be known as ‚ÄòKamaraj Plan‚Äô, the irrepressible Desai was removed from the Union Cabinet.

So long as one is working within the narrower concept of self, N√¶ss argues, environmentally responsible behaviour is a form of altruism, a \\"doing good for the other\\", which historically has been a precarious ethical basis, usually involved in exhorting others to \\"be good\\". N√¶ss argues that in his Ecosophy, the enlargement of the ego-self to the eco-self results in environmentally responsible behaviour as a form of self-interest.

(EarthLight Magazine 53, Spring 2005 Vol. 14, No. 4) The concept of the Ecological Self goes beyond anthropocentrism, which, by contrast locates human concerns as the exclusive source of all value. It draws upon the Land Ethic of Aldo Leopold. Leopold argued that within conventional ethics, the land itself was considered only as property, occupying a role analogous to slavery in earlier societies that permitted the ownership of people. By comparison a land ethic enlarges the boundary of moral concern to include \\"soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land\\". The basis of such a non-anthropocentric ethic, according to Leopold was that \\"A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.\\"Leopold, Aldo \\"The Land Ethic\\", in A Sand County Almanac Like Thomas Berry and Brian Swimme, ecological philosopher Freya MathewsMathews, Freya (1991) The Ecological Self (Routledge) argues that in considering the ecological self, we need to look beyond the present to the \\"deep time\\" of ages past, in the evolution of life and the creation of the cosmos, in order to consider the real roots of human consciousness.

He was born at Autun, Burgundy, of a distinguished house that produced the marquises of Montlyon and Raigny. He was the eldest son of Henri de Clugny, seigneur of Conforgien and Joursenvault, a councillor of Jean sans Peur, duke of Burgundy, and his wife, Pierrette Coullot.Salvador Miranda (ref). At the University of Bologna he obtained a doctorate utroque iure, in both civil (Roman) and canon law. Councillor and statesman in Burgundy While still a young man he was a member of the grand council of Philip the Good, the reigning duke of Burgundy, and a ma√Ætre des requ√™ts in the ducal court. Asked by the duke to assist, representing the clergy, in reducing to writing the customary law of Burgundy, he was sent instead as ambassador on several occasions, notably to Pope Callixtus III (in 1456 with Geoffroy de Thoisy, seigneur de Mimeure) and with the duke of Cleves, to the Council of Mantua (1459), convoked by Pope Pius II, who was engaged in planning war against the Turks. Clugny obtained from Pius confirmation of the Treaty of Arras (1435) and of the acts of Pope Eugenius IV and his successors. Duke Philip agreed to promote him to the see of Autun or see of M√¢con, whichever became vacant first. Lieutenant of the chancellor of Bourgogne at the see of Autun, 2 December 1459. He was named Apostolic Protonotary. He was one of the three Burgundian ambassadors sent to Louis XI of France in Melun in January 1465. After Philip's death, he was entrusted by the new duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, to negotiate the Treaty of P√©ronne (1468), to treat with Louis again at Noyon, and in 1473 to negotiate the Treaty of Senlis. He headed the Duke's grand council from 29 May 1473, and was named Chancellor of the Order of the Golden Fleece the following 15 September. With the death of Charles the Bold, 5 January 1477, Maximilian received the vast Burgundian inheritance by right of his wife. In the transfer of power to the Habsburg, Ferry de Clugny was confirmed in his positions, including that of Chancellor of the Golden Fleece (10 December 1477), where he guided the new sovereign of the order, and as councillor. Abbacies in commendam Like all major prelates of the time, he held multiple abbacies in commendam, which supported him in his official capacities in a manner befitting his rank. Not all these benefices came to him easily: though he was elected bishop of Cavaillon by its cathedral chapter in 1467, the election was never confirmed, and in 1468, he was unsuccessful in getting appointed dean by the chapter of Amiens. Later, he was provost of the collegiate church of Saint-Barth√©lemy de B√©thune, canon of the cathedral chapter of Cambrai, and archdeacon of Ardennes in Li√®ge.

On 7 November 1465, he obtained permission from the cathedral chapter of Autun, where he was a canon, to have a chapel built to be his sepulchre; it is called the Chapelle Dor√©e from the profusion of its gilding. For its painted walls he commissioned Pierre SpicreJacques Bacri, \\"Two Portraits by Pierre Spicre\\" Parnassus 9.4 (April 1937, pp. 24‚Äì28) p. 27. The eighteenth-century plaster covering the wall-paintings had recently been removed, permitting the attribution to Spicre, who had decorated a chapel for Clugny's friend, Cardinal Jean Rolin, at Beaune to provide figures of four Old Testament patriarchs, the four Evangelists and four doctors of the Church. In the Annunciation attributed to Rogier van der Weyden or one of his disciples, Hans Memling, that is now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Ferry de Clugny's arms appear in the carpet and in the stained glass above the Virgin's head; it too must have been commissioned by him.Susie Nash, \\"A Fifteenth-Century French Manuscript and an Unknown Painting by Robert Campin\\" The Burlington Magazine 137 No. 1108 (July 1995, pp. 428‚Äì437) p. 436.

Bishop of Tournai Between 1410 and 1483 four presidents of the great council of Burgundy succeeded one another as bishops of Tournai: Jehan de Thoisy, Jehan Chevrot, Guillaume Fillastre, and Ferry de Clugny. Following the death of Fillastre, Clugny was elected 8 October 1473, with the consent of Louis XI, as was the king's right; he took possession the following 22 March and occupied the see until his death. In January 1484, in Brussels, he baptised Marguerite, daughter of Archduke Maximilian, future Holy Roman Emperor, and Marie, the heiress of Burgundy. To Rome Clugny was created cardinal in secret by Pope Paul II in May or June 1471; the creation was not published because of the unexpected death of the Pope. He was publicly created cardinal priest in his absence, in the consistory of 15 May 1480. He arrived from Flanders in Rome with his household, which included the composer Marbrianus de Orto, 3 June 1482. On 10 June, he was received by the pope, who gave him the red hat. On 7 October 1483 he died suddenly, of a stroke; on the following day, he was buried in the church of Santa Maria del Popolo, far from the Clugny chapel that he had prepared at Autun.

Kaganaias was semi-aquatic and is the only known aquatic squamate to be found in Asia and is also the only known aquatic squamate known from before the Cenomanian stage of the Cretaceous. It is also the first to be found in an inland area, instead of on the coast where aquatic squamates are commonly found.Evans, S.E., Manabe, M., Noro, M., Isaji, S. & Yamaguchi, M. (2006). \\"A Long-Bodied Lizard From The Lower Cretaceous Of Japan.\\" Palaeontology, 49.6, 2006, pp. 1143‚Äì1165. Its generic name is derived from Kaga Province, the old name for the Ishikawa Prefecture where the specimens were found, while the species name hakusanensis comes from the mountain that gives its name to Hakusan the city near its find site. The geological formation in which the specimens were found, the Kuwajima Formation, stands alongside the Tetori River and has been the site of numerous other finds including molluscs, dinosaurs, fish and pterosaurs. Although Kaganaias is known to be in the Mosasaur family, it is unclear where; it has been assigned to Platynota (Varanoidea) for the time being. Description Kaganaias was small (roughly half a meter long), agile and had a long body. Like most of its semi-aquatic kind, Kaganaias had reduced limbs to aid in its aquatic activities. Kaganaias is known from two specimens; the holotype specimen was a partial skeleton, including numerous ribs, vertebrae and parts of the limbs and tail, whilst the secondary specimen had extra ribs and sections of the skull also, notably parts of the maxilla. The body of Kaganaias was both long and broad across the chest, but was predominantly flat. Despite being classified as a lizard, Kaganaias has numerous snake-like features. Sexual dimorphism may have been present in the species, but this is uncertain due to the paucity of data. Kaganaias lived in what was a fertile, inland swamp-like region of Japan, possibly a large floodplain which was covered with water for most of the year. The fossil itself was discovered by a construction team preparing to lay down a new tunnel through a fossil cliff in 1997. Kaganaias almost certainly moved through the water using a snake-like swimming motion, using its short hind legs to navigate. Kaganaias probably fed on other small vertebrates or molluscs which have been found in the surrounding area, but this has yet to be confirmed by the results of the examination of the fossil's faecal remains.

The temple is of significance to the Chinese in Singapore, and is believed to bring worshippers good luck after praying to the Kuan Yin (), or Avalokite≈õvara, the Goddess of Mercy. The temple is also involved in charity work, contributing to several health and educational organisations.  History and architecture  The temple's current side gate, used to leave the temple grounds. The temple has existed since 1884 at its present location with a reconstruction in 1895. The original temple was an example of Chinese temple architecture and traditional craftsmanship. In its vicinity were other places of worship such as the adjacent Sri Krishnan Temple, Church of Saints Peter and Paul at Queen Street, Maghain Aboth Synagogue and the Malabar Jama-ath Mosque. The original temple, entry was gained across a large sheltered courtyard through a porch and screened anteroom. The main hall then contained three altars, the central one for the Kuan Yin and one each for Bodhidharma (the founder of Zen Buddhism) and Hua Tuo, a Chinese patron saint of medicine and healing on the flanking altars. An image of Sakyamuni Buddha was kept in the rear hall and various ancillary rooms on either side. During the second World War, the temple was spared of destruction when all the other buildings in the area were severely damaged. It provided refuge for the sick, the wounded and the homeless. In 1982, the temple was extensively rebuilt as it needed to increase its capacity due to the high number of worshipers at the temple. All deities were enshrined on a single altar in the prayer hall with the elevated statue of Sakyamuni Buddha placed behind Kuan Yin. The relative positions of other deities remain unchanged. A large space of two separate roofs of different height. The entrance wall is a large central gateway flanked by two smaller ones and colours are rich in golden yellows, reds, blues and greens. At the ends of all the roof rafters, there are yellow Buddhist swastikas on a green ground. The roof decorations are comparatively constrained, the ridges, having simple curves with decorations of good omen. The tiles inside the hall of the temple are currently being changed from ceramics to granite. Candles and incense are not burnt inside the temple hall, but burnt in an urn at the entrance of the temple to prevent the soot from staining the ceiling.  Singapore Biennale  During the inaugural Singapore Biennale in 2006, it was used as a site to display artworks of several artists. A carpet designed by Xu Bing, a lotus mantra by Tsai Charwei, 1001 Buddha statues by Hiroshi Sugimoto and a \\"Please Love Me\\" sign written in the four official languages of Singapore by Santiago Cucullu.  Worship  250x250px Kwan Im Temple remains as one of the major temples in the area, with thousands of devotees visiting the temple to pray for blessings from Kwan Yin. Devotees believe that they will be blessed after worshiping at the temple, thus making it one of the most visited temples in Singapore. Devotees are known to visit the temple on the first or fifteenth day of Chinese New Year seeking blessings. On the eve of Chinese New Year, the temple is opened all night and the street is often packed with devotees queuing shoulder to shoulder to enter the temple hall to offer their incense to the Kwan Yin in hope for an auspicious start to the New Year. The temple is well known for its divination activities which are believed to be very accurate.  Charity work  The temple is known for its work towards charity since 1997. It first set up a Kidney Dialysis Centre at Simei, setting up an educational bursary and providing treatment to anybody regardless of race. Also, it embarked a national health screening programme, and set up a professorship in computing at the National University of Singapore in 2000 by donating S$1.5 million. The temple also donated to the National Kidney Foundation Singapore and is a patron of the Singapore arts scene.

First elected to the Colorado House of Representatives in 2000, Cadman was appointed to fill a vacancy in the Colorado Senate in 2007. Later, he represented Senate District 12, which covers rural Colorado Springs, Fort Carson, Security-Widefield, Cimarron Hills, and Cheyenne Mountain. He was on the Board of Directors of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a national association of legislators. In 2015, he was elected as President of the Colorado Senate when the GOP won control of the chamber for the 1st time in ten years. He left those offices on January 11, 2017. He was previously Republican Leader while in the minority. Biography Born in Hollywood, Maryland, Cadman earned a bachelor's degree from California State University in 1989 before settling in Colorado. Cadman worked as the office manager for U.S. Representative Joel Hefley from 1994 to 2000. From 1996-98, he was a board member of the Colorado Republican Party. Cadman is married; he and his wife, Lisa, have two children and live in Colorado Springs. Colorado House of Representatives In 2000, he was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives, representing House District 15, which covered eastern Colorado Springs, Colorado. Cadman rose to become House Majority Whip during the 2003‚Äì2004 session. Cadman won re-election to four terms in the House, defeating a series of Democratic opponents (Steven Bell in 2000, Charley Johnson in 2002, Bill Martin in 2004, and Allison Hunter in 2006), each time claiming more than 65% of the vote. During his time in the majority, Cadman sponsored legislation on the subjects of immigration, eviction practices, and domestic violence laws. After Democrats took control of the legislature in 2004, Cadman served as Minority Caucus Chair. During the 2007 legislative session, he sat on the House State, Veterans, and Military Affairs Committee, and on the legislature's Joint Computer Management Committee. Colorado State Senate 2007 appointment & 2008 election Term-limited in the State House, Cadman filed to run for the Colorado Senate in the 2008 legislative elections, seeking the seat held by Senator Ron May who was himself term-limited. Upon May's resignation in October 2007, Cadman sought and unanimously won a vacancy appointment to May's seat in the Colorado Senate. He resigned from the State House on December 10, 2007, and was sworn into the Senate on December 11. He faced opposition in the 2008 election from Democrat Diane Whitley, but ultimately won election to the Senate with 65% of the vote. 2009 legislative session During the 2009 legislative session, Cadman was the prime sponsor of a Senate Joint Memorial focusing on protecting the rights of workers to cast secret ballots in workplace elections. SJM 09-007 fought to counter-act the \\"Employee Free Choice Act\\" that would force employees to cast secret ballots for union elections in the presence of a union organizer. The bill would have urged Congress to stop the EFCA from passing. The bill, while supported by the entire Senate Republican Caucus, failed to reach the Colorado House of Representatives as it was postponed indefinitely in the Senate State, Veterans, and Military Affairs Committee. 2010 legislative session In 2010, Cadman sponsored HB10-1287 with Representative Lambert that would have disallowed state employees from using state-owned vehicles for commuting purposes. The bill, which would have freed up $3 million for the state budget, passed through both chambers before reaching the Governor's desk. Governor Bill Ritter, a Democrat, vetoed the bill, claiming it \\"sweeps too broadly\\" and would diminish public safety in the process. 2011 legislative session Senator Cadman sponsored several legislative measures throughout the course of the 2011 legislative session, one of the biggest measures being HB 11-1284. This bill would have impacted how beer is sold throughout Colorado, allowing grocery stores and convenience stores to sell full-strength beer. The bill was first introduced the House and assigned to the Committee on Economic and Business Development where it was passed to the House floor; however, the bill was postponed indefinitely during second reading. In 2011 after Senator Kopp‚Äôs resignation, Senator Cadman was elected to serve as the Minority Leader by the Colorado Senate Republican Caucus. 2012 legislative session During the 2012 session, one of the several bills Cadman sponsored was a bill urging state agencies to seek Colorado-specific solutions \\"in lieu of federal regulations whenever possible\\". HB 12-1175 would have focused on finding solutions to local problems on a local level, instead of applying a \\"one-size fits all\\" idea from federal solutions, giving state‚Äôs more control. The legislation passed through the House before being assigned to the Senate Health and Human Services committee, where it was postponed indefinitely by a party-line 3‚Äì5 vote. In 2012, Cadman was re-elected as Minority Leader for the Senate Republican Caucus by his peers. He served on the Legislative Council and the Executive Committee of Legislative Council due to his leadership role. 2012 election After the redistricting of Colorado‚Äôs legislative seats in 2011, Senator Cadman was redrawn into Senate District 12. Therefore, in order for Senator Cadman to be able to run again, Senator Keith King, the current Senator of that district, stepped down and chose not to run for re-election. During the general election, Cadman faced no Democratic opponent; his opponents were Dave Respecki from the Libertarian Party, and James Bristol from the American Constitution Party. Cadman won 68.2% of the vote. 2013 legislative session Senator Cadman was re-elected as Minority Leader by the Republican Caucus and will continue to serve on the Legislative Council and Executive Committee of Legislative Council as well.

The magazine began on campus in 1979 at the University of Queensland as an initiative of co-editors Rob Cameron and Bruce Dickson, and was originally printed on A4 glossy stock. While then circulated free on campus, it was simultaneously released for limited edition purchase through South-East Queensland newsagents. Commenting on its status as a pioneering cultural production of its type for Australia, Phillip Adams at the time described it as \\"a remarkable achievement\\" (for quality, independent publishing). In the early 80s, Time Off began distribution off-campus as a now free, newsprint edition. With a strong rock music bias, the magazine also focuses on cinema and the arts, and now has a separate dance music section. The magazine was edited/published for the bulk of its history by Sean Sennett who bought the magazine while it was in receivership in 1990 and successfully grew the paper over the ensuing period. For nearly twenty years Sennett oversaw the magazine taking it from 16pp to up to 72pp adding a glossy cover and expanding the magazine's print run and content. During this period Sennett interviewed over 1000 artists and gave many local writers the opportunity to have their worked published. Sennett also instigated the 'Core Sample' series which saw local bands featured on various compilation CD's. Sennett has now established Time Off Media; the aim of which is to take the 'indie spirit' of Time Off into the digital age with Tom Magazine. Under Sennett's guidance Time Off were the second street paper to go online in Australia [behind Beat Magazine] in the early 1990s. Earlier editors included Shar Adams, Gavin Sawford and Brent Hampstead who shaped the paper from a 'what's on' guide to a more music themed publication. The magazine was owned by the Melbourne-based Street Press Australia group, and had a strong local content, but also featured interviews with many international artists.

Born into the noble Bentinck family, his grandfather William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, served as both Prime Minister of Great Britain and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Expected to succeed his father as the fifth Duke of Portland, Titchfield died at only 27 years old. Biography Henry was the first child of William Cavendish- Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland, and his wife Henrietta (n√©e Scott). His father was the grandson of William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire, while his mother, Henrietta, was one of three daughters and heiresses born to Scottish General John Scott. Upon their marriage, the family name became Cavendish- Scott-Bentinck. In honour of the birth of his first grandson, the Third Duke of Portland commissioned the Portland Baptismal Font, the only known gold font commissioned for private use in England. Designed by landscaper Humphrey Repton and crafted by Paul Storr, it stayed in the Bentinck family until 1986, when it was acquired by the British Museum. Henry ‚Äî referred to by his second name as all the males in the family were named William‚Äîwas styled as the Marquess of Titchfield in 1809, when his father succeeded to the dukedom. After private education at home, Titchfield went to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1815. Under headmaster Edmund Goodenough, Titchfield excelled academically and distinguished himself in classical literature. \\"Few men entered the 'world's great stage' with brighter prospects before them. His character, thus eminent and unsullied at the place of his education, was afterwards destined to display itself with no less brilliancy in the senate of his country, to which an honourable ambition incited him to display the talents, so useful and conspicuous, with which nature and application had endowed him,\\" praised the Rev. Thomas Maurice after his death. His Oxford classmate George Agar-Ellis, who later became a close friend, wrote in his diary in 1815 that Titchfield was a \\"stripling marquess\\" and a \\"horrid bore ... an empty talkative coxcomb, with the Devonshire bad, affected manner.\\" His uncle Charles Greville, however, believed that Titchfield's education at home created a disadvantage he was forced to overcome: Another uncle, the Prime Minister George Canning, later praised his character: \\"He is really the best of creatures‚Äî so right minded and so warmhearted, and so full of native good sense.\\" In 1819, Titchfield joined the Nottinghamshire Yeomanry Cavalry as a captain. That same year, he was elected to the House of Commons as MP for Bletchingley, and held that seat until 1822. He was then elected for King's Lynn in 1822, a seat he held until his death. He is known to have given only one speech in Parliament, on 14 May 1819, when he criticized the Game Laws. He also voted against public lotteries and for inquiry into the abuse of charitable foundations. He died at the family home in London in March 1824, at age 27; his early death was attributed to a brain abscess. He was interred in the family vault at Marylebone Parish Church in London. His younger brothers, the eccentric John and temperamental George, also served as MPs. John succeeded him as both the Marquess of Titchfield and the MP for King's Lynn, and eventually became the fifth Duke of Portland.

It is the mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Trento, and until 1802, was the seat of the Bishopric of Trent. It was built over a pre-existing 6th- century church devoted to Saint Vigilius (), patron saint of the city. Bishop Federico Wanga commissioned the architect Adamo d'Arogno to construct the new Lombard-Romanesque church. Works continued for more than a hundred years, with the Gothic style becoming increasingly evident. The fa√ßade has a large rose window including The Wheel of Fortune. Notable also are the lions supporting the columns of the narthex on the northern side and the twisting columns in the apsidal area. The interior has a nave and two aisles with a transept. The latter has 14th-century frescoes depicting the legend of Saint Julian and the stone statue of the Madonna degli Annegati. The apse of the right transept houses the relics of the local martyrs Sisinius, Marturius and Alexander who died around 397 AD. In the right aisle is the Crucifix Chapel (1682), with a wooden crucifix at the feet of which were promulgated the issues of the Council of Trent, whose sessions were held in the church's presbytery.

Examples of welcome signs can be found near political borders, such as when entering a state, province, county, city, or town, and they are increasingly found in neighborhoods and private communities. In European countries under the Schengen Agreement, a welcome sign may be found at borders between countries. Its purpose is partly informational, to inform drivers where they are, and partly for tourism, as it affords an opportunity to advertise features within the region to people who are entering it. A welcome sign is a type of town sign‚Äîa sign placed at the entrance to and exit from a city, town, or village. In many jurisdictions, the format of town signs is standardized; in some, welcome signs may be distinct from the legally mandated town sign. A municipality's welcome sign may give its population or date of foundation, list twinned towns or services within the town, or depict the town's crest, typical local products, or the logo of sponsor organizations which maintain the sign (such as the local Lions Club).

Gelemso is the origin of a variety of khat called by the same name (Gelemso). It is also a scene of an Amharic novel known as Akel Dama (the Bloody Land), written by Theodros Mulatu in 1991. Etymology Oral history says the name Gelemso came from the Oromo phrase Galma Usso, meaning the Hall of Usso or House of Usso, a mosque named for a man who came to preach Islam to the Ittu Oromos in the 13th century,Oromia Culture and Tourism Commission, History of the Oromo People up to 16th Century, Adama, 2004, p. 94 called by his followers Aw Seid, and by the Oromos with his given name Usso after he was made ilma gossa or the adopted son of the Warra Qallu clan of the Ittu Oromo . As galma usually refers to the worship house under the traditional (Waqefanna ) religion of the Oromos, we may wonder why the mosque was called so. The Oromo elders explain the case as follows. The Ittu OromoMohammed Hassen: Menelik‚Äôs Conquest of Harar, 1887, and Its Effect on Political Organization of the Surrounding Oromos Up to 1900, in Working Papers of Society and History in Imperial Ethiopia: The Southern Periphery from 1800s to 1974, edited by P.L. Donham and Wendy James, African Studies Centre, Cambridge University, 1980, p. 227-246, in this essay, Mohammed Hassen beautifully described the settlements of the three major bodies of the Eastern Oromo. For ethnography and especially for the history of the Eastern Oromos, the works of Mohammed Hassen are awesome. who are usually mentioned as the native Oromo group of the Chercher highlands, says AW Seid was the first person to start an Islamization campaign in their land. His real name was Seid Ali and according to the oral history of the Ittu Oromo], he was a Sharif (i.e. descendant of Prophet Mohammed)Ulrich Brauk√§mper: Islamic History and Culture in Southern Ethiopia.

He was so considerate man that while his study was concerned on the Hadiya people of southern Ethiopia, he traveled as far as Gelemso to know the ancient links of the Hadiya with other people. His book is an advisable work to read It was in latter periods that his followers who believed in his sainthood added a prefix Aw to his name, in the manner of the Harari and the Somali who call their saints and national heroes so. (Aw meaning father in Harari language, and male saints are usually called with this title.).Camilla Gibb: In the City of Saints: Religion, Politics, and Culture in Harar, Ethiopia, PhD Thesis, University of Toronto, 1996, p. 70 & 276, 279,156-160, 73, 70&319 Since then, Seid Ali has been called Aw Seid. Local history tellers say that in order to achieve his target, Aw Seid had to seek a means that enables him live in the land of the Oromos with full citizenship rights, which could be accessed under the tradition of the Oromo people at that time.Oromia Culture and Tourism Commission, History of the Oromo People up to 16th Century, Adama, 2004, p. 94-99 Accordingly, he became ilma gosa or the adopted son of the Warra Qallu sub-group within the Ittu Oromo division of the Eastern Oromo, and on his adoption ceremony, the Oromos named him Usso. When Aw Seid built his mosque in the southern part of the current site of Gelemso town, the Oromo started to call it galma Usso. Here, as elders say, galma stands to notify the spiritual significance of the newly built structure, (even though galma originally refers to the worshiping house of the traditional Oromo religion, the Oromos used to call the worshiping house of any faith by this name) and Usso denotes the owner of the house (in this case Aw Seid). The name Galma Usso was introduced in this way, and in the long period of time, it evolved to Gelemso. This story is in not documented, while the Islamization effort of Aw Seid has been discussed by different scholars. However, as the name Gelemso can never be found at any other place in the Oromo lands (in the whole of Ethiopia and the world either), and as it has no exact meaning in Oromo or any other language, it might be sound to conclude the ancient Galma Usso gave rise to the current Gelemso, the name of the town. Basic statistics Based on figures from the Central Statistical Agency, the result of the third Ethiopian census (undertaken in May 2007) shows that Gelemso has total population of 16,484, of which 9,003 are male and 7,481 are female. .Central Statistical Agency (2008). Census 2007, Population of Oromia Region (PDF file) p.1636 However, this report is unacceptable to many people and organizations, including authorities in the departments of the woreda and zonal administrations. People who refuse the report demonstrate their argument simply by the sex ratio of the population (19 males/15 females) . which can not express the reality of the town. On the other hand, many inconsistencies of the report may induce one to reject its conclusion For example, the report says that the town of Mieso has a population of 13,339, exceeded by Gelemso only with 3000 souls.Central Statistical Agency (2008). Census 2007, Population of Oromia Region (PDF file) p.1635 On the other hand, Hirna town, which is twice as large as Mieso has only 11,650, something very difficult to believe. Free viewers say that the census has defects, and the Ethiopian government admitted that. But the quest for the true figure of the population of Gelemso and many other factors remained unanswered. With regard to the religious affiliations, it is witnessed by many that most of the residents of the town (around 70%) are Muslims. And Orthodox Christianity is the second significant religious domination (about 25%). Oromo is the native and the dominant ethnic group in Gelemso and the surrounding areas. Amhara is the second largest ethnicity with persons from different Gurage subgroups at the third level. And a few others are persons of Somali, Argoba and Harari ethnicities. . Language The Oromo tongue, called by the natives Afan Oromo, is a principal language in the town. Amharic is also widely spoken in the town. From among the languages of international significance, in Gelemso town, it is Arabic that has due benefits for communication purposes. It is said that some 40 years ago, Arabic was the language of commerce in the town, a custom survived to this date. Customs Here are some important notes on social and commercial customary features of the town. *Tuesday is the principal market day in Gelemso. There are two open market places in the town. One of them is called by the natives Magaalaa Salaasaa, meaning Tuesday's Market, it is where most of the trading activities of the principal market day takes place. The other one is called Magaalaa Qobbo and it is functional throughout the week. The cattle market, which is found near Qabri Lukku, is open only on the principal market day (Tuesday). Females dominate the business in the two open markets. The cattle market, however, is totally run by males. The town is one of the primary suppliers of the humped bull, popularly known as Harar Sangaa (Harar Bull). *The Afan Oromo spoken in the town is the Eastern Oromo dialect. But the natives of the town and the surrounding areas of Chercher highlands retain some peculiar usages. For example, coins are usually called niiraa, (from Italian lira), and its counting vary by successive units of two. For example, at Gelemso, the Ethiopian five cents coin is called niira lama (two lira), the ten cents called niiraa afur (four lira), and 20 cents called nira saddeet(eight lira). On the other hand, the Ethiopian birr is called qarshii and the ten birr note is known as bawandii (from English pound). *The residents dine three times a day. The breakfast is called fatara (from Arabic futuur), the lunch is known as either subaata or qadaa (from Arabic ghada) and the dinner is called dhiheena, hirbaata, or hiraata (from Harari hiraat). The meals include items of traditional Oromo styles like marqaa (porridge), shumoo, affeellama, qiitaa, etc... dishes of the Arabian origin like mulawwah, fatiiraa, haniid, and the traditional Harari dish called hulbat marakh.Mohammed Hassen: The City of Harar and the Spread of Islam Among the Oromo in Hararghe, A Paper Presented on African Studies Association Annual Meeting, Philadelphia, November 11‚Äì14, 1999, pp. 23, 4, 3, 4, 5, 44, 44, 23-25, 52, 54-55, In this paper, Professor Mohammed Hassen notes that due to their presence in a region criss-crossed by trade routes, military conquests, and the pioneering campaigns of Islamic propagation, the Oromo in Harerghe had developed a long tradition of borrowing and adapting new lifestyles from other people, and lending their own customs to others. Accordingly, we can see many domestic terminologies of Arabian, Somali and Harari origins among the Harar Oromos, and we can look into thousands of words of Oromo origin among other peoples. :The residents who belong to the Amhara nation have the same food preparation style as that of the Amhara people who reside elsewhere in Ethiopia. However, they also share the customs of the Oromos in many cases. For example, the Arabian spread bread called mulawwah and the Harari's hulbat marakh is experienced by most of the Amharas too. *Houses of the town are usually built with at least two rooms. One of these, known as deera, is a room that serves as a bed room and it is where the family keeps its most valuable materials. The other room is of big size where guests are welcomed, and important ceremonies are undertaken. Inside this room, a big sized mud-built raised platform, which serves as seat and called dinqa or madaba, is found with Persian and Arabian rugs spread on it . :Kitchens are usually located outside the main house and called alawaadaa (from Oromo phrase alatti waaddaa- roast a meet outside a house ). *Another most common custom in the town, which remained a noted figure to this day, is that all male residents are nicknamed. A boy is given a nickname by his friends when he is in early 10s. He remains with it whether he likes it or not. But when becomes closer to the 40s, his formal name started to outshine again. *Eid al Fitr and Eid Al Adha are the two Islamic festivals celebrated with high honors in Gelemso. The remarkable event associated with them is the children's songs at the epoch nights of these festivals. The children also require their parents to buy eid cloths. The festivals are usually accompanied by private ceremonies. :Another important festival of Islamic origin is Ashura, which is held in the 10th day of the Muharram month of the Hijra calendar. The children's song that is sung on the night before Ashura day known as Ishaatoo, together with their gourd smashing march, remains one of the classic customs of early Islam of Eastern Ethiopia (It is not known elsewhere apart from East Ethiopia). :The Christian population usually celebrates Epiphany (called Timket in Amharic) with great honor than other Christian festivals. Its annual first takes place on the bank of Aw Seid River 1 km away from the town (in the southern direction). *Milad Al Nabi or Mawlid is the most notable festival celebrated in mass. The main festival lasts for 3 consecutive days, and it is held chiefly at the Hadra of Sheikh Omar (See below). Professor Braukamper witnessed that when he visited the Hadra in 1973, the attendants of the feast number in 10,000s. *Khat is chewed in the town by many people of different age groups. A variety of superior quality of khat is called qarti and it originates mostly around a rural zone called Chaffe Afanani. Other varieties are known by such names as urata, 'qudaa, chabbbala, tachero, walaha etc... Locations of interest Locations of interest around Gelemso include the followings. Natural wonders *Karra Torban Gelemso or the Seven Natural Gates of Gelemso : in ancient times, the town is said to have seven natural gates called with different names. Most of those ancient names are still on use. The seven gates are ·ç° **Karra Bantii / also called Karra Qoree (the gate of Benti/Kore)- found in the northern direction. **Karra Bubbee (the gate of Bube) :- found in the north-western direction **Karra Gobeensaa /also called Karra Hardiim/(the gate of the Bamboo forest/Hardim)-found in the western direction. **Karra Beeraa or Karra Balballeettii (the gate of the Women/Belbeleti ) :- found in the south-west direction. **Karra Cifraa or Karra Sheekh Husseen(the gate of the Army/ Sheikh Hussein)-found in the southern direction **Karra Weenne or Karra Bookee (the gate of Wene/Boke)- found in the south-east direction **Karra Caffee (the gate of Chaffee )- found in the north east direction. *Haroo Carcar (Lake of the Cherecher) :- 10 km east of Gelemso, a lake that varies in its area coverage from time to time.www.maplandia.com This Website gives you a satellite image of some villages and landmarks found near Gelemso Currently, it is the largest natural lake in eastern Ethiopia (assumed this rank when Lake Haramaya disappeared few years ago). The lake will become as large as 4 km with a breadth of 2 km at its peak. But some times it is mistaken for another temporal lake which appears at its vicinity during heavy rainfall season. This latter body of water is called by the peasants Sal Malee meaning a place where everybody washes his body without being shy (of being seen naked by others). * Natural Caves :- in the whole of the mountainous province where Gelemso is situated, we can see natural caves of different sizes. The most famous of them are the three caves found near Mechara town, 40 km south of Gelemso.Asfawossen Asrat, Andy Baker, Melanie J.

It is one of the properly protected forest areas in Ethiopia, and extends to the Arba Gugu mountains of northern Arsi. Currently, the forest is a home of many species of animals, including the endemic Mountain Nyala. Places of archeological importance *Corooraa/Chorora :- an archeological site 40 km west of Gelemso, where Chororapithecus, the 10 million years old fossils of a primate family (ape) were found in 2007.Anthropology.Net, \\"Chororapithecus Abyssinicus in Brief\\"Nature.com, \\"A Species of Great Ape from Late Miocene Era from Ethiopia\\"Primatology.net, \\"A More Thorough Reading of Chororapithecus\\" According to Nature Journal, these are the first fossils of a large-bodied Miocene ape from the African continent north of Kenya. :When the fossils were excavated, the news media (including Nature Journal) reported the place wrongly Chorora Formation at the southern margin of the Afar rift. Choroora is of course in the southeast part of the Rift Valley. The exact location of Chorora, however, is the east section of Anchar woreda of West Harerghe zone, on 40 km distance from Gelemso. Places referred as ancient settlements *Qurquraa :- a villages referred by Oromo elders as a long existing settlement area since ancient times. This notion may induce us to identify it as a place repeatedly mentioned by the same name (Qurquraa) in the famous book known as Al Futuhul Habash, (the Conquest of Abyssinia), a chronicle of the brilliant campaigns of Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi whom the Ethiopian writers call Ahmad Gragn, which was written by the eyewitness of the conquests in the 16th century.Futuh al-haba≈°a, English Translation by Paul Lester Stenhouse, Tsehai Publishers, 2003, p. 98 This village is found about 30 km away from Gelemso (in the western direction) near to a small town called Hardim. *Abboonah : - another village (a market area) referred by locals as a long standing settlement. Since the village is commonly called by the natives with a prefix Daro (saying Daro Abonaah), this one also might be identical to a town of the Dawaro Sultanate that was mentioned in Al Futuhul Habash by the same name.Futuh al-haba≈°a, English Translation by Paul Lester Stenhouse, Tsehai Publishers, 2003, p. 173 The village (a small market of about 1000 residents) is about 60 km to the south of Gelemso. In the 1980s, the Dergue government had established a strong military base there in order to watch the nearby movements of OLF. *Professor Mohammed Hassen also notes another village called by the name Qunburah in Al Futuhul Habash which is a commonly known name in Oromo nomenclature. However, among many places of the Chercher highlands called by the name Qunburah, the Oromo elders do not consider any one as a long standing. But this does not mean there was no place who had this name in ancient times. In fact, one of the places called Qunburah in Chercher highlands is believed to be the offshoot of the ancient Qunburah of Al Futhul Habash. Therefore, a search for that place should continu. *Harala Ruins:- around Gelemso, we can find ruins of the ancient buildings of the legendary people of Harala, whom the Oromos narrate as people of great length, extra ordinary strength and superior wealth, but devastated by hunger, epidemic and volcanic eruption because of their extravagance and disbelief. Today, as Professor Urlich Braukamper had described precisely in his book, the remnants of the stone built necropolis, store pits, houses and mosques of the ancient Harala people are observable in all of the Hararghe highlands. Their mysterious legends reach as far as Karayu in the west and Jijjiga in the east.  Places of cultural importance  *Oda Bultum :- one of the five Oda or traditional meeting places where the Oromo used to meet to end one luba or 8-year period of the Gadaa system and begin a new one. It is 25 km to the east of Gelemso.·ä†·ã≤·àµ ·ä†·ãµ·àõ·àµ ·åã·ãú·å£·ç£ ·à∞·äî 27·ç£ 2001·ç£ ‚Äπ‚Äπ·ä¶·ã≥ ·â°·àç·â±·àù ·â†·àê·à®·à≠·åå‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ * Halaya Buchuro :- A deep gorge where the Oromos in ancient times, used to throw and execute (in to the chasm) criminals who were found guilty of intentional killing (of innocent people).  Places noted for Islamic history and culture  *Sheikh Omar Mosque and Sufi Compound:- found at the heart of Gelemso. The mosque is to the west of a Sufi compound called Hadra·ä†·ã≤·àµ ·ä†·ãµ·àõ·àµ ·åã·ãú·å£·ç£ ·àê·àù·àå 11·ç£ 2001·ç£ ·ã®·å•·â†·â• ·à∏·àõ·äî·ãé·âΩ (·à±·çä·ãé·âΩ ·â†·àê·à®·à≠·åå) which hosts the celebration of the birth day of the Prophet (Mawlid), making the town one of the main places in Ethiopia marked with such a festive. The Hadra has many quarters of different uses, with Beytul Hadra (the house of presence) as a focus. The compound of Hadra is also a home of a big mausoleum in which the tomb of Sheikh Omar (the founder of Hadra) is found. *Aw-Seid Shrine which is traditionally identified with the ancient Galma Usso, of which the name Gelemso was derived. There is no surviving remnant of the 13th-century mosque by now. The current shrine dates only from the late 19th century. *Aw-Sherif Hill :- where, according to oral history, the Muslim saint Aw-Sherif had lived some 300 years ago. *The Mosque of Sheikh Ali Jami:- located 10 km east of Gelemso, where a saint Sheikh Ali had lived and preached Islam after he returned from the city of Harar where he attended his higher education. His mosque is encircled by a galma and a mausoleum that contains his tomb.  Important Christian sites  *Medihane Alem Church:- An Orthodox Christian Church aged about 60 years. *Saint Michael Catholic Church:- Built by the Italian colonists in the late 1930s. It is the tallest man made erection in the town, which is visible as far as 30 km due its strategic position, and commonly called Mana Dheeraa meaning the tallest house. It had served as a church, then as prison, and now it hosts a primary school. Notable persons from Gelemso Gelemso has been associated with many imminent figures. Its notable personalities include the following: *Sheikh Ali Jami Guutoo : - commonly called Qallicha by the Oromos, not only for his origin from Warra Qallu Oromo clan, but also for his high priesthood in the Chercher plateau. His descendants are still called Qalicha or Qalittii- meaning the respected one (Qallitti is for female), It is said that the first man to preach Islam peacefully and openly (without any sanction ) in the land of Chercher was this Sheikh Ali Jami, so that he became one of the key figures in the Islamization of the Ittu Oromo. Sheikh Ali is considered a great saint and most of the people of the Chercher highlands usually refer to him as Aw Ali. *Sheikh Umar Aliye :- popularly known as Gelemsiyyi. He was another key figure in the Islamization of the Ittu Oromo and a father of Mohammed Zakir Meyra and many more heroes and scholars. Perhaps, he is the most widely known scholar, activist and important Islam figure in the region. In fact, he is well known for his dedication for Islam and its teaching throughout the country. He is also the most noted figure in the transmission of the Qadiriyyah Sufi brother- hood ( Tariqa ), which he introduced to the Harar Oromos with Sheikh Mohammed Harar, his close friend with whom he returned from Wallo after the completion of higher education.Hussein Ahmed HARAR-WALLO RELATIONS REVISITED: HISTORICAL, RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL DIMENSIONS, African Study Monographs, Kyoto University, March 2010, p. 111-117 *Ahmad Taqi Sheikh Mohammed Rashid (well known as Hundee) (1942? ‚Äì September 6, 1974): He was an Oromo nationalist known with his comrade Elemo Kiltu as the first true fighters since they launched the first armed struggle for the Oromo causes under an organization that bears the name of their people (i.e. Oromo). They died together on September 5/1974 at the historic Battle of Tiro and now honored as martyrs by the three major Oromo political organizations; OLF, OPDO and IFLO. Hundee the hero immortalized by Ali Birra's songs. *Mohammed Zakir Meyra (1949 -1977): Also known as Mohammed-Zakir Sheikh Umar Aliye or well known as simply Meyra):- He is a son of the well respected Gelemsiyyi (see above). He was considered by the people around Gelemso as an heir to Elemo and Ahmad Taqi. While he was only in his 20s, he marched to Somalia leading a group of youth with whom he used to discuss the national agenda. He returned as a commander of brigade that included in addition to his fellow Oromo youths, some West Somali Liberation Front (WSLF) fighters who claimed giving support to the Oromo brothers. His brigade had effectively destroyed the Dergue army in Boke and Darolebo woreda. But he felt furious on the mischievous act of the WSLF fighters when they start to install the flag of Somali Republic on the freed lands. He fought them as equal as he was fighting the Dergue. The fight between the two forces continued until the winter months of 1977. And finally, Meyra was martyred on the Battle of Kurfa Roqa, 30 km south of Boke town. *Umar Bakkalcha (1953? - 1980) was one of the early Oromo nationalists and martyrs well-remembered in the Chercher highlands of Harerghe especially for the heroic speeches he made at his death spot. His name had been Umar Sheikh Mohammed Rabi, but the people usually refer to him as ‚ÄúUmar Bakkalcha‚Äù or simply ‚ÄúBakkalcha‚Äù (the downfall star). Bakkalcha was enlightened in the Oromo National struggle from the very beginning. He had a good understanding of the quests of the Oromo causes far before many people. However, the most brainstorming incident that took him to decide giving up all of his belongings for the Oromo causes was the heroic death of the well known Oromo patriots and guerilla leaders called Elemo Killtu (Hassen Ibrahim) and Hundee (or Ahmad Taqi Sheikh Muhammed Rashid). *Sheikh Mohammed Rashad Abdulle a graduate of Al-Azhar University who translated Qur'an into the Oromo. (For the detail of his life and work, click on his name.) *Abuna Berhane Eyesus, the current Patriarch of the Ethiopian Catholic Church. He is originally from Anchar woreda, but raised up in Gelemso in his early ages. *Gelemso and its vicinity had produced many scholars which include Dr. Ashagre Yigletu of the Dergue, Dr. Bayan Asoba of OLF, Afendi Muteki, the young Ethiopian ethnographic writer and activist, Artist Garbi Ahmed Nurie (Pianist, live in Toronto, Canada), Artist Adnan (singer) and Fozia Amin, member of the Central committee of OPDO and Human Rights Commissioner in the Federal Government of Ethiopia. The city produced many doctors, engineers, teachers, lawyers, nurses, pharmacists, and many other professions. Notable administrators *Dejene Gizaw - The municipal mayor of Gelemso acknowledged for the foundation he laid in the modesty of the town in the 1960s. *Fitawrari Tesfaye Wondimagenyehu - The first governor of Habro Awraja. *Colonel Tedla Ayele - Second Governor of the Habro Awraja, acknowledged for establishment of the police department of the province and many other institutions at Awraja level. *Mekonnen Maru - Noted for his ruthless campaigns of murder and looting during the Ethiopian Red Terror. He was tried for genocide by the Harari Region's High Court and sentenced to life imprisonment. *Allagaw Gulle- Acknowledged for stopping the Red Terror. *Alemu Belachew- party chief of Habro awraja, called first Secretary of ESEPA or WPE for Habro Awraja. *Alemu Mengesha - party chief of Habro Awraja after Alemu Belachew, admired by many for his simple life and justiful approach, but hated by others for some of his terrifying campaigns. *Selamu Tegenye - administrative head of Habro Awraja while Alemu Belachew was the first secretary of Habro Awraja WPE. He is usually referred by the residents as the most notorious administrator in history of Gelemso, especially for the brutal measures he had taken on peasants in Boke and Darolebu districts in the 1980s, where he labeled them extermists who shelter sccessions (by this, he was referring to OLF, the strongest opposition movement in West Harerghe at that time) and massacred them. The urban people of all sorts (Muslim, Christian, Oromo or Amhara) also remember Selamu as a merciless man to the youth for his showy acts and intensive brutality especially when was applying the mandatory national military service program (commonly called Beherawi). He was promoted later, but died in November 1989 in a helicopter crash at Dengego, with Gebreyes Weldehanna, secretary of WPE all over the former Hararghe Kiflehager, Major General Birhanu Jembere, the commander of the 1st Division of Revolutionary Army of Ethiopia (commonly called Misrak Ezz), and colonel Qajella Gemeda, chief of the then Harerghe Region Police Department. *Birhanu Bekama Butta - witnessed by many people as highly responsible administrator for the current features of the town. The town had got 24-hour electric power service while he was a mayor, and he laid down the master plan of the town too. Even, some of the most important constructions executed under the current regime were what he had planned in the 1980s. *Aleye Umare - Noted as long time administrator in history of the town. Almost all of the public constructions undertaken in the current regime were completed in his leadership. After the Dergue was deposed from power, the town did not get an able mayor, so that the Woreda administrators usually intervene in the municipal activities. History  Early history  It is difficult to trace when the history of the town starts. And it is so troublesome to single out the early history of the town from the history of the whole of the Hararghe highlands. But for accuracy purposes, and to construct a relevant historical order, it is better to discuss those tales that directly focus to the town itself. Accordingly, some data obtained from oral history and written sources, which might describe the antique nature of the town, are not presented here. These include specially the one that related to the ancient Harala people, whom we know only through their legends and few descriptions in the works of some scholars. All of our sources (oral and written) dignify the importance of a man mentioned above as Aw Seid in the birth of the town. It is said that Aw Seid was appointed by Sheikh Abadir, the then chief Islamic scholar in Harar, to preach Islam to the Oromos around Gelemso in the second half of the 13th century. Hence, as the sources say, Aw Seid came with his family and settled at Gelemso. He built the first mosque of the town, but he had little success in converting the local Oromos to Islam.Oromia Culture and Tourism Commission, History of the Oromo People up to 16th Century, Adama, 2004, p. 99 Latter, he disagreed with the Ittu Oromo and returned to Harar, where he died and buried according to legends. However, some of the most notable scholars who studied the case deeply, such as Ulrich Br√§ukamper, suggest that the Islamization effort of Aw Seid could be a phenomenon of latter ages (i.e. after the 16th century), an argument that has a good ground, as far we consider the starting period of the mutual interdependence between the Muslims of the southeast and their Oromo neighbors. But one thing that deserves attention here is the recurrent appearance of a name Aw Seid or Seid Ali in the long list of Harari saints, from which we may infer the saint called so was not a mere a legendary man only. (For example, he might have been engraved in Harar after his mission had failed in the land of the Ittu Oromo). For all, detail investigations would clarify the real story. The current site of Gelemso town lays, according to proposed suggestions, within the boundary of the ancient Sultanate of Dawaro,.Oromia Culture and Tourism Commission , History of the Oromo People up to 16th Century, Adama, 2004, p. 93 whom in the 14th century, the Syrian writer Abu Fadlulah Al Umari and, in the 15th century, the Egyptian Al Makrizi had mentioned as one of the Seven Islamic Principalities of the Southern and Eastern Ethiopia that constituted the Zeyla Federation . In the oral history collected from the elderly people, the ancient Dawaro is said to be synonymous to the late Daro district which was merged with the adjacent district of Lebu to form the current Darolebu woreda during the Haile Selasie period. However, it is unclear as to what Gelemso appeared to be when the ancient Sultanate of Dawaro was flourishing. But again, we may argue that the oral history concerning the Islamization effort of Aw Seid, in which Gelemso is identified as the scene of action, may have solid truths which can be inferred from the chronological concurrence of the mission of Aw Seid and the flourishing era of the Sultanate of Dawaro (i.e. both of them were phenomena of the same historical period, from the 13th century to the 15th century). And again, it is said that Gelemso assumed a wider fame with the foundation of Oda Bultum as a cultural and administrative center of the Eastern Barento·ä†·ã≤·àµ ·ä†·ãµ·àõ·àµ ·åã·ãú·å£·ç£ ·à∞·äî 20·ç£ 2001·ç£ ‚Äπ‚Äπ·çâ·åâ·åç·äì ·ã®·àê·à®·à≠·åå ·ä¶·àÆ·àû‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ Oromos (one of the two major tribal confederations of the Oromo people, the other being Borana ) . Here, as many books have recorded, it was also Aw Seid who played a key role in the derivation of the Oromo Constitutional Law (called Hera ) at Oda Bultum.Oromia Culture and Tourism Commission, History of the Oromo People up to 16th Century, Adama, 2004, p. 94-96 Prior to the 1991 governmental change (during Haile Selassie and Dergue times), people who live closer to the Oda Bultum often called the Oda itself as Aw Seid. (oda is a tree known in its scientific name as Ficus gnaphalocarpa) . And many rituals exercised when the Ya'ii(conferences) of the Chaffe Gada were undertaken at Oda Bultum in recent years were called in the name of Aw -Seid. In this case, the role of the saint called Aw-Seid at the establishment of Oda Bultum can be accepted without any doubt. However, it is not clear again how Gelemso was elevated to a place of high social status with the establishment of Oda Bultum, pertaining that the place called so is 25 km away from the town. Some people say Gelemso was an administrative capital and the seat of the Mana Bokkuu (the President's Office) of the Eastern Oromo, with Oda Bultum serving as the place where Caffee Gadaa assembled only once in eight years. And others say that it was a place where the Oda Bultum itself was located prior to its move to the current place. Latter on, oral history says, Gelemso evolved to an important village of commerce when one of its counties called Qabri Lukku (now found in the south eastern tip of the town) was organized as a market center to accommodate traders who were coming from different regions. It is said that at that place, a local chief called Lukkuu had mastered over the caravan traders who used to sell the goods they brought from remote areas. Few elders, however, dispute this story and say rather Lukku was a man who in ancient times, left the traditional Oromo religion and accepted Islam so that when he was diseased, the Ittu Oromo sanctioned his dead body not to be buried with the mass, a reason why we see his grave on isolated ground. (Qabrii Lukku mean grave of Lukku) To conclude, when we consider oral histories which assert the town had Karra Torba (The Seven Gates) in ancient times, non existent in the case of other towns of West Harerghe save Gelemso, when we consider its presence closer to places of significant traditions like Halayya Buchuro and Laga Bera (retold as a place where once ruthless and contestant dictatorial queen called Akkoo Manoyye had built her palace), when we analyze its tie to Oda Bultum and the presence of the shrines of Aw-Seid both at Gelemso and Oda Bultum, we can deduce that Gelemso must had been a place of higher social and spiritual importance in the tradition of the Oromo people since ancient times. And to the least, we can say it existed on the line of history long before the appearance of many of the current towns of the Hararghe region.  After the conquests of Menelik II  In 1887, while campaigning to occupy the city state of Harar and the whole of Eastern Ethiopia, which he accomplished after his victory at the Battle of Chelenqo,Bahru Zewde, A History of Modern Ethiopia: 1855-1991, 3rd edition, Addis Ababa University Press, Addis Ababa, 2001, p. 72 Emperor Menelik II had arrived at the bottom of the current Gelemso town. The Ethiopian writer Tekletsadik Mekuria tells that Menelik arrived at Gelemso on December 18, 1886.Tekletsadik Mekuria , Emperor Yohannes and the Ethiopian Unity, (written in Amharic), Kuraz Publishers, Addis Ababa, 1990, p. 291 Menelik was attracted by the landscape around Gelemso and ordered a garrison to be founded there, which his warlords had executed immediately. The garrison was established at the western part of the current town, and had been called Gorgo (an Amharic name for a kind of tree). That was a second turn in the long history of Gelemso, by which it had leaped from a small village of cultural importance to a truly urbanized community. However, elderly people assert that the formation of the garrison had also some bad objectives behind. It is said that Menelik II had an aim of erasing the centrality and symbolism of early places like Gelemso from the mind and the heart of his Oromo subjects. Truly speaking, it was Emperor Menelik II who officially closed down all of the traditional Oromo institutions like Chaffe assembly and prohibited many other cultural feasts, a fact that Ethiopian writers of the early 20th century like Aleqa Tayye had recorded.Getachew Haile, The Works of Abba Bahrey with Other Records Concerning the Oromo , Avon, Minnesota, p. 222 But the true urban feature of the town dates from Menelik's period. This will be agreeable when we know that in 1908, Gelemso was one of the few centers that the imperial government formally recognized as true towns.Mayor Berhanu Bekam's Speech on the inauguration of Gelemso public bus station, 1990, and new data obtained from Gelemso Municipality, December 2009, Gelemso, West Harerghe. The Municipality recounts this year 1908 as the birth date of a town. But the elders do not agree with that, neither the writer of this article (Alladin Alevi) too. This may be justified by the fact that the Menilik's landing at Gelemso was in 1887, and it is assumed that the Emperor did not had rest at a village which cannot fulfill the subsistence needs of his huge army; and where marketing was inaccessible. That means Gelemso had at least certain appearance of a small town or it had been a market place prior to the Menelik's period. During the Italian occupation Gelemso stayed under a period of dwarfism and stagnancy in the reign of Ras Teferi Mekonnen (latter Emperor Haile Selassie I ) who had special sympathy for another town established in the Chercher highlands and named for his honor Asebe Teferi(which mean Teferi wished it in Amharic). Bahru Zewde narrates that in 1933, immediately after his ascension to the throne, Emperor Haile Selesie made Chercher Awraja the model of his future administration system.Bahru Zewde, A History of Modern Ethiopia: 1855-1991, 3rd edition, Addis Ababa University Press, Addis Ababa, 2007, p. 156 However, when Italy conquered Ethiopia and formed the Italian East Africa in 1935,Bahru Zewde, A History of Modern Ethiopia: 1855-1991, 3rd edition, Addis Ababa University Press, Addis Ababa, 2007, p. 169 Gelemso began to expand in every direction. During their five years administration, the Italians returned the seat of the Chercher province to Gelemso (which was moved first to Kunni, then to Asebe Teferi or Chiro by the Haile Selassie officials) and made valuable change on its urban customs. They established new settlements in the northern and eastern parts of the town, starting from a hill called now Kambo (from Italian campo which mean a military camp). The Italian occupiers also constructed the first graveled road of the town, and connected it with Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa through all weather roads which run in the west to Awash (via small towns of Hardim and Bordode ), and in the east to Dire Dawa through Wachu and Bedessa. (the remnant of the western old road still exists with its decorated Italian style bridge built on the northern section of Aw Seid river ). The first modern buildings of the town were also attributed to the Italians, the most eloquent of them being St. Michael Catholic Church mentioned above. Scholars tell us that the Italians had focused on Gelemso because of its presence in the vicinity of Wachu (10 km east of Gelemso), a place where they intended to build Secondo Roma (Second Rome), a future city to be evolved from the agrarian community that would be brought from southern Italy under the resettlement program. On the other hand, one of the most important features of Gelemso town, the Sheikh Omar mosque, was built in that period while Sheikh Omar was Qadi of the Chercher province. After the Italian occupation In 1951, the Christian missionary group of American Adventist Church constructed the first school of the town at a place called Lode ( now separated from the main town by gorge created by gully erosion and called Tirso ). Although the group closed its missionary activities in the 1960s, the school they built has continued to function to this day, and the elderly people still call it Amerikaanii (The American). Gelemso was made a municipal town in 1952. And in the year 1958, while it remained still under the Chercher awraja administration, it was designated an electoral district (in Amharic called ·ã®·àù·à≠·å´ ·ä†·ãç·à´·åÉ) and had got 2 seats in the imperial parliamentary assembly of the Haile Seliasie regime, which was won in that very year by Haji Abdullahi Sheikh Ahmed and Mukhtar Mohammed.·ã∞·åÉ·ãù·àõ·âΩ·ç°·ã∞·àù·àµ·ç°·ãà·àç·ã∞·ç°·ãê·àõ·äë·ä§·àç·ç£ ·àï·åà·ç°·àò·äï·åç·à•·âµ·äì·ç°·àù·ä≠·à≠·ç°·â§·âµ ·ç£·àÅ·àà·â∞·äõ·ç°·àò·åΩ·àê·çç·ç£ ·ãê·ã≤·àµ·ç°·ä†·â†·â£·ç£ ·å•·âÖ·àù·âµ·ç°1951·ç°·ãì.·àù.·ç£·åà·åΩ·ç°163-185 However, the governmental projects were rarely planned and executed in the town then. But when it became the capital of Habro Awraja up on the splitting up of the former Chercher Awraja to Habro and Chercher-Adal-Gara Guracha Awrajas (Chiro or Asebe Teferi remained the latter's capital) in the year 1968 and afterwards, some improvements were made. For example, the town was equipped with electric light service for 6 hours a night, and its tap water supply system (built by Italians) was expanded. However, it was the efforts of Arabian, European and Asian traders that greatly helped Gelemso continue its long standing role as market center and social panorama. The list of those foreign traders includes Nasir Sana'ani, Abdallah Ubadi, Ali Ahmed, Ali Sa'ad, Salah Muhsin who were all Yemenis, the Greeks Kostar Gragor and his brother Stafrol, the Italians Antonio Viccini and Francesco Berto, the Sudanese Haji Abdullah and Sheikh Bashir Babikir, and the Indian Usma'il Hindii. Latter on, natives of the town like Mohammad Abdo (Lungo), Ahmed Yusuf, Mohammed Beker, Muteki Sheikh Mohammed and his brother Ahmad Taqi, Haji Ahmed Nure, Haji Sani Abdulqadir, Ahmed Alhadi, Usmail Ahmayyu, Nejash Usmail, Belew Haile, Mekonnen Metaferia, Jemaneh Yimamu, Tiruneh Gebremichael, Omar Ghazali and his brother Mumme Ghazali etc....and well known Ethiopian entrepreneurs like Mohammed Abdullahi Ogsade also entered to the business and they altogether marked the town's classic commercial era. That was why the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia moved against its working rule of the time and opened a branch at Gelemso (according to its working rule of that time, the bank do not open its branch in a town found far away from the High Way).Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, Gelemso Branch Inauguration Ceremony, December 1969, p. 17 In the late 1960s and early 1970s, General Taddese Birru, a well known Oromo nationalist and co-founder of Mecha- Tulama Self Help Association,Bahru Zewde, A History of Modern Ethiopia: 1855-1991, 3rd edition, Addis Ababa University Press, Addis Ababa, 2007, p. 273Geda Melba, Oromia: An Introduction to the History of Oromo People, Khartoum, 1988, p. 183-184 had been in the town for his supposed ·åç·ãû·âµ (Amharic for house arrest) . Fortunately, the incident favored Tadesse to meet other early Oromo nationalists like Elemo Kiltu, Ahmad Taqi and Mohammed Zakir Meyra, with whom he could demonstrate his devotion for Oromo freedom, an act that became one of the main reasons for which Gelemso is heard so loudly. From the 1974 revolution to 1992 When the Dergue came to power in 1974,Bahru Zewde, A History of Modern Ethiopia: 1855-1991, 3rd edition, Addis Ababa University Press, Addis Ababa, 2007, p. 241 more attention was given to Gelemso. Viewers and most of the residents say that the Dergue era was a prosperous time in the town's history where many governmental buildings were erected, and subsequent improvements were made in the town. This includes the health centre, two primary schools, the current Gelemso High School, the multipurpose city assembly hall (a unique at the time in all of Eastern Ethiopia), the public slaughter house, a stadium, youth recreation center, farmers training center and most notably, the Gelemso-Mechara high way. On the other hand, NGOs like CARE international highly participated in the development activities of the Habro Awraja starting from the late 1980s. The 1984 Harerghe Province All Games Championship it hosted was the major sport festival in history of the town where all of the 13 awrajas in Hararghe participated in the contest. Gelemso was also the first town of Eastern Ethiopia where the Development Bank of Ethiopia had opened its branch (now this branch had moved to Chiro or Asbeteferi). One of the main urban zones of the town, called in its Amharic name Addis Ketema (the New City), totally emerged during the Dergue time as well. It is worth having also to mention the former President Mengistu Haile-Mariam had visited Gelemso and its surrounding villages in 1985 which makes Mengistu the only Ethiopian ruler that came across the town for official visit while in office. However, the prosperous situation prevailing during the Dergue time must never be considered as an expression of sympathetic view of the Dergue towards Gelemso. The motives behind the Dergue's considerable attention, as many people believe, were the economic importance of the Habro Awraja for whom Gelemso was a capital (among the 13 awrajas of the former Hararghe province), and to an equal importance, Gelemso's central location in the Chercher highlands, a region highly known for Oromo rebellion.Geda Melba, Oromia: An Introduction to History of the Oromo People, Khartoum, 1988, p. 194 Indeed, the Dergue era was also a period where brutal campaigns like the Red TerrorGeda Melba, Oromia: An Introduction to History of the Oromo People, Khartoum, 1988, p. 152 were undertaken in Gelemso and elsewhere in the country. For instance, the residents of Gelemso still have fresh memories of the Kara Qurqura Massacre where 70 people (half of them in the pretext of Amhara land lords who resist the land reform, and half of them labeled Oromo secessionists who conspire against the state with Somali Expansionists )Babile Tola, To Kill a Generation: The Red Terror in Ethiopia, Amharic Translation by Awgichew Terefe, Addis Ababa, 1992, p. 96, - However, Babile did 2 mistakes in his book. a). He underestimated the number of the dead. b). He alleged the cause of the dead to EPRP, which had no strong support in Gelemso were taken away from town, executed, and then bulldozed to one grave in April 1970 at a place called Karra Qurqura. (20 km east of Gelemso. In similar way Dergue military groups massacred 32 innocent civilians (children, baby of 1 year, women and elderly) bulldozed and buried in one grave yard in the place called 'Biyo' few km from town of Michata. It is still remembered locally as 'Qabri sodoma' in local Oromo language. On May 30, 1991, the town came under the control of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) and was made the administrative center of the OLF-held areas in the former provinces of West Hararghe, Arsi and Bale. The most memorable event of that time was the Oda Bultum festival, where about 800,000 Oromos came together at Gelemso and Oda Bultum to celebrate the resurrection of the ancient Chaffe Gadaa assembly tradition. On June 21, 1992, when OLF quitted the transitional government, Gelemso was passed to the current Ethiopian government led by the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front along with the other towns of the West Harerghe Zone.

He earned five caps with the United States national team, three coming in the 1930 FIFA World Cup. He was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 1986. Early career Auld began his organized soccer career with Scottish club Stevenston F.C. in 1911, when he was eleven years old. He stayed with the club until he entered the military. His service continued through World War I and Auld was not discharged until 1919. When he left the military, he joined Ardeer Thistle in 1919. He remained with the club for three years, until he moved to Glasgow club Parkhead F.C. in 1921. In 1923, he immigrated to the United States to live in Gillespie, Illinois. Life in the U.S. did not suit Auld and he decided to return to Scotland; however, he stopped en route to visit his sister who lived in Niagara Falls, New York. While there, he played a game of pick-up soccer. During the game, a scout for the Providence Clam Diggers of the American Soccer League (ASL) saw him and after the game convinced Auld to sign with the Diggers. At the time, the ASL was one of the highest paying and most competitive soccer leagues in the world. Team owners used these qualities to draw many of the top European, especially English and Scottish, players to the U.S. American Soccer League Auld would spend six seasons with Providence, playing 277 games with them. In 1928, the club renamed itself the Gold Bugs. Then in 1930, a consortium of businessmen in Fall River, Massachusetts, bought the club and moved it to that city, renaming the team Fall River F.C.. Auld played ten games during the spring 1931 season with Fall River before moving to the Pawtucket Rangers for the remaining eight games of the spring 1931 season. When the first American Soccer League finally collapsed in 1933, the Rangers moved to the New England Division of the second American Soccer League for the 1933‚Äì1934 season. In 1934, he joined Newark Portuguese, a semi- professional team. However, he spent only two years with the club and retired from playing in 1935. National team While Auld had an excellent professional career, he is best known as a member of the United States national team which took third place at the 1930 FIFA World Cup. Auld earned his first cap with the national team in a November 6, 1926 6-1 dismantling of Canada. Auld scored two goals, his only two with the national team, in his debut game. Auld did not play again with the U.S. until the first game of the World Cup. He then played the next two matches as the U.S. went to the semifinals only to fall to Argentina in a particularly physical game. Several U.S. players were injured and the team finished with only eight fit field players. Auld himself was kicked in the mouth in the first half. According to the U.S. coach, Wilfred Cummings, the Argentinians scored their third goal ‚Äúonly after Andy Auld had his lip ripped wide open and one of the players from across the La Platte River had knocked the smelling salts out of Trainer Coll's hand and into Andy's eyes, temporarily blinding one of the outstanding 'little stars' of the World's Series.\\" As substitutes were not permitted at the time, Auld played the rest of the game with a rag stuffed in his mouth to stem the bleeding. After the tournament, the U.S. traveled to Brazil where Auld and his teammates lost 4‚Äì3. That was his last game with the national team. After retiring from playing professionally, Auld made his living in the sheet metal business. He died in Rhode Island on December 6, 1977. In 1986, he was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

Uhtred leads battles against the Danes, as King Alfred strengthens the defences of his kingdom of Wessex. This novel was used as the basis for the second half of the second series of the BBC's The Last Kingdom. Plot summary Uhtred is serving Alfred, King of Wessex, by building one of the fortified towns that will make up Alfred's system of defence against attacks by the Danes when he learns that two powerful Norse leaders have occupied nearby London, giving them the ability to interfere with traffic on the Thames to and from Wessex. He is contacted by his former friend, Danish chieftain Haesten, who invites him to a meeting across the Thames in Mercia. Haesten takes Uhtred to a graveyard, where a corpse appears to rise from the earth to tell Uhtred that the Fates have decreed he is to be King of Mercia. Torn between his oath to Alfred, whom he dislikes, and the temptation to become a king in his own right, he follows Haesten to London, where he meets the Norse leaders Sigefrid and his brother Erik. Haesten and the Norse brothers have a proposition for Uhtred: if Uhtred convinces his foster-brother Lord Ragnar of Northumbria to bring Ragnar's men to join them in attacking East Anglia, Mercia and Wessex, then Uhtred will be given the throne of Mercia while the others rule East Anglia and Wessex. Uhtred ponders this offer while Sigefrid invites him to watch the crucifixion of some Christian prisoners. Among the prisoners Uhtred recognizes his old comrade at arms, the Welshman Father Pyrlig. Uhtred decides to save Pyrlig and lose his chance to join Sigefrid's plot. Knowing Pyrlig to be an experienced fighter, Uhtred tricks Sigefrid into promising the prisoners can go free if Pyrlig beats him in single combat - which he promptly does. Uhtred, Pyrlig and the prisoners leave London. Returning to Wessex with Pyrlig, Uhtred swears to keep his oath to Alfred. In Wintanceaster, King Alfred's older daughter, Aethelflaed, is married to Mercia's Earldorman Aethelred. Uthred is summoned by Alfred and ordered to plan an attack on London to dislodge the Norse brothers and turn the city over to Alfred's son-in-law and ally Earl Aethelred of Mercia. By stealth Uhtred's seaborne assault works and the defenders of London are caught out in the open as they sally forth to confront Aethelred's larger attacking army. Wedged between what was their safe London refuge, the Saxons in front of them and Uhtred's force behind, the Norse are defeated. A particularly cruel blow is struck by Osferth (King Alfred's illegitimate son) who leaps from the walls onto Sigefrid and injures him, leaving him crippled. Sigefrid, Erik, and Haesten retire to East Anglia. Fortune smiles on them again when Aethelred mounts a seaborne raid on their hurt forces. After initial success against the Danes, Aethelred manages to lose his wife, Aethelflaed. Alfred is distraught at the threat to his daughter and is willing to ransom her from his foes. Uhtred is sent to negotiate the price and terms with Sigefrid. Whilst in their camp he learns that Erik and Aethelflaed have fallen in love, whereupon Erik and he plot to spirit her away from her captors; all without either of their leaders knowing what they plan. Uhtred takes a ship with his household guard to help Erik and Aethelflaed escape. Upon arriving to the camp, Sigefrid's hall is ablaze and Haesten has kidnapped Aethelflaed. The battle in the mouth for the inlet where the Vikings have holed up is as desperate as they come, with it often being unclear who is fighting for whom. This climax to the narrative is fought over marshland, waterside, on ship and across ships. Erik is killed by Sigefrid, but Uhtred and his crew quickly gain victory over Sigefrid's own warriors, and Sigefrid himself is killed by Osferth. Aethelflaed is rescued and the story ends with Uhtred taking her back to her father.

Access Rail From Sydney there is only one practical access, which is by the Central Coast & Newcastle Line Intercity train that travels from Central Station to Newcastle, stopping at Wondabyne, which is north east from Pindar. There are no roads at Wondabyne, the backdrop escarpment is too precipitous.

Phyllis Spira (18 October 1943 ‚Äì 11 March 2008) was a South African ballet dancer who began her career with the Royal Ballet in England. Upon returning to South Africa, she spent twenty-eight years as prima ballerina of CAPAB Ballet, a professional company in Cape Town named for the Cape Performing Arts Board.Debra Craine and Judith Mackrell \\"Spira, Phyllis,\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of Dance (Oxford University Press, 2000). In 1984 she was named the first (and currently only) South African Prima Ballerina Assoluta.Amanda Botha, Phyllis Spira: A Tribute (Cape Town: Human & Rousseau, 1988), p. 1. Early life and training Born in Johannesburg, Phyllis Bernice Spira was the first daughter and second child of Lazar and Fanny Pauline (Rosen) Spira, working-class parents who lived in a modest home in the pleasant suburb of Orange Grove. When she was 4 years old, little Phyllis was enrolled in ballet classes, where, even at that tender age, she showed talent for dancing. After attending a Hebrew nursery school, she was educated at Orange Grove Primary School and Waverly High School for Girls, where ballet classes and training for eisteddfods were extracurricular activities. When she was 15, her headmistress, recognizing her exceptional talent, obtained official permission for her to leave school at the end of the tenth grade to pursue her dance training. Soon thereafter, she was offered a chance to attend the Royal Ballet School in London. Despite her parents' concern at the prospect of their teenage daughter living alone in a great foreign city, she was allowed to take the chance.Milton Shain and Miriam Pimstone, \\"Phyllis Spira,\\" Jewish Women's Archive, website, http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/spira-phyllis. Retrieved 22 November 2015. Having arrived in London in May 1959, Spira began training at the Royal Ballet School when she was just 16. Her special qualities of movement soon caused favorable comment. Ninette de Valois, director of the school, referred to her as \\"a baby Markova,\\" comparing her to the famous British ballerina Alicia Markova.Amanda Botha, Phyllis Spira: A Tribute (Cape Town: Human & Rousseau, 1988), p. 1. Awarded a scholarship, Spira progressed quickly through the course of study. After only a few months, she made her debut in a performance of Swan Lake at Covent Garden, dancing in the pas de trois in act 1, as a cygnet in acts 2 and 4, and in the Neapolitan Dance in act 3. Thereupon she was invited to join the Royal Ballet touring company. She was 17 years old at the time. Professional career Thus was launched the career of a dancer who was much admired in England and who became \\"the undisputed queen of ballet in South Africa.\\"Marina Grut, The History of Ballet in South Africa (Cape Town: Human & Rousseau, 1981), p. 201. England Spira remained with the touring group of the Royal Ballet for three years, from 1960 to 1963. Promoted to soloist in 1961, she danced in performances in the English provinces, continental Europe, Scandinavia, the Middle East, and the Far East, making occasional appearances on television in England and Japan. Among the featured and leading roles in her repertory were the pas de trois in Frederick Ashton's Les Rendezvous and Kenneth MacMillan's Danses Concertantes, the title role in John Cranko's Pineapple Poll, and Phyllis in Alan Carter's Toccata, a role created especially for her in 1962. A promising future lay before her, but her longing for home made her decide to return to South Africa in 1964.Shain and Pimstone, \\"Phyllis Spira,\\" Jewish Women's Archive, website, http://jwa.org. Retrieved 22 November 2015. South Africa In 1963, the South African government had established four professional ballet companies, one in each of the four provinces.David Poole, \\"The South African Way: Four Professional Ballet Companies Subsidized by the Government,\\" Dance and Dancers (London), May 1969, pp. 18ff. The two most vigorous were PACT Ballet, named for the Performing Arts Council of the Transvaal, in Johannesburg, and CAPAB Ballet, named for the Cape Performing Arts Board, in Cape Town. Upon returning to her home town, Spira joined PACT Ballet, under the direction of Faith de Villiers, soon after it was formed. During her brief tenure with this new, young company, she danced leading roles in Swan Lake, Giselle, Sylvia, and Casse Noisette (The Nutcracker). An unfortunate salary dispute led to her defection, along with her frequent partner Gary Burne, to the company in Cape Town. Spira and Burne joined CAPAB Ballet as its principal dancers in 1965, leaving it temporarily in 1967-1968 and moving to Toronto to dance with the National Ballet of Canada, directed by Celia Franca. After touring North America with this company, they returned to South Africa at the end of 1968 and rejoined CAPAB Ballet. They performed as a popular partnership until Burne left the company in 1971.Julius Eichbaum, \\"The CAPAB Ballet Company,\\" Dancing Times (London) June 1994, pp. 879, 881. Thereafter, she formed another partnership with strikingly handsome Eduard Greyling, which lasted for some seventeen years, until she retired from the stage. Spira's repertory ranged widely, varying from the lyrical (Les Sylphides) to the dramatic (Romeo and Juliet) to the technically spectacular (Don Quixote). Her musicality, theatrical intelligence, and sense of humor enabled her to interpret disparate roles with great finesse. She danced the Betrayed Girl in The Rake's Progress, by de Valois; the Young Girl in The Two Pigeons, by Ashton; and the title role of Bournonville's La Sylphide, staged by Hans Brenaa. Among the several works that Burne choreographed for her were The Doves (1966), set to music by Aram Katchaturian, and The Birthday of the Infanta (1971), set to the music of Harry Partch. David Poole also created roles for her and, as artistic director of the company, cast her in many others. Besides classical ballet, Spira was a gifted Spanish dancer, appearing in Marina Keet's productions of The Three-Cornered Hat (1966), set to the famous score by Manuel de Falla, and Fiesta Manchega (1973), to music by Francisco Guerrero. In 1971, she danced the role of Salome in John the Baptist, set by Veronica Paeper to music by Ernest Bloch, and in 1976, she danced the title role in Judith, set by Alfred Rodrigues to music by √áetin I≈üik√∂zl√º.Grut, \\"Spira, Phyllis,\\" in The History of Ballet in South Africa (1981), p. 413. Comparisons with Alicia Markova were persistent. Peter Williams, editor of Dance and Dancers, wrote that \\"Spira looked uncannily like Markova as well as having a flavor of Fonteyn, but with an approach of her own.\\"Botha, Phyllis Spira: A Tribute (1988), p. 1. Describing her as \\"reed- thin and tiny, with huge eyes dominating a gamine face,\\" a writer for the New York Times also likened her to Markova, remarking that they shared \\"a classical purity of line and delicacy of style wedded to a steely technique.\\"Roslyn Sulcas, \\"Phyllis Spira, 64, Cape Town Ballerina, Dies,\\" obituary, The New York Times, 17 March 2008. She continued to lead the Cape Town company until 1988, when an injury on the opening night of a new production of Giselle brought her dance career to an end. Honors and awards Spira received numerous honors and awards during her long career. A two-time winner of the Nederburg Award for Ballet, she was also the recipient of the Lilian Solomon Award and the Bellarte Woman of the Year Award for the Cape Province in 1979, In 1984, she was granted the unusual title of prima ballerina assoluta by the president of South Africa. Following this rare honor, she received South Africa's highest civilian award for excellence, the Order for Meritorious Service, Gold. In 2000, she received the Molteno Medal from the Cape Tercentenary Foundation for lifetime service to the performing arts.Shain and Pimstone, \\"Phyllis Spira,\\" Jewish Women's Archive, website, http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/spira-phyllis. Retrieved 22 November 2015. In 2003, she was named a member of the Order of the Disa for her contribution to ballet and the development of ballet in disadvantaged communities.University of Cape Town News, Monday Paper, Archives, website, http://www.news.uct.ac.za,mondaypaper/archives. Retrieved 16 September 2015. Later life After leaving the stage in 1988, Spira served as principal ballet mistress of CAPAB Ballet until 1999, during which time the company was renamed as Cape Town City Ballet. She and her husband, Philip Boyd, a former CAPAB dancer whom she had married in 1986, had no children, so they devoted their energies to community service. Appointed head of the David Poole Trust Youth Training Program, she and Boyd ran the Dance for All program initiated by Poole some years earlier. Set up to take dance to underprivileged children living in non-white townships, it was active in Gugulethu, Nyanga, and Khayelitsha on the borders of Cape Town and in the rural inland areas of Barrydale and Montagu. The program reached more than seven hundred children each year.Sulcas, \\"Phyllis Spira, 64, Cape Town Ballerina, Dies,\\" obituary, 17 March 2008. After a foot injury in August 2007 in London, Spira underwent a series of operations on both her legs. Complications set in and she again underwent vascular surgery, which she did not survive. She died in a Cape Town hospital, aged 64.

Duesenberg is part of G√∂ldo Music GmbH and is widely known for their classic and distinctive Art Deco designs. By 2004, the company opened a new branch in Fullerton, California. Besides its electric guitars and basses such as its most successful model, the Starplayer TV, the company produces high end music equipment like amplifiers and effects pedals. History The first model of the Starplayer Series Duesenberg Headquarters in Hannover When first used by the German guitar designer Dieter G√∂lsdorf in 1986, Duesenberg was originally a brand for futuristic heavy metal guitars until 1989. Since 1991, G√∂lsdorf uses the brand within his company, G√∂ldo Music GmbH in Hannover, Germany. By 1995, G√∂lsdorf had begun developing a new guitar called the Starplayer, which would be the predecessor of their now most popular model, the Starplayer TV. The brand Duesenberg was taken up again for these instruments. The guitar featured a semi-hollow flat Spruce top construction, a Maple neck with Rosewood fingerboard, two pickups, one humbucker and one P-90-style single coil switched by utilising unconventional wiring, and numerous Art Deco style appointments. With its classic designs and mostly unconventional colouring, Duesenberg instruments refer to the craftsmanship in guitar design of the 1950s and 1960s. Due to the extensive media coverage of Japanese popular musician Sheena Ringo, who regularly used a surf green Starplayer TV, sales figures began experiencing a steady growth. In 2004, the company opened a new branch in Fullerton, California. As sales continued growing, the company found itself in need of a new facility and moved from the city center to the outskirts of Hannover by 2011. Meanwhile, the number of international artists who use Duesenberg instruments as live performance equipment has increased significantly. Over the years, this has resulted in several Signature-Edition Instruments. Today, Duesenberg has become a small brand with worldwide recognition for high-quality instruments and sound equipment. Name Starplayer TV Ron Wood Duesenberg is spelled the same as the automobile brand, founded in the 1920s by brothers Friedrich and August Duesenberg. They themselves had become highly respected for outstanding design, performance and luxury. Just like the cars, Duesenberg instruments are also called Doozy or Duesy, which had become a slang expression for extravagance and enthusiasm in past decades, originally associated with the automobiles. Rumor has it when Ron Wood, guitarist of The Rolling Stones, first unpacked his signature edition, the Ron Wood Mother Of Pearl in October 2002, he apparently said \\"Oh what a Doozey!\\", which may be the actual reason why Duesenberg Instruments came to be called Doozeys. Design D Logo on guitars top A fundamental basis of the typical Duesenberg design is its three-step geometry. This is reflected in almost every part of the instrument, from headstock, pickguard and pickup-ring to knobs, output jack and even the pickup switch knob. The typical Duesenberg D also contains this three-step design in the lower bar. Most of the instruments are semi-hollow constructions. However, the solid body guitars also feature many traditional elements.Duesenberg.de - Duesenberg Produktkatalog 2012(Digital Product Catalogue 2012) Duesenberg combines these traditional shapes with design elements of the Art D√©co style, which is expressed in overall designs, as well through the use of rare and eccentric materials. Typical for this style are parallel lines, stepped geometries and extended curves. The colouring also uses classic elements, some of them typical for Art D√©co. Besides standard colours such as Black and White, the colour palette features a transparent Orange, a classic Surf Green, a pastel Red and the glitter finishes Blue-, Silver- and Black-sparkle. Duesenberg designs also feature extravagant mother-of-pearl finishes Ice-, Blue- and Emerald-Green-Pearl. Traditional finishes such as Gold-Top, Two-Tone-Sunburst, Fireburst and Vintage Blonde are used on specific models as well. Features thumb Diamond Deluxe Tremola Duesenberg Z-Tuner Duesenberg PLEK Wood & Neck Spruce is the traditional German choice wood for the tops of semi- hollow constructed instruments - this also is reflected in Duesenberg instruments. The back, bent sides and neck on these models usually are made of Maple which in the case of sides and back is flamed and bookmatched.Duesenberg.de (eng) - Duesenberg Technical Most models feature a neck made of American Hardrock Maple. Exceptions are the D-Caster, Dragster, 49er and 52, which are equipped with a Mahogany neck. These guitars also feature a Mahogany body. The fretboards are made of Indian Rosewood with dot- inlays for orientation, except for the Starplayer TV Phonic, Artist-, 440-, Classic- and Imperial Series as well as the signature models Starplayer TV Chris Whitley and C.C. John Platania, which have custom fretboard inlays. Each guitar features a 25.6\\" scale, a fretboard radius of 12\\" and a Dual-Action- Trussrod. All guitars are equipped with Jumbo Frets and factory-fitted .10-.50 strings. Hardware Every instrument features Duesenberg's own hardware parts which are designed by Dieter G√∂lsdorf. Due to the classic approach, all standard hardware parts are nickel-plated, as was customary before chrome finishes became popular. Hardware parts are being constantly developed and improved so that the current tremolo on Duesenberg guitars have been optimized in shape and detail continuously until today. Duesenberg uses their own tuners, called Z-Tuners, on every guitar. These tuners have a drilled-through shaft which allows for fast string change by putting the string all the way through the tuner and cutting it off at the end to prevent sharp ends sticking out at the back of the headstock. Pickups As well as other hardware, Duesenberg pickups are available online. Each pickup features an open German Silver cover. Currently, the company produces five different types of pickups for neck or bridge position use. The Grand Vintage, the Crunchbucker and the D-Tron generally cover the area of humbucking pickups. The Grand Vintage is Duesenberg's interpretation of a classic PAF Style pickup and is used in most instruments bridge position. The Little Toaster is a humbucking pickup with a lower output reminiscent more of a single coil than a Humbucker and is featured on special instruments such as the TV Rebound. The Domino is a P90 style pickup with the dimensions of a standard humbucker. It is used in the neck position on most guitars. PLEK Since January 2009, every instrument has been processed in the computer-controlled PLEK machine.Duesenberg.de (eng) - PLEK The CNC based system cuts and levels each fret within a tolerance of 1/100 of a millimetre. This is done to guarantee optimal setup conditions and playability. Starplayer TV Starplayer TV Mike Campbell Duesenberg booth at the Frankfurter Musikmesse 2012 The Starplayer TV, often simply referred to as TV, is a semi-hollow electric guitar, featuring a sustain-center-block, maple neck and arched back, as well as a laminated arched spruce top with a single f-hole on the left side. The standard version of the Starplayer TV is equipped with two pickups, the Domino P90 in the neck position and the Grand Vintage humbucker in the bridge position. The tremolo versions of the guitar use the Duesenberg Diamond Deluxe Tremola as designed by Dieter G√∂lsdorf. Depending on the version, every guitar has a distinctive top finish. Neck, sides and reverse of the headstock are usually finished in opaque black. Basic versions feature a black to grey burst finish on the back, decently showing the flamed maple. Most models have a simple cream binding on body and neck. Over the years, the Starplayer TV has become the company's most successful model within the range, which has resulted in several special versions and signature models: ;Starplayer TV :Basic model, available in Black, Vintage White, 2-Tone Sunburst, Surf Green, Silver Sparkle, Blue Sparkle, Trans-Orange and Gold- Top.Duesenberg.de (eng) - Guitar Model List and Features ;Starplayer TV Stoptailpiece :Edition without a tremolo, available in Black and 2-Tone Sunburst. ;Starplayer TV Classic (Honey All Over) :Special Edition featuring the Honey-All-Over finish.

Since he was a teenager and as a survivor of the Holocaust, Toma Sik actively opposed Israeli militarism. He refused military service and counselled conscientious objectors for 30 years, and played a central role in the War Resisters International chapter in Israel, as well as in Gush Shalom (Peace Bloc). He was an active secular humanist proponent for human and civil rights for both Jews and Arabs. He worked as a columnist and translator at Al-Fajr English-language Palestinian weekly, and as a photographer for the Arab Studies Society in East Jerusalem. Since 1974 he devoted himself merely to public activity, developing a simple living style. He was a familiar sight at demonstrations in central Israel for many years, where he would distribute leaflets written in his peculiar style. He also worked at the War Resisters International‚Äôs headquarters in London, was the central activist in Amnesty International Israel Branch and helped Alba K√∂r (Hungarian nonviolent movement for Peace) become a War Resisters International Member. He was also a citizen of the Mondcivitan Republic (Commonwealth of World Citizens). For many years Toma Sik supported the international language Esperanto. He also taught it to his children. He occasionally hosted Esperanto meetings in his Tel Aviv home and hosted foreign Esperantists there. He left Israel in the late 1990s and ultimately settled down again in his country of birth, Hungary, where he died in 2004, overrun by a tractor during a nightly walk home through the fields to his newly-bought old farm where he was trying to establish an egalitarian agricultural commune of organic, humanist and vegan \\"new peasants\\". In his obituary his friends stated: \\"in the words of Joe Hill, Don't mourn, organise!\\". The International Institute of Social History keeps a vast collection of papers from Toma Sik in several languages, such as Hebrew, Hungarian, and English. The papers include documentation on the peace movement in Israel and especially Gush Shalom, periodicals and leaflets about sustainable and organic agriculture, the environment (e.g. in Eastern Europe), vegetarianism and veganism, and documentation about European unification, including newsletters from the European Anti-Maastricht Alliance.

Its mission was to create an audio-visual record of Australian culture, through the commissioning, distribution and management of programs that deal with matters of national interest or illustrate and interpret aspects of Australian life. The agency consolidated operations into Screen Australia in 2008. Administration of the Film Australia Collection was transferred from Screen Australia to the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia on 1 July 2011. History In 1945, the Australian National Film Board was established to produce documentary films. In 1956, the board was renamed the Australian Commonwealth Film Unit. Stanley Hawes was the Producer-in-Chief from 1946 to 1969. In 1973, the unit became Film Australia. That year it gained its first female producer, Suzanne Baker, who in 1977 became the first Australian woman to win an Academy Award, for Best Animated Short Film, for Leisure, animated by Bruce Petty. Some of Michael Thornhill's first films were short documentaries made for the Commonwealth Film Unit, including The Esperance story (1968) and Cheryl and Kevin (1974). One of Film Australia's most successful films is A Steam Train Passes. It has won many awards and is generally regarded as Australia's finest railway film. Film Australia also created one of Australia's most successful children's television programs, Johnson and Friends, which ran for four series. The program sold to over 50 territories and ran from 1990 until 1995. This venture also lead to the creation of further children's programs, including The Girl from Tomorrow / Tomorrow's End, Boffins, Escape from Jupiter / Return to Jupiter and Spellbinder / Land of the Dragon Lord. The operations of Film Finance Corporation Australia, Australian Film Commission, and Film Australia were merged as Screen Australia in July 2008. Administration of the Film Australia Collection was transferred from Screen Australia to the National Film and Sound Archive (NFSA) on 1 July 2011. However, the Australian Children's Television Foundation are now the distributors for Film Australia's children's catalogue, with the exception of Boffins, which is maintained by the NFSA.  Operations  Before becoming Screen Australia, Film Australia was one of the nation's leading producers of television documentaries and educational programs. Film Australia produced programs under the National Interest Program: a contract with the Australian Government to devise, produce, distribute and market productions that deal with matters of national interest or illustrate and interpret aspects of Australian life. Additional funding for a ten-part series on Australian history was provided by the Government from 2005. Film Australia was the executive producer of these productions, drawing the creative and technical talent needed to produce them from Australia's independent documentary production industry. The company also provided support to the Australian documentary sector through a range of services and facilities, under its Community Service Obligations. The Film Australia Library manages over 5000 titles and 150,000 photographs, reflecting a century of Australia's history. This unique archive of footage and stills is made available to the production industry. Film Australia Digital Learning creates projects targeted to the developing market for educational resources, primarily for delivery online. It draws largely on the materials in Film Australia's Library, and creates opportunities for documentary filmmakers and multimedia producers in education and new media production. Film Australia Distribution markets both National Interest Program productions and independently produced documentaries to Australian and international broadcasters, and to libraries, schools, universities and community groups. Film Australia Studios in Sydney is a purpose-built film and television production facility and provides screening venues, a sound stage, sound post- production facilities, a film laboratory, production offices, editing and transfer suites. These are used by many Film Australia and low-budget independent film and television productions, and by long-term tenants who operate production facilities and service companies. Film Australia‚Äôs Digital Resource Finder is a quick, convenient and easy-to-use search engine for teachers and educators. It features FREE FOR EDUCATION video clips from Film Australia‚Äôs remarkable archive‚Äîone of the nation‚Äôs largest and most historically significant collections.

The 12 part series ran beginning of January 2007.Wollanston, Sam Last Night's TV with Sam Wollaston. The Guardian. Retrieved on 3 December 2015. Summary The project follows the 15 apprentices into the hostile frontier lands of Northern Kenya, with their expedition leader Ken Hames (Beyond Boundaries) and new foreman Nick Knowles (DIY SOS). The team find themselves in the Sera Conservancy, marooned by a dry river bed with no water, as well as being surrounded by dangerous animals like a bull elephant. Working side by side with local people the trainees have just six weeks to build an ecolodge, dig boreholes for water and help local wildlife experts repopulate the area with animals. The team of rookie builders, electricians, plumbers and architects have no experience of working and surviving in the African bush. They have to get the build completed while satisfying the needs of the local Samburu tribal leaders who need water for their domestic stock, as well as the wildlife they have been pledged to protect.Tilden, Imogen Yes But.... The Guardian. Retrieved on 3 December 2015. Nick Knowles and former Special Forces Major Ken Hames put together the team, and are in charge of turning the volunteers into a united workforce. Ken, an expert on the African Frontier, also trains the team as wildlife rangers. Nick, Ken and the trainees live in tents in the bush alongside their African team mates who were working with them on the site. At night the camp is protected by rangers, as nocturnal visitors include elephants and lions.Curwin, Nick On the box - Walks on the wild side. Broadcast. Retrieved on 3 December 2015. As the series progresses the ranger trainees capture six giraffes to relocate to a new reserve, track rhino and tag elephant. Their training takes place at Lewa, a conservancy further south, and the template for the initiative at Sera, a new community conservation area in the far north of Kenya towards the Ethiopian and Somali borders. Sera is an area that for many years has been ravaged by tribal conflict, bandits and poaching and where conservancy experts are trying to bring security, stability and prosperity to the people. The aim of the project is to enhance the work done by conservancies to conserve wildlife and its habitat with the support of local communities. This is done through the protection and management of species, the initiation and support of community conservation and development programmes, and the education of neighbouring areas in the value of wildlife. With wildlife encouraged back to Sera, it is hoped that tourists and investors will come to stay at the new lodge and view the wildlife close up. It will also provide better access to water for the local community as well as work and income. Critical reception The show received mixed to positive reviews. Sam Wollaston of The Guardian commented on the cast's \\"privileged\\" attempt at \\"saving\\" Africa, while making a droll comparison that the skill- sets used in the television show DIY SOS would be on par with combating famine, drought, and civil war. Imogen Tilden did, however, offer a contrary view on the shows merits. And found Wollaston's review cynical. Nick Curwin of Broadcast found the show refreshing compared to the \\"lazy, spoilt, bland, self-obsessed wannabes doing nothing of any possible consequence\\" on reality television.

One of the country's leading historians, Ferrell was widely considered the preeminent authority on the administration of Harry S. Truman, and also wrote books about half a dozen other 20th-century presidents. He was thought by many in the field to be the \\"dean of American diplomatic historians,\\" a title he disavowed. Early life Ferrell was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1921 to Ernest and Edna Ferrell. His mother was a schoolteacher; his father was a World War I veteran whose career as a banker kept the family moving throughout Ohio during the Great Depression. The family settled in Waterville, Ohio, where Ferrell's father managed the First National Bank and Ferrell and his brother Ernest Jr. went to high school. A pianist, Ferrell studied music and education at Bowling Green State University in Ohio before serving in the U.S. Army Air Forces during the Second World War as a chaplain's assistant and staff sergeant. His wartime experience in Europe compelled him to change his vocation to the study of history, inspired also by reading the works of historian and fellow Ohioan Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr., Ida Tarbell, and Allan Nevins. After the war, he received a B.S. in Education from Bowling Green in 1946 and another in history in 1947. Academic career Ferrell's first book, Peace in Their Time: The Origins of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, won the American Historical Association's 1952 George Louis Beer PrizeAt Yale University, Ferrell earned a master's degree in 1948 and a Ph.D. in 1951, working under the direction of Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Samuel Flagg Bemis. His dissertation, The United States and the Origins of the Kellogg‚ÄìBriand Pact, won Yale's John Addison Porter Prize for original scholarship. A longer version of this became his first book, Peace in Their Time: The Origins of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which went on to win the American Historical Association's 1952 George Louis Beer Prize. ‚ÄúThis may not be the last book on the subject, but it should be,‚Äù wrote historian Richard W. Leopold of Northwestern University. Ferrell was an intelligence analyst in the U.S. Air Force in Washington, D.C., during the Korean War. After leaving the Air Force, he taught at Michigan State in 1952‚Äì53. He then moved to Indiana University in Bloomington, where he taught for many years, starting as an assistant professor in 1953 and rising to distinguished professor of history in 1974. He held several notable visiting professorships, including Yale in 1955‚Äì56 and the University of Cairo in 1958‚Äì59, the universities of South Carolina, Wisconsin and Nebraska in the late 1950s, and the Naval War College in 1974. In 1971, he was elected the fourth president of the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations (SHAFR). He made nine appearances on C-SPAN to discuss his books and historical events, and was a featured expert in the History Channel's 2005 documentary series The Presidents. In a 2000 Chicago Sun-Times article, Ferrell ranked Abraham Lincoln, Truman and George Washington as the three best presidents in history. Teaching and academic legacy Ferrell considered teaching a core part of his career, and worked to improve the quality of history teaching in general. In 1964, working with Maurice Glen Baxter and John E. Wiltz, he conducted a thorough survey of every high-school history teacher and school librarian in Indiana, writing up their findings along with detailed suggestions to help unprepared teachers in the 1964 book The Teaching of American History in High Schools. He supervised 35 Ph.D. students from 1961 to 1988. Many of his students became history professors themselves. His students, both Ph.D. and otherwise, included Eugene P. Trani, former president of Virginia Commonwealth University; American Spectator founder Emmett Tyrrell; William B. Pickett, a professor emeritus of history at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Indiana and author of Eisenhower Decides To Run; historian and author Arnold A. Offner, past president of SHAFR; Reginald Horsman, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee professor and author of Race and Manifest Destiny; Terry H. Anderson, history professor at Texas A&M; University and author of The Pursuit of Fairness: A History of Affirmative Action; Preview. Ross Gregory, history professor at Western Michigan University and author of Walter Hines Page: Ambassador to the Court of St. James‚Äôs; national security and intelligence expert Melvin Goodman, author of Whistleblower at the CIA; Theodore A. Wilson, history professor at the University of Kansas and author of The First Summit: Roosevelt and Churchill at Placentia Bay, 1941; and John Garry Clifford, professor of political science at the University of Connecticut. After his 1988 retirement, SHAFR named the annual Robert H. Ferrell Book Prize in his honor for distinguished scholarship in the field. More than a dozen of his former students, all historians in their own right, compiled the book Presidents, Diplomats, and Other Mortals: Essays Honoring Robert H. Ferrell to recognize his achievements in the field.  Published works  Ferrell wrote prolifically, sharing with Bemis a disapproval of what they called \\"one-book men\\" who stopped writing after finishing a Ph.D. dissertation. He published 25 books before his 1988 retirement from teaching, and before his death had produced more than 60. His prose was \\"expressed with grace and economy, [and] a light wit,\\" wrote historian Lawrence Kaplan. After the publication of Peace in Their Time, his early works included influential history textbooks American Diplomacy in the Great Depression and American Diplomacy: A History, the latter of which was republished in expanded and revised editions three times in the ensuing decades. He continued to work closely with his mentor Bemis, co-editing the later volumes of the series American Secretaries of State and Their Diplomacy which Bemis had begun in the 1920s, and also writing the entries on Frank B. Kellogg, Henry L. Stimson, and George Marshall. He helped edit Bemis' Pulitzer-winning 1949 biography, John Quincy Adams and the Foundations of American Foreign Policy, and catalyzed the publication of a 1957 paperback edition of Bemis' The Diplomacy of the American Revolution. Ferrell was also notable for the thoroughness and depth of his research, with a knack for finding obscure or unpublished diaries, memoirs, and letters which would then become central elements of his books, such as the papers of Coolidge-era assistant secretary of state William Castle, which greatly informed Peace in Their Time. Editing and publishing the diaries and private letters of persons of historical interest, from presidents to ordinary soldiers, became a specialty of his, with nearly two dozen such books to his name, including presidents Truman, Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge (and his wife Grace) and Dwight Eisenhower, White House staffers James Hagerty, Frank Comerford Walker, Arthur F. Burns and Eben Ayers, and soldiers in the American Civil War, World Wars I and II, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Not content to be a passive chronicler of history, Ferrell would often, when he felt a topic merited it, engage in spirited critique of other historians' interpretations of past events. In the influential 1955 article \\"Pearl Harbor and the Revisionists,\\" he argued against the conspiracy theory that Franklin Roosevelt had deliberately allowed Japan to commit the surprise attack that drew the U.S. into World War II. His book Harry S. Truman and the Cold War Revisionists argued against post-1960s New Left historians' critiques of the Truman era. Reactions to the book were divided: Writing for Michigan State University's H-Net, Curt Cardwell felt that Ferrell misunderstood the arguments of the younger generation he criticized and was \\"condescending,\\" while Alonzo L. Hamby's review in Journal of Cold War Studies called the book \\"restrained and gentlemanly\\" and noted that Ferrell viewed prominent revisionist William Appleman Williams as a friend. In a 1995 article in American Heritage, he accused Merle Miller, author of the bestselling book Plain Speaking: An Oral Biography of Harry. S. Truman, of fabricating many of the quotes attributed to Truman. In 1998's The Dying President, Ferrell examined Franklin D. Roosevelt's medical records and concluded that Roosevelt had deliberately chosen to keep the cardiovascular disease which would soon kill him secret from the public. The book was praised by historian John Lukacs as ‚Äúpainstaking and exceptionally researched ‚Ä¶ sparklingly well-written, bearing the marks of a master historian‚Äù and one of the most important books on Roosevelt by any historian.  Harry S. Truman  rightFerrell wrote voluminously on Truman, devoting more than a dozen books to his life and presidency. Ferrell's work rehabilitated the reputation of the Truman presidency, which had been previously considered a failure by scholars, by providing evidence of how decisions such as Truman's choice to champion the Marshall Plan led to the successful establishment of an American- led post-war world order. Although it was overshadowed by the popular success of David McCullough's Pulitzer-winning Truman biography, Ferrell's 1994 Harry S. Truman: A Life was considered a masterwork by scholars in his field. Historian Lawrence Kaplan called it \\"the height of his achievement,\\" with far more detailed analysis than McCullough's book. Ferrell's discovery of a cache of hundreds of letters from Truman to his wife, previously thought to have been burned, led to his 1983 book Dear Bess: The Letters From Harry to Bess Truman, 1910-1959., a New York Times bestseller. Coincidentally, Ferrell and Truman were born on the same day, May 8.  World War I  World War I was a special interest of Ferrell's‚Äîin particular the 1918 Meuse-Argonne Offensive, the largest and bloodiest U.S. operation of the war, in which Ferrell's father and then-Capt. Harry Truman both served. His books on the conflict include America's Deadliest Battle, Collapse at Meuse-Argonne, and a profile of the American Expeditionary Forces' only African-American division, Unjustly Dishonored, as well as several edited memoirs of soldiers who served in it. One of his final books, 2008's The Question of MacArthur's Reputation, painstakingly reconstructed the events of the Meuse-Argonne, a victory which helped launch the career of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, to prove that MacArthur had lied about his role in the battle to embellish his prestige and take undeserved credit. Awards In addition to the John Addison Porter Prize and George Louis Beer Prize for his early work on the Kellogg-Briand Pact, Ferrell received the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations' Norman and Laura Graebner Award in 1998, which recognizes distinguished lifetime achievement by a senior historian of United States foreign relations. In 2002, Ferrell was given the Society for Military History's Distinguished Book Award for editing a trio of memoirs by soldier William S. Triplet, A Youth in the Meuse-Argonne, A Colonel in the Armored Divisions, and In the Philippines and Okinawa. Personal life His wife, Lila, died in 2002. They had a daughter, Carolyn. He was an inveterate collector of books, owning more than 10,000 volumes. He died of heart disease. Ferrell's papers, writings and correspondence, comprising 200,000 items, are archived at Indiana University's Lilly Library.

Considered one of Italian cinema's top early directors, he directed over 120 films in his fifty-year career between 1913 and 1963. Life and career Carmine Gallone was born as Carmelo Camillo Gallone on 10 September 1885 in Taggia (in the province of Imperia), but grew up in Naples. His father was Italian, from Sorrento, and his mother was French, from Nice.G. Martini, Patchwork: 100 anni di cinema in Italia : un viaggio attraverso le regioni, Finzioni, 1997, p. 168 He began writing plays at 15 and in 1911 won first prize at a national drama competition for his drama Brittanico. He later moved to Rome where in 1912 he was hired as a general worker by the Teatro Argentina company, all the while continuing to write plays. In the same year he had his first experience working in film at the Cines studio. In 1912 he also met and married the Polish actress Stanis≈Çawa Winawer√≥wna, better known to the public as Soava Gallone, whom he directed in many of his films. Promoted to director at Cines, he directed thirteen titles in 1914 alone, including Amore senza veli, Il romanzo di un torero, La donna nuda and Le campane di Sorrento. In 1915 he was selected to direct the film Avatar. In 1918 he made his most successful film to date, Redenzione (Redemption) for the Medusa Film company. The film had a great success with audiences and critics. In 1924, together with Augusto Genina he directed Il corsaro. The following year due to the Italian film industry's troubles Gallone moved abroad where he worked for many years in France, Germany, England and Austria. Due to his predilection for historical epics he was compared to Cecil B. DeMille. His best remembered films like Gli ultimi giorni di Pompei (The Last Days of Pompeii) in 1926 and many years later, the massive epic Scipione l'Africano in 1937, were used to enhance the imperial aspirations of the Mussolini regime, through the depiction of the greatness of ancient Rome. About Scipio l'Africano, Gallone is said to have remarked \\"If the film does not please il Duce I will shoot myself.\\" The film in fact did not impress Mussolini, but still premiered at the Venice Film Festival and was quite successful. In 1943 he made Harlem, set in the US and critical about the American lifestyle, with afro-American and colonial British war prisoners employed in extra roles as colored characters. Gallone also had a passion for making films that were linked to, or inspired by, the world of opera. These include Casta Diva (1935), Il sogno di Butterfly (Butterfly's Dream) (1939 and the remake of 1954) and Puccini (1953). After the revival of Italian film Gallone went back to work at home permanently in 1940. He directed not only more historical films like Messalina (1951) and Cartagine in fiamme (1960), but also some comic films in the Don Camillo series starring Fernandel and Gino Cervi. The comedy Carmen di Trastevere, made in 1963, was the last film of his long career. Having directed more than one hundred films, Gallone is noted as one of the most prolific filmmakers in the history of Italian cinema, active both in the silent and sound eras.

History  The British army assigned a captain to the central administration for police duties in 1898. He commanded 30 British army officers and helped to organize provincial police forces. In 1901 the authorities decentralized the police to improve efficiency. The government assumed responsibility for administrative control of the police in 1908, but provincial governors retained operational control of the forces. In 1928 the British established the Sudan Police Force (SPF) under the Ministry of Interior. Throughout the colonial period, the police lacked the resources and manpower to deploy officers throughout Sudan. Instead, the government gave tribal leaders authority to maintain order among their people and to enlist a limited number of ‚Äúretainers‚Äù to help them in law-enforcement duties. This communal security system remained in effect until the early 1970s. The Sudan Police College opened in Khartoum in 1937 to train all policemen and administrators in a one- or two-year course. Graduates could transfer between the two services initially, but by 1948 training had become too specialized to allow this practice. In 1969 the authorities built a police laboratory to enhance criminal-investigation capabilities. The SPF faced several challenges during the colonial and early postcolonial periods. On June 4, 1951, a group of police officers met to discuss recent labor unrest in Khartoum, North Khartoum, and Omdurman. The British commandant broke up the meeting. The police officers then staged a demonstration that resulted in the dismissal of the ringleaders, who refused an order to return to barracks. On June 8‚Äì9, companies from the Camel Corps and the Eastern Arab Corps arrived in Khartoum from Al-Obeid and Kassala to prevent further unrest while the SDF disarmed the police. A few days later, the authorities allowed 670 police officers to return to duty but sacked 222 others. The British released a report in July that blamed the unrest on incompetent British officers who commanded the police and on wretched housing conditions. In the aftermath of this report, workmen built new housing and renovated old barracks. The SPF and army worked together from 1965 to 1969 to quell the unrest caused by the rebellion in the Southern provinces. By 1970, SPF headquarters included administration, immigration, nationality, public affairs, training, and security administration. These divisions also existed at provincial levels. Each provincial police force had about 2,000 officers. Khartoum frequently modified the command and administration of the SPF. Prior to 1977, women served in the police after learning basic administrative duties and working on criminal cases involving women as witnesses or defendants. In 1977 four women completed the twoyear course at the Sudan Police College and became the first females to join the ranks. A limited number of women served in the SPF and generally worked in administrative sections, on juvenile delinquency matters, or criminal cases that involved female Sudanese witnesses or defendants. The police reported to the minister of interior until 1979, when that post was abolished, and various ministers became responsible for different areas of police work. This arrangement proved unwieldy, however, and the Police Act of 1979 instituted a unified command in which the head of the force reported to the president. After al-Numayri's fall, the cabinet position of minister of interior was restored, and the director general of police was made responsible to the minister. Central police headquarters in Khartoum was organized into several divisions‚Äîsuch as administration, training, and security affairs‚Äîeach commanded by a police major general. The main operational elements included the traffic police and the riot police. The 1979 legislation brought specialized police units, such as one for the Sudan Railways, under the SPF‚Äôs authority. Khartoum headquarters maintained liaison and cooperated with the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) and agencies involved in combating international drug trafficking. The government's new administrative system delegated many powers to the regional level, but law enforcement outside major urban areas was organized at the state level. Thus, the SPF was subdivided into state commands, which were organized according to the same divisions found in the national headquarters. Local police directors reported to state police commissioners, who in turn were responsible to the SPF director general in Khartoum. Each provincial command had its own budget. The SPF expanded from roughly 7,500 officers and men in 1956 to about 18,000 in 1970 and 30,000 by 2005.  Police organizations  As of 2010, internal security was divided up among an array of organizations, including the United Police Forces (UPF), Popular Police Forces (PPF), Popular Defense Forces, and Border Intelligence Guard.  United Police Forces  The United Police Forces had an estimated 30,000 personnel who were responsible for civil defense, criminal investigations, immigration and customs, passport control, traffic control, and wildlife protection. Police divisions normally operated within state commands. State police commissioners reported to the director general of police in Khartoum, who answered to the minister of interior. The UPF inventory included 40 Fahd armored fighting vehicles, 20 Panhard M3 armored fighting vehicles, and 30 armored personnel carriers. The serviceability of these vehicles was unknown. Generally, the UPF had not deployed significant numbers of officers to South Sudan. After 2004, an unknown number of UPF personnel deployed to Darfur. Human-rights advocates accused the UPF of committing an array of human-rights atrocities.  Popular Police Forces  The Popular Police Forces, created in 1989, were estimated to have at least 35,000 members who technically were under the supervision of the director general of police. In fact, the PPF was little more than an Islamist vigilante group that supposedly assisted the UPF. It operated as a politicized militia that sought to enforce ‚Äúmoral standards‚Äù among the country‚Äôs Islamic population. The PPF, not surprisingly, had a poor human- rights record.  Border control  Sudan lacked a true border guard. The UPF was responsible for passport control, immigration, and customs at border- crossing points, although the SAF and the PDF might also undertake border- control duties. However, there was a Border Intelligence Guard that operated outside the SAF chain of command; it reported directly to SAF military intelligence officers in the area of operations. The Border Intelligence Guard was active during the Southern civil war. In 2002‚Äì3, the guard recruited sources in Darfur to gather information about political and military conditions. Some observers accused the guard of recruiting for the janjaweed.  Training  One researcher found no available information about training in the al-Bashir era, but formerly police officer cadets usually received two years of training at the Sudan Police College near Khartoum. The institution provided theoretical and practical instruction and served as a training school for military personnel who required police skills in their assignments. In addition to recruit training, the college offered courses in criminal law, general police duties, fingerprinting, clerical work, photography, and the use of small arms. Enlisted recruits usually underwent four months of training at state headquarters.  Community relations and human rights  State police traditionally enjoyed good relations with the local communities, but in Khartoum if not elsewhere, police treatment of arrested persons could be harsh. During the 1990s and early 2000s, public-order campaigns in Khartoum often resulted in roundups of thousands of people, who were then charged with illegal street vending or loitering. In urban areas, police abused refugees, particularly Southerners, by stealing from them or beating them for minor infractions. The police also administered floggings for drinking alcohol or for curfew violations. Refugees seldom had recourse to the legal system when attacked by the police. Partly as a result of such actions, the al-Bashir government earned a reputation for poor treatment of prisoners.

They had survived mostly from extracting bribes from the public. Only the traffic division had smart uniforms and could be seen on duty, as their position made it easier to impose spurious fines on motorists. According to Friedman (2011), UNPOL and Liberian police leaders, through the Rule of Law Implementation Committee, then \\"recruited and deployed an initial interim force of 400 former local police officers to work alongside UNPOL in its efforts to drive out former combatants and reclaim police stations in Monrovia.

The International Crisis Group wrote in 2011 that 'Over 4,000 officers have been trained, including the armed Emergency Response Unit (ERU) and the specialised Police Support Unit (PSU). 623 (15 per cent) of these officers are women. At a ratio to population of 1:850 and with 65-70 per cent deployed in Montserrado county alone, there are clearly not enough officers to cover the whole country. The ERU, set up in 2008 to combat spiralling armed robbery, is functional and appears efficient, though based on revised needs assessments, it has only 344 officers instead of the originally targeted 500. The PSU is meant to have 600 members by December.' Divisions The LNP is made up of three units: Administration; Operations; Training. The Liberian Criminal Justice System site says that the Administration and Operations sections consist of: *Administration Section **i. Personnel **ii. Finance **iii. Records and Identification **iv.

Region four (4) ‚Äì Sinoe, Grand Gedeh, and River Cess Counties 5\\\\. Region five (5) ‚Äì River Gee, Maryland, Grand Kru Counties. INTERPOL states that \\"With more than 4,100 police officers in 151 police stations across the country, the Liberian National Police (LNP) has responsibility for Liberian internal security and criminal investigations.\\" The Liberian National Police have 844 officers spread across 33 stations in Montserrado County, which contains the capital Monrovia, as of October 2007. The National Police Training Academy (LNPTA) is in Montserrado County in Paynesville City. It is headed by a Commander with three deputy commanders: *1. Administration *2. Training and Research *3. Curriculum Development The Training Academy trains all members of the Liberia National Police in various phrases of law enforcement and crime prevention and investigation. It is also responsible to train members of the other law enforcement agencies such as Special Security Service, Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization, National Fire Service, Drugs Enforcement Agency, etc. Despite a national goal to raise police strength to 8,000, the impact of earlier delays in recruitment and the suspension of training during the West African Ebola virus epidemic make it unlikely that it will go much higher than 5000 men and women by mid 2016. Leadership In September 2016, Police Director Chris Massaquoi was succeeded by Gregory Coleman. Also appointed was Abraham Kromah, as deputy. Both had new titles in accordance with the National Police Act currently before the House, as Inspector General and Deputy Inspector General. Kromah's appointment drew particular comment. Kromah was a nephew and an aide of Alhaji Kromah, leader of ULIMO-K, and was associated with ULIMO during the First Liberian Civil War. He said that in 1990 he was an active member of the Student Unification Party on the University of Liberia campus. During the interim rule of the Council of State in 1996, he was appointed as Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Liberia. He was appointed as Deputy Director of the LNP, with responsibility for operations, by Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, but in May 2015 he was dismissed, along with two other senior LNP officers, without a public reason being given. He had had a serious rift with commercial motorcyclists while in the position.  See also  * Crime in Liberia Notes References * Further reading *Bruce Baker, Policing in Liberia, Coventry, UK.

It has a church, All Saints', and a Parish Room. The civil parish of Satterthwaite has its own community website. In 2011 Satterthwaite had a population of 215 according to the most recent census. The population peaked in 1881 at 450 and has since gradually declined to the current day. In the 10 years to 1891 the population fell to 410 falling further to 325 in 1931. The population decline is probably due to rural urban migration. In the 1870s Satterthwaite was described as \\"a village and a township-chapelry in Hawkshead parish, Lancashire.\\" Population of Satterthwaite  Housing  Satterthwaite contains a mixture of houses, in 2011 a total of 152 were in the vicinity, down from 166 in 2001. This change suggests houses may have been converted or changed into different establishments. In 2011, 104 of the 152 houses had at least one usual resident occupying the property compared to 112 out of 166 in 2001. In 2011 of the 152 houses 68 were detached, 57 semi-detached, 16 terraced and 10 flats. These houses occupy varies age groups. A total of 34 of these houses have 1 occupant living in them. Housing during the earlier years was very different to the housing of today in Satterthwaite. The difference was probably due to economy and capital flow that people had, as building a house required materials and expenses. With this though, in 1881 there was 82 houses in total. This obviously being a very different statistic than the numbers in the 2001 and 2011 census. In 10 years, 1891 only 10 new houses were built, this may have been an influx in population or that they had more land to build houses on. Again, the next 10 years 1901 only 2 houses were built. Then in 1921 there was a decline in houses, the previous 10 years was 94 but now it is 86. Satterthwaite grew as a place after the Second World War as new people arrived from the cities to work in forestry. In recent years, barn conversions have added to the number of properties, but around 50% of the buildings in Satterthwaite village are now second or holiday homes.  Occupation  A bar chart showing the occupation of Satterthwaite In Satterthwaite residents aged 16‚Äì74 that are in employment measure 137 in the year 2011, the majority of residents are employed, 29 residents were managers, directors and senior officials. The second highest job occupation is associate Professional and technical. These jobs seem to be highly qualified. 20 employees work on in the skilled trade section, incorporating their skills to work on houses throughout Satterthwaite. Another main occupation is caring, leisure and other service; 12 employees. Elementary occupations, qualified teachers count towards 18 occupation. Overall Satterthwaite has a range of occupations but they seem to require higher qualification jobs as for other districts. This should show how educated an area like Satterthwaite is. 2001 is consistently differently to 2011, all people aged 16‚Äì74 in employment totals 145 slightly more, this may be due to population decreasing since the last Census. Managers and senior officials count at 24. This is not the highest employment sector though, the main occupation is working in elementary valuing 27. Comparing this data to the occupational statistics in 1881 show a completely different aspect to life in Satterthwaite and shows the changes in industry as well as. This is probably due to improvements in technology as more advancing technology means people can become better and acquire different skills for more complex jobs. Education is also an advantage that people have in Satterthwaite at this current time compared to the occupational statistics in 1881. The main employment sector in 1881, for men, was agriculture. As Satterthwaite is a rural area and this was a large employment sector, agriculture is of high demand. Men usually do manual labour whereas women in that specific generations are more occupied in domestic jobs. This also shows as the main occupation for women in 1881 was domestic services or offices, the number of employed being 32. Yet again a large number of men work in the agriculture side of work, 39 males work in varies vegetable substances. These figures may have been more as it was difficult to find occupations in 1881.  Ethnicity  The ethnic group in Satterthwaite is mainly white British, 213 of the 215 residents. With only 1 mixed ethnicity and 1 Asian. This shows that Satterthwaite does not have a diverse ethnic society. In the 2011 Census 83.5% of the residents of England were born in England, 208 out of 215. With such a high percentage of English the religion that is the most popular is Christianity, 135 out of 215. 52 residents are non-religious. As Satterthwaite is mainly white British the main language they speak is obviously English (English or Welsh) 209 residents. All usual residents aged 3 and over equal 211. The two other residents equals European language. Residents arriving in the UK is another ethnic statistic that is relevant for Satterthwaite. In 2011, 208 of 215 residents were born in the United Kingdom, 4 residents arriving between 2004‚Äì2006.  Health and Care  Satterthwaite has a higher average of very good health compared to the whole of England. Satterthwaite has a 49.8% very good health rating whereas England has a percentage of 47.2%. The percentage of residents that have good health is also a high percentage, 32.6%. The only poor percentage rating is the 3.7% of which have bad health, even though this is a small value it may affect some residents. These percentages are relatively good but it is more realistic looking at genuine figures. In 2001 of all the 257 residents 187 of them have good health, it then declines rapidly. 53 have fairly good health and 17 have not good health. These figures are relatively good compared to England. In 2011 these figures change. The population being 215 and 107 of them having very good health and 70 of them have good health. In 10 years the health and well being of Satterthwaite has become better, probably due to technology advances. Disability may affect an area like Satterthwaite but due to the fact the population is not as high as other areas the disability rate will not be as high. In 2011 the population was 215 and out of them only 9 had day to day impacts due to their disability or could not do activities as best as possible. People affected in a little was equalled 27 people out of 215, this figure small yet again. Finally, 179 people are not affected by any sort of disability in Satterthwaite.  Places to Visit  Satterthwaite from Hob Gill Plantation Satterthwaite has some beautiful surrounding areas and places to visit. Some of the main places to visit are Grizedale Forest Park, Graythwaite Woods and Dale Park. Dale Park is ideal for leisure activities such as hiking and rambling. Grizedale is also ideal for leisure activities as the area of the land is 24.47km2 A campsite is the main attraction as well as cycling and walking paths. Within Grizedale is Force Forge and Force Mill. The water from Force Beck exits out of Grizedale Valley at Force Falls. Graythwaite is situated at the Southern Eastern corner of Satterthwaite Parish. The hall is closed to the public but the Graythwaite Hall Gardens are open to tourists.  Land Use  The total area of all and types in Satterthwaite in square metres is 29,329.36. The area of domestic buildings incorporating in all the ground space equals 21.31 this leaves 14.65 square metres being non-domestic building use. The large majority of land in Satterthwaite is greenery but the area of road accumulates to 452.82, large public footpaths are also throughout Satterthwaite and contributing to 3.86 square metres.

History 'The Functional Imaging Laboratory (FIL)', was founded in 1994 following a major grant award from the Wellcome Trust. This provided for a new building, capital equipment and core staff support. The award enabled a core group of scientists, based at the Medical Research Council Cyclotron Unit, at the Hammersmith Hospital to relocate their activity to a central London site, within UCL. In 1994 the principal neuroimaging research tool was positron emission tomography (PET). Over the next decade functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) became the primary investigative tool of the FIL, leading to PET decommissioning in 2004. Currently, the investigative tools of the laboratory include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) magneto- encephalography (MEG) and electro-encephalography (EEG).

They were conceived in 1966 by Dave Forney as a solution to the problem of finding a code that has both exponentially decreasing error probability with increasing block length and polynomial-time decoding complexity. Concatenated codes became widely used in space communications in the 1970s. Background The field of channel coding is concerned with sending a stream of data at the highest possible rate over a given communications channel, and then decoding the original data reliably at the receiver, using encoding and decoding algorithms that are feasible to implement in a given technology. Shannon's channel coding theorem shows that over many common channels there exist channel coding schemes that are able to transmit data reliably at all rates R less than a certain threshold C, called the channel capacity of the given channel. In fact, the probability of decoding error can be made to decrease exponentially as the block length N of the coding scheme goes to infinity. However, the complexity of a naive optimum decoding scheme that simply computes the likelihood of every possible transmitted codeword increases exponentially with N, so such an optimum decoder rapidly becomes infeasible. In his doctoral thesis, Dave Forney showed that concatenated codes could be used to achieve exponentially decreasing error probabilities at all data rates less than capacity, with decoding complexity that increases only polynomially with the code block length. Description Schematic depiction of a concatenated code built upon an inner code and an outer code. This is a pictorial representation of a code concatenation, and, in particular, the Reed‚ÄìSolomon code with n=q=4 and k=2 is used as the outer code and the Hadamard code with n=q and k=log q is used as the inner code. Overall, the concatenated code is a [q^2,k \\\\log q]-code. Let Cin be a [n, k, d] code, that is, a block code of length n, dimension k, minimum Hamming distance d, and rate r = k/n, over an alphabet A: :C_{in}: A^k \\\\rightarrow A^n Let Cout be a [N, K, D] code over an alphabet B with |B= |A|k symbols: :C_{out}: B^K \\\\rightarrow B^N The inner code Cin takes one of |A|k = |Bpossible inputs, encodes into an n-tuple over A, transmits, and decodes into one of |Bpossible outputs. We regard this as a (super) channel which can transmit one symbol from the alphabet B. We use this channel N times to transmit each of the N symbols in a codeword of Cout. The concatenation of Cout (as outer code) with Cin (as inner code), denoted Cout‚àòCin, is thus a code of length Nn over the alphabet A: :C_{out} \\\\circ C_{in}: A^{kK} \\\\rightarrow A^{nN} It maps each input message m = (m1, m2, ..., mK) to a codeword (Cin(m'1), Cin(m'2), ..., Cin(m'N)), where (m'1, m'2, ..., m'N) = Cout(m1, m2, ..., mK). The key insight in this approach is that if Cin is decoded using a maximum-likelihood approach (thus showing an exponentially decreasing error probability with increasing length), and Cout is a code with length N = 2nr that can be decoded in polynomial time of N, then the concatenated code can be decoded in polynomial time of its combined length n2nr = O(N‚ãÖlog(N)) and shows an exponentially decreasing error probability, even if Cin has exponential decoding complexity. This is discussed in more detail in section Decoding concatenated codes. In a generalization of above concatenation, there are N possible inner codes Cin,i and the i-th symbol in a codeword of Cout is transmitted across the inner channel using the i-th inner code. The Justesen codes are examples of generalized concatenated codes, where the outer code is a Reed‚ÄìSolomon code. Properties 1\\\\. The distance of the concatenated code Cout‚àòCin is at least dD, that is, it is a [nN, kK, D'] code with D' ‚â• dD. Proof: Consider two different messages m1 ‚â† m2 ‚àà BK. Let Œî denote the distance between two codewords. Then :\\\\Delta(C_{out}(m^1), C_{out}(m^2)) \\\\ge D. Thus, there are at least D positions in which the sequence of N symbols of the codewords Cout(m1) and Cout(m2) differ. For these positions, denoted i, we have :\\\\Delta(C_{in}(C_{out}(m^1)_i), C_{in}(C_{out}(m^2)_i)) \\\\ge d. Consequently, there are at least d‚ãÖD positions in the sequence of n‚ãÖN symbols taken from the alphabet A in which the two codewords differ, and hence :\\\\Delta(C_{in}(C_{out}(m^1)), C_{in}(C_{out}(m^2))) \\\\ge dD. 2\\\\. If Cout and Cin are linear block codes, then Cout‚àòCin is also a linear block code. This property can be easily shown based on the idea of defining a generator matrix for the concatenated code in terms of the generator matrices of Cout and Cin. Decoding concatenated codes A natural concept for a decoding algorithm for concatenated codes is to first decode the inner code and then the outer code. For the algorithm to be practical it must be polynomial-time in the final block length. Consider that there is a polynomial-time unique decoding algorithm for the outer code. Now we have to find a polynomial-time decoding algorithm for the inner code. It is understood that polynomial running time here means that running time is polynomial in the final block length. The main idea is that if the inner block length is selected to be logarithmic in the size of the outer code then the decoding algorithm for the inner code may run in exponential time of the inner block length, and we can thus use an exponential-time but optimal maximum likelihood decoder (MLD) for the inner code. In detail, let the input to the decoder be the vector y = (y1, ..., yN) ‚àà (An)N. Then the decoding algorithm is a two-step process: # Use the MLD of the inner code Cin to reconstruct a set of inner code words y' = (y'1, ..., y'N), with y'i = MLDCin(yi), 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ N. # Run the unique decoding algorithm for Cout on y'. Now, the time complexity of the first step is O(N‚ãÖexp(n)), where n = O(log(N)) is the inner block length. In other words, it is NO(1) (i.e., polynomial-time) in terms of the outer block length N. As the outer decoding algorithm in step two is assumed to run in polynomial time the complexity of the overall decoding algorithm is polynomial-time as well. Remarks The decoding algorithm described above can be used to correct all errors up to less than dD/4 in number. Using minimum distance decoding, the outer decoder can correct all inputs y' with less than D/2 symbols y'i in error. Similarly, the inner code can reliably correct an input yi if less than d/2 inner symbols are erroneous. Thus, for an outer symbol y'i to be incorrect after inner decoding at least d/2 inner symbols must have been in error, and for the outer code to fail this must have happened for at least D/2 outer symbols. Consequently, the total number of inner symbols that must be received incorrectly for the concatenated code to fail must be at least d/2‚ãÖD/2 = dD/4. The algorithm also works if the inner codes are different, e.g., for Justesen codes. The generalized minimum distance algorithm, developed by Forney, can be used to correct up to dD/2 errors. It uses erasure information from the inner code to improve performance of the outer code, and was the first example of an algorithm using soft-decision decoding. Applications Although a simple concatenation scheme was implemented already for the 1971 Mariner Mars orbiter mission, concatenated codes were starting to be regularly used for deep space communication with the Voyager program, which launched two space probes in 1977.K. Andrews et al., The Development of Turbo and LDPC Codes for Deep-Space Applications, Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 95, No. 11, Nov. 2007. Since then, concatenated codes became the workhorse for efficient error correction coding, and stayed so at least until the invention of turbo codes and LDPC codes. Typically, the inner code is not a block code but a soft-decision convolutional Viterbi-decoded code with a short constraint length. For the outer code, a longer hard-decision block code, frequently a Reed-Solomon code with eight-bit symbols, is used. The larger symbol size makes the outer code more robust to error bursts that can occur due to channel impairments, and also because erroneous output of the convolutional code itself is bursty. An interleaving layer is usually added between the two codes to spread error bursts across a wider range. The combination of an inner Viterbi convolutional code with an outer Reed‚ÄìSolomon code (known as an RSV code) was first used in Voyager 2,R. Ludwig, J. Taylor, Voyager Telecommunications Manual, JPL DESCANSO (Design and Performance Summary Series), March 2002. and it became a popular construction both within and outside of the space sector. It is still notably used today for satellite communications, such as the DVB-S digital television broadcast standard.Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Framing structure, channel coding and modulation for 11/12 GHz satellite services, ETSI EN 300 421, V1.1.2, August 1997. In a looser sense, any (serial) combination of two or more codes may be referred to as a concatenated code. For example, within the DVB-S2 standard, a highly efficient LDPC code is combined with an algebraic outer code in order to remove any resilient errors left over from the inner LDPC code due to its inherent error floor.Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Second generation framing structure, channel coding and modulation systems for Broadcasting, Interactive Services, News Gathering and other broadband satellite applications (DVB-S2), ETSI EN 302 307, V1.2.1, April 2009. A simple concatenation scheme is also used on the compact disc (CD), where an interleaving layer between two Reed‚ÄìSolomon codes of different sizes spreads errors across various blocks.  Turbo codes: A parallel concatenation approach  The description above is given for what is now called a serially concatenated code. Turbo codes, as described first in 1993, implemented a parallel concatenation of two convolutional codes, with an interleaver between the two codes and an iterative decoder that passes information forth and back between the codes. This design has a better performance than any previously conceived concatenated codes. However, a key aspect of turbo codes is their iterated decoding approach. Iterated decoding is now also applied to serial concatenations in order to achieve higher coding gains, such as within serially concatenated convolutional codes (SCCCs). An early form of iterated decoding was implemented with two to five iterations in the \\"Galileo code\\" of the Galileo space probe.

She was the sister of Rosa Taikon. During Taikon's childhood Romani still lived in camps in Sweden, and had to move often, which made it hard for the children to get any school education. Taikon didn't learn how to read and write until she was in her teens. Taikon dedicated her life to improving conditions for Romani people in Sweden and throughout the world. Through her tireless work, debating, writing and talking to Swedish authorities, the Romani were granted the same right to housing and education as all other Swedes. In 1953 the 1914 ban on Romani immigration ended. This led to other Romani seeking refuge in Sweden, and the population, at first less than a thousand people, grew. Taikon tried to convince Swedish authorities that these people were in fact political refugees, since they had been oppressed in their countries. After fruitless efforts to help a group of 47 French Romani gain asylum in Sweden, she decided to change her strategy. The only way to end the prejudices against her people was to address the young, she realized, so she started to write her popular series of children's books about her own childhood, Katitzi (in 1979 a TV- series based on the books was produced). Katarina Taikon died of brain damage after falling into a 13 year long coma, following a cardiac arrest. She has been called the Martin Luther King of Sweden.Taikon, 2015 documentary by Gellert Tamas and Lawen Mohtadi.

They were aided by a number of Finnish volunteers, starting from 6 November 1921. The conflict ended on 21 March 1922 with the Agreements between the governments of Soviet Russia and Finland about the measures of maintenance of the inviolability of the Soviet‚ÄìFinnish border.Text of the Agreement in Russian. Signed in Moscow. Representative of Finland: Charge d'Affaires ad interim Antti Hackzel, representative of RSFSR: Member of the Board of the National Commissariat for Foreign Affairs Yakov Ganetski The conflict is regarded in Finland as one of the heimosodat ‚Äì \\"Kinship Wars\\".  Background  After Finland declared independence from Russia, a number of Finnish nationalists supported the idea of a Greater Finland attained through the annexation of Russian East Karelia. This was seen as an effort to form a unified country for Balto-Finnic tribes, who were regarded as kindred by these activists. The resulting two incursions by Finnish volunteers into Russia, called the Viena and Aunus expeditions, are not considered wars against Russia in Finnish historiography. In Russia, this conflict, as well as the Finnish expeditions into East Karelia and the Petsamo in 1918‚Äì1920, is considered a military intervention and called the First Soviet‚ÄìFinnish War. This period of disagreement and uncertainty about borders was ended with the Treaty of Tartu, where Finland and the Baltic states first recognised the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic as a sovereign state, and established the border between Finland and RSFSR. The motivation for the uprising was East Karelians' year-long experience of the Bolshevik regime ‚Äì not respecting promises of autonomy, food shortages, the will of nationalistic kindred activists to amend the results of the \\"shameful peace\\" of Tartu, and the wish of exiled East Karelians. Finnish kindred activists, notably Jalmari Takkinen, the deputy of Bobi Siv√©n, the bailiff of Repola, had been conducting a campaign in the summer of 1921 in order to rouse the East Karelians to fight against the Bolshevik belligerents of the ongoing Russian Civil War. East Karelian paramilitary units called themselves Karjalan mets√§sissit (English: Forest Guerrillas), and by autumn of 1921 a notable part of White Karelia was under their control.Niinist√∂, Jussi: \\"Heimosotien historia\\", p. 239. SKS 2005 Before the Treaty of Tartu The parishes of Repola, Rebola from 31 August 1918 and Poraj√§rvi, Porosozero from 1919 of the Olonets Governorate Karelian: Aunuksen Kuvernmentti had voted in favor of secession from Bolshevist Russia and had been occupied by Finland later that year. In late 1919 the Russian White Army retreated towards the Finnish border to the Repola-Poraj√§rvi area. The Finnish government led by Juho Vennola decided in February 1920 that Finland should intervene to help the dissidents by diplomatic means. Foreign minister Rudolf Holsti sent a message to his counterpart Georgy Chicherin stating that Finland would disarm the retreating Russian White troops if the Red Army does not occupy the parishes. Agreement was honoured by both parties, although there were minor skirmishes between Finnish troops and the Red Army. These fights led to armistice negotiations in Rajajoki, which ended unsuccessfully after two weeks.Niinist√∂, Jussi: \\"Heimosotien historia\\", p. 216. SKS 2005 There had been uprisings in White Karelia as early as 1920. After British forces left Karelia, Karelian ethnic nationalists arranged a meeting in Ukhta (now Kalevala, Russia) in March‚ÄìApril 1920 where they elected 117 representatives. In the meeting they decided that White Karelia should become an independent nation. Some parishes of Olonets Karelia joined in and the V√§liaikainen toimikunta (Temporary Commission) renamed itself to Karjalan v√§liaikainen hallitus (Temporary Government of Karelia). However, the Red Army suppressed this uprising and in summer 1920 the Temporary Government fled to Finland.Niinist√∂, Jussi: \\"Heimosotien historia\\", p. 225. SKS 2005 In its place, the Karelian Worker's Commune was formed, an autonomous oblast of the RSFSR. During the treaty negotiations, Finland proposed a referendum in East Karelia, through which its residents could choose whether they wanted to join Finland or Soviet Russia. Due to opposition from Russia, Finland had to withdraw the initiative. In return of ceding Repola and Poraj√§rvi back to Russia, Finland acquired Petsamo and a promise of cultural autonomy for East Karelia.Ed. Hakala, Matti: Suomalainen tietosanakirja 3 (HIL-KANAN), p. 297-298. Espoo: Weilin+G√∂√∂s, 1990. However this cultural autonomy was poorly carried out. Preparations Following the signing of the treaty, irredentists of the Repola county devised a contingency plan with the silent approval of the Finnish ministry of foreign affairs, titled Karhunpes√§suunnitelma (Project Bear's Den). They acquired a shipment of 500 Japanese rifles and 100 000 cartridges from Elmo Kaila, one of the J√§ger Movement leaders. They also had two Maxim machine guns and four Lewis Guns. Weapons shipments for Project Bear's Den were an open secret and overlooked by Finnish customs officials. On 6 January 1921 an aide of the Finnish minister of foreign affairs Rudolf Holsti demanded an official account for the weapons. Eventually, the leader of the Repola irredentists, Bobi Siv√©n, received a letter from the Finnish foreign ministry stating: \\"Due to extraordinary circumstances you must do your utmost to prevent the people of Repola and Poraj√§rvi from arming themselves.\\" On 12 January Siv√©n committed suicide with his service pistol. In several suicide letters he left behind, he expressed his resentment at Finland \\"betraying\\" the East Karelians, and his wish to rather die for East Karelians than return to Finland. He had answered earlier requests from Finnish government to return to Finland by stating he resigns from his bailiff office, and prefers to live as a civilian in Repola. Due to succeeding events Siv√©n was elevated to a status of a minor Finnic national hero and martyr akin to Eugen Schauman, whose method of suicide he also imitated either on purpose or coincidentally, shooting himself in the heart instead of head in addition to the similar nationalistic pathos letters. Gradually these early uprisings and Finnish government's interest in supporting them dwindled.Niinist√∂, Jussi: Bobi Siv√©n - Karjalan puolesta, p. 9‚Äì280. Helsinki: Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura, 2001.  The uprising  The pivotal moment in the uprising was the council meeting of Karelian Forest Guerrillas in mid-October 1921. It voted in favor of secession from Soviet Russia. The key leadership was formed by military leaders Jalmari Takkinen, Finnish-born, aka. Ilmarinen, and Ossippa Borissainen. Particularly Vaseli Levonen aka. Ukki V√§in√§m√∂inen, who had prominent Karelian features and general resemblance to the Finnish mythical character, was deemed suitable for his role as an ideological leader. Some 550 Finnish volunteers joined the uprising, acting mostly as officers and squad leaders. Most famous of them was Paavo Talvela and Erik Heinrichs of the J√§ger Movement, who later served as high ranking staff officer in the Winter War and Continuation War. The uprising is a peculiarity among heimosodat as this time the initiative was not taken by Finnish insurgents, but by East Karelian separatists, and Finnish government remaining officially passive. After the treaty of Tartu and Finnish government retreating from covert separatist support, the uprising was started by East Karelians, with Finnish volunteers joining afterwards.Niinist√∂, Jussi: \\"Heimosotien historia\\", p. 260. SKS 2005 The uprising began with the immediate summary execution of anyone who was or was suspected to be a Bolshevik. The uprising escalated into a military engagement in October‚ÄìNovember 1921. The 2 500 Forest Guerrillas were initially fairly successful, despite their lack of proper equipment.Niinist√∂, Jussi: \\"Heimosotien historia\\", p. 244. SKS 2005 The East Karelian rebels got some publicity in international media, but they had expected Finland to intervene with its defence forces. However, the Finnish government denied requests of arranging official enlistment, but it did not prevent private Finnish volunteer activists from crossing the border. Finland did agree to send humanitarian aid to the East Karelian rebels, taking the risk of provoking a war with the RSFSR.Niinist√∂, Jussi: Heimosotien historia, p. 250. SKS 2005 (translation: \\"Although official Finland did not support the rebels, there was a risk that the war could extend.\\") Soviet historians, however, stipulated that the Finnish government did support the uprising in a military manner, and was intervening in an internal conflict.Shirokorad Alexander: Finland ‚Äì Russia. Three unknown wars, p.63 In Northern White Karelia the smaller Vienan Rykmentti (Viena Regiment) was formed. Combined, the East Karelian rebels numbered 2 500. On 6 November 1921 the Finnish and Karelian forces began a new incursion into East Karelia. According to Finnish historians, on that day Karelian guerrillas and Finnish volunteer forces attacked in Rukaj√§rvi. Russian historian Alexander Shirokorad claims this force was 5 000‚Äì6 000 strong, which is twice the total strength of East Karelians and Finnish volunteers combined according to Finnish records.Shirokorad, Alexander p.63\\" The first Finnish volunteers reached Repola at the end of November 1921. The volunteers acted as private citizens and were not considered a government intervention by Finland, but the Russian view differed. This controversy caused considerable friction in diplomatic relations between Finland and RSFSR. Most of the volunteers joined the Repolan Pataljoona (Repola Battalion). Command of the Battalion in Olonets Karelia was first taken by Gustaf Svinhufvud and thereafter by Talvela, at the middle of December 1921.Niinist√∂, Jussi: \\"Heimosotien historia\\", p. 248. SKS 2005 By the end of December 1921, the Finnish volunteers and Karelian Forest Guerrillas had advanced to the Kiestinki Suomussalmi ‚Äì Rukaj√§rvi ‚Äì Paatene ‚Äì Poraj√§rvi lines. Meanwhile, the ca. 20 000 troops of the Red Army led by Alexander Sedyakin Sedyakin's biography on the Hronos project. have reached Karelia and mounted a counterattack. The Red Army also had Red Finns within its ranks. These Finns had emigrated to Soviet Russia after their defeat in the Finnish Civil War. One such unit was a ski battalion of 200 Red military school cadets under the command of Toivo Antikainen.Niinist√∂, Jussi: \\"Heimosotien historia\\". SKS 2005  Defeat of the uprising  Finnish support of the uprising with volunteers and humanitarian aid caused a notable regression on Finnish-Russian diplomatic relations. Leon Trotsky, the commander of the Red Army, announced that he was ready to march towards Helsinki and Soviet Russian troops would strike the East Karelian rebels with an army of 20,000 via the Murmansk railway.Niinist√∂, Jussi: \\"Heimosotien historia\\", sivu 250. SKS 2005 At the onset of winter, the resistance of Forest Guerrillas collapsed under superior numbers of the Red Army, famine, and freezing cold. The rebels panicked, and their troops started to retreat towards the Finnish border. According to Shirokorad, the troops of the Red Army had crushed the main group of the Finnish and Karelian troops by the beginning of January 1922 and had retaken Porosozero and Reboly. On 25 January the northern group of the Soviet troops had occupied Kestenga and Kokkosalmi, and by the beginning of February occupied the settlement Ukhta.Shirokorad Alexander: Finland ‚Äì Russia. Three unknown wars, p.64 During the final stages of the uprising, the Red \\"Pork mutiny\\" occurred in Finland, sparking a hope among the rebels and Finnish volunteers that this would cause the Finnish government to intervene and provide military aid to the insurgents. This did not happen; on the contrary, the minister of interior, Heikki Ritavuori, tightened border control, closed the border preventing food and munitions shipments, and prohibited volunteers to cross over to join the uprising. The assassination of Ritavuori on February 12, 1922, by a Finnish nationalist activist did not change the situation. The last unit of the uprising, remnants of Viena Regiment, fled Tiirovaara on 16 February 1922, at 10:45 am and reached the border at 1 pm.Niinist√∂, Jussi: \\"Heimosotien historia\\", p.260. SKS 2005 Aftermath On 1 June 1922, in Helsinki, Finland and Soviet Russia signed an Agreement between RSFSR and Finland about the measures providing the inviolability of the Soviet‚ÄìFinnish border.

Representatives of Finland: Antti Ahonen, Paavo Hunninen etc; representatives of the RSFSR: S.M.Frankfurt, A.M.Smirnov etc. Both parties agreed to reduce the number of border guards and to keep those who do not reside permanently in the border zone from freely crossing the border from either side to the other.Blomstedt, Yrj√∂ et al.

Read 8.11. 2006 The Karelian Worker's Commune was renamed into the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1923, and its autonomy was further expanded. However the cultural autonomy practically ended in 1933 - 1935 when the √©migr√© Finnish leaders Edvard Gylling and Kustaa Rovio were purged and teaching of Finnish language was prohibited. Gylling had promoted the adoption of Finnish rather than Karelian within the KASSR as he and the other √©migr√© Finns who dominated the leadership of Karelia before 1935 did not consider Karelian to be anything more than a rustic dialect of Finnish. It may also be argued they held the same view of the essential unity of the Karelians and Finns as one Finnic people as their nationalist counterparts, and also wished that they be unified (albeit in rather different political circumstances).

Its aim is to raise awareness about the social and economic problems faced by Jats. The Jat Mahasabha spearheaded the community's struggle for reservation in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections in 1999. Chaudhary Dara Singh was the president. After paying rich tribute to the departed soul, the member of the mahasabha nominated the prominent patron Ch Ajay Singh (diplomat) (Former Central Minister and Ex High Commissioner Fiji). The Mahasabha became a forum for demanding employment and airing Jat grievances over their poor representation in government service. Rongha jatt a great Jat Muslim tribe migrated from East Punjab after 1857's war of Independence and settled in different areas of Western & southren Punjab and some areas of Sindh also. (now in Pakistan) basically they were landlords (zamindar). But now a day's they are educated and are serving as government officials in different departments of Pakistan specially Khanewal city of Punjab. Rongha Jatt are the pioneers of Jatt Muslims .They were the first Muslim Jatt in This land.Rongha jatt people fought against khilji empire.Originally the were Mewari force. After that they became known as Rongha Jatt tribe. The Rongha Mewari was the forefather of this tribe. As with the time they became to know by their forefathers name Rongha.  Objectives of formation  According to Nonica Datta, Jat Mahasabha was Arya Samaj's offshoot, which was founded in 1905 in Muzaffarnagar. But Brij Kishore Sharma states that the claims of Datta are incorrect. According to him, it was founded in 1907, and that there are two claims regarding its place of formation. He notes that some sources support the Muzaffarnagar claim, but the Chhatri Jat journal states that it was founded at a fair in Garhmukteshwar, Uttar Pradesh. The Mahasabha, a supra-provincial organization, was perceived in southeast Punjab as a symbol of unity in Jat society and as the main catalyst of reform and change. The Jat Mahasabha is a nonpolitical organization in nature. It is a social organisation. It is organised by a community for its uplift, for social reconstruction. The Jat Mahasabha has been functioning from 1993 for social causes. But it is not a registered body, not even as an NGO or social organisation.Gyan Prakash Pilania as head of the Jat Mahasabha Sir Chhotu Ram explained its objectives as under: \\"slowly the Jat Kshatriya Sabha in Jamna- par Western Uttar Pradesh came into existence which had its impact in Haryana. This was followed by the formation of panchayats. It breathed a new spirit into the Jat community. In this period, only the Arya Samaj propagated its rules in Haryana and the Jats were greatly influenced by it. This movement was consolidated through its leaders. It led to an awakening among the Jats. The Jat school was opened, the Jat Mahasabha was created and the Jat Gazette was started. Earlier the Jats were all fragmented, but now they were brought together. They began to perceive all their institutions as exclusively Jat. The Jats became conscious of their sense of unity.\\" The Jat Mahasabha was initially founded as All India Jat Kshatriya Mahasabha. The founder members were Chaudhary Mamraj Singh Shamli (Muzaffarnagar), Kunwar Kalyan Singh Varkatpur (Bulandshahr), Thakur Tej Singh Vahpur (Bulandshahr), Chaudhary Hari Singh Kurmali (Muzaffarnagar), Shri Ram Lal Hala ,shri mehtab singh (aligarh)Raghunathpur (Badayun), Shri Nathu Singh Pardeshi,{Sapanch} Sardar Ghulam Sarwar Rongha[(Haryana)],Kunwar Hukum Singh (Mathura), Shri Lal Singh and Shri Vahal Singh (Saidpur), Chaudhary Gulab Singh Yadnagar, Chaudhary Nanu Singh Delhi, Shri Shadi Ram editor 'Kshatriya' and Sir Chhotu Ram (Rohtak). Kunwar Hukum Singh (Mathura) took pains to bring all the elite people of the society such as Jagirdars, Thikanedars, Raos, Rais, Rai Bahadurs at one platform. Later large number of common people from society joined it. Branches were started at Baghpat, Agra, Aligarh, Bijnor, Muradabad, Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Mathura etc. in Uttar Pradesh and Sikar, Ajmer, Multan, Jhunjhunu, Jodhpur etc. places in Rajasthan. Kunwar Hukum Singh Angai (Mathura) expanded its scope from Brij area to All India in character. The first Executive Committee of All India Jat Mahasabha was constituted on 14 March 1907 in Meerut on the occasion of Nauchandi Mela.Leaders of Rongha Jutt students also participated on this occasion.Ahmed Ali Rongha Jat of Multan was an active leader of student federation .  Annual adhiveshanas from 1908 to 1924  The All India Jat Mahasabha held its annual adhiveshan (Conference) at Delhi in 1908, Meerut in 1909, Garhmukteshwar in 1910, Delhi in 1911, Gwalior in 1912, Rohtak in 1913, Bharatpur in 1914, Pushkar in 1915, Meerut in 1916, Dhaulpur in 1917, Gwalior in 1918. Rana Udaybhanu Singh, the rule Maharaj r of Dholpur, was the Chairman of the 1918 adhiveshan. Earlier Sir Chhotu Ram had started a newspaper named Jat Gazette in 1916 which became very popular among the farmers of northern India. Sir Chhotu Ram was awarded the title of 'Rao Bahadur' and he founded 'Zamindar Association' to protect the interests of farmers. From 1918 to 1924, the annual adhiveshans were held at various places. Decisions were taken regarding social uplift, avoiding extravaganza, and opening new schools and hostels to spread education amongst masses. Sir Chhotu Ram was appointed Agricultural Minister in Punjab Government in 1924. He had also started the freedom movement against British Rule in India.  Pushkar adhiveshan in November 1925  The Pushkar adhiveshan in November 1925, organized by All India Jat Mahasabha, was presided over by Maharaja Kishan Singh of Bharatpur and proved to be a turning point in mobilization of Jats in India. Sir Chhotu Ram, Madan Mohan Malviya, Chhajju Ram, etc. farmer leaders attended. This function was organized with the initiative of Master Bhajan Lal Bijarnia of Ajmer-Merwara. The farmers from all parts of Shekhawati had come namely, Chaudhary Govind Ram, Kunwar Panne Singh Deorod, am Singh Bakhtawarpura, Chetram Bhadarwasi, Bhuda Ram Sangasi, and Moti Ram Kotri. 24-year-old Har Lal Singh also attended it. The Shekhawati farmers took two oaths in Pushkar namely, # They would work for the development of the society through elimination of social evils and spreading of education. # ‚ÄòDo or Die‚Äô in the matters of exploitation of farmers by the Jagirdars. # Resolution was passed to remove the British rule from India.

Held at Tishazari ground in Delhi, it was attended by people from various religions.  The Jat Prajapati Maha-Yajna 1934  In 1934, to spread the principles of Arya Samaj and create awakening in Shekhawati, it was decided to hold the Prajapati Yajna (Prayer ceremony for the Lord of Universe). The Jat Prajapati Maha-Yajna took place at Sikar 20‚Äì29 January 1934. Kunwar Hukam Singh Rahees Angai (Mathura) was made Yajnapati (chairman) of the Yajna. Chaudhary Kaluram of village Kudan was the Yajnaman. Acharya Shri Jagdev Sidhanthi received an invitation for this Yajna at his Gurukul at Kirttal. In that invitation he was requested to attend the Yajna and bring 20 Bhramcharis and disciples with him. Volunteers went to all the households in all the villages in the region and collected material that would be needed. They collected ghee, flour, and gur and invited all the householders to participate. Hundreds of cans of ghee and hundreds of sacks of flour were collected. During the Yajna 3,000 men and women adopted the Yogyopavit, which was a symbol of \\"Kisan sangathan\\" (farmers' organization). Sheetal Kumari daughter of Kunwar Netram Singh adopted yagyopavit. Chaudhary Chimana Ram of Sangasi brought his wife wearing salwar- kurta. The unity of Jat farmers in this Yajna had terrified the Jagirdars of Sikar. The role played by Sardar Har Lal Singh and Thakur Deshraj was unparallel which made this Yajna a grand success. In December 1934, ‚ÄòAll India Jat Students Federation Conference‚Äô was organized at Pilani; the coordinator of it was Master Ratan Singh. Sir Chhotu Ram, Kunwar Netram Singh, Chaudhary Ram Singh, Thakur Jhumman Singh, Thakur Deshraj and Sardar Har Lal Singh, along with large number of farmers from various states, attended it. This conference gave a great strength to the Jat youth.  Centenary celebrations 2007  The All-India Jat Mahasabha held a convention at Talkatora Stadium in Delhi on 9 March 2007 under the chairmanship of its president, Dara Singh. One of the main issues taken up at the convention, which was attended by several Central and State Ministers and MPs, was reservation for the Jats in State and Central Government jobs. The convention also discussed social evils like female foeticide, dowry and drug abuse. 2007 was celebrated as the organisation's centenary year.Jat Mahasabha convention on 9 March 2007Yahoo Hindi News In 2013 Ch.Ajay Singh former Union Minister and former High Commissioner elected as President of All India Jat Mahasabha.

At the meeting, speakers recalled his yeoman's contribution to the Mahasabha in various capacities and termed his death as a great loss for the community as well as the nation. Ch Dara Singh breathed his last at Mumbai on 12 July 2012 after a brief illness. After paying rich tributes to the departed soul, the meeting unanimously nominated Shri Ajay Singh as convener to convene a Jat Mahasabha Mahapanchayat to elect its next president. This task was entrusted to Ch Ajay Singh as the lone as well as senior most surviving Patron of the Akhil Bhartiya Jat Mahasabha. Those present recalled how he had performed a similar task when he convened the Jat mahapanchayat on 14 September 1998 at the lawns of the Vitthal Bhai Patel House at Rafi Marg, New Delhi in which Ch Dara Singh was unanimously elected the President. In 1998 Shri Ajay Singh played an important role by leading a delegation to Mumbai to bring Ch Dara Singh to the Mahapanchayat. Shri Baldev Sihag (Former OSD to Ch Devilal), Shri Dharampal Sirohi (Eminent Journalist), Shri Dharamraj Panwar and Ch Amarpal Singh (Political/Social activists) and Shri Yadunath Singh(Former Deputy Speaker, Rajasthan) were part of the delegation led by Shri Ajay Singh to Mumbai on this occasion.

Singh (senior most Jat military officer), Ch Ajay Singh (Former Union Minister) and Shri Chhetilal Verma (Founder Chairman Continental Construction Limited) were nominated as Patrons in Mahasabha. Past mahasabha president Shri Vishvendra Singh, Shri Kamlesh Bharti (Vrindavan) were also later included as Patrons. The next historic Akhil Bhartiya Jat mahapanchayat was held on 30 March 2013 at the Mavalankar Hall in Vitthalbhai Patel House at Rafi Marg New Delhi. This was adjacent to the lawns where earlier historic Akhil Bharatiya Jat Maha Sammelan held in 1998. The mahapanchayat was presided over by Shri Balram Jakhar former Speaker of the Lok Sabha. During the mahapanchayat a number of prominent leaders spoke about the need for unity amongst the Jat Community. After extensive deliberations Shri Balram Jakhar presiding over the Mahasabha proposed Ch Ajay Singh's name for president recalling Shri Ajay Singh's late father, Captain Bhagwan Singh's work as the president (1979 to 1991) of the mahasabha in reviving the organisation which had been defunct since the death of Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh in 1979. Dr Aryaveer addressing the Mahasabha He recalled how Captain Bhagwan Singh had toured the country spreading the Mahasabha from Jammu to Andhra Pradesh to bring Jats from all over country into the mahasabha folds. While seconding the proposals of Shri Ajay Singh's name Shri K Natwar Singh recalled great literary work done by the mahasabha under Capt Bhagwan Singh, particularly in historical research on Jats. He hoped Shri Ajay Singh as a veteran journalist and eminent editor would carry forward this legacy. Then Chief Minister of Haryana Shri Bhupinder Singh Hooda and others also seconded the proposal. Professor Zile Singh Rana who conducted the program asked for the vote and Ajay Singh was unanimously elected as the President of All India Jat Maha Sabha with the raising of hands, beating of Nagada, slogans and showers of flowers and garlands.

Dr Balaram Jakher along with all the leaders present on the dais blessed Ajay Singh as president and wished him well. Dr Jakhar said that he had placed this turban on behalf of the community and hoped that Singh will follow his late father's footsteps in the service to the community. He also added that since Ajay's late father had been close friend ‚Äúlike a brother‚Äù and added, ‚Äúif Ajay Singh fails to perform his duties towards the community, have right to correct him!‚Äù Ch Ajay Singh seeking blessings from Shri Balram Jakhar after being elected as the president of mahasabha The convention was addressed by Shri K Natwar Singh (former External Affair Minister), Shri Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Manpreet Singh Badal (Former Finance Minister, Punjab State and President of People's Party of Punjab), Smt Kiran Chaudhary (Former Minister Haryana), Smt Chandrawati (Former President Akhil Bhartiya Mahila Jat Mahasabha and former Lt.

Overview CABI is an international not-for-profit organisation. Their work is delivered through teams of CABI scientists and key partners working in over 40 countries across the world. CABI states its mission as \\"improving people‚Äôs lives worldwide by solving problems in agriculture and the environment\\". These problems include loss of crops caused by pests and diseases, invasive weeds and pests that damage farm production and biodiversity, and lack of global access to scientific research. Funding CABI states that only 3% of its revenue comes from core funding. Donors listed in the company's 2014 financial report include the UK's Department for International Development (¬£4,962k), the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (CHF 972k), the European Union (‚Ç¨3,242k) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (US$570k). A not-insignificant portion of CABI's revenue is made up of member country contributions. Projects CABI engages in a variety of projects that address agricultural and environmental issues worldwide. Typically these focus on commodity crops, invasive species, and scientific communication. Invasive Species CABI hosts a large number of invasive species-related projects that it is currently planning to bring under one banner. Many of these projects don't focus on a particular area, but on specific species. Notable projects include research into invasive plants including Japanese Knotweed, Giant Hogweed and Himalayan Balsam. Plantwise Plantwise is a global programme with the purpose of reducing crop losses and improving food security by collecting and sharing information about plant health. Plantwise is supported by an alliance of international partners, who typically provide content or funding. Microbial services CABI housed a collection of over 28,000 fungi samples from around the world to carry out microbial identification, preservations, patenting, training and consultancy from their offices and labs in Egham, England. In 2009, these were merged with the collection at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. This move was supported by a ¬£250,000 grant from the UK government. Notable people Professor Ruth Oriango'o who is a leading nutritionist from Kenya sits on the board (in 2020).

His 1968 novel, Once An Eagle, written at the peak of the Vietnam War, is required reading for all Marines and is frequently used in leadership training at West Point. The novel, considered a classic of military literature and a guide to honorable conduct in the profession of arms, has been compared favorably to Leo Tolstoy's magnum opus War and Peace. Eight years after publication, Once an Eagle was made into a television mini-series starring Sam Elliott. Glenn Ford played a supporting character. Myrer wrote eight other novels, of which The Big War (1957) was adapted for a movie in 1958 and The Last Convertible (1978) was made into a television mini-series in 1979. Once An Eagle (1968) and The Last Convertible (1978) became international best-sellers and were translated in 19 languages. The United States Army War College Foundation celebrates October 14 every year as Anton Myrer Army Leader Day to discuss leadership issues at the strategic level. This day serves as the capstone event for the U.S. Army War College's strategic leadership course. The United States Army War College also presents an award called the Anton Myrer Strategic leadership Writing Award annually on graduation day. Early years and military service Gen. Peter Chiarelli speaking with Army War College students on the 2009 Anton Myrer Army Leader Day. Born in Worcester, Massachusetts, on November 3, 1922, to Raymond Lewis and Angele E. Myrer, Myrer grew up in Boston, graduating from Boston Latin High School in 1940. He prepared at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire before entering Harvard College in September 1941 with the Class of 1945. Myrer's studies were interrupted, however, after the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. Soon after the attack, he, like many of his college peers, sought to enroll in the Army Reserve but was rejected. In 1942, he enlisted and was accepted by the United States Marine Corps. Myrer participated in the Battle of Guam and the occupation of the remaining Mariana Islands afterwards. He was wounded in Guam and was promoted to the rank of corporal before being discharged in 1946. Education, marriage, and writing Myrer returned to Harvard and graduated magna cum laude with an A.B. in May 1947, two years after his original classmates. In August 1947, he married artist Judith Rothschild and relocated to Rosemead, California. Random House published his first novel, Evil Under the Sun in 1951. To support his family, Myrer continued to work a number of low-paying, unskilled jobs. In 1957, his novel The Big War, published by Appleton-Century-Crofts, was financially and critically successful, resulting in the 1958 film screenplay he wrote with Edward Anhalt re-titled In Love and War, starring Robert Wagner and Bradford Dillman. In 1960, the Myrers moved back to the Northeast to a country home in Saugerties, New York, and a summer home on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Little, Brown published The Violent Shore (1962) and The Intruder: A Novel of Boston (1965). Myrer's most successful novel, Once An Eagle, was published in 1968 by Holt, Rinehart and Winston, during the Vietnam War. He separated from his wife and divorced her in 1970. Soon afterward he married Patricia Schartle (May 21, 1923 ‚Äì June 26, 2010). Myrer wrote three more novels: The Tiger Waits (1973 published by Norton); The Last Convertible (1978, published by Putnam); and A Green Desire in (1981, also published by Putnam). Anton Myrer died on January 19, 1996, of leukemia at the age of 73. He was survived by his widow. The couple had no children. On February 20, 1996, Patricia Myrer wrote a letter to her close friend, popular Chicago radio personality Art Hellyer, informing him that Anton had suffered from acute leukemia for nine months prior to his death and had been in isolation in a local hospital. She thanked Art Hellyer for the mix tapes that he had sent and said that Anton had died in her arms. On the receipt of Patricia Myrer's letter, Art Hellyer dedicated a four-hour radio show to Anton Myrer. In March 1997, Anton's widow, Patricia, donated $25,000 to the New York Society Library in memory of her husband who had received books from the library by mail at his home in Saugerties in upstate New York. The donation was used to purchase and preserve quality fiction published until the death of Henry James (1916), and serious literary criticism. A special book-plate was designed to be placed in all volumes bought or rebound from the donated funds. Patricia Myrer also donated case leather-bound volumes of six of his eight novels to the library. In 1997, Patricia Myrer donated funds to the United States Army War College Foundation and the republication rights to her husband's novel Once An Eagle. The Army War College reprinted the book with citations from the Army War College commandant, Maj. Gen. Robert H. Scales; General John William Vessey, Jr.; and the US Marine Corps commandant General Charles C. Krulak. The book has remained in print ever since and is required reading at the United States Army War College. In Anton Myrer's honor, the Department of Command, Leadership, and Management of the U.S. Army War College held its first annual Anton Myrer Leadership Symposium at Carlisle Barracks over three days January 26‚Äì28, 1999. The department also nominated October 14 every year as Anton Myrer Army Leader Day to provide an opportunity for academics, military and corporate leaders, journalists, and other invited guests to focus attention on leadership issues at the strategic level. It serves as the capstone event for the U.S. Army War College's strategic leadership course.

Black bar is 100 nanometers Microvesicles (ectosomes, or microparticles) are a type of extracellular vesicle (EV) that are released from the cell membrane. In multicellular organisms, microvesicles and other EVs are found both in tissues (in the interstitial space between cells) and in many types of body fluids. Delimited by a phospholipid bilayer, microvesicles can be as small as the smallest EVs (30 nm in diameter) or as large as 1000 nm. They are considered to be larger, on average, than intracellularly-generated EVs known as exosomes. Microvesicles play a role in intercellular communication and can transport molecules such as mRNA, miRNA, and proteins between cells. Though initially dismissed as cellular debris, microvesicles may reflect the antigenic content of the cell of origin and have a role in cell signaling. Like other EVs, they been implicated in numerous physiologic processes, including anti-tumor effects, tumor immune suppression, metastasis, tumor- stroma interactions, angiogenesis, and tissue regeneration. Microvesicles may also remove misfolded proteins, cytotoxic agents and metabolic waste from the cell. Changes in microvesicle levels may indicate diseases including cancer. Formation and contents Different cells can release microvesicles from the plasma membrane. Sources of microvesicles include megakaryocytes, blood platelets, monocytes, neutrophils, tumor cells and placenta. Platelets play an important role in maintaining hemostasis: they promote thrombus growth, and thus they prevent loss of blood. Moreover, they enhance immune response, since they express the molecule CD154 (CD40L). Platelets are activated by inflammation, infection, or injury, and after their activation microvesicles containing CD154 are released from platelets. CD154 is a crucial molecule in the development of T cell-dependent humoral immune response. CD154 knockout mice are incapable of producing IgG, IgE, or IgA as a response to antigens. Microvesicles can also transfer prions and molecules CD41 and CXCR4.  Endothelial microparticles  Endothelial microparticles are small vesicles that are released from endothelial cells and can be found circulating in the blood. The microparticle consists of a plasma membrane surrounding a small amount of cytosol. The membrane of the endothelial microparticle contains receptors and other cell surface molecules which enable the identification of the endothelial origin of the microparticle, and allow it to be distinguished from microparticles from other cells, such as platelets. Although circulating endothelial microparticles can be found in the blood of normal individuals, increased numbers of circulating endothelial microparticles have been identified in individuals with certain diseases, including hypertension and cardiovascular disorders, and pre-eclampsia and various forms of vasculitis. The endothelial microparticles in some of these disease states have been shown to have arrays of cell surface molecules reflecting a state of endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, endothelial microparticles may be useful as an indicator or index of the functional state of the endothelium in disease, and may potentially play key roles in the pathogenesis of certain diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. Microparticles are derived from many other cell types. Process of formation The process of the formation of exosomes. 1. Cell undergoes endocytosis forming endocytic vesicles. 2. Endocytic vesicles fuse together forming an early endosome. 3. Endocytic cisterna matures into exocytic multivesicular body, during which membrane invaginations form exosomes. 4.Multivesicular body fuses with the plasma membrane, releasing exosomes into the extracellular space. Microvesicles and exosomes are formed and released by two slightly different mechanisms. These processes result in the release of intercellular signaling vesicles. Microvesicles are small, plasma membrane-derived particles that are released into the extracellular environment by the outward budding and fission of the plasma membrane. This budding process involves multiple signaling pathways including the elevation of intracellular calcium and reorganization of the cell's structural scaffolding. The formation and release of microvesicles involve contractile machinery that draws opposing membranes together before pinching off the membrane connection and launching the vesicle into the extracellular space. Microvesicle budding takes place at unique locations on the cell membrane that are enriched with specific lipids and proteins reflecting their cellular origin. At these locations, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids are selectively incorporated into microvesicles and released into the surrounding environment. Exosomes are membrane-covered vesicles, formed intracellularly are considered to be smaller than 100 nm. In contrast to microvesicles, which are formed through a process of membrane budding, or exocytosis, exosomes are initially formed by endocytosis. Exosomes are formed by invagination within a cell to create an intracellular vesicle called an endosome, or an endocytic vesicle. In general, exosomes are formed by segregating the cargo (e.g., lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids) within the endosome. Once formed, the endosome combines with a structure known as a multivesicular body (MVB). The MVB containing segregated endosomes ultimately fuses with the plasma membrane, resulting in exocytosis of the exosomes. Once formed, both microvesicles and exosomes (collectively called extracellular vesicles) circulate in the extracellular space near the site of release, where they can be taken up by other cells or gradually deteriorate. In addition, some vesicles migrate significant distances by diffusion, ultimately appearing in biological fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine. Mechanism of shedding There are three mechanisms which lead to release of vesicles into the extracellular space. First of these mechanisms is exocytosis from multivesicular bodies and the formation of exosomes. Another mechanism is budding of microvesicles directly from a plasma membrane. And the last one is cell death leading to apoptotic blebbing. These are all energy- requiring processes. Under physiologic conditions, the plasma membrane of cells has an asymmetric distribution of phospholipids. aminophospholipids, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine are specifically sequestered in the inner leaflet of the membrane. The transbilayer lipid distribution is under the control of three phospholipidic pumps: an inward-directed pump, or flippase; an outward-directed pump, or floppase; and a lipid scramblase, responsible for non-specific redistribution of lipids across the membrane. After cell stimulation, including apoptosis, a subsequent cytosolic Ca2+ increase promotes the loss of phospholipid asymmetry of the plasma membrane, subsequent phosphatidylserine exposure, and a transient phospholipidic imbalance between the external leaflet at the expense of the inner leaflet, leading to budding of the plasma membrane and microvesicle release. Molecular contents The lipid and protein content of microvesicles has been analyzed using various biochemical techniques. Microvesicles display a spectrum of enclosed molecules enclosed within the vesicles and their plasma membranes. Both the membrane molecular pattern and the internal contents of the vesicle depend on the cellular origin and the molecular processes triggering their formation. Because microvesicles are not intact cells, they do not contain mitochondria, Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, or a nucleus with its associated DNA. Microvesicle membranes consist mainly of membrane lipids and membrane proteins. Regardless of their cell type of origin, nearly all microvesicles contain proteins involved in membrane transport and fusion. They are surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer composed of several different lipid molecules. The protein content of each microvesicle reflects the origin of the cell from which it was released. For example, those released from antigen- presenting cells (APCs), such as B cells and dendritic cells, are enriched in proteins necessary for adaptive immunity, while microvesicles released from tumors contain proapoptotic molecules and oncogenic receptors (e.g. EGFR). In addition to the proteins specific to the cell type of origin, some proteins are common to most microvesicles. For example, nearly all contain the cytoplasmic proteins tubulin, actin and actin-binding proteins, as well as many proteins involved in signal transduction, cell structure and motility, and transcription. Most microvesicles contain the so-called \\"heat-shock proteins\\" hsp70 and hsp90, which can facilitate interactions with cells of the immune system. Finally, tetraspanin proteins, including CD9, CD37, CD63 and CD81 are one of the most abundant protein families found in microvesicle membranes. Many of these proteins may be involved in the sorting and selection of specific cargos to be loaded into the lumen of the microvesicle or its membrane. Other than lipids and proteins, microvesicles are enriched with nucleic acids (e.g., messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA). The identification of RNA molecules in microvesicles supports the hypothesis that they are a biological vehicle for the transfer of nucleic acids and subsequently modulate the target cell's protein synthesis. Messenger RNA transported from one cell to another through microvesicles can be translated into proteins, conferring new function to the target cell. The discovery that microvesicles may shuttle specific mRNA and miRNA suggests that this may be a new mechanism of genetic exchange between cells. Exosomes produced by cells exposed to oxidative stress can mediate protective signals, reducing oxidative stress in recipient cells, a process which is proposed to depend on exosomal RNA transfer.Eldh M, Ekstr√∂m K, Valadi H, Sj√∂strand M, Olsson B, Jern√•s M, L√∂tvall J. Exosomes Communicate Protective Messages during Oxidative Stress; Possible Role of Exosomal Shuttle RNA. PLoS One. 2010 Dec 17;5(12):e15353. These RNAs are specifically targeted to microvesicles, in some cases containing detectable levels of RNA that is not found in significant amounts in the donor cell. Because the specific proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs in microvesicles are highly variable, it is likely that these molecules are specifically packaged into vesicles using an active sorting mechanism. At this point, it is unclear exactly which mechanisms are involved in packaging soluble proteins and nucleic acids into microvesicles. Role on target cells Once released from their cell of origin, microvesicles interact specifically with cells they recognize by binding to cell-type specific, membrane-bound receptors. Because microvesicles contain a variety of surface molecules, they provide a mechanism for engaging different cell receptors and exchanging material between cells. This interaction ultimately leads to fusion with the target cell and release of the vesicles' components, thereby transferring bioactive molecules, lipids, genetic material, and proteins. The transfer of microvesicle components includes specific mRNAs and proteins, contributing to the proteomic properties of target cells. microvesicles can also transfer miRNAs that are known to regulate gene expression by altering mRNA turnover. Mechanisms of signaling Degradation In some cases, the degradation of microvesicles is necessary for the release of signaling molecules. During microvesicle production, the cell can concentrate and sort the signaling molecules which are released into the extracellular space upon microvesicle degradation. Dendritic cells, macrophage and microglia derived microvesicles contain proinflammatory cytokines and neurons and endothelial cells release growth factors using this mechanism of release. Fusion Proteins on the surface of the microvesicle will interact with specific molecules, such as integrin, on the surface of its target cell. Upon binding, the microvesicle can fuse with the plasma membrane. This results in the delivery of nucleotides and soluble proteins into the cytosol of the target cell as well as the integration of lipids and membrane proteins into its plasma membrane. Internalization Microvesicles can be endocytosed upon binding to their targets, allowing for additional steps of regulation by the target cell. The microvesicle may fuse, integrating lipids and membrane proteins into the endosome while releasing its contents into the cytoplasm. Alternatively, the endosome may mature into a lysosome causing the degradation of the microvesicle and its contents, in which case the signal is ignored. =Transcytosis= After internalization of microvesicle via endocytosis, the endosome may move across the cell and fuse with the plasma membrane, a process called transcytosis. This results in the ejection of the microvesicle back into the extracellular space or may result in the transportation of the microvesicle into a neighboring cell. This mechanism might explain the ability of microvesicle to cross biological barriers, such as the blood brain barrier, by moving from cell to cell. Contact dependent signaling In this form of signaling, the microvesicle does not fuse with the plasma membrane or engulfed by the target cell. Similar to the other mechanisms of signaling, the microvesicle has molecules on its surface that will interact specifically with its target cell. There are additional surface molecules, however, that can interact with receptor molecules which will interact with various signaling pathways. This mechanism of action can be used in processes such as antigen presentation, where MHC molecules on the surface of microvesicle can stimulate an immune response. Alternatively, there may be molecules on microvesicle surfaces that can recruit other proteins to form extracellular protein complexes that may be involved in signaling to the target cell. Relevance in disease Cancer Promoting aggressive tumor phenotypes The oncogenic receptor ECGFvIII, which is located in a specific type of aggressive glioma tumor, can be transferred to a non-aggressive population of tumor cells via microvesicles. After the oncogenic protein is transferred, the recipient cells become transformed and show characteristic changes in the expression levels of target genes. It is possible that transfer of other mutant oncogenes, such as HER2, may be a general mechanism by which malignant cells cause cancer growth at distant sites. microvesicles from non-cancer cells can signal to cancer cells to become more aggressive. Upon exposure to microvesicles from tumor-associated macrophages, breast cancer cells become more invasive in vitro. Promoting angiogenesis Angiogenesis, which is essential for tumor survival and growth, occurs when endothelial cells proliferate to create a matrix of blood vessels that infiltrate the tumor, supplying the nutrients and oxygen necessary for tumor growth. A number of reports have demonstrated that tumor-associated microvesicles release proangiogenic factors that promote endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and tumor growth. microvesicles shed by tumor cells and taken up by endothelial cells also facilitate angiogenic effects by transferring specific mRNAs and miRNAs. Involvement in multidrug resistance When anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin accumulate in microvesicles, the drug's cellular levels decrease. This can ultimately contribute to the process of drug resistance. Similar processes have been demonstrated in microvesicles released from cisplatin-insensitive cancer cells. Vesicles from these tumors contained nearly three times more cisplatin than those released from cisplatin-sensitive cells. For example, tumor cells can accumulate drugs into microvesicles. Subsequently, the drug-containing microvesicles are released from the cell into the extracellular environment, thereby mediating resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and resulting in significantly increased tumor growth, survival, and metastasis. Interference with antitumor immunity Microvesicles from various tumor types can express specific cell-surface molecules (e.g. FasL or CD95) that induce T-cell apoptosis and reduce the effectiveness of other immune cells. microvesicles released from lymphoblastoma cells express the immune-suppressing protein latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1), which inhibits T-cell proliferation and prevents the removal of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). As a consequence, tumor cells can turn off T-cell responses or eliminate the antitumor immune cells altogether by releasing microvesicles. the combined use of microvesicles and 5-FU resulted in enhanced chemosensitivity of squamous cell carcinoma cells more than the use of either 5-FU or microvesicle alone Ghada A. Abd El Latif , Iman M. Aboushady and Dina Sabry Decreased VEGF and cyclin D1 genes expression enhances chemosensitivity of human squamous cell carcinoma cells to 5-fluorouracil and/or mesenchymal stem cells-derived microvesicles E.D.J. Vol. 65, 2, Pp 1217-1228 ; 2019. DOI: 10.21608/EDJ.2019.72197 Impact on tumor metastasis Degradation of the extracellular matrix is a critical step in promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Tumor-derived microvesicles often carry protein-degrading enzymes, including matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). By releasing these proteases, tumor cells can degrade the extracellular matrix and invade surrounding tissues. Likewise, inhibiting MMP-2, MMP-9, and uPA prevents microvesicles from facilitating tumor metastasis. Matrix digestion can also facilitate angiogenesis, which is important for tumor growth and is induced by the horizontal transfer of RNAs from microvesicles. Other disease states The release of microvesicles has been shown from endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, platelets, white blood cells (e.g. leukocytes and lymphocytes), and red blood cells. Although some of these microvesicle populations occur in the blood of healthy individuals and patients, there are obvious changes in number, cellular origin, and composition in various disease states. It has become clear that microvesicles play important roles in regulating the cellular processes that lead to disease pathogenesis. Moreover, because microvesicles are released following apoptosis or cell activation, they have the potential to induce or amplify disease processes. Some of the inflammatory and pathological conditions that microvesicles are involved in include cardiovascular disease, hypertension, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, and rheumatic diseases. Vascular diseases Circulating microvesicles isolated from cardiac surgery patients were found to be thrombogenic in both in vitro assays and in rats. Microvesicles isolated from healthy individuals did not have the same effects and may actually have a role in reducing clotting. Tissue factor, an initiator of coagulation, is found in high levels within microvesicles, indicating their role in clotting. Additionally, microvesicles can induce clotting by binding to clotting factors or by inducing the expression of clotting factors in other cells. microvesicles and tissue factor are associated with diabetic vasculopathy in a mechanism affected by hyperglycemia in diabetic patients. Renal mesangial cells exposed to high glucose media release microvesicles containing tissue factor, having an angiogenic effect on endothelial cells. Atherosclerosis has also been linked with circulating microvesicles originating from platelets and macrophages. These microvesicles are found in high levels within atherosclerotic plaques, and their presence results in communication with clotting machinery that exacerbates the condition. Inflammation Microvesicles contain cytokines that can induce inflammation via numerous different pathways. These cells will then release more microvesicles, which have an additive effect. This can call neutrophils and leukocytes to the area, resulting in the aggregation of cells. However, microvesicles also seem to be involved in a normal physiological response to disease, as there are increased levels of microvesicles that result from pathology. Neurological disorders Microvesicles seem to be involved in a number of neurological diseases. Since they are involved in numerous vascular diseases and inflammation, strokes and multiple sclerosis seem to be other diseases for which microvesicles are involved. Circulating microvesicles seem to have an increased level of phosphorylated tau proteins during early stage Alzheimer's disease. Similarly, increased levels of CD133 are an indicator of epilepsy. Clinical applications Detection of cancer Tumor-associated microvesicles are abundant in the blood, urine, and other body fluids of patients with cancer, and are likely involved in tumor progression. They offer a unique opportunity to noninvasively access the wealth of biological information related to their cells of origin. The quantity and molecular composition of microvesicles released from malignant cells varies considerably compared with those released from normal cells. Thus, the concentration of plasma microvesicles with molecular markers indicative of the disease state may be used as an informative blood-based biosignature for cancer . Microvesicles express many membrane-bound proteins, some of which can be used as tumor biomarkers. Several tumor markers accessible as proteins in blood or urine have been used to screen and diagnose various types of cancer. In general, tumor markers are produced either by the tumor itself or by the body in response to the presence of cancer or some inflammatory conditions. If a tumor marker level is higher than normal, the patient is examined more closely to look for cancer or other conditions. For example, CA19-9, CA-125, and CEA have been used to help diagnose pancreatic, ovarian, and gastrointestinal malignancies, respectively. However, although they have proven clinical utility, none of these tumor markers are highly sensitive or specific. Clinical research data suggest that tumor-specific markers exposed on microvesicles are useful as a clinical tool to diagnose and monitor disease. Research is also ongoing to determine if tumor-specific markers exposed on microvesicles are predictive for therapeutic response. Also published as Also published as Evidence produced by independent research groups has demonstrated that microvesicles from the cells of healthy tissues, or selected miRNAs from these microvesicles, can be employed to reverse many tumors in pre-clinical cancer models, and may be used in combination with chemotherapy.Microvesicles (MVS) Derived From Adult Stem Cells For Use In The Therapeutic Treatment of a Tumor Disease. PCT/EP2011/052945 Available onlineHuman Liver Stem Cell-Derived Microvesicles Inhibit Hepatoma Growth in SCID Mice by Delivering Antitumor MicroRNAs. Camussi et al; Stem Cells [2012,30]Available online Conversely, microvesicles processed from a tumor cell are involved in the transport of cancer proteins and in delivering microRNA to the surrounding healthy tissue. It leads to a change of healthy cell phenotype and creates a tumor-friendly environment. Microvesicles play an important role in tumor angiogenesis and in the degradation of matrix due to the presence of metalloproteases, which facilitate metastasis. They are also involved in intensification of the function of regulatory T-lymphocytes and in the induction of apoptosis of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, because microvesicles released from a tumor cell contain Fas ligand and TRAIL. They prevent differentiation of monocytes to dendritic cells. Tumor microvesicles also carry tumor antigen, so they can be an instrument for developing tumor vaccines. Circulating miRNA and segments of DNA in all body fluids can be potential markers for tumor diagnostics. Microvesicles and Rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of joints. In the early stage there are abundant Th17 cells producing proinflammatory cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F, TNF, IL-21, and IL-22 in the synovial fluid. regulatory T-lymphocytes have a limited capability to control these cells. In the late stage, the extent of inflammation correlates with numbers of activated macrophages that contribute to joint inflammation and bone and cartilage destruction, because they have the ability to transform themselves into osteoclasts that destroy bone tissue. Synthesis of reactive oxygen species, proteases, and prostaglandins by neutrophils is increased. Activation of platelets via collagen receptor GPVI stimulates the release of microvesicles from platelet cytoplasmic membranes. These microparticles are detectable at a high level in synovial fluid, and they promote joint inflammation by transporting proinflammatory cytokine IL-1. Biological markers for disease In addition to detecting cancer, it is possible to use microvesicles as biological markers to give prognoses for various diseases. Many types of neurological diseases are associated with increased level of specific types of circulating microvesicles. For example, elevated levels of phosphorylated tau proteins can be used to diagnose patients in early stages of Alzheimer's. Additionally, it is possible to detect increased levels of CD133 in microvesicles of patients with epilepsy. Mechanism for drug delivery Circulating microvesicles may be useful for the delivery of drugs to very specific targets. Using electroporation or centrifugation to insert drugs into microvesicles targeting specific cells, it is possible to target the drug very efficiently. This targeting can help by reducing necessary doses as well as prevent off-target side effects. They can target anti-inflammatory drugs to specific tissues. Additionally, circulating microvesicles can bypass the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and deliver their cargo to neurons while not having an effect on muscle cells.

Life and career  Born in Rome, Magni started his career as a screenwriter, in 1956, with Tempo di villeggiatura. In 1968 he collaborated with Mario Monicelli to a real \\"event\\" of the Italian cinema as the transformation of Monica Vitti in a comedic actress with The Girl with the Pistol, and the critical and commercial success of the film pushed him into directing. After the directorial debut with Faustina (which was also the debut film of Vonetta McGee), in 1969 Magni achieved an extraordinary success with Nell'anno del Signore, which was the highest-grossing Italian film of the year, so as to require for the first time in Italy nighttime screenings to meet the demands of the audience. The film marked the encounter with Nino Manfredi, with whom Magni had a long-standing association on the set (including the screenplay of Manfredi's award-winning film Per Grazia Ricevuta) and a close friendship off the set. The film also defined Magni's style, namely a commedia all'italiana mainly centred on Rome and its history, particularly the epoch between the Papal States and the Risorgimento. In 1977 Magni achieved critical recognition with In nome del Papa Re, which also gave him his first David di Donatello Award. He received a second David di Donatello in 1995, for the screenplay of Nemici d'infanzia, and a special David di Donatello Lifetime Career Award in 2008. In 1991 he was a member of the jury at the 17th Moscow International Film Festival. After the 2003 TV movie La notte di Pasquino, a sort of sequel of Nell'anno del Signore still with Nino Manfredi as the main actor, and with the death of Manfredi in 2004, Magni retired from cinema. He died in Rome, on 27 October 2013.

As part of the Tyres√•n Lake System, Treh√∂rningen receives water from Lake G√∂mmaren and supplies water to Lake √Ögesta.  History  The area surrounding Treh√∂rningen, Orl√•ngen and √Ögestasj√∂n, is a fine example of a historical landscape evolving from a prehistoric settlement into a traditional agricultural village discontinued in the 19th century, encompassing structures from all interjacent eras. It is one of the few areas in Stockholm which escaped the creation of the widespread 20th century suburbs around the historical city of Stockholm, and, consequently, the area is considered as having cultural and historical values of national interest. The landscape include open cultivated and grazed fields next to steep rocks, pine and deciduous forests. Several grave fields, hillforts, and other archaeological structures, reflects the area was connected to the Baltic Sea in prehistoric times. During medieval times, the area contained the only farmstead exempt from land dues (i.e. owned by a member of the Swedish nobility) in Huddinge. In the area traces from the Stone Age and some cairns from the Bronze Age have been found, and parts of the present road network is left unaltered for thousands of years.Stockholm County Museum  Catchment area  Three-fourths of the catchment area is used for settlements, including the commercial centre of Huddinge (Huddinge Centrum) and half a dozen residential neighbourhoods. Nevertheless, the shores of the lakes are of significant recreational importance as they border the Orl√•ngen Nature Reserve and contain several cliffs popular for bathing and angling. Both major inflows, Fullersta√•n and Solfagradiket, are guided through culverts under neighbouring settlements, but reaches the lake through open ditches. Today, motor-driven boats are not permitted on the lake and restrictions are imposed on angling.Huddinges sj√∂ar (site)  Environmental influence  The lake used to receive waste water from both settlements and other neighbouring operations 1951‚Äì1971, but the inflow is today reduced to stormwater - the old usage still echoing in oxygen depletion and phosphorus release at the lake bottom, and algae bloom and limited water transparency. To restrict future influence to a minimum, reduction in incoming flows are given priority rather than any actions to the lake itself. The lake was drudged in 1975 and 1976, the product of which was pumped over to the lake's western bay where embankments prevents it from pouring back into the lake. Additionally, reed beds were removed and other measures were taken to clean the lake. Vegetation has been cleared annually since.  Flora and fauna  As a locale for birds, the lake was significantly deteriorated by the mid-1970s drudging which caused a colony of black-headed gull to disappear. Today, the lake has a regular presence of mallard, Eurasian coot, great crested grebe, common goldeneye; regular visits of common gull, heron, common merganser, osprey, marsh warbler, great reed-warbler, and grasshopper warbler; and some uncommon guests such as common kingfisher and black-throated diver; the lake itself thus still being of ornithological interest, while the forests surrounding the lake attracts long-tailed tit and lesser spotted woodpecker. Aquatic plants, in addition to reed and club-rush, includes several species of duckweed and chickenwort. Along the shore are some 30 species of trees and plants, including alder, birch, aspen, spruce, sedges, loosestrife, forget-me-nots, cinquefoils, and water-pepper. The common frog and common toad have been observed by the lake, as have bats such as the northern bat and Daubenton's bat. No observations of dragonflies had been reported until July 2014, when two American visitors saw a small red dragonfly and a large black dragonfly.

A dance hostess at a club in her youth, she married three times, on each occasion to an executive of a business that sold luxury goods. Her third marriage, to Sir Bernard Docker, the chairman of Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA) and its subsidiary, Daimler, was notable for the couple's extravagant lifestyle. This was often funded by tax writeoffs and company expenditure that could not be legitimately defended, which led to Sir Bernard's removal from BSA's board of directors. She was also banned from the French Riviera by Prince Rainier after an incident in which she tore up a Monegasque flag. Early life She was born in Derby in 1906 as Norah Royce Turner to Sydney Turner and his wife, Amy. The Turners moved to Birmingham, where her father bought into a car dealership. Her father committed suicide when she was 16, after which she had to earn her own living. As a young woman, she became a dance hostess at London's Caf√© de Paris. Her male friends included the 9th Duke of Marlborough and, for many years, Clement Callingham, head of Henekeys wine and spirit merchants. She had an affair with Callingham, which resulted in an abortion, her being named in a divorce action by Callingham's wife, and then her marriage to the divorced Callingham. Marriages She was married three times. The first, to Clement Callingham from 1938 until his death in 1945, resulted in one son, Lance. The second, in 1946, to Sir William Collins, the president of Fortnum & Mason, lasted until his death in 1948. The third, in 1949, was to Sir Bernard Docker, chairman of Birmingham Small Arms Company and Daimler, and a director of the Midland Bank, Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company and Thomas Cook and Son. Public life Lady Docker loved publicity and was often in public view. In the summer of 1954, after a visit to a coal mine, Lady Docker invited several of the miners to a champagne party on the Dockers' yacht, Shemara, at which she danced the hornpipe. Lady Docker won a marbles championship in 1955 at Castleford's \\"Reight Neet Aht\\", a charity event for the Cancer Relief Fund, while wearing a sequin dress and diamonds. The match was rigged, the other players having been instructed to let her win. The next year, while in Melbourne, Australia, to watch the 1956 Summer Olympics, she challenged the suburb of Collingwood to a marbles match. Docker Daimlers Sir Bernard Docker commissioned a series of Daimlers built to Lady Docker's specifications for the show circuit. Blue Clover, her second show car Golden Zebra for the Paris Show 1955 ;1951 ‚Äì The Gold Car (a.k.a. Golden Daimler) The Gold Car was a touring limousine on the Thirty-Six Straight-Eight chassis. The car was covered with 7,000 tiny gold stars, and all plating that would normally have been chrome was gold. This car was taken to Paris, the United States and Australia ;1952 ‚Äì Blue Clover Also on the Thirty-Six Straight-Eight chassis, Blue Clover was a two-door sportsman's coup√© ;1953 ‚Äì Silver Flash The Silver Flash was an aluminium-bodied coup√© based on the 3-litre Regency chassis. Its accessories included solid silver hairbrushes and red fitted luggage made from crocodile skin. ;1954 ‚Äì Star Dust based on the DF400 chassis ;1955 ‚Äì Golden Zebra The Golden Zebra was a two-door coup√© based on the DK400 chassis. Like the Gold Car, the Golden Zebra had all its metal trim pieces plated gold instead of chrome, beyond that, it had an ivory dashboard and zebra-skin upholstery.  Explaining the zebra skin upholstery, Lady Docker said: \\"Because mink is too hot to sit on.\\". Alongside the show cars kept for her personal use, Lady Docker also owned other Daimler cars, including an unmodified Conquest drophead coup√©. Separation from BSA At the end of May 1956, Bernard Docker was removed from the board of Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA), where he had been chairman. Lady Docker resigned from the board of directors of Hooper at the same time. The company, which owned the Docker Daimlers, had Lady Docker return them. The issues leading to the removal of the Dockers stemmed from the extravagant expenses they presented to the company, including the show cars made available for Lady Docker's personal use, a ¬£5,000 gold and mink ensemble that Lady Docker wore at the 1956 Paris Motor Show that she tried to write off as a business expense as she \\"was only acting as a model\\" at the show, and Glandyfi Castle, bought with ¬£12,500 of BSA's money and refurbished for ¬£25,000, again with company money. Shortly after BSA disassociated itself from the Dockers, Lady Docker bought a Bentley Continental from Daimler's rival, Rolls-Royce. Feud with Monaco Up until 1958, the Dockers often went to Monaco, where, in September 1952, they were banned from the Monte Carlo Casino after Lady Docker slapped a waiter in the face. The Dockers were invited to the christening of Prince Albert in April 1958. They brought Lady Docker's son, Lance Callingham, with them, but he was not allowed to attend. Later, at the H√¥tel de Paris, Lady Docker, still furious about the incident, tore up a paper Monegasque flag that had been at her table. In response, the government of Monaco had her expelled and the Princely Family of Monaco returned the Dockers' christening gifts to them. Through a 1951 treaty with France, the ban on Lady Docker was extended throughout the French Riviera. News of a reconciliation between Lady Docker and the Princely Family of Monaco was reported by the North American Newspaper Alliance in February 1959. However, in September 1960, Lady Docker announced that she would invest in a company to build a waterfront casino in Cannes to rival the Monte Carlo Casino. Decline Without their main source of income, the Dockers began to run out of money. In 1965, Bernard Docker put his yacht Shemara on the market for ¬£600,000; it was eventually sold for ¬£290,000. In 1966, the Dockers sold their estate in Hampshire and moved to Jersey in the Channel Islands, becoming tax exiles. Lady Docker later said of the people of Jersey: \\"They are the most frightfully boring, dreadful people that have ever been born.\\" Death Lady Docker died on 11 December 1983 in the Great Western Royal Hotel in London. She is buried in the churchyard of St. James- the-Less in Stubbings, near Maidenhead. Common usage The term 'Lady Docker' is also used in a derogatory way in the north of England, specifically Lancashire, to describe a woman who has pretensions to be of high station but who in reality is anything but. For example, 'Who does she think she is ‚Äì Lady Docker?' or 'Here comes Lady Docker'. It is interchangeable with 'Lady Muck' or the male equivalent, 'Lord Muck'.

The marketing offices of MCF are located in Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra. Overview of MCF Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers Limited (MCF) is a subsidiary of Zuari Fertilisers and Chemicals Limited, an Adventz group company, which holds 53.03% equity shares. The 'Adventz' Group, is an Indian conglomerate with global ambitions that participates in and contributes to India's economic growth and prosperity through transformational change. The Group is partnered by world leaders in various areas of enterprises and has significant presence in agriculture, engineering & infrastructure, real estate, consumer durables and services which are the key drivers of the Indian economy. The Adventz Group and the UB Group are promoters of MCF. In 1990, Government of Karnataka selected the UB group to take over the management of MCF, which was then a potential sick unit, with losses to the tune of about 600 million rupees. Now its under the management of Adventz Group. Infrastructure Manufacturing facilities The company has capacity to manufacture 2,17,800MT of Ammonia (intermediate product), 3,79,500MT of Urea, 2,55,500MT of Phosphatic fertilizers (DAP & NP 20:20:00:13), 15,330MT of Ammonium bicarbonate (ABC), 33,000MT of Sulphuric acid and 21,450MT of Sulphonated naphthalene formaldehyde (SNF) annually. The design and engineering of the Ammonia/Urea plants was done by Humphreys & Glasgow Limited, London, a leading international firm in the fertilizer field and their associates, Humphreys & Glasgow Consultants Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai. (The firm is now merged with Jacobs Engineering, USA). The Phosphatic plant was designed and engineered by Toyo Engineering Corporation, Japan. Indian firms PDIL and Furnace Fabrica designed and constructed the ABC and Sulphuric acid plant respectively. In 2010, MCF forayed into the manufacture of sulphonated naphthalene formaldehyde (SNF). SNF is a speciality basic chemical used in construction industry. It is largely consumed in formulation of concrete admixtures which facilitate dispersion of the cement particles and increases the rate of hydration resulting in usage of less water for concrete mixture. In 2003, the company implemented SAP R/3 for its entire operation. Utilities * Cooling water system - 16,600 m3/h circulation rate. * Water De-mineralizing plant - 120 m3/h capacity. * Nitrogen plant - 650 Nm3/h of gaseous nitrogen and equivalent 50 Nm3/h of liquid nitrogen. * Instrument Air Compressor with Instrument Air drier - 1,500 Nm3/h capacity. * Product Handling - There are four streams for Urea and three streams for phosphatic fertilizers for bagging and dispatch. * Auxiliary Boiler - The Ammonia and Urea plants are supplemented with an auxiliary boiler of 60 MT/h steam capacity at 75 kg/cm2 pressure and 480 ¬∞C. * Purge Gas Recovery Unit (PGRU) - The productivity of the Ammonia plant was increased by installing a PGRU in May 1984 of 4,800 Nm3/h capacity. * Captive Power Plant - To overcome the frequent interruptions in power supply, resulting in equipment failure and wastage of energy during shut down and start ups of the process plants, a Captive Power Plant with W√§rtsil√§ Diesel Engine was commissioned in 1985.

Most of its exhibits concern the history of the town, focusing on the shipbuilding industry at VSEL (now BAE Systems), the steelworks industry ‚Äî of which Barrow once had the world's largest, the Furness Railway and the World War II bombings of the town. There has been a museum in Barrow since 1907 and in its current location since 1994, when 50,000 people visited it in its first year, visitor numbers peaked at 120,000 in 2001. The museum has free entry and remains under public ownership.  Exhibits  Shipbuilders models of two Barrow-built ocean liners displayed in the Dock Museum On initial entrance to the museum, the ground floors galleries are about the town's history, its rapid mushrooming, as well as how it was affected by World War II. The largest part of the museum is housed in a former dry dock, where three floors containing models of ships and submarines built in Barrow, along with other exhibits can be found. The Vickers Photographic Archive, an archive of 10,000 glass plate negatives donated by the shipyard, was once available online. There are changing temporary exhibitions, two historic, locally-built vessels as well as a filmshow illustrating the town's past and present on the very bottom floor. The museum takes its name from the dock in which it is built. This is the oldest part of the museum, opened in 1872, and is one of its main attractions. The Dock Museum focuses largely on Barrow-in-Furness and its immediate surroundings. It is a common misconception that it is solely a maritime museum. The museum has a strong prehistory collection, natural history artefacts, domestic furnishings, toys and maritime objects. The Furness Hoard of Viking artefacts discovered in 2011 is currently being held at the museum with hopes it can be acquired after being valuated.  Museum boats  There are currently four small boats preserved at the Dock Museum, including a yacht called White Rose, which was built in the late 19th century; Banshee, a Whammel fishing boat; and the 1914 traditional Morecambe Bay prawner, Nance. The museum's largest vessel‚Äîthe RNLB Herbert Leigh (ON 900)‚Äîis sited adjacent to North Road.  Location and facilities  The Dock Museum is located in Barrow-in-Furness alongside the Walney Channel. The Museum has a distinctive shape, and can be seen from the nearby intersection of the A590 road and Hindpool Road. The museum's original large car park was developed into a Premier Inn hotel and Brewers Fayre restaurant in 2014, with current parking now available to the south of the museum directly adjacent to the outdoor play area. The museum is home to the 'Bridge Coffee Shop', a gift shop, a maritime themed adventure playground, toilets, disabled access, a studio for hire as well as access to the 'Channelside Walk', which leads up to the towns old slag banks, with good views of Barrow, Walney Island, the Lake District and the Isle of Man when the weather permits. It is a fully accessible museum. Lease to BAE Systems The lower floor as well as The Studio (previously used to generate income from workshops and events) are now home to BAE Systems HR department. Barrow Borough Council and BAE Systems entered this financial partnership to give prospective employees a good first impression and some local knowledge of the town. Some resistance from regular visitors to the museum was met, but building modifications went ahead and a 25-year lease was signed. All building work was completed in early 2015, and the HR department moved into the museum. The Dock Museum are still offering workshops, events and tours, though in a revised capacity.

The global population size has not been quantified but the bird is listed by the IUCN as being of \\"Least concern\\". Description The southern black flycatcher is entirely black, with a black beak and black legs. The iris of the eye is brown and this, along with the square-cut tail, helps distinguish it from the otherwise similar fork-tailed drongo (Dicrurus adsimilis) which has a red iris and long forked tail. Distribution and habitat The southern black flycatcher is native to eastern and southern Africa. It has been recorded from Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, Namibia, Swaziland, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and South Africa. It is typically found in habitats with open areas and light woodland, riparian corridors, the edges of plantations and in gardens. The trees in these habitats include miombo (Brachystegia spp.), thorntrees (Acacia spp.) and mopane (Colosphermum mopane). Behaviour The southern black flycatcher is a mainly insectivorous bird. Its diet includes beetles, termites, locusts, worms, spiders and centipedes. Its main foraging technique is to perch on a low eminence such as a branch or fence post and pounce on prey in the air or on the ground below. It is also known to sip nectar from the flowers of mountain aloe (Aloe marlothii) and to eat the berries of the black nightshade (Solanum nigrum). It sometimes forages in small flocks, often associating with fork-tailed drongos. Breeding takes place between May and January, peaking in September and October. The nest is usually built in a recess in a tree trunk or behind a loose slab of bark, but is sometimes in a tangle of creepers, the sheath of a palm frond, banana bunch or an abandoned farm implement. It is cup-shaped and composed of twigs and dry grasses, lined with fine rootlets. Up to four eggs are laid and incubation lasts about two weeks with the young fledging and leaving the nest in fifteen to twenty days. Status The IUCN list the southern black flycatcher as being of \\"Least concern\\". This is because it has a wide range, approximately , the population seems stable and the bird is said to be common over at least part of its range.

He served from 1960 to 1972. Aycock failed in his only bid for governor in the 1971 Democratic primary. Few lieutenant governors in Louisiana have been elected directly to the governorship; former Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Lafayette, is a prominent exception. Aycock was born in Franklin to Clarence A. Aycock (1885-1948) and the former Inez Crask. He received his law degree in 1937 from Loyola University in New Orleans and launched his law practice in Franklin. He won the Bronze Star while serving in Europe during World War II. In 1945, Aycock married the former Elaine Champagne (1918‚Äì2011). They had six children. Speaker of the Louisiana House, 1952 Aycock was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives in 1952 and, though a freshman member, was tapped by incoming Governor Robert F. Kennon as his choice for Speaker. In Louisiana, House Speakers routinely have the recommendation of the governor regardless of the separation of powers between executive and legislative branches. He was reelected to the legislature in 1956 but was not recommended for retention as Speaker by Kennon's successor, Earl Kemp Long. Long instead called Lorris M. Wimberly back as Speaker and then sent Wimberly to head the Department of Public Works in the summer of 1956. Wimberly's abrupt departure led to the accession of Speaker Robert Joseph \\"Bob\\" Angelle of St. Martin Parish. Aycock was associated with the anti-Long faction within the Louisiana Democratic Party. While Aycock served as lieutenant governor and Speaker of the House, only John Hainkel, a lawyer from New Orleans, and John Alario, a businessman from Westwego, were elected by both the Senate and the House to their respective highest positions of Senate President and House Speaker.Ron Gomez, My Name Is Ron And I'm a Recovering Legislator: Memoirs of a Louisiana State Representative, Lafayette, Louisiana: Zemog Publishing, 2000, pp. 186-187, Election as lieutenant governor, 1960 & 1964 Aycock first won the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor in 1959 - 1960\\\\. At that time, under the Louisiana Constitution of 1921, the lieutenant governor presided over the state Senate. In the 1974 Constitution, senators chose a \\"Senate President\\" to preside over the body, with a ceremonial President Pro Tem in the second position. These Senate presidents also have the recommendation of the governor. Aycock and then Mayor W. George Bowdon, Jr., of Alexandria led the primary field in December 1959 and went into a January 1960 runoff. Losing candidates included sitting Governor Earl Long, who was actually waging his third campaign (the last two unsuccessful) for lieutenant governor, and Mayor William J. \\"Bill\\" White (December 25, 1910 - December 12, 1990) of Gretna in Jefferson Parish, a ticket-mate of State Auditor William J. \\"Bill\\" Dodd, then of Baton Rouge. Ernest J. Wright, a labor organizer from New Orleans, was the first African-American candidate for lieutenant governor in the 1963 primary, the first member of his race to seek the office since the era of Reconstruction. Aycock was in the second round of balloting Jimmie Davis' choice for lieutenant governor; his intraparty rival, George Bowdon, was endorsed from the start by the losing runoff candidate, Mayor deLesseps Story Morrison of New Orleans. In the general election held on April 19, 1960, Aycock defeated Republican Clark Clinton Boardman (October 14, 1887 - July 8, 1965), retired engineer from Monroe in Ouachita Parish; he is interred at Riverview Cemetery in Monroe. A native of St. Croix County, Wisconsin, received his Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering in 1909 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Boardman and his wife, the former Ethel V. Martin (1889‚Äì1989), had one son, Grant Clinton Boardman, II (1925‚Äì2010), a Louisiana State University graduate named for his grandfather. This Boardman was an engineer with Sid W. Richardson Carbon and Gas in Fort Worth, Texas, for much of his career. Aycock polled 392,421 votes (83.2 percent) to Boardman's 68,186 (14.4 percent). (Vaughn L. Phelps (born 1920), also of Monroe, the nominee of the Louisiana States' Rights Party, received 11,299 votes, the remaining 2.4 percent.) Boardman, at seventy-two, did not wage an active campaign. He was the first Republican in modern times even to seek the lieutenant governor's position. Not until 1987, eleven months after Aycock's death, did a Republican, Paul Hardy of St. Martinville in St. Martin Parish, win the position, which had been otherwise reserved for Louisiana Democrats. In December 1963 - January 1964, Aycock ran as an \\"independent\\" Democrat, meaning that he did not align himself to any gubernatorial candidate. He might have favored Robert Kennon, who was seeking a comeback as governor and who had made him Speaker, but he preferred to make his race alone. Kennon therefore ran with former state Representative Francis Dugas, a lawyer from Thibodaux in Lafourche Parish. Aycock was thrust into a runoff with Chep Morrison's next choice for the position, attorney Claude B. Duval of Houma in Terrebonne Parish. Omitted in the primary runoff was Dugas and McKeithen's ticket-mate, former Mayor Ashton J. Mouton of Lafayette. Duval, an \\"old-school\\" orator, was as conservative as Aycock, but he, like his gubernatorial ticket mate Morrison, fared poorly in central and northern Louisiana. In 1968, Duval entered the state Senate for the first of three terms with his former rival, Lieutenant Governor Aycock, as the presiding officer. Duval and Aycock also had something else in common: they came from adjoining south Louisiana parishes, and both were in the anti-Long tradition of Louisiana politics. Endorsing Goldwater for president In the fall of 1964, Aycock endorsed Republican presidential nominee Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona, rather than his fellow Democrat, President Lyndon B. Johnson. Governor John J. McKeithen, many of whose backers also voted for Aycock for the second position, remained neutral in the presidential race. The states' two powerful Democratic senators, Allen J. Ellender of Houma and Russell B. Long of Baton Rouge, however, endorsed the Johnson-Humphrey elector slate. Goldwater won Louisiana's ten electoral votes: he was only the second Republican to have done so in modern times, the other having been Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956. Several other Democrats joined Aycock in supporting Goldwater: Secretary of State Wade O. Martin, Jr., former Governors Sam Houston Jones of Lake Charles and Robert Kennon of Minden, Caddo Parish Sheriff J. Howell Flournoy, Monroe Mayor W. L. \\"Jack\\" Howard, and Plaquemines Parish political \\"boss\\" Leander H. Perez. The Republicans held a rally at Tulane University in New Orleans to honor Goldwater and former Democrat-turned-Republican Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina as well as the defecting Louisiana Democrats, with then congressional candidate David C. Treen acting as master of ceremonies. Goldwater and Thurmond also made a stop thereafter in Shreveport. McKeithen blocks Aycock's aspirations, 1967 Aycock had planned to seek the governorship in the 1967 Democratic primary, but he ran into a major roadblock. In 1966, McKeithen proposed a change to the state's term limits law, and Amendment 1 was adopted into the state Constitution on November 8, 1966. The amendment allows a Louisiana governor to be elected to two consecutive four-year terms, but not a third-term unless he first sits out a term. When Aycock gauged how powerful McKeithen had become, he backed away from a gubernatorial challenge and ran instead for reelection as lieutenant governor, again without tying himself to any gubernatorial candidate. He had no serious opposition for his third term. Running for governor, 1971 Aycock presumably could have had a fourth term as lieutenant governor for the asking, but he entered the 1971 Democratic primary for governor. The field was so crowded that the lieutenant governor never made it into the top tier of candidates, headed by then U.S. Representative Edwin Washington Edwards of Crowley, State Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Jr., of Shreveport, then former U.S. Representative Gillis William Long of Alexandria, and former Governor Jimmie Davis, then of Baton Rouge. Aycock, the most conservative candidate in the field, finished in sixth place with 88,465 votes. Davis and Aycock, who had been the winning intraparty ticket in 1960, were opposing each other in 1971. As it turned out, neither was a serious factor in the race. In 1971, the runoff featured the newer, more moderate candidates, Edwards and Johnston. Edwards narrowly won the second primary and then went on to defeat Republican David Treen, then of Jefferson Parish, in the general election held on February 1, 1972. Eleven candidates, ten Democratic and one Republican, entered the race to succeed Aycock, including two bankers, outgoing State Representative P.J. Mills of Shreveport and State Senator Jamar Adcock of Monroe, and two candidates from Webster Parish, state Representative Parey P. Branton and businessman Edward Kennon, later a member of the Louisiana Public Service Commission. The eventual Democratic nominee, Jimmy Fitzmorris, a former member of the New Orleans City Council, easily defeated the Republican choice, Treen's running-mate, former state Representative Morley A. Hudson of Shreveport. Aycock's legacy Aycock never sought another office but returned to Franklin to practice law. He pushed for the name change of Southwestern Louisiana Institute to the University of Southwestern Louisiana (since University of Louisiana at Lafayette). He supported the French heritage movement and the Acadiana Regional Airport in New Iberia in Iberia Parish.

Coleman was born in Philadelphia, where he was educated and studied law. His parents were Quakers; his mother, Rebecca Bradford, had arrived in the new colony of Pennsylvania as a child in 1683, and his father, also William Coleman, was a carpenter and one of the earliest members of the Carpenter's Company of Philadelphia. After he was admitted to the bar, Coleman held a variety of municipal offices, beginning as Town Clerk and Clerk of the City Court. He became a Judge of various local courts including the Orphan's Court, Court of Common Pleas, and Quarter Sessions. In 1758 he was appointed an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. He was also a merchant, in partnership with Thomas Hopkinson. He was also active in Philadelphia's emerging cultural institutions. By 1727 Coleman was a friend of Benjamin Franklin and member of Franklin's Junto. He was a founder and first treasurer of the American Philosophical Society, one of the first directors of the Philadelphia Contributionship, and an early supporter of Pennsylvania Hospital. Benjamin Franklin was a close friend of Colman, and said of him, \\"He has the coolest, clearest head, the best heart, and the best morals of almost any man I ever met.\\" Coleman was also a founder of the College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania, serving as the original clerk of the Board of Trustees, 1749‚Äì1755, and as its first treasurer, 1749‚Äì1764. In 1738, William Coleman married Hannah Fitzwater, daughter of George Fitzwater, a successful merchant and landowner. The couple was childless, but Coleman adopted his nephew, George Clymer, son of Hannah's sister Deborah and Captain Christopher Clymer, a sea captain and privateer. In 1747, Coleman joined with other Philadelphia merchants to fit out a privateer, The Warren, to defend the Delaware River and Bay from Spanish and French pirates, who had been carrying off slaves and other property in the bay and river. The Philadelphia Friends Meeting considered this incompatible with the Meeting's pacifist beliefs and read Coleman out of the Meeting. Subsequently, Coleman joined with Franklin to help manage a public lottery held in 1748 to raise funds to cover the costs of building Philadelphia's first military defense, the Association Battery. In 1756, William Coleman purchased 12 acres of land along the Schuykill River, where he built an elegant country home which he named Woodford. In 1761, Coleman was appointed to serve as one of the Pennsylvania Members of the Commission formed to adjust the disputed boundary between Pennsylvania and Maryland. English surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon were engaged to record the boundary, now known as the Mason-Dixon line, and the Commission certified their map of the boundary line in 1768. He died in Philadelphia on January 11, 1769.

He was known for his energy and zeal, as well as his overt activism in local politics, founding the 'Belfast Catholic Association'. Education and priestly ministry Henry was born in Loughguile, County Antrim. After his education at St Patrick's College, Maynooth, he was ordained for the Diocese of Down and Connor on 7 June 1870 by Matthew Quinn, the Bishop of Bathurst. The Diocese of Bathurst is located in New South Wales in Australia. He was appointed to St. Malachy's Diocesan College to teach French and Mathematics. He succeeded Marner as President of the College from 1876‚Äì95, before his Episcopal nomination; he is, to date, the longest serving president of the college. Bishop He was appointed 25th Bishop of Down and Connor on 6 August 1895 and was consecrated bishop in St Patrick's Church, Belfast on 22 Sept 1895 by Cardinal Logue. One of his first acts was to agree to be patron of the nascent Gaelic League in Belfast. The distinguished Jesuit historian, Fr Oliver P. Rafferty calls Henry Henry \\"a man of decidedly theocratic tastes\\" and assesses many of his decisions, especially those relating to politics and civil society as \\"quixotic.\\" Dr Henry believed that a religious order of priests could give invaluable help in the densely populated area of West Belfast. Accordingly he invited the Redemptorists to found a community there at Clonard Monastery. It was a welcome invitation, which they accepted as they were already looking for a foundation in the North. In 1900, he helped establish St. Mary's Training College to staff local Catholic schools. http://www.downandconnor.org/blog/2018/03/29/29-march-2018-homily-bishop- treanor-chrism-mass/ Belfast Catholic Association In 1896, Bishop Henry organised a Catholic Association, initially confined to controlling representation in the newly created Catholic wards [of Belfast]. It dominated municipal politics in West Belfast for a decade: it easily defeated the Nationalist slate of candidates in the two wards in 1897 and 1904, and between these dates its candidates were not even challenged. Its viewpoint dominated the Irish News, the local Catholic newspaper, to such an extent that the Irish Nationalist leader in the city, Joseph Devlin, had to begin a rival, the Northern Star, in 1897.A past apart: studies in the history of Catholic Belfast, 1850-1950, Anthony C. Hepburn, Ulster Historical Foundation (1996), 261 pages () Henry's episcopal ministry took place against the intensely fought political battles around Irish Home Rule and he worked hard to influence nationalist political opinion, and representation in Belfast, at the heart of his diocese. By 1912, however, Devlin had won control of nationalist thought in the city.

A boy with a dark sadden and mysterious past. He travels wielding the powerful Pasa sword. Early on unknown to himself, he wields a great deep power within him. History Six years before the start of the series, Rey's parents had died from an epidemic. He and his sister, Mey, drifted around and eventually came to the capital city. Rey and his sister were brought along with thousands of other orphans under false pretense of care and shelter. There at the \\"Gigantic Pagoda\\" in which the Prime Minister resides, all the orphans were locked under a dark room and each were given a sword. Being told that if they wanted to get out, they would have to fight. For months they fought and the children became relentless, greedy, and violent, driven by the scarcity of food provided for them. Survivors were eventually swallowed up by a dark entity and were lost into the darkness. Mey was eventually swallowed up and Rey soon followed. After the ordeal, he awoke with a demon stone embedded into his forehead. After sometime, Master Loruan and his disciple, Shyao, found Rey, who was holding the Pasa sword. They witnessed Rey among hordes of slain demons across the field. Loruan saved him from insanity and raised Rey as one of his own disciples. Loruan was eventually killed by White Tiger, who sought the Pasa sword. Loruan sacrificed himself using a forbidden spell in order for Rey and Shyao to escape with the Pasa sword. Summary Six years later, at the start of the series he travels with Shyao Lin. Though Shyao denies any feelings for Rey and claims to be his 'older sister', Rey begins to feel something for her, quite obviously. He wields an immensely powerful sword, The Pasa sword, with the power to consume demons blood and souls to augments its powers. After Shyao's betrayal, he retreats into the mountains and becomes a listless wanderer, barely even interested in killing the demons there for a time. Personality Rey Yan undergoes a somewhat dramatic change from the beginning of the manhwa. According to the description of Rey in the character files drawn by Hui-Jin at the end of volume eight, Rey is described as having; 'a tough, almost twisted personality, but remnants of his original understanding character still shine through. He is quick to anger but doesn't hold grudges... Making new friends has made him mellower... Hui-Jin also reveals that Rey 'has a soft spot for women', and can be a bit shy around them (especially Shyao). Even as early on in the series as up to volume eight, Rey's kind personality shines through. In the first volume, he seems almost inhuman, but later on he becomes more open to people. Powers Rey makes remarkable progress using Chan Kaihu's chastity technique. One of the more powerful techniques that Rey learns in 'Moonbeams Slice Through the Night Air' (or so called in the English version). This power lets you cut through anything. Rey uses this to tremendously weaken the powerful Sorcerer of the Dark in a battle with him. Rey's other 'powers' are what Ban-Go and the PaSa sword provide him with, along with decent swordsmanship and some raw strength. *Pasa Sword Rey is beginning to merge more and more with the Pasa sword spirit and can interact with and threaten him. At one point he is even let into the demon's memories against his will. The two are quite alike, both being hot- blooded and as Rey mentions to the demon; 'You're not the only one here with a dark past'. *Chan Kaihu's techniques As the series progresses, Rey continues to learn new techniques. One such technique is \\"A spell to shatter diamonds,\\" in which a giant explosion is created by harnessing the earth element. The technique \\"Moonbeams Slice through the Night Air\\", is only the first of five techniques in the Metal element techniques described in the \\"Tome of Heaven and Hell. The \\"Dance of the Blaizing Shadows \\", is a technique based on the fundamental distinction between reality and illusion that trickes the opponent into thinking that the illusion is the real you. Appearance Throughout the series, Rey appearances changes drastically. These changes seems like it is coming from the merge between Rey and the Pasa sword's demon spirit, but also something deep within Rey is slowly surfacing. *Volume 1, Rey's eyes become cloudy and Spirit speaks through him *Volume 3, Spirit took over when the Dervishes though Rey was beat. His eyes became completely pupiless and he only regained control when MinXia intervened to remind him about Shyao. Rey enters Sheyshen's dimension and his physical form immediately changes, he now has red eyes, markings all over his body, claws, and spikes growing from his wrists. After Sheyshen lands her first punch on him, the PaSa sword takes over and Rey has no memory of the possession afterwards. *Volume 4, Spirit takes on a sprite form outside of Rey's body. *Volume 5, Spirit appears for a brief moment and the PaSa sword attacks Hyacia on his command. *Volume 8, After learning of Shyao's betrayal (and being impaled), Spirit actually takes on a visible form (not the sprite this time) and controls Rey like a puppet. He is able to unleash powerful attacks without the use of the PaSa sword and Rey only regains his senses seconds before he would have taken off Shyao's head. *Volume 9, When Louen and Moa meet Rey, there are still markings all over his face and he wears a bandage over one eye because it is still demonic from the last possession. Spirit can now maintain a physical form when not possessing Rey but Rey has insight into his memories against his will. The PaSa sword can travel long distances now without Rey. *Volume 14, During the battle against the Sorcerer King, Ban-Go's spirit is partially awoken. Rey's entire body is turned black with the exception of his left eye. He later in the battle uses the \\"Armor of Creation\\", giving Rey armor on his left side. He loses the demon stone in his forehead after the battle with the sorcerers because all of his powers have become one, according to the PaSa sword spirit. Ban-Go Ban- go is the creator God that formed the universe at the dawn of time. It is said that his body formed the earth while his spirit rose up and formed the heavens while his soul took in everything evil and became the demon realm. Shiyan put Ban-Go's soul in Rey hoping that his brother which is the Pasa sword spirit would take over Rey when the power awakened so they could exact there revenge on the Demon emperor that betrayed them. Relationships *Shyao: Rey very clearly is in love with Shyao, though she has tried to kill him. After she failed to kill him, he was heartbroken and would rather not meet her again. *Hyacia: He does not seem to have the same feeling for 'Hyacia', as she clearly does. Though he gets horribly flustered when embarrassed in front of her. Later it is hinted that he has fallen for her, since he called her \\"someone he cares\\".

Themes iGoogle with the Winter Scape theme. With iGoogle, users could select unique themes for their Google homepages; some themes were designed by Google itself and others by third parties. Experimental iGoogle On July 8, 2008, Google announced the beginning of a testing period for a new version of iGoogle which altered some features, including replacing the tabs with left navigation, adding chat functionality, and a canvas-view gadget for RSS.Experimental iGoogle features Users were selected for this test and notified when they logged in by a link to a brief description and further links to forums. On the forums, it was explained by Google staff that there was no opt-out, as a control for the test. Further, there was no information on how long the test would continue. On the main discussion thread, almost 600 users expressed dissatisfaction with the new version and with the inability to opt out. On October 16, 2008, Google announced the release of a new version of iGoogle and retired its older format. The release did not initially include the persistent chat widget. It did include the left navigation in place of tabs as well as a change to widget controls, however. The stated purpose was to prepare for OpenSocial, with the new canvas view stated as playing an important role in that. InformationWeek reported \\"a vocal group of users\\" as unhappy with the changes, pointing out that many users do not want change forced on them, and that this is a general problem with cloud software under a service provider's control. A workaround to restore the original tab layout was found by attaching \\"?gl=all\\" to the end of the iGoogle URL. On June 4, 2009, this workaround was eliminated. Within days, another workaround was discovered. Changing the URL ending to \\"?hl=all\\" would again restore the original tab layout, with some missing links across the top of the home page, including \\"Maps\\" and \\"more\\". This workaround was again eliminated on November 18, 2009. This led to an immediate resurrection of the controversy over user choice, both in the UK and worldwide, as many people unhappy with the new layout imposed on US users had switched to the UK Google site where the workarounds still worked. Within hours, the most frequently asked question on the help forum was how to restore the old layout, and there was a large number of feature suggestions to the same effect on the Google product ideas page. Other solutions had come to the fore, which require adds-ons, greasemonkey scripts or bookmarklets. Discontinuation On October 14, 2011, Google announced through its official blog that with its new focus on Google+, the ability to interact socially on iGoogle would be disabled on January 15, 2012, and the mobile version of iGoogle would be shut down on July 31, 2012.Google blog/Blogspot; iGoogle's social interaction will be disabled but its non-social applications will stay as announced on Google's official blogGoogle Support; What's happening to iGoogle?

He has been a Visiting Artist at Cooper Union, NYU ITP Program and ICP/Bard College, and taught at Pratt Institute and SUNY Old Westbury. In 2019, his work was part of the Textile Biennial at the Rijswijk Museum in the Netherlands. His work has been discussed in The Observer, Art Fag City, VICE, Time Out New York, The Washington Post, and in the New York Times.  Influences  Textiles, soft sculpture and folk art practices influence Smith‚Äôs works, and he often blends these forms within a single piece. Speculative fiction and comic book narratives are a lens through which Smith creates, and his works imagine future worlds, creatures, and societies as a way to envision decolonized space and reinvestigate notions of race, climate change and alternate states of consciousness. Smith writes: > ‚ÄúSci-fi narratives are very compelling to me - imagining stories and > persons, objects and creatures from other planets, VR realities, or star > systems. Digital technologies and image gathering help reveal these worlds > and continue a line of artistic questioning and layering until I get work > that exists in a 3D - an interactive and physically relational element, > creating viewer interconnectivity....revealing worlds and selves that might > be hidden beneath historical and preconceived notions of what something is > to invite the question of what something could be.‚Äù  Creation process  For Smith, every object, person or memory is informed by a cultural landscape, made of images, lived experiences, memories, gestures, and sound. He playfully offers the range of possibility within these experiences by bending, folding, and layering textiles with digital, sonic, found, and created images. The resulting works are referential and unfamiliar, creating a discombobulating effect for the viewer, whether a soft sculpture, a sound score or a performance.

The mutiny, on 15 February 1915, lasted nearly seven days. It resulted in the deaths of eight British officers and soldiers, two Malay officers and one soldier, 14 British civilians, five Chinese and Malay civilians and one German internee before it was finally quelled by British forces and Allied naval detachments. The reasons for the outbreak are complex and remain open to debate. Background 5th Light Infantry The 5th Light Infantry was a long established regiment in the Indian Army, dating from 1803. and had a good military record. It was initially known as the 2nd Battalion, 21st Bengal Native Infantry and was re-designated as the 42nd Bengal Native (Light) Infantry in 1843. After the Indian Mutiny, also known as the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the surviving Bengal regiments were renumbered in 1861 and consequently the 42nd became the 5th Bengal Native (Light) Infantry. Following army reforms, the word ‚Äò‚ÄôNative‚Äô‚Äô was dropped the regiment simply became known as the 5th Light Infantry. The regiment was well known for several battle honours, which included the Arakan, Afghanistan and Kandahar 1842, Ghunze 1842, Kabul and Moodkee, Ferozeshah and Sobroan 1857. It also fought in the Second Afghan War of 1879‚Äì80 and the Third Burmese War of 1885‚Äì87, which led to the British annexation of Burma and its tributary Shan states. Immediately prior to World War One, the regiment was employed in garrison duties in India. On 10 October 1914, the 5th Light Infantry was stationed in Nowgong when it was posted to Singapore to replace the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, which had been ordered to France. Unusually for 1914‚Äì15 the 5th Light Infantry was an entirely Muslim unit, mainly comprising Ranghars (Muslims of Rajput origin) and Pathans, commanded by British and Indian officers. Upon arrival in Singapore, the 5th Light Infantry was based in Alexandra Barracks. Disunity and discontent in regiment Even before its departure from India the 5th Light Infantry suffered from weak senior leadership and discord amongst its British officers (see details of Court of Inquiry report below). To compound the problem, the sepoys themselves were divided into two major cliques. One was led by the Subedar Major Khan Mohamed Khan and Subedar Wahid Ali and the other consisted of Subedar Dunde Khan plus Jamadar Chisti Khan and Abdul Ali Khan. According to the Court of Inquiry, discipline was compromised by this division and any particular policy innovation or other measure taken within the regiment was likely to be opposed by one faction or the other. The sepoys were also reportedly unable to adjust and adapt to the living conditions in their new environment. While in India, the sepoys had a constant supply of goat meat and milk but because it was difficult to receive a constant supply of goat in Singapore, they had to make do with a substitute ‚Äì chicken - and very little milk. The sepoys resorted to buying their own meat and milk to make up for the insufficient amounts they received and the use of the dollar versus the rupee irked them further. The Court of Inquiry report, as well as contemporary accounts of the mutiny, saw it to be essentially an isolated affair - resulting from internal problems arising within a single poorly-led unit on overseas service. The possibility of German or Turkish involvement was closely examined but otherwise wider political and social implications were generally ignored. Mutiny On 27 January 1915, Colonel Martin announced that the 5th Light Infantry was to be transferred to Hong Kong for further garrison duties, replacing another Indian regiment. However, rumours were circulated among the sepoys that they might instead be sent to Europe or to Turkey to fight against their Muslim co-religionists. Three Indian officers, Subedar Dunde Khan, Jemedar Christi Khan, and Jemedar Ali Khan, were later to be identified by a court of enquiry as key conspirators in the matter. When the final order to sail to Hong Kong aboard the Nile arrived in February 1915, they and other ringleaders among the sepoys decided that it was time to rebel. On the morning of 15 February, the General Officer Commanding Singapore addressed a farewell parade of the regiment, complimenting the sepoys on their excellent turnout and referring to their departure the next day, without mentioning Hong Kong as the destination. At 3:30 pm on the afternoon of the same day, four Rajput companies of the eight companies making up the 5th Light InfantryPhilip Mason, pages 426‚Äì427 \\"A Matter of Honour\\", mutinied. The mostly Pathan sepoys of the remaining four companies did not join the mutiny but scattered in confusion. Two British officers of the regiment were killed as they attempted to restore order. The mutineers divided themselves into three groups. A party of 100 went to obtain ammunition from Tanglin Barracks, where 309 Germans, including crew members from the German light cruiser SMS Emden, had been interned by the British. The mutineers fired on the camp guards and officers without warning, killing ten British guards, three Johore troops present in the camp and one German internee. Amongst the dead were Second Lieutenant John Love Montgomerie, Rifles; Sergeant G. Wald, (Reserve) Engineers; Corporal D. McGilvray, Rifles; Corporal G.O. Lawson, Cyclist Scouts; Lance Corporal J.G.E. Harper, Rifles; Private B.C. Cameron, Rifles; Private F.S. Drysdale, Rifles; Private A.J.G. Holt, Rifles and Stoker 1st Class C. F. Anscombe, HMS Cadmus. Three British and one German were wounded but survived the attack, as did eight Royal Army Medical Corps personnel in the camp hospital, including one who managed to escape under heavy fire to raise the alarm. The mutineers tried to persuade the Germans to join them, but many of the latter were shaken by the sudden violence and reluctant to do so. Some German sailors and reservists wanted to join with the mutineers, but the majority adopted a neutral stance, refusing to accept rifles from the Indians. Thirty-five Germans escaped but the rest remained in the barracks. As it was the middle of the Chinese New Year, most of the Chinese Volunteers Corps were on leave, leaving Singapore almost defenceless against the mutiny. The British government was caught unprepared, and other mutineers went on a killing spree at Keppel Harbour and Pasir Panjang, killing 18 European and local civilians. Martial law was imposed and every available man from HMS Cadmus went ashore to join with British, Malay and Chinese Volunteer units and the small number of British regular troops forming part of the garrison. British Vice-Admiral Sir Martyn Jerram sent a radio message requesting help from any allied warships nearby. A group of mutineers laid siege to the bungalow of the commanding officer of the 5th Light Infantry, Lieutenant-Colonel E. V. Martin, which effectively blocked the route into Singapore Town. Martin and a detachment of the hastily mobilised Malay States Volunteer Rifles held out through the night of the 15th, under sporadic fire. Loyal sepoys who tried to join them were ordered to \\"go to a safe place\\" to prevent them from being confused in the dark with mutineers. With daylight, the defenders were successful in retaking the regimental barracks, at the cost of one killed and five wounded. The mutineers scattered, and despite sniper fire, the general population stayed calm while volunteers, sailors and marines fought sporadic skirmishes with the mutineers. Malay States Guides Attached to the 5th Light Infantry at Alexandra Barracks were a detachment of 97 Indian officers and men of the Malay States Guides (MSG) Mule Battery. Raised in 1896 for the internal garrisoning of the Federated Malay States, the regiment was recruited from Sikhs, Pathans and Punjabis in both India and Malaya. The British officer commanding the battery was shot dead by an unknown sniper as he hastened to the gun park. The MSG gunners then dispersed when a large body of 5th Light Infantry mutineers approached their lines. The MSG artillery pieces were abandoned but not brought into action by the mutineers. Seven men of the MSG were subsequently arrested in Outram Road, Singapore while they were carrying rifles, which had been fired. They were court-martialed and sentenced to a year in prison. Killing of women civilians Among the civilian fatalities during the mutiny were thirteen British men; one British woman, Mrs. G.B. Woolcombe (her death was later assumed by the British authorities to have possibly been unintended); two Chinese women; one Chinese man; and two Malay men. The fact that only one British woman was killed was often ignored in the reports that followed the mutiny. For instance, in a long letter detailing her experience during the mutiny, a British woman who was an eyewitness to the incident misleadingly wrote in to The Times that the sepoys had \\"deliberately shot at every European man or woman they saw\\" and that \\"21 English men and women were buried yesterday\\" (26 March 1915). Sir Evelyn Ellis, a member of the Legislative Council in Singapore and of the official court of enquiry that investigated the mutiny, publicly described the revolt as \\"part of a scheme for the murder of women and children\\". More than 15 years later, in 1932, a journalist in Penang, George Bilainkin, wrote that during the mutiny, the sepoys had \\"knifed and shot white men and women indiscriminately\\". As recently as 1989, CM Turbull erroneously wrote that during the mutiny, the sepoys roaming the streets were ‚Äò‚Äôkilling any Europeans they encountered‚Äô‚Äô. Final suppression On 17 February, the French cruiser Montcalm, followed by the Russian auxiliary cruiser Orel and Japanese warships Otowa and Tsushima arrived. Seventy-five Japanese sailors, twenty-two Russians and 190 French marines were landed to round up mutineers who had taken refuge in the jungle to the north of Singapore. They were joined in this operation by sixty soldiers of the 36th Sikhs who were passing through Singapore, plus Singaporean police, British sailors and Malay States Volunteer Rifles. Lacking strong leadership, the mutiny had started to lose direction ‚Äì a large number of the mutineers surrendered immediately, and the rest scattered in small groups into the jungles. Many tried to cross the Strait of Johore, but were quickly rounded up by the Royal Johor Military Force. While local media spoke of serious battles there were in fact only minor skirmishes between the allied landing parties and the now demoralized mutineers. By the evening of 17 February, 432 mutineers had been captured. On 20 February, companies of the 1st/4th Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry (Territorials) arrived from Rangoon to relieve the sailors and the marines. They succeeded in quickly rounding up the last of the mutineers. Russian role and reservations News of the mutiny reached the Russian Consul-General in Singapore, N.A. Rospopov, on the morning of 16 February 1915 through a Russian citizen who was a patient at a charity hospital in Singapore. As offices were closed for Chinese New Year and the town in a state of siege, Rospopov had difficulty finding formal and conclusive information about the mutiny through official sources. It was only a day later, on 17 February, that the Russians, having been advised by their Japanese allies, dispatched the Orel to assist the British in putting down the mutiny. It was only on the 18 February that Rospopov eventually received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and another from the Commander of the Russian Pacific Squadron, Admiral Schulz (ru), instructing the Orel to depart quickly for Singapore from Penang and to exercise \\"extreme caution and military preparedness en route\\". The Orel brought with it 40 men, 2 machine-guns, and a doctor. Within 15 minutes of its arrival, the Russians were preparing for military action at the end of the railway line in the northern part of Singapore to intercept any fleeing mutineers. The Russians were successful in capturing an estimated 180 mutineers. On 25 February a detachment of twenty-two Russian sailors had skirmished with sepoys. The latter dispersed but later that evening exchanged heavy fire with a picket of five Russians, wounding two.As a result of the incident, published works on the 1915 mutiny described that the Russians \\"among all the Allies‚Ä¶ had the closest encounter with near disaster avoided\\". Besides military involvement, the Orel also temporarily provided shelter for some of the residents who had evacuated the town. Rospopov reported on the 21 February that the Orel had to unexpectedly take in 42 women and 15 children abroad as a fire had broken out on board their other ship. Although the Russians were quick to come to the aid of the British, the Anglo-Russian relationship was fraught with an underlying sense of distrust rooted in a long-standing history of competition. Just decades before the mutiny of 1915, Russia and Britain were already locked in imperialist rivalry. Spurred by the last tsar's Asiatic Mission and his visit to South East Asia as part of his world tour of 1891, the Russian government appointed its first ethnic-Russian Consul, V. Vyvodtsev, to Singapore as early as 1890. The Russian presence in Southeast Asia during the last quarter of the 19th century was meant not only to safeguard its economic and strategic position in China but also to carefully observe the designs and advances of its imperialist rivals in the region, foremost among them being the British empire. Anglo-Russian relationship took a turn for the worse during the latter half of the 19th century when both Britain and Russia were locked in competition for Afghanistan and Persia as well as when Britain halted Russian advancement into the Balkans and Turkey. Britain's alignment with Japan as ally worsened Anglo- Russian relationship with the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese war of 1904‚Äì05. This history of suspicion and rivalry explains why Rospopov sent a secret telegram on 21 February expressing his reservations at placing the Orel and its accompanying men and guns under the command of the British military in Singapore. Eventually the French admiral was able to assuage the fears of Rospopov and assured him that Russian aid at this point would serve as a good means to strengthen Anglo-Russian relation. When the mutiny was finally quelled, the Russian captain Vinokurov reportedly remarked to the British Governor to Singapore that the Russian assistance in suppressing the mutiny \\"would unite the two countries better than any treaty\\". Japanese role and reservations On 16 February 1915, the Third Squadron of the Japanese Navy received a telegram from the Military Attach√© Araki Jiro via Ma-Kung in the Formosa Straits (the main base of the Squadron) requesting Japanese help. The Otowa and Tsushima were sent immediately for Singapore. Although help was sent and well received by the British Navy in Singapore, the Japanese Navy was hesitant about doing so initially. Commanding Officer of the Third Squadron, Rear Admiral Tsuchiya Mitsukane had apparently expressed his displeasure in dispatching help as he believed that being a signatory of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, Japan should not interfere in the internal affairs of another country without attaching collateral conditions. Also, Tsuchiya had recalled how a British ship once anchored at Chilung refused to help put down a Taiwanese revolt on Japan. Seeing that Tsuchiya had no choice but to follow orders from the Japanese Government and Naval Headquarters, Tsuchiya secretly advised his land force not to kill or wound any Sepoy intentionally but to simply encourage them to surrender as the former had no enmity with the latter. According to The General Staff of the British Military Headquarters, ‚Äúin reality the Japanese did not do much‚Ä¶and it was found desirable to disband them as early as possible‚Äù.This was apparently in reference to the organisation by their consul-general of 190 armed special constables from the Japanese community in Singapore. However, from the point of view of Japanese politicians, Japan's entry into the mutiny was also a form of projecting Japanese power and strength in the region. Inquiry and public executions The public executions of convicted sepoy mutineers at Outram Road, Singapore, On 23 February 1915, a Court of Inquiry was held, at first meeting in camera but then in public sessions. It prepared a 450-page report dated 15 May 1915. Although extensive discord amongst both officers and men of the 5th Light Infantry was identified, the cause of the mutiny was not conclusively established. The focus of the report was on possible external German influences, plus internal regimental causes of the mutiny. More than 205 sepoys were tried by court-martial, and 47 were publicly executed, including Kassim Mansoor. Most soldiers killed were Muslims from the Hisar district and Rohtak district of current Haryana state of India. Nur Alam Shah was not put on trial, although he was exposed as an active Indian nationalist with links to Ghadar. Instead, he was detained and deported, as the British did not want to stir up trouble among their Muslim subjects. Sixty-four mutineers were transported for life, and 73 were given terms of imprisonment ranging from 7 to 20 years. The public executions by firing squad took place at Outram Prison, and were witnessed by an estimated 15,000 people. The Straits Times reported: The remnants of the 5th Light Infantry, numbering 588 sepoys plus seven British and Indian officers, left Singapore on 3 July 1915 to see active service in the Cameroons and German East Africa. They were not accompanied by Colonel Martin, who was heavily criticised by a court of inquiry and then retired from the Army. In 1922 the 5th Light Infantry was disbanded. Much the same fate befell the Malay States Guides; they were sent to Kelantan in Malaya to quell Tok Janggut's uprising at Pasir Puteh in April 1915. Afterwards the Guides were sent to fight in Africa and were disbanded in 1919. Causes Ineffectiveness of commanding officer The specifically military grievances that led to the mutiny of the 5th Light Infantry centred on the personality of the commanding officer at the time, Lieutenant-Colonel E. V. Martin. He had been promoted from major in the regiment, but the previous colonel had reported that he was unpopular with his fellow officers and that he inspired little respect among the men. His appointment led to disunity amongst the British officers, which was reflected by division among the Indian officers over the promotion to commissioned rank of a colour-havildar. The issues, which might, under ordinary circumstances, have been of limited impact, were aggregated by the disruptive external influences of the Ghadar Party propaganda noted above and the entry of Turkey into the war. According to the Court of Inquiry, 'the prime cause of this lamentable episode' was the responsibility of Colonel Martin. Described as a \\"loner\\" for whom officers had little respect, Martin's primary fault was that he was too trusting, to the point of naivety. While he cared for the welfare of his men and saw that their living conditions were improved, he was described as being too much of a \\"soldier‚Äôs friend\\", to the point that other British officers found that this attitude and work ethic of Martin's severely undermined their authority over the sepoys. Over time, that served to erode the respect that the British officers and even the sepoys had for him. Colonel Egerton at the India Office commented that the British officers serving under Colonel Martin were comparable to \\"sheep without a shepherd\\", avoiding and avoided by Martin whom they should have looked to for guidance. The sepoys were accused of deftly noticing this discontent and disunity among their British officers and then taking advantage of it to mutiny. Role of pan-Islamism Within less than a week of the mutiny, a Court of Inquiry was set up to investigate and collect evidence for the trial for the mutineers. Although the Court of Inquiry was meant to take place behind closed doors, as accordance with standard military procedures, the proceeding was held in public instead. According to Harper and Miller this was to give the public the impression that the mutineers ‚Äúwere being tried for mutiny and shooting with intent to kill and not, as alleged for refusal to go to Turkey\\". Although the Court of Inquiry was clearly trying to downplay the link between Turkey and the mutiny, with the declassification of new documents and evidence, another perception has emerged in explaining the cause of the mutiny and that is the role of pan-Islamism. Contrary to official British colonial authorities, the mutiny was not an isolated case of a purely local affair but was instead part of a wider anti-British and pro- Muslim battle. When Turkey decided to join in the war on the side of the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy), the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed V. Reshad (1844‚Äì1918) declared a jihad against the Allied Powers (Britain, France and Russia) and issued a fatwa calling on Muslims all around the world to throw their lot with the Caliphate. This move had a huge impact on Muslims throughout the world as the Ottoman Sultan was revered as the Caliph of Islam and long considered by Indian Muslims as the final bulwark of Muslim power following the collapse of the Mughal empire in India. Overnight, Muslims serving under the British Army, such as the sepoys, faced an existential dilemma and their loyalty being torn between their ummah (community, brotherhood) and their British colonial superiors. For the Muslim sepoys in the 5th Light Infantry, interaction with Kasim Mansur, who was an Indian Muslim merchant in Singapore, served to fuel this sense of divided loyalties further. Kasim Mansur together with a local imam, Nur Alam Shah, would often host members of the 5th Light Infantry at Mansur's home and it was then that the duo persuaded the Muslim sepoys to adhere to the fatwa issued by the Ottoman Sultan and to turn their guns against their British commanding officers and contribute towards the war against these kafirs who were battling their Muslim brothers who were defending the Caliphate in the West. It was within this context that the plan was hatched for the mutiny. Global connection It is difficult to identify any one reason as being the main cause or catalyst of the mutiny. However, a recent perspective has emerged of the role of global connections. The mutiny had revealed the permeable nature of colonial boundaries and the way that external influences affected the British possessions in Southeast Asia. The sepoys of the 5th Light Infantry were constantly receiving information about what was happening outside of Singapore. As news of the fatwa issued by the Ottoman Sultan spread, an anti- British movement spearheaded by the Ghadar Party was also disseminating special pamphlets in a variety of languages which were reaching through secret channels into the hands of the sepoys. Acrimonious slogans against the British only fuelled the anti-colonial sentiment among the sepoys. Some of the slogans were ‚Äúthe wicked English and their allies are now attacking Islam, but the German Emperor and the Sultan of Turkey have sworn to liberate Asia from the tyranny. Now is the time to rise.... Only your strength and religious zeal are required‚Äù. The sepoys were clearly being bombarded with a lot of anti-British sentiments while being stationed on the small island of Singapore. There was also awareness in Singapore of the Komagata Maru incident in which Canadian authorities refused to allow a ship with 376 Indian passengers to land and forced them to stay aboard for 2 months in difficult conditions. On its way back to India, while the ship docked in Singapore, the governor-general of Singapore remarked that ‚Äúthough the ship had no communication with the land, yet it left a bad effect‚Äù on the Indian troops stationed there. It appears that information was reaching the sepoys through a wide range of channels, from origins as diverse and distant as North America, Britain, the Ottoman Empire and India. Much of this information was obtained locally, but even so it was being mediated through a host of international and external actors, including a wide array of Indians from across the subcontinent, British officers and Arab and Malay coreligionists. Aftermath Tablet at the entrance of the Victoria Memorial Hall, Singapore Setting up of Special Branch Unit and other related initiatives The 1915 mutiny was a watershed event in the way that the British viewed security in their Malayan colonies. More importance than ever was placed on political intelligence, espionage, and the surveillance of potential subversives. Following the mutiny, a political intelligence bureau was established in Singapore under direct command and control of Major General Dudley Howard Ridout, General-Officer-Commanding (GOC) Singapore. This eventually paved the way for the formation of the Criminal Intelligence Department (Special Branch) was set up in 1919. Other institutions were also formed with the purpose of providing feedback and monitoring activities on the ground. To enhance the protection of its crown colony further from internal skirmishes and attacks, in August 1915, the legislative council passed the Reserve Force and Civil Guard Ordinance. This was the first Act passed in a British colony which imposed compulsory military service on all male subjects between the ages 15 to 55 who were not in the armed forces, volunteers, or police. Additionally, a Reserve force in the Volunteer Corps was created for fit men over the age 40. From the slew of new initiatives enforced, it was clear that the British had taken the debacle of the mutiny as a serious lesson to learn from and to prevent from happening again. In literature Currently, there are only two fictional works in English that deal with the subject of the Singapore mutiny. The first is Isobel Mountain's novel, A Maiden in Malaya, written shortly after the mutiny in 1919. The other is Rogue Raider: The Tale of Captain Lauterbach and the Singapore Mutiny, written in 2006. Both stories deal with very different narratives. In Mountain's novel, the plot revolves around the romantic story between the protagonist Elizabeth Tain and Peter Fenton a rubber planter. The author, however, projects the mutineers in a standard imperial or colonialist interpretation, with the mutineers being painted in wholly unattractive colours, with no redeeming qualities while hinting at their lustful nature. Mountain's representation of the sepoys can be considered an echo of the colonial reportage of the rogue sepoys. Barley, however, took on a humorous tone and revolved around the adventures of the Captain Julius Lauterbach of the German Imperial Navy. Once again, the humorous nature of the book underplays and potentially undermines the actual set of events. Supported by the Singapore Film Commission and the Singapore High Commission in India, Daljit Ami made an Objectifs Residency-sponsored 2017 feature-length documentary Singapore Mutiny ‚Äì A Reclamation in English and Saada Singapore in Punjabi. Commemoration To commemorate the event and those British soldiers and civilians killed during the mutiny, two memorial tablets were erected at the entrance of the Victoria Memorial Hall and four plaques in St Andrew's Cathedral. In addition, three roads were later named in memory of three of the casualties as Walton Road, Harper Road, Holt Road, after Gunner Philip Walton of the Singapore Volunteer Artillery, Corporal J. Harper and Private A.J.G. Holt respectively.

Founding associations came from Austria, Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the UK, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway. Meetings and informal collaboration between industries had begun in 1948, and although initially created as an informal club without any financial demands, the organisation became increasingly structured and eventually developed a secretariat in the early 1950s. Various other engineering groups had been created at the same time as the European Coal and Steel Community developed, such as MEFTA and COLIME. Orgalim members decided in 1960 to incorporate the groups into Orgalim as working groups.https://www.orgalim.eu/news/rich-heritage-european-collaboration Orgalim has since been registered on the Transparency Register operated jointly by the European Commission and the European Parliament.http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=20210641335-88 Overview Orgalim is an international not-for-profit association with its legal seat in Brussels.

Orgalim's work on compliance, standards and enforcement focuses on promoting improvements to the EU's New Legislative Framework, the cornerstone of Internal Market legislation since 2008. A key priority for the organisation has been to uphold and strengthen what is known as the ‚ÄòNew Approach‚Äô to technical harmonisation and standards, which recognises that standards are a voluntary, end-user-driven and private compliance tool ‚Äì an approach that gives flexibility to producers while reducing administrative burden. Orgalim's work covers a wide spectrum of product-specific EU legislation addressing the health and safety of professional end-users and consumers. The organisation's work on legal issues aims to ensure a stable regulatory environment for the technology companies, focusing for example on liability and redress framework, contract law and protection of intellectual property rights. Orgalim's work in R&D; and innovation focuses on ensuring that EU R&D;&I; programmes such as Horizon Europe prioritise funding for applied industrial research and strengthen collaboration between academia and industry.

He is currently the Chief Executive Officer and Co- Founder of Planet illogica, an online creative community for artists and art organizations. and California Christiania Republic clothing brand. Biography Tonny Sorensen was born on March 9, 1964 in Copenhagen, Denmark. He earned a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronic Engineering from the University of Copenhagen, and a degree in Business and Trade from a Copenhagen trade school. Sorensen was a member of Denmark's Taekwondo team at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, and won a Gold Medal in the Heavyweight division of the 1991 World Taekwondo Championships in Athens, Greece. Sorensen subsequently owned the Gladsaxe dojo in Denmark, an elite school that produced several Taekwondo world champions. Sorensen moved to the United States in 1991, settling in Los Angeles, where he studied acting, screenwriting and filmmaking. In 1998 he co-produced the 1998 movie American Intellectuals, starring Portia de Rossi. Sorensen's renegade style of management earned him a reputation as a rebel in the world of fashion. His \\"one-second rule,\\" in which he instantly decides on whether or not to pursue a new project, design or program, led to the global phenomenon that was the Trucker Cap.  Kustom Kulture and Von Dutch Originals  The Trucker Cap, popularized by Von Dutch Originals under the leadership of Tonny SorensenIn the mid-1990s, Sorensen purchased a hot rod Cadillac and became involved in Southern California car culture. Sorensen's Venice mechanic introduced him to the art and design of Kenny \\"Von Dutch\\" Howard the father of the Kustom Kulture movement that has heavily influenced the fashion and style of hot rodding, surf culture, skateboarding and rock 'n' roll. Intrigued by Howard, Sorensen set-out to make a film about Von Dutch's life, which led him to Michael Cassel, who had earlier acquired the rights to reproduce the iconic \\"Von Dutch\\" signature and imagery from Howard's heirs and had established Von Dutch Originals. Sorensen invested in Von Dutch Originals in 2000 and became its CEO, opening the Von Dutch Melrose Avenue retail location that same year. Sorensen expanded Von Dutch from a niche T-shirt and hat line to a full-scale fashion collection adding hoodies, jeans and accessories. Sorensen rapidly grew the business, opening stores in Las Vegas, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Chicago and Miami, with wholesale distribution to Japan, Canada and Europe. Von Dutch Originals used high-level product placements and celebrity involvement to propel the brand. In the height of the brand's popularity, Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, and Ashton Kutcher were regularly photographed wearing the Von Dutch trucker hat. Sales reached $33 million in 2003, and as high as $100 million in 2004. Von Dutch Originals was sold to Groupe Royer S.A. in 2009. In 1996 he had his first daughter named nadja sorensen  Planet illogica  Influenced by the free and open trade mentality of Freetown Christiania, an artist enclave near Copenhagen, and his success as a brand entrepreneur at Von Dutch, Sorensen was inspired to build an online artistic community. In 2007 he partnered with Ken Goldstein, founder of marketing agency Six Shooter LA, and formerly Marketing Director of Von Dutch, to form Planet illogica, an online collaborative tool for artists. The site launched in July 2009 with the help of the American Film Institute's Digital Content Lab. The site and organization are designed to serve as a tool to help artists create, promote and sell their work, and build collaborative relationships with other artists and commercial brands. Planet illogica's business model relies on product sales and licensing of user-generated content, Borrowing on Sorensen's earlier experience with Von Dutch, Planet illogica focuses on the commercial intersection between emblematic art and brand associations with that art, deliberately fostering relationships between art, brand imagery and commercial advertising. Planet illogica also serves as a vehicle for Sorensen to scout and develop talent.

See also glanders and equine lymphangitis.  Classification  In the United Kingdom it is a notifiable disease; the OIE no longer classifies it as a Listed Disease.  Symptoms  Epizootic lymphangitis usually presents with the following symptoms: * Skin eruption, usually on legs, occasionally head or neck, rarely other body parts. * The lymph vessels in the skin stand out prominently, and small hard nodules approximately 1 cm (1/2\\") in diameter appear on their course. * The nodules suppurate forming abscesses and discharge a thick yellow pus. Proud flesh grows from the wounds, the lymph vessels around being inflamed, and the eruption gradually extends. * The neighbouring glands are swollen and hard. The ulcers heal with difficulty, even under treatment, and they may break out again after an apparent cure had been effected.DEFRA (UK)  Diagnosis  This disease is distinguished from glanders/farcy by the presence of the Histoplasma organisms in the pus, and failure of the mallein test to produce a reaction. Both Glanders and epizootic lymphangitis may be present in the same animal. Serology can be used to assist diagnosis.  Control  Control of the disease is usually through elimination of the infection. This is achieved by culling infected horses and application of strict hygiene practices to prevent spread of the organism. Vaccination has been used on a limited scale in areas where enzootic lymphangitis is endemic, e.g. Iraq, but is not authorised for widespread use.OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals (2004), Chapter 2.5.13  References  Category:Animal fungal diseases Category:Horse diseases ","title":"Epizootic lymphangitis"},{"id":"11764295","text":"contra!'

The town has extensive European history, first built on in 1889, and now hosts a large expanse of oyster farms, one of the largest on the Eyre Peninsula. History The bay which the town is named after initially mapped by Matthew Flinders in 1802, as part of a wider attempt to map South Australia's coastline. Flinders named the inlet \\"Denial Bay\\" because of \\"the deceptive hope we had formed of penetrating by it some distance into the interior of the country\\". The first European exploration of the hinterland was in August 1839 by John Hill and Samuel Stephens, using the chartered brig Rapid as a base.Register, 26 October 1839, pp.5 and 17. The town was established by William McKenzie in 1889 as the first settlement in what was to become the Ceduna area. McKenzie nearly single- handedly set up the town, clearing mallee scrub by axe, building a general store and becoming the local harbour master, postman, blacksmith, butcher, saddler and Justice of the Peace, employing up to 30 people at any one time. The town established primarily as a loading and offloading point for the various inland farming activities, and this was done using a unique system based on the rocky floor of the bay's seabed. A large wooden platform known as 'McKenzie's Landing' was constructed and at high tide, boats would unload goods onto the platform and at low tides horse and cart would be used to collect the items. The same would be done to load boats. The town was surveyed during December 1909 and proclaimed under the name McKenzie on 16 June 1910 presumably after William McKenzie. The town was officially renamed as Denial Bay on 19 September 1940. During this peak of activity, a school opened in 1897 and continued operation until 1945. In 1909, a jetty was constructed south of McKenzie's Landing after a 1905 proposal, and still stands today. Another piece of history at Denial Bay is the famous dog fence which runs down to the water near McKenzie's Landing. The town has long since ceased functioning as a port, and today relies on the aquaculture industry, as well as tourism. Economy The economy of Denial Bay now depends heavily on the production of Oysters by aquaculture, as well as minor inputs from tourism. Oyster farming was established in the area in 1985, with 105 Ha of intertidal farms allocated to farmers within the bay. The maximum size per individual farm was 10 Ha. This has since increased to over 200 Ha in Denial and Murat Bays. The oysters grown in both the Denial Bay and Smoky Bay regions account for approximately 20% of all oysters grown in the state. The oyster growing industry is celebrated each year during 'Oysterfest' in Ceduna. Tourism in the town is centred around recreational fishing and other marine based activities such as snorkelling, scuba diving, swimming and even surfing along some parts of the coast. The bay has an unusually high density of the Blue Swimmer Crab, making it a popular destination for crabbers, with crabs caught off the jetty or by boat. Other notable species caught in the bay include Snapper, King George and Yellowfin Whiting, Salmon, Mulloway, Shark and Squid, as well as a host of other species. Media A newspaper, the Denial Bay Starter, a weekly paper issued every Saturday, was printed in Denial Bay from 14 November 1908 to 29 January 1910. Facilities Denial Bay is a very small town, and as such has very limited facilities. The town does have a small general store that sells petrol and groceries, with a public payphone located nearby. A full range of shopping and business services is located in Ceduna only 12 kilometres away by sealed road. The town has very little in the way of accommodation, sporting grounds, eateries or other services.

Born in Edgbaston, Birmingham, he was the only child of Frank Dudley Docker, an English businessman and financier. Career Docker was the managing director of the Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA) group of companies from the early 1940s until 1956. He also chaired The Daimler Company Limited and the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company. He became noted during the 1950s for producing show cars, such as the \\"Golden Daimler\\" (1952), \\"Blue Clover\\" (1953), \\"Silver Flash\\" (1953), and \\"Stardust\\" (1954). He was succeeded by Jack Sangster as Chairman of BSA, following a 1956 boardroom coup. He also served as the chairman of the British Hospitals Association. First marriage Docker's first wife was Jeanne Stuart (n√©e Ivy Sweet), a British actress. They married in 1933, but the marriage was soon dissolved after pressure from Docker's parents. His father had her tracked by private detectives, and after finding her with actor David Hutcheson, Docker divorced her. MY Shemara MY Shemara seen at Southampton Docks. Docker commissioned John I. Thornycroft & Company to build a yacht to his specifications. The yacht was completed in 1938 and christened MY Shemara. MY Shemara was requisitioned by the Royal Navy at the start of the Second World War in 1939 and used as a training vessel for anti-submarine warfare. It was during a training exercise with HMS Shemara that the submarine HMS Untamed was lost with all her crew. Shemara left RN service in 1946 Green Goddess 1949 Daimler DE 36 \\"Green Goddess\\" drophead Docker commissioned Hooper & Co. to build a drophead coup√© on a Daimler DE-36 chassis for display at the first post-war British International Motor Show at the Earls Court Exhibition Centre in 1948. Named the \\"Green Goddess\\" by the press, the car had five seats, three windscreen wipers, and hydraulic operation of both the hood and the hood cover. After the show, the car was further tested and refined, after which it was kept by Docker for his personal use. Six other chassis were bodied with similar bodies. These were all called \\"Green Goddesses\\" after the original, which was exhibited with jade-green coachwork and green-piped beige leather. Second marriage His second wife was Norah Collins (n√©e Norah Royce Turner), a former showgirl that he married in 1949 as her third husband. She was the widow of Sir William Collins, the president of Fortnum & Mason, and also the widow of Clement Callingham, the head of Henekeys wine and spirits merchants. The Dockers were often objects of ridicule because of the ostentatious flaunting of their wealth. In the 1950s, they bought and lavishly redecorated Glandyfi Castle in Wales. The comedian Frankie Howerd often referred to people as \\"looking a bit like Lady Docker\\". Docker Daimlers Blue Clover, the 1952 show car Golden Zebra, for the 1955 Paris Show Sir Bernard Docker commissioned a series of Daimlers that were built to Lady Docker's specifications for the show circuit. ;1951 ‚Äì The Gold Car (a.k.a. Golden Daimler) The Gold Car was a touring limousine on the Thirty-Six Straight-Eight chassis. The car was covered with 7,000 tiny gold stars, and all plating that would normally have been chrome was gold. This car was taken to Paris, the United States and Australia. ;1952 ‚Äì Blue Clover Also on the Thirty-Six Straight-Eight chassis, Blue Clover was a two-door sportsman's coup√©. ;1953 ‚Äì Silver Flash The Silver Flash was an aluminium-bodied coup√© based on the 3-litre Regency chassis. Its accessories included solid silver hairbrushes and red fitted luggage made from crocodile skin. ;1954 ‚Äì Star Dust based on the DF400 chassis ;1955 ‚Äì Golden Zebra The Golden Zebra was a two- door coup√© based on the DK400 chassis. Like the Gold Car, the Golden Zebra had all its metal trim pieces plated in gold instead of chrome, and it had an ivory dashboard and zebra-skin upholstery. Separation from Midland Bank In January 1953, the chairman of Midland Bank asked Docker for his resignation from the board of directors. Docker, who had been a director of Midland Bank since 1928, refused to resign. The board of Midland Bank notified its shareholders that they were to be asked to remove Docker from the board at the annual general meeting being held that February. The chairman stated that it was not in the bank's best interest to be associated with the publicity surrounding Docker, who replied to the shareholders that the publicity stemmed from three court proceedings, all of which had been either settled or found in his favour. In late January, Docker resigned from the board of Midland Bank with immediate effect, claiming there was a rumour of an impending charge for a currency offence. Separation from BSA At the end of May 1956, Docker was removed from the board of Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA), and he was replaced as chairman of BSA by Jack Sangster. The company, which owned the Docker Daimlers, had the Dockers return them. The issues leading to the removal of Docker stemmed from the extravagant expenses he presented to the company, including the show cars made available for Lady Docker's personal use, a ¬£5,000 gold and mink ensemble that Lady Docker wore at the 1956 Paris Motor Show that she tried to write off as a business expense as she \\"was only acting as a model\\" at the show, and Glandyfi Castle, bought with ¬£12,500 of BSA's money and refurbished for ¬£25,000, again with company money. Decline and death Without their main source of income, the Dockers began to run out of money. In 1965, Docker put Shemara on the market for ¬£600,000; it was eventually sold for ¬£290,000. In 1966, the Dockers sold their estate in Hampshire and moved to Jersey in the Channel Islands, becoming tax exiles. Docker was placed in a nursing home in 1976, where he died on 22 May 1978. He was buried beside his wife's grave site in the Callingham family plot in the churchyard of St James the Less, Stubbings, near Maidenhead in Berkshire. Clement Callingham, Lady Docker's first husband, had been buried on the other side of her grave site.

History  The company founder worked for the piano company Steinway & Sons in New York City, United States, before starting his own factory in Leipzig, Germany, in 1884. As business grew, the Zimmermann company expanded to a second factory in 1904. By 1912 over 10,000 pianos were being built a year making it one of the Europe‚Äôs largest piano manufacturers. Later, it became a global piano exporter within over 400,000 instruments sold world-wide. In 1992, C. Bechstein took over the company and incorporated it in its Product Range. Until 2011, Zimmermann pianos have been produced in Saxony like all Bechstein Instruments, where the Bechstein company regrouped its production facilities.

It is found largely in open areas of subarctic boreal forests, though it is also found in a wide variety of habitats in the region. It is similar in appearance to Eurybia merita, but their ranges overlap only near the border between the US and Canada, where E. sibirica is generally found at higher elevations. Eurybia sibirica is a perennial herb up to 60 cm (2 feet) tall, spreading by means of thin underground rhizomes. The plant produces flower heads either one at a time or in dense flat-topped arrays of 2-50 heads. Each head contains 12-50 white, purple, or pale violet ray florets surrounding 25-125 yellow disc florets. The involucral bracts are reddish-purple (anthocyanic).Hitchcock, C.L. and A.

Distribution and habitat Eurybia sibirica is present in much of the subarctic region of world, in northwestern North America and Northern Europe and Northern Asia. It is common in northern Asia (Buryatia, Yakutia, Mongolia, Japan, Chinese Province of Heilongjiang and other parts of North of China). It is also found in European Russia and Scandinavia, as well as northern and western Canada (Alberta, British Columbia, and all 3 Arctic provinces) and United States (Alaska plus the mountains of Washington, Idaho, and Montana). It is found at heights ranging from sea level up to 2200 metres in sandy or gravely soils in disturbed or open areas of boreal forests. It is also present in wet meadows, in open areas of aspen and spruce woods and along riparian thickets. In addition, it is common growing in sandy or gravelly stream flats, along stream banks and the shores of lakes, on bluffs, in sand dunes and other sandy places, and in both sub-alpine and mountain meadows. ;Subspecies *Eurybia sibirica subsp. sibirica *Eurybia sibirica subsp. subintegerrima (Trautv.)

They also are used as model organisms in various other biological fields e.g. due to their interesting reproductive mode in evolutionary ecology. Brachionus spp. are easily reared in large numbers and because of this are used to substitute for wild zooplankton for feeding hatchery reared larval fish. However, the composition of rotifers generally does not satisfy the nutritional requirements of fish larvae, and large amounts of research have been invested in improving the lipid, vitamin and mineral composition of rotifers to better meet the requirements of fish larvae Reproduction Brachionus species can normally reproduce sexually and asexually (cyclical parthenogenesis).

Its first name was Left Front - Workers Youth Alliance (Baloldali Front - Munk√°s Ifj√∫s√°gi Sz√∂vets√©g). The Baloldali Front has been a member of World Federation of Democratic Youth since 2004. History Founded on 14 March 1999, \\"Baloldali Front\\" was the first real communist youth movement since the cessation of the Hungarian Young Communist League (KISZ) in 1989. The founders wanted to re-establish that, so they transformed the youth department of the Workers' Party (Munk√°sp√°rt) into a new organization. The Front's first logo was a red tomato, which was later replaced by a claret- black coloured star. P√©ter Sz√©kely was elected as president in 2004. At the same time, the movement started to use the name \\"Communist Youth Alliance\\". With the leadership of P√©ter Sz√©kely, Baloldali Front was an important ally of the international movements. The solidarity with Latin America was significant. As Sz√©kely reached the 35 years age limit, he was replaced by Kinga Kalocsai. She continued his predecessor's politics: the Front demonstrated against the prohibition of KSM, the youth section of Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia, and declared solidarity with Palestine. In 2006, the crisis in the \\"Munk√°sp√°rt\\" reached the youth movement too - some members quit. The re-organisation was crucial. In 2008, a new president, Tam√°s Szab√≥ was elected. From then they focused on the political crisis of Hungary, not the international politics. Many Front members were candidates under the name of \\"Magyar Kommunista Munk√°sp√°rt\\" in the European Parliament election in 2009. The Front had a new logo, but because it looked like a deformed red star, which was restricted in Hungary, it was soon replaced by the modernised version of the former logo. In 2011, the presidency of the Front was dissolved, and they founded a new organisation, called \\"Radik√°l-Humanista Mozgalom\\" (Radical-Humanist Movement). Objectives The Front supports peace, opposes Hungary's NATO-membership, and the politics of the European Union. They demand the right to work, housing, and free clinics as fundamental rights. They want free, easily accessible education for everyone, and fight for the rights of students. Basic information It's free to join Baloldali Front for every Hungarian citizen between the age 14 and 35. (Between 35 and 45 they could be supporter members.) The Front's basic units are the basic organisations, which work at the local level. The leader of the Front is the National Bureau, led by the president.

History Smolenice Castle was built in the 15th century, but it was destroyed during R√°k√≥czi's War of Independence and Napoleanic wars. In 1777, Count J√°nos P√°lffy from Pezinok inherited Smolenice but did not reside in the castle due to its poor condition and lack of money for rebuilding it. The castle was only rebuilt in the 20th century, by order of Count J√≥zsef P√°lffy. The architect Jozef Hubert designed the new castle by using Kreuzenstein castle near Vienna as a model, and the works were controlled by the architect Pavol Reiter from Bavaria. During its construction there were masters from Italy, Germany, Austria and Hungary, and 60 workmen from Smolenice and nearby villages. The main building has two wings and a tower, and is made of ferroconcrete. The castle was damaged in the spring of 1945 during World War II, and in that same year the state became the owner of it. Some reconstructions have been made after 1950, and since June 26, 1953 the castle is property of the Slovak Academy of Sciences.

Brunetti has said he choose the name \\"FUCT\\" because it was a homophone of the expletive \\"fucked\\" and wanted people to question its pronunciation. FUCT has been referred to as one of the pioneering brands of modern streetwear, often incorporating various elements and icons of pop culture alongside anti-government and anti-religious campaigns into their designs including the use of parodied logos. Along with clothing manufactured for various markets, FUCT also produces a higher-end FUCT S.S.D.D. line of clothing exclusively for the Japanese market; S.S.D.D. being an acronym of \\"Same Shit Different Day\\". As of Oct. 7, 2020, fuct's website shows no products available for purchase.  History   Origins  FUCT was first conceptualized in 1990 by Erik Brunetti and Natas Kaupas in Brunetti's one-bedroom Venice Beach apartment. In a 2019 interview with fashion publication Hypebeast, Brunetti stated that the two ‚Äúthought it would be clever to call the brand FUCT and present it [as] very corporate, so you had to question the pronunciation of the name based on the way it looked.‚Äù FUCT's first logo was designed using software available on Brunetti's Macintosh Classic computer. In 1991, Kapas and Brunetti filed as a business under the name ‚ÄúFUCT Designs‚Äù. Shortly afterward, Kapas parted ways with the company. In 2002, Brunetti stepped away from the brand to focus on personal artistic endeavors before returning to the company in 2005. In 2013, publishing house Rizzoli released ‚ÄúFUCT‚Äù. The book was published as a retrospective of the brand's history published to coincide with its 20-year anniversary. The book, written by Brunetti, includes essays by Aaron Rose and Gary Warnett.  Advertising  Throughout the 1990s, the company rarely sold through the apparel trade shows popular at the time. Instead, FUCT chose to market through magazine editorials and full-page, printed advertisements in publications such as the skateboarding magazines Thrasher, Big Brother, and Strength. These advertisements were often self-effacing and controversial in nature, designed to play up FUCT's counter-cultural image. Many of these advertisements included Brunetti's personal phone number as the point of contact for wholesale purchases. In 1996, Fuct launched its e-commerce website, fuct.com. Fuct used this platform to experiment with selling and marketing their product. The brand's website included a catalog, a newsletter, customer support, and specific mail-in instructions for purchasing garments directly.  Skate culture  FUCT has thorough roots in skateboarding culture. Brunetti and Kaupas met through their mutual affiliation with skateboarding company, World Industries. In 1998, FUCT released its first and only skate video, Random Acts of Kindness. Shot in New York City and Los Angeles, the video followed the FUCT skate team in addition to numerous graffiti artists affiliated with the brand. The video was shot on VHS and has a 30-minute run-time.  Work and collaborations  Throughout the 1990s FUCT partnered with photographers Larry Clark and Shawn Mortenson on multiple campaigns. The subjects of Mortenson's campaigns include Kate Moss, Snoop Dogg, The Notorious B.I.G., and Keith Richards. In 1998, artist Kaws enlisted Brunetti to collaborate on an advertisement for design house Calvin Klein. In collaboration with Beastie Boys rapper Mike D‚Äôs clothing brand, X-Large, Fuct opened the doors of its first brick-and-mortar location, X-FUCT, in 1993. Located in Los Angeles, CA, X-FUCT‚Äôs interior was modeled to resemble a deli; this design included the use of repurposed deli meat counters as displays for the merchandise. X-FUCT released limited collaborative runs throughout the store‚Äôs operation in addition to stocking the brands‚Äô respective products. After X-FUCT closed, Brunetti resumed operation of FUCT at his Hollywood Hills home. In 2008, FUCT launched its SSDD (Same Shit, Different Day) line of merchandise in Japan. The design language incorporated motifs inspired by the American counter-cultural movements of the 1960s and 70's. In 2018, FUCT partnered with Los Angeles-based streetwear brand FTP to release a pair of collaborative capsules. In 2019, FUCT partnered with Richardson Magazine to release a capsule collection. The release included previous FUCT designs co- branded with the Richardson logo.  Cultural impact  FUCT is well known for appropriating pop-culture iconography into its own branding. Throughout its run, the brand has repurposed a wide range of iconography, often in a satirical manner. Brunetti's approach to satire established FUCT as a pillar of 90s counterculture, earning him a \\"reputation as one of the toughest streetwear designers in america\\". FUCT is thought to be one of the first clothing companies to experiment with CMYK printing on apparel. In 1992, FUCT released its ‚ÄúGoodfellas‚Äù T-shirt. The T-shirt features a portrait of the film's main cast, re-appropriated to include the brand's logo. The ‚ÄúGoodfellas‚Äù design is thought to be the first piece of streetwear to reference film as part of its branding. In 1999, The Face magazine named FUCT as one of the top forty iconic labels in fashion. In 2011, Complex Magazine ranked FUCT as the 7th greatest streetwear brand \\"of all time\\". In his ranking of the brand, author Bobby Hundreds stated there was \\"a reason why a good chunk of the top contenders [on the list had] stolen fragments of their identity from Brunetti's creations.\\" Larry Clark's personal collection of FUCT apparel added to the foundation of his exhibition, Printed Matter, installed at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles in 2013. The apparel exhibited by Clark was then purchased by Cornell University Library‚Äôs Rare Book and Manuscript department due to its cultural significance and affiliation with Clark's work. FUCT is known for its influence on other streetwear brands and fashion designers. The iconography used in A Bathing Ape's merchandise can be directly linked to graphics used in FUCT's Planet of the Apes designs. In its infancy, Shepard Fairey's streetwear brand Obey appropriated heavily from FUCT's design language, namely the latter's logo and graffiti-inspired imagery. Notable people who have worn FUCT clothing include Leonardo DiCaprio in the 2000 film, The Beach , Rihanna, Hailey Baldwin, and Billie Eilish. Musician Trent Reznor has been seen wearing FUCT apparel during studio recording sessions. In Nirvana's most famous band photoshoot, Dave Grohl can be seen wearing a FUCT baseball cap. Rage Against the Machine front- man Zach de la Rocha can be seen wearing FUCT's Ford Motors logo in the video for Bullet in the Head.  Supreme Court case  In 2011, Brunetti applied for a federal trademark for the brand name due to a number of knock-offs online. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office denied the trademark citing the power to ‚Äúscandalous‚Äù trademark applications through the Lanham Act. A federal appeals court in Washington ruled in his favor in 2017, but was appealed by the Trump administration, reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 24, 2019, in the case Iancu v. Brunetti, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that the Patent and Trademark Office cannot deny trademark registration due to a name being \\"immoral\\" or \\"scandalous,\\" citing that the provision infringes the First Amendment.https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/18-302.html https://www.justice.gov/osg/brief/iancu-v-brunetti-3  External links   Official Fuct Website (1998) * Available online at nuggs.cc  References  Category:Clothing brands of the United States Category:Companies established in 1990 Category:Companies based in Los Angeles ","title":"FUCT (clothing)"},{"id":"11764750","text":"frame A point diffraction interferometer (PDI) is a type of common-path interferometer. Unlike an amplitude-splitting interferometer, such as a Michelson interferometer, which separates out an unaberrated beam and interferes this with the test beam, a common-path interferometer generates its own reference beam. In PDI systems, the test and reference beams travel the same or almost the same path. This design makes the PDI extremely useful when environmental isolation is not possible or a reduction in the number of precision optics is required. The reference beam is created from a portion of the test beam by diffraction from a small pinhole in a semitransparent coating. The principle of a PDI is shown in Figure 1. The device is similar to a spatial filter. Incident light is focused onto a semi-transparent mask (about 0.1% transmission). In the centre of the mask is a hole about the size of the Airy disc, and the beam is focused onto this hole with a Fourier- transforming lens. The zeroth order (the low frequencies in Fourier space) then passes through the hole and interferes with the rest of beam. The transmission and the hole size are selected to balance the intensities of the test and reference beams. The device is similar in operation to phase-contrast microscopy.  Development in PDI systems  168x168px PDI systems are valuable tool to measure absolute surface characteristics of an optical or reflective instruments non destructively. The common path design eliminates any need of having a reference optics, which are known to overlap the absolute surface form of a test object with its own surface form errors. This is a major disadvantage of a double path systems, such as Fizeau interferometers, as shown in Figure 2. Similarly the common path design is resistant to ambient disturbances. The main criticisms of the original design are (1) that the required low-transmission reduces the efficiency, and (2) when the beam becomes too aberrated, the intensity on-axis is reduced, and less light is available for the reference beam, leading to a loss of fringe contrast. Lowered transmission was associated with lowered signal to noise ratio. These problems are largely overcome in the phase-shifting point diffraction interferometer designs, in which a grating or beamsplitter creates multiple, identical copies of the beam that is incident on an opaque mask. The test beam passes through a somewhat large hole or aperture in the membrane, without losses due to absorption; the reference beam is focused onto the pinhole for highest transmission. In the grating-based instance, phase-shifting is accomplished by translating the grating perpendicular to the rulings, while multiple images are recorded. The continued developments in phase shifting PDI have achieved accuracy orders of magnitude greater than standard Fizeau based systems. Phase-shifting [see Interferometry] versions have been created to increase measurement resolution and efficiency. These include a diffraction grating interferometer by Kwon and the Phase-Shifting Point Diffraction Interferometer.  Types of phase-shifting PDI systems   Phase-shifting PDI with single pinhole  FIgure 3: Phase-shifting point diffraction interferometer design proposed by Gary Sommargren Gary Sommargren proposed a point diffraction interferometer design which directly followed from the basic design where parts of the diffracted wavefront was used for testing and the remaining part for detection as shown in Figure 3. This design was a major upgrade to existing systems. The scheme could accurately measure the optical surface with variations of 1 nm. The phase shifting was obtained by moving the test part with a piezo electric translation stage.G. E. Sommargren, U.S. Patent No. 554840 1996 . An unwanted side effect of moving the test part is that the defocus also moves distorting the fringes. Another downsides of Sommargren's approach is that it produces low contrast fringes and an attempt to regulate the contrast also modifies the measured wavefront.  PDI systems using optical fibres  In this type of point diffraction interferometer the point source is a single mode fiber. The end face is narrowed down to resemble a cone and is covered with metallic film to reduce the light spill. Fibre is arranged so that they generate spherical waves for both testing and referencing. End of an optical fibre is known to generate spherical waves with an accuracy greater than \\\\lambda \\\\diagup 2000. Although optical fibre based PDIs provide some advancement over the single pinhole based system, they are difficult to manufacture and align. Figure 4: Two-beam phase-shifting point diffraction interferometer, where the reference beam can be independently regulated for phase shifting and contrast regulation  Two-beam phase- shifting PDI  Two-beam PDI provides a major advantage over other schemes by availing two independently steerable beams. Here, the test beam and reference beam are perpendicular to each other, where the intensity of reference can be regulated. Similarly, an arbitrary and stable phase shifts can be obtained relative to the test beam keeping the test part static. The scheme as shown in Figure 4 is easy to manufacture and provides user-friendly measuring conditions similar to Fizeau type interferometers. At the same time renders following additional benefits: # Absolute surface form of the test part. # High numerical aperture (NA = 0.55). # Clear fringe patterns of high contrast. # High accuracy of surface form testing (wavefront RMS error 0.125 nm). # Wave-front RMS repeatability 0.05 nm. # Can measure depolarising test parts. The device is self-referencing, therefore it can be used in environments with a lot of vibrations or when no reference beam is available, such as in many adaptive optics and short-wavelength scenarios. 254x254px  Applications of PDI  Interferometry has been used for various quantitative characterisation of optical systems indicating their overall performance. Traditionally, Fizeau interferometers have been used to detect optical or polished surface forms but new advances in precision manufacturing has allowed industrial point diffraction interferometry possible. PDI is especially suited for high resolution, high accuracy measurements in laboratory conditions to noisy factory floors. Lack of reference optics makes the method suitable to visualise absolute surface form of optical systems. Therefore, a PDI is uniquely suitable to verify the reference optics of other interferometers. It is also immensely useful in analysing optical assemblies used in Laser based systems. Characterising optics for UV lithography. Quality control of precision optics. Verifying the actual resolution of an optical assembly. Measuring the wavefront map produced by X-ray optics. PS-PDI can also be used to verify rated resolution of space optics before deployment.

The projective space in question is the twistor space, a geometrical space naturally associated to the original spacetime, and the twistor transform is also geometrically natural in the sense of integral geometry. The Penrose transform is a major component of classical twistor theory. Overview Abstractly, the Penrose transform operates on a double fibration of a space Y, over two spaces X and Z :Z\\\\xleftarrow{\\\\eta} Y \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\tau} X. In the classical Penrose transform, Y is the spin bundle, X is a compactified and complexified form of Minkowski space and Z is the twistor space. More generally examples come from double fibrations of the form :G/H_1\\\\xleftarrow{\\\\eta} G/(H_1\\\\cap H_2) \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\tau} G/H_2 where G is a complex semisimple Lie group and H1 and H2 are parabolic subgroups. The Penrose transform operates in two stages. First, one pulls back the sheaf cohomology groups Hr(Z,F) to the sheaf cohomology Hr(Y,Œ∑‚àí1F) on Y; in many cases where the Penrose transform is of interest, this pullback turns out to be an isomorphism. One then pushes the resulting cohomology classes down to X; that is, one investigates the direct image of a cohomology class by means of the Leray spectral sequence. The resulting direct image is then interpreted in terms of differential equations. In the case of the classical Penrose transform, the resulting differential equations are precisely the massless field equations for a given spin. Example The classical example is given as follows *The \\"twistor space\\" Z is complex projective 3-space CP3, which is also the Grassmannian Gr1(C4) of lines in 4-dimensional complex space. *X = Gr2(C4), the Grassmannian of 2-planes in 4-dimensional complex space. This is a compactification of complex Minkowski space. *Y is the flag manifold whose elements correspond to a line in a plane of C4. *G is the group SL4(C) and H1 and H2 are the parabolic subgroups fixing a line or a plane containing this line. The maps from Y to X and Z are the natural projections. Penrose‚ÄìWard transform The Penrose‚ÄìWard transform is a nonlinear modification of the Penrose transform, introduced by , that (among other things) relates holomorphic vector bundles on 3-dimensional complex projective space CP3 to solutions of the self-dual Yang‚ÄìMills equations on S4. used this to describe instantons in terms of algebraic vector bundles on complex projective 3-space and explained how this could be used to classify instantons on a 4-sphere.

Beginning with his debut novel Kosala, Nemade brought new dimensions to the world of Marathi literature. This was followed by a tetralogy consisting of novels Bidhar, Hool, Jareela and Jhool. In 2013, Nemade published his magnum opus titled Hindu: Jagnyachi Samruddha Adgal () which is regarded as his masterpiece. Nemade is a recipient of the Sahitya Akademi Award as well as the Jnanapith Award, the highest literary honour in India. In 2013, he was awarded the Padma Shri. Life Nemade was born on 27 May 1938 in the village of Sangavi in the Khandesh region of Maharashtra. After doing his matriculation, he moved to Pune, and received his BA from Fergusson College in Pune and MA in Linguistics from Deccan College in Pune and English Literature from the Mumbai University in Mumbai. He received PhD and D.Lit. degrees from North Maharashtra University. Nemade worked as a college teacher in several parts of Maharashtra. He spent a year in London teaching Marathi at the School of Oriental and African Studies. From 1973 to 1986, he taught English at Marathwada University in Aurangabad. In 1987, he was appointed as professor and head of department of English at Goa University. In 1991, he joined Mumbai University, from where he retired as the Gurudeo Tagore Chair for comparative literature studies. During 1960s, Nemade edited Marathi magazine Vacha. Literary career The prime minister Narendra Modi presenting the 50th Jnanpith Award to Bhalchandra Nemade on 25 April 2015 Nemade wrote his first novel Kosala () in 1963. It is a fictitious autobiographical novel of one Pandurang Sangvikar, a youth from rural Maharashtra who studies in a college in Pune; but it is loosely based on Nemade's own life in his youth. Sangvikar, the narrator in Kosala, uses everyday Marathi spoken in rural Maharashtra and his worldview also reflects that held by residents of rural Maharashtra. Kosala is a chronological autobiographical narration, yet it employs certain innovative techniques. Thus, Sangvikar describes one year in his life in the form of a witty diary. As another innovative technique, the narration describes \\"historical investigations\\" often undertaken by Sangvikar and his friend Suresh Bapat, which ultimately uncover to them the absurdity and tragedy of their present condition. Kosla is extensively translated into various languages including English, Hindi, Gujarati, Kannada, Assamese, Punjabi, Bengali, Urdu, Oriya, et al. After Kosala, Nemade presented a different protagonist, Changadev Patil, through his four novels Bidhar (), Hool (), Jarila () and Jhool (). Another tetralogy begins with Hindu ‚Äì Jagnyachi Samruddha Adgal () in 2010 having Khanderao, the archaeologist as its protagonist. The differences between Sangvikar and Patil are not confined to just their age, profession, habits, and intellectual and emotional perception: While Sangvikar at times keeps the world at bay or even rejects the world, Patil is all for the world and is forever engaged in confronting and understanding it. Sangvikar is mercurial, Patil is more realistic, whereas Khanderao's consciousness moves across 5000 years to Indus Valley culture in the Hindu tetralogy. As a critic, Nemade's contribution rests in initiating Deshivad, a theory that negates globalisation or internationalism, asserting the value of writers' native heritage, indicating that Marathi literature ought to try to revive its native base and explore its indigenous sources. Nemade antagonised his contemporaries by contending that the short story is a genre inferior to that of the novel. Nemade won the prestigious Jnanpith Award in February 2015. He was the fourth laureate receiving the award for work in Marathi language. Winner of the Sahitya Akademi Award, he was conferred with Padma Shri in 2011 by Government of India.

He primarily played as a scrum-half. Originally from Cork, Murphy played for his native province of Munster before moving to the English side Leicester Tigers, with whom he won a Premiership title, and then finished his career with Connacht, another Irish province, making over 100 appearances for the side. Murphy began refereeing in the All-Ireland League in 2015, progressing to referee in the British and Irish Cup later that year. He began refereeing at international level in 2016, and has taken charge of games in the European Nations Cup. In November 2016, Murphy took charge of his first Pro12 game, and has since gone on to referee in the Challenge Cup at European level. Early life Murphy grew up in the Crosshaven, a village in south County Cork, and began his playing career with the local team, Crosshaven RFC. In his final year of secondary school, he went on to play with Christian Brothers College, Cork. While playing with the Christian Brothers team, he won the Munster Schools Senior Cup, beating Rockwell College in the final. Playing career Munster Murphy went on to play at senior level for his native provincial team, Munster. Murphy made his debut for the side on 17 October 2003, in a 2003‚Äì04 Celtic League match, away against Welsh side Newport Gwent Dragons. He came off the bench, replacing Eoin Reddan in a match Munster went on to lose 29‚Äì6. Murphy made a total of nine appearances in the league that season, with all but one of them coming from the bench. In the 2004‚Äì05 Celtic League Murphy made only two appearances, starting on both occasions, while in the 2005‚Äì06 Celtic League he made on start and three appearances as a replacement. Murphy left Munster at the end of the 2005‚Äì06 having made 15 appearances for the senior team, and joined English Premiership side Leicester Tigers. Leicester Tigers Murphy joined Leicester ahead of the 2006‚Äì07 season, and was one of a number of Irishmen in a Tigers squad that included Geordan Murphy, Shane Jennings, Leo Cullen and Ian Humphreys. Murphy made his debut on 9 September 2009, coming on as a replacement against Bath in the 2006‚Äì07 Premiership. He made his first start against London Irish on 18 November that year. Murphy made his European debut for the Tigers on 13 January 2007 in the 2006‚Äì07 Heineken Cup as a replacement against Cardiff Blues. In his first season with the club, Murphy made 16 Premiership appearances, starting on 9 occasions. At the end of the season Murphy appeared in both the Premiership final and Heineken Cup final. Murphy started the Premiership final against Gloucester as Leicester won 44‚Äì16, with Murphy scoring one of Leicester's tries. He also started the Heineken Cup final against London Wasps, only his second ever appearance in a European match. The opposition scrum-half on the day was Murphy's former Munster teammate Eoin Reddan. The Tigers came out second best, losing 25‚Äì9 at Twickenham. In his second season with Leicester, Murphy featured in fewer Premiership games, but played more often in European matches. He played in 13 2007‚Äì08 Premiership games, starting 8 of these as Leicester finished in fourth, but made it to the final. Murphy did not feature in either the semi-final or the final as Leicester lost to Wasps. In Europe, Murphy started six games for the Tigers and came off the bench in another in the 2007‚Äì08 Heineken Cup as his side came second in their pool, but missed out on the knockout rounds. Murphy left Leicester Tigers in 2008 and returned to Ireland, joining the western province of Connacht. Connacht Murphy moved to Connacht ahead of the 2008‚Äì09 season. He made his debut for the side in the 2008‚Äì09 Celtic League against Welsh side the Ospreys on 5 September 2008, starting for Connacht and playing the full match. Murphy made 16 appearances in the league that season, starting in all but one of these games. Murphy made his European debut for the province on 10 October 2008 against French side Dax in the 2008‚Äì09 European Challenge Cup. He started in six games for Connacht in the cup as they finished as runners-up in their pool and made it to the quarter-finals of the competition. In the 2009‚Äì10 season, Murphy continued as Connacht's first choice scrum-half. He played in 14 of Connacht's 18 games in the 2009‚Äì10 Celtic League, starting all but two of these. At European level, Murphy played in all of Connacht's 2009‚Äì10 Challenge Cup games as they reached the semi-final, being beaten 19‚Äì12 at the Sportsgrounds by Toulon. In the following season, Murphy played in 21 of Connacht's games under new coach Eric Elwood in the 2010‚Äì11 Celtic League, which had been expanded to 12 teams. Murphy played in all six of Connacht's games in the 2010‚Äì11 Challenge Cup, starting five of them, as Connacht failed to make it past the pool stage. Over the course of these seasons, Murphy would, on occasion, serve as captain of Connacht. In the 2011‚Äì12 season, Connacht qualified for their first ever Heineken Cup. Ahead of Connacht's first season in the top tier of European rugby, the team signed another scrum-half, Paul O'Donohoe from Leinster. Murphy remained Connacht's first choice in the position, playing 20 games in the 2011‚Äì12 league, which had been renamed the Pro12. In the Heineken Cup, however, Murphy started only two of the side's six games, coming on as a replacement in a further two. Ahead of the 2012‚Äì13 season Murphy suffered a cruciate ligament injury, which kept him out for most of the season. At the same time a hamstring injury sidelined O'Donohoe. In their absence, academy scrum-half Kieran Marmion excelled, and went on to start every game that season. Murphy mad only a single substitute appearance that season, coming in the 2012‚Äì13 Pro12. Marmion continued as Connacht's first choice in the 2013‚Äì14 season, with Murphy and O'Donohoe mostly making appearances as replacements. On 27 December 2013 Murphy made his one hundredth appearance for Connacht, starting against his former team Munster in the Pro12, in a 22‚Äì16 defeat. In total, Murphy made seven appearances in the league for the season, six of these appearances coming from the bench. In Europe, Murphy played in only one game during the season, coming off the bench in a famous victory over Toulouse in the 2013‚Äì14 Heineken Cup. In April 2014, it was announced that Murphy's contract with Connacht was not being renewed and he would be leaving the province at the end of the season. He was one of a number of high-profile departures that included fellow centurion Gavin Duffy and former Scottish international fly-half Dan Parks. Murphy retired from professional rugby after leaving Connacht. Refereeing career Following his retirement from playing rugby, Murphy started to work as a referee in the sport as a way of staying in the game. Murphy progressed quickly through the IRFU's Inter Provincial Appointments System, and in February 2015 was added to the union's National Panel of Referees, officiating in All-Ireland League matches. He began refereeing in the semi-professional British and Irish Cup in the 2015‚Äì16 season. Murphy refereed his first international match in February 2016, when he took charge of a European Nations Cup game between and . On 27 November 2016, Murphy refereed his first Pro12 game, between Newport Gwent Dragons and Edinburgh.

He was a national officer in Students for a Democratic Society, a founding member of Weatherman, and a leader of the Weather Underground. Early life and background Jeffrey Carl \\"Jeff\\" Jones, the first child of Albert and Millie Jones, was born February 23, 1947 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Jones, Thai. A Radical Line: From the Labor Movement to the Weather Underground, One Family's Century of Conscience. Free Press: New York, New York, 2004. Four years later, the expanding Jones family moved to the Los Angeles San Fernando Valley, and his father eventually settled into a career at the Walt Disney Company in 1954. Having a father who worked for Disney enhanced young Jones' popularity among his peers; with home screenings of the latest Mickey Mouse cartoons, a featured event at his birthday parties. During World War II, his father, a pacifist and conscientious objector, was assigned for the duration of the war, to a civilian work camp in the Sierra Nevada, California. When his church abandoned him for not serving in the military, the Quakers in the camp embraced him, and he later immersed his family in their traditional ways. Uniforms in the Jones home (Boy Scouts, etc.) were not permitted; the YMCA would have to suffice. This minor restriction was no impediment, as young Jones (hereafter, Jones) excelled in academics, cross country , and school politics (he was the student body president of his high school). From SDS to Weatherman By mid-June 1969, SDS held what would turn out to be its final convention. Previous efforts/tactics to bring the war to an end and factional disputes over the organization's goals and direction allowed an influential and militant bloc of SDS' hierarchy to seize control of the body.Berger, Dan. Outlaws of America: The Weather Underground and the Politics of Solidarity. AK Press: Oakland, California, 2006. Building on their earlier support for the Black Liberation Movement in the United States and the Vietnamese, the Weatherman faction at the convention issued a statement calling for a revolution in this nation to fight and defeat U.S. imperialism within, and outside the country. Emerging from the fractious convention, Jeff Jones, Bill Ayers, and Mark Rudd, all signatories to what came to be known as the Weatherman statement, constituted the organization's new leadership group. Jones worked throughout the rest of the summer following the convention to promote and organize a demonstration in Oct. 1969 to coincide with the Chicago Seven trial and the second anniversary of the death of Che Guevara. \\"Bring the War Home\\" was the slogan for the Chicago march, and despite far fewer demonstrators than anticipated, Jones \\"figured they were the right ones, the vanguard.\\" Jones evoked the memory of Marion Delgado, a five-year-old boy who put a slab of concrete on a railroad track and derailed a passenger train, reinforcing the potential damage that the small can inflict on the powerful. Proclaiming himself to be the embodiment of Marion Delgado, Jones announced to the crowd the as yet stated target of their wrath, and the small army filed out of the park where they were staged and embarked on a violent rampage that came to be known as the Days of Rage. (The violence amounted to smashing windows, damaging cars, and clashes with police.) News article San Antonio Express And News October 25, 1969, page 2: \\"Militant SDS Group Nabbed in Park Raid. OREGON, ILL. (AP) - Police raided three cabins at White Pines State Park Thursday night and turned up some top leaders of the militant Weatherman faction of the Students for a Democratic Society. Two persons were arrested ‚Äî Jeffrey C. Jones, 22, SDS Interorganizational Secretary from Cylmar, Calif., and Linda Sue Evans, 22, of Ann Arbor, Mich. Among others questioned and released were Mark W. Rudd, 22, National SDS Secretary from Maple Park, N.J.; Bernardine Dohrn, 27, former Iinterorganizational Secretary from Chicago; and William C.

Police said Jones is at liberty on $10,000 bond on an aggravated assault charge in Du Page County. Miss Evans was accused of auto theft after authorities said she had not returned a rented automobile on time. Police dropped the charge, however, on learning the renter would not sign a complaint.\\" San Antonio Express And News October 25, 1969, page 2http://access.newspaperarchive.com/san-antonio- express-and-news/1969-10-25/page-2?tag=William+Ayers+william-c- ayers&rtserp;=tags/?ndt=by&py;=1960&pey;=1975&pep;=william-c- ayers&pf;=william&pl;=ayers&psb;=relavance Underground Jones and about a hundred others were arrested for their roles in an event that caused considerable damage to not only the city, but also to Weatherman's image among some previous sympathizers on the left. Chicago Black Panther Party leader Fred Hampton, who had a mostly friendly relationship with Weatherman, denounced the group's action, fearing it would alienate potential allies and invite an escalation of police oppression. Ironically, it was the killing of Hampton by the Chicago police less than two months after the \\"Days of Rage\\" that cemented in the mind of Weatherman that it was time to move underground and take up armed struggle. Jones and other Weathermen failed to appear for their March 1970 court date to face charges of \\"crossing state lines to foment a riot and conspiring to do so\\". \\"Unlawful flight to avoid prosecution\\" charges were added when they failed to show up. The Greenwich Village townhouse explosion earlier in the month claimed the lives of Weather members Ted Gold, Diana Oughton, and Terry Robbins. With the destructive capacity of Weatherman fully realized, the FBI launched an intensive manhunt to round up the members of the organization, including Jeff Jones. In the aftermath of the townhouse explosion, members of the Weatherman leadership gathered on the coast of California to discuss the incident and its implications. Initially, the bomb was intended for a military dance at Fort Dix, New Jersey, but the catastrophic outcome apparently forced the leaders to reassess the wisdom of targeting humans. After a lot of heated debate, the considerable influence of Jones and Bernardine Dohrn moved the organization away from attacking civilian targets and toward symbols of American power (buildings, etc.). In the early stages of his life on the lam, Jones lived for over a year in San Francisco with fellow-fugitive Dohrn. In this time, at least one bombing claimed by Weatherman went off in their locale (Presidio Army base). Although neither the aforementioned bombing, nor any claimed by Weatherman, can be attributed to any one member of the group, Jones' name is listed on a roster of issuers of communiqu√©s that were customary before or after one of the organization's major actions.\\"Weather Underground Organization (Weatherman).\\" Federal Bureau of Investigation. 1976. 24 Nov. 2007. http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/weather.htm Jones left California for the East Coast in 1971, with passenger and fellow Weatherman, Eleanor Raskin. Over a time they became a couple and settled down in the Catskill Mountains to establish a new network there. In the years to come, they lived in New Jersey and in the Bronx, New York. Because of the secretive nature of the group, by now known as the Weather Underground Organization (WUO), specifics of what members did and where they were at all times are extremely hard to come by. However, in his time underground, Jones was part of a collaborative WUO effort that wrote and published a book entitled Prairie Fire, of which 40,000 copies were printed and distributed. The book was a way in which the WUO could reach out and forge unity with progressive activists aboveground as well as advocate, with its doctrinal content, for the creation of a communist party. Inspired by reading Prairie Fire, radical filmmaker Emile de Antonio made a documentary about the WUO called Underground. Made in secrecy with Jones and four other members of the organization, the film was another vehicle for the WUO to communicate with potential supporters of their causes. In an effort to gather information on the group, the FBI harassed de Antonio relentlessly, and subsided only when Hollywood celebrities and prominent lawyers intervened on his behalf. Arrest and life since Jeff Jones had felt as early as 1975 that the underground had run its course and it was time to consider resurfacing, but supported those who chose to remain there. He essentially believed that the time for armed acts was over. However, Jones would not surface until late October 1981, when he was unexpectedly caught up in a police sweep of individuals suspected of participating in the deadly robbery of an armored truck. A SWAT team arrested Jones and Raskin, and allowed a friend to take custody of their four-year-old son. In December 1981, a week before the couples' sentencing, they were married legally. At sentencing Jones received probation and community service, while the charges against his wife were dismissed. In the years after he gained his full freedom, Jones has worked as a reporter and editor covering New York State politics and policy. He was a communications director for ten years at Environmental Advocates of New York. He now heads up his own consulting firm called Jeff Jones Strategies that specializes in media expertise, writing, and campaign strategies that help grassroots and progressive groups achieve their goals.\\"Jeff Jones Strategies: Consulting for Good Causes.\\" Jeff Jones Strategies. 24 Nov. 2007. http://www.jeffjones-strategies.com Jones is also working on the board of the financial arm of Movement for a Democratic Society (MDS), a group that works closely with the new SDS.\\"MDS Conference Elects Manning Marable Chair of MDS, Inc.\\" Next Left Notes. 24 Nov. 2007. http://antiauthoritarian.net/NLN/?m=200702 He lives in Albany, New York with his wife and has two sons.

Life He was the son of John Stranahan and Lucy (Buck) Stranahan. In 1801, he removed to Cooperstown, and practiced law there. In 1803, he formed a partnership with Richard Fenimore Cooper, the oldest son of Judge William Cooper. Judge Cooper had founded the Village of Cooperstown and the Coopers remained the largest land-owners in the area. Stranahan thus was put in charge of the legal business deriving from the land-holdings, like collecting debts and foreclosing mortgages. The partnership was dissolved in January 1807 over a political disagreement. In 1807, the Democratic-Republican Party in New York was split in two factions: the \\"Lewisites\\" (supporters of the incumbent Governor Morgan Lewis); and the \\"Clintonians\\" (supporters of DeWitt Clinton). The Coopers were Federalists and had dominated local politics since the foundation of the village. The Federalists supported Lewis in his run for re-election against his Clintonian challenger Daniel D. Tompkins. Stranahan however was influenced by his landlord Elihu Phinney to support Tompkins. During the election campaign, on April 3, 1807, on Phinney's instructions, the New York State Legislature incorporated Cooperstown as the \\"Village of Otsego\\", thus insulting Judge Cooper by \\"stealing\\" his village, but the incorporation act was not published in Cooperstown until after the election. Cooper campaigned vigorously for Lewis, but Tompkins was elected Governor, carrying also Otsego County. On May 14, the result of the election was published by Phinney in his Otsego Herald together with the incorporation act, calling for a meeting to elect the village trustees. On May 19, five friends of Judge Cooper were elected trustees. At this meeting Judge Cooper insulted the leading Democratic-Republicans, including Stranahan, who two days later avenged his honor by attacking Cooper in the street, severely beating him with his cane. Stranahan was arrested, tried and fined $30 for the assault. On May 23, the trustees met again and refused to take any further action until the original name was restored to the village. This happened only in 1812 when the Federalists had the next time a majority in the State Legislature, and the \\"Village of Cooperstown\\" was re-incorporated. Stranahan married Sarah Stewart (1768‚Äì1824, daughter of Gen. Charles Stewart (1729‚Äì1800)). Their only child was Farrand Stewart Stranahan (1812‚Äì1845), and the latter's son was Lt. Gov. of Vermont Farrand Stewart Stranahan (1842‚Äì1904). During the War of 1812, Stranahan was a colonel and was taken prisoner during the Battle of Queenston Heights. He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1814 to 1816 (Western D.), and from 1823 to 1824 (6th D.). He was a member of the Council of Appointment in 1815. He was a presidential elector in 1820 voting for James Monroe and Daniel D. Tompkins. In 1824, Stranahan was one of the 17 State senators (a majority of the 32-seat State Senate) who voted against the election of presidential electors by popular ballot. This had been the main issue of the year, and the \\"People's Party\\", which advocated the popular election, achieved a landslide victory at the State election in November.

It is not known precisely when the work was created (Dvo≈ô√°k scratched out the note on the title page with a knife so effectively that it is not possible to reconstruct the most important data).Score, p. IX However, the symphony was composed probably in 1872, but possibly not scored until the following year. It is also not possible to find out with certainty the original text of the work.  Background  While he composed his third symphony, Dvo≈ô√°k was a violist in the orchestra of the Provisional Theatre in Prague, which intensified his infatuation with the works of German composer Richard Wagner, whose influence is seen more heavily in this symphony than any of his others. Dvo≈ô√°k began working on the symphony in April 1873 and completed it in July. He began composing his fourth symphony later the same year. It was a successful period of Dvo≈ô√°k‚Äôs career. In the spring of 1873 he had his first major success with the hymn ‚ÄúThe Heirs of the White Mountain,‚Äù an orchestral setting of an epic poem by Czech poet V√≠tƒõzslav H√°lek. According to Dvo≈ô√°k‚Äôs biographer Otakar ≈†ourek, the same sense of patriotism that Dvo≈ô√°k expressed in the hymn can be seen in his third symphony. However, composing the symphony was a challenge for Dvo≈ô√°k, who, after orchestrating it, ‚Äúburned the work‚Äù because he ‚Äúdid not like it,‚Äù according to the notes he scrawled in the margins of the autograph score. The symphony is generally typical of Dvo≈ô√°k‚Äôs style due to its broad, flowing melodies, the variety of interrelated musical ideas within movements, and an exuberant and optimistic finale. But the symphony does also display some clear shifts from Dvo≈ô√°k‚Äôs earlier work. It was written seven years after his second symphony, during which period he wrote numerous other works, including chamber music, vocal music, opera, and other orchestral music. The symphony is generally considered to show significant progress in compositional skill from his second symphony. It shows a greater sense of structural coherence due to its Classical-style structure and a more direct approach to thematic material. The first movement in particular is in sonata form in the style of Haydn. Dvo≈ô√°k does also make use of Romantic styles, particularly with regard to the orchestration with his use tuba, English horn, piccolo, harp, and triangle. Many of Dvo≈ô√°k‚Äôs early works seem to have Wagnerian influences, but this symphony is widely considered to be the most Wagnerian of them all. Throughout the symphony his use of harp is particularly Wagnerian. The influence of Wagner is particularly notable in the second movement, where Dvo≈ô√°k seems to allude to motifs from Wagner‚Äôs Ring Cycle, as well as using harmonies and orchestrations in the style of Wagner, particularly in the strings, harp, and brass. Instrumentation and form The work is scored for an orchestra of two flutes, piccolo, two oboes, English horn, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, triangle, harp, and strings. The work, unlike his other symphonies, is in three movements: There is no scherzo, this being the only three-movement symphony he wrote. The Adagio molto is his longest symphonic slow movement, and the Allegro vivace is the shortest finale. A typical performance of the work has a duration of about thirty minutes. Critic Ludev√≠t Proch√°zka felt that the three movements could be three symphonic poems but the absence of a scherzo prevented the work from truly being a symphony. However, an examination of the music itself reveals more unity than Proch√°zka saw. The first and third movements center on E‚ô≠, F‚ôØ, and A‚ô≠ major, while the second movement is in C‚ôØ minor, the dominant of F‚ôØ. In addition, both the second and third movements contain allusions to thematic material from the first movement to foster a sense of symphonic unity.  Reception  Dvo≈ô√°k submitted this symphony along with his fourth symphony (completed in the early months of 1874) in an application for a state scholarship, which he was granted. Despite its unusual structure and Wagnerian influences, the symphony captured the attention of German composer Johannes Brahms, who was notorious for his musical conservatism. The symphony represented a milestone in Dvo≈ô√°k‚Äôs career in that it marked the beginning of his association with the musical establishment in Vienna. It was premiered by Prague Philharmonic Orchestra on March 29, 1874 at the fourth philharmonic concert in the hall on ≈Ωof√≠n (Sophia Island), conducted by Bed≈ôich Smetana. The composition was revised by Dvo≈ô√°k in 1887‚Äì1889, though not printed until 1912 (after the composer's death) by N. Simrock in Berlin. It was the first of his symphonies that Dvo≈ô√°k heard performed. In another performance a few months later, Smetana included the scherzo from Dvo≈ô√°k‚Äôs fourth symphony. In a review in the Czech newspaper N√°rodn√≠ listy in 1874, Ludev√≠t Proch√°zka praised the symphony as breathtaking, enthusiastic, and imaginative, but wrote that Dvo≈ô√°k was ‚Äúas yet unable to control the high-spirited steed of his imagination.‚Äù He saw promise in the young Dvo≈ô√°k nonetheless, commending the finale for its reminiscence of ‚Äúthe spirit of Beethoven,‚Äù and writing that with time Dvo≈ô√°k could truly achieve greatness in his symphonic works.
