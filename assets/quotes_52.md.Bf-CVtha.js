Origin  John Metcalf. The origins of the surveyor's wheel are connected to the origins of the odometer. While the latter is derived to measure distances travelled by a vehicle, the former is specialized to measure distances. Much of the material on the earliest stages in the development of the hodometer are adequately covered in odometer. In the 17th century, the surveyor's wheel was re-introduced and used to measure distances. A single wheel is attached to a handle and the device can be pushed or pulled along by a person walking. Early devices were made of wood and may have had an iron rim to provide strength. The wheels themselves would be made in the same manner as wagon wheels and often by the same makers. The measuring devices would be made by makers of scientific instruments and the device and handles would be attached to the wheel by them. The device to read the distance travelled would be mounted either near the hub of the wheel or at the top of the handle. In some cases, double-wheel hodometers were constructed. Francis Ronalds extended the concept in 1827 to create a device that recorded the distances travelled in graphical form as a survey plan. The apparatus had a worm on the axle of the two wheels that meshed with a toothed wheel to drive another transverse screw that carried a slider. A pencil on the slider recorded the distance travelled along the screw on an attached drawing board at a chosen scale. Modern surveyor's wheels are constructed primarily of aluminium, with solid or pneumatic tyres on the wheel. Some can fold for transport or storage.  Principle  A diagram of a surveyor's wheel taking a measurement. The surveyor's wheel is marked in fractional increments of revolution from a reference position. Thus its current position can be represented as a fraction of a revolution from this reference. If the wheel rotated a full turn (360 angular degrees), the distance traveled would be equal to the circumference of the wheel. Otherwise, the distance the wheel traveled is the circumference of the wheel multiplied by the fraction of a full turn. In the figure on the right, the blue line is the reference starting point. As the wheel turns during measurement, it is seen that the wheel sweeps out an angle of \\\\frac{3}{4} \\\\pi radians, which is equal to 135 degrees or \\\\frac{3}{8} of a full turn.  Usage  Each revolution of the wheel measures a specific distance, such as a yard, metre or half-rod. Thus counting revolutions with a mechanical device attached to the wheel measures the distance directly. Surveyor's wheels will provide a measure of good accuracy on a smooth surface, such as pavement. On rough terrain, wheel slippage and bouncing can reduce the accuracy. Soft sandy or muddy soil can also affect the rolling of the wheel. As well, obstacles in the way of the path may have to be accounted for separately. Good surveyors will keep track of any circumstance on the path that can influence the accuracy of the distance measured and either measure that portion with an alternative, such as a surveyor's tape or measuring tape, or make a reasonable estimate of the correction to apply. Surveyor's wheels are used primarily for lower accuracy surveys. They are often used by road maintenance or underground utility workers and by farmers for fast measures over distances too inconvenient to measure with a surveyor's tape. The surveyor's wheel measures the distance along a surface, whereas in normal land surveying, distances between points are usually measured horizontally with vertical measurements indicated in differences in elevation. Thus conventionally surveyed distances will be less than those measured by a surveyor's wheel. See also *Trundle wheel *Odometer References #Gerard L'E.

The PSD was founded in March 1971 as a secession of the right wing of the Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party (LSAP) which had a centrist orientation. The group left the LSAP in opposition to the rising leftist faction in the LSAP, which opposed forming coalitions with the Christian Social People's Party (CSV) and championed coalitions with the Communist Party at communal level. The split was led by Henry Cravatte, who had been ejected as President of the LSAP in May 1970. In total, six of the LSAP's eighteen MPs joined the new party, including Albert Bousser and Astrid Lulling. One-sixth of the LSAP's communal councillors also defected. The party competed in the 1974 election, taking 9.2% of the vote and winning five seats, to draw level with the Communist Party, which had been the long-held fourth party in Luxembourgian politics. In that election, the LSAP formed a coalition with the Democratic Party. In 1979, the PSD lost three of their seats to a resurgent CSV. In the European election held on the same day, the PSD failed to win a seat, but did beat the Communist Party into fifth place. Before it fought another election, the party disbanded, in 1984. Some of its members, including Cravatte, returned to the LSAP, whilst others, such as Lulling, joined the CSV, thereby completing their political metamorphosis from left to right.

The Band's Discogs Webpage displays the following names: General Bee, Bee Warrior, Bee Girl, Bee Jag and Bee Svizzl. In an interview, they stated, \\"Dvar is something that came in a dream.\\" Band members claim to have heard music in their dreams, presented to them by a being named Dvar. In several interviews the band has insisted that all of their music is directly inspired by the Dvar being, with the band serving as mere messengers. Some fans have claimed that the Dvar being took on the shape of a giant bee, based on the recurring theme of bees in their album artwork. They stated in an interview, when asked what they think about Kabbalah learnings, that they know Dvar is 211.Dvar In Hebrew, Dvar means Word of... or thing. The vocals which accompany Dvar's music use what appears to be a constructed language, which displays a sound pattern that is somewhat reminiscent of ancient Semitic languages. Due to this similarity, many followers of the band claim that the \\"lyrics\\" are sung in the occult Enochian language. However, the band has given no clues as to the nature of their invented language, except to say that, like the music, the vocals merely relate the message of the Dvar being. Their first known work was a 1998 self- released tape called Raii, though rumors have circulated of an earlier self- released tape from 1995, simply named DVAR.DVAR discography In 2000, the duo issued a self-released 4-track CD-R demo called Taai Liira. In 2002, the band released their first album on the Italian S.P.K.R/Radio Luxor record label, called Piirrah. In 2003, Dvar moved to the Russian label Irond and released five albums: Roach (2003), Rakhilim (2004), a 2004 re-release of Taai Liira with bonus tracks, Hor Hor (2005) and Oramah Maalhur (2005). The album Madegirah – Early Works was announced in 2005, but not be released until 2009. In 2007, the band moved to the label Gravitator and released Jraah Mraah.

In mid-2010, their tenth anniversary album, El Mariil was released, with an unusual medieval sound. A new album Deii was released in Russian magazine \\"Мир Фантастики\\" (English: Mir Fantastiki World of Sci-Fi) in mp3 320 kb/s format. Physical copies of the album were released in December 2012 on Shadowplay Records. The release consists of two parts (two 16-track CDs) in Digipack format.

The lyrics, according to the band, are written in the Enochian language, though they claim that they do not understand most of what is told to them by the creature Dvar.

The artist E.O.M.†.A.K.E.K made an album titled A Tribute to DvarA Tribute To Dvar. with a description saying, “At the humble beginnings of my music making journey, It was Dvar that help spark that flame. This is my gift to you, Dvar. The very first album released onto this name. Thank you for being a major inspiration in my life.“ There is a mysterious group that calls themselves Gvarthat is very much similar to Dvar, that has three albums to their name. Those albums are called Rarities (2010-2015), Mirroah, and Vraii. On Gvar's website[https://gvraii.wixsite.com/index>that is translated to Russian to English, it reads in a very Dvar-like manner when it comes to their origin. How their origin starts out, it first reads out like this. Before telling you the story of my acquaintance with Gvar, I would like to make a small digression explaining the fact that it was I who became my chosen ones. Before putting the album on the net, I spent many sleepless nights at the computer, not knowing whether it was worth putting the material on the court of listeners. Nevertheless, he soon realized that if I didn’t do it, I would quietly give the ends in my room, but no one would know about the mystical cassette, and then my doubts came to an end. As well as to me - perhaps a little later. In the meantime, I decided to publish the files so that the will of the musicians was fulfilled, and the message reached the ears of those to whom it was intended.'' Before I met Gvar, my list of individual passions included many performers; after him, everything remained in its place. But nothing but Gvar gave that incredible sensation for which I put the cassette over and over again - the sensation of incredible unity with the concrete of the room in which I had lived all these years. The story of this cassette begins with the strange appearance of a stranger who stood at Pivnushka. Passers-by did not pay attention either to him or to the bundle of DVDs and CDs in his hand when he tried to say something to them. I passed by. Rather, it was just about to pass, because having been delayed for a moment, I was already unable to leave. It turned out that the stranger does not see well and he has no money. Here, buy the wheels, he said! You will not regret! - just give me a beer! Disks did not interest me. Moreover, he had the films \\"Carrier\\", \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" .. primitive films. Not my taste. I would have a cassette - I said dreamily rolling my eyes. Noticing my ecstasy, the blindman was not at a loss. I have one! he winked at me and pulled a cassette from his pocket. Without a box, without a piece of paper. I gave him a couple of coins for beer, not really hoping that the cassette was standing. Expecting that it would be Shafutinsky, or, at best, Modern Tolking, I clicked on the play, and ... Here. I could not help but digitize this. And after two days and 11 hours, I found in my mailbox a sheet folded 8 times. There was only one word on it - Gvar. Seeing this as a sign, I digitized the cassette and put it on the net. after that day my dog no longer barks, eats and walks. Maybe because I never had it. I do not know. Are you looking too? It’s all useless ...'' I heard about the new album by Gvar, which is expected to be released in 2014 - this time either on floppy disks or vinyl, but I don’t have full confidence in this. As, however, in everything else, as for this mystical group, which once and for all changed my life. I don’t know if I will survive until my mind is divided into 4 parts, and I can see Diana, but be that as it may, I click on the play again, because I simply have no other choice. Weakening, I nonetheless live in the hope that I will have time to hear a new message from Gvar, knowing that it will save me from this mortal world. In the meantime, since I still remain on the physical plane, I understand that this is a sign from above - and therefore do everything in my power - I create a page about Gvar in the hope that it will become a light in the darkness of our world for people like me... Another mysterious group that calls themselves Draw has released three albums with covers very similar to those of Dvar, believed to be either a tribute to Dvar or a mockery of Dvar. There is hardly any information about Draw's third album, but there is information with their other two albums. With Draw's first album Хааа' Хах, hosted by Immoral Basement Records on Bandcamp.com. We get a author's note quoting, “Our label continues to unofficially republish old, little-known, but interesting projects. This time two projects fell into my hands, which are parodies of the legendary darkvarve / lightwave-group Dvar. The first project is called Gvar (about it a little later), and the second Draw (talk about it and go). And so, this is the debut release of Drav, which is the most obvious caricature of the very same Dvar. The music, however, resembles Dvar only remotely, and the vocals are completely absent. However, there are names in the 'fictional' language, which is, as you may have already noticed, distorted Russian words. Dvar also refers to a cover with an anthropomorphic insect depicted on it.“ With Draw's second album Двав'р Кота​-​Ах, hosted by Immoral Basement Records on Bandcamp.com. We get a author's note quoting, “The Draw Group”, the first album of which became so popular after the mysterious disappearance of one of the fans, mysteriously sent me a second tape with their work. A note was attached to the new audio recording in which Drav reported that they had become rich after one of the western recording companies signed a contract with them. The musicians have already earned a lot of money on melodies for porn films and have bought a villa, a car and little monkeys. The remaining money “Draw” was spent on searching and hiring a vocalist. Their choice fell on one of the most mysterious singers of the world dark scene, whose voice you can hear in “Dvav'r Kota Akh”, the main composition of the new album.“ Identity Dvar has kept their identities secret, including their hometown, their ages, or exactly how many band members there are. However, Dvar is presumed to be a duo. This has led to many impostors claiming that they either are Dvar or know the identities of the band members.

Bonanza Books, New York, 1984. Design and development In the 1980s the Enstrom Helicopter Company was producing two helicopters, both powered by horizontally-opposed piston engines. When the United States Army revealed a requirement for a turbine-powered training helicopter, the company designed a larger, turbine-powered version of its 280 Shark. The proposed unit was designated TH28 (TH for \\"training helicopter\\" derived from the 28(0), since the Army's proposal was NTH, \\"new training helicopter\\"). The Army contract effort was not successful,Bell Helicopter Company won the bid, with a militarized version of its 206 JetRanger. (Stephen Pope Enstrom 480B, Flying, September 2011, pp. 60-65) but the company effort looked promising enough that management committed to continue with a commercial version, which was introduced in 1993. Its power was provided by the C20W variant of the Rolls-Royce Model 250 turboshaft engine. Design The 480 fuselage consists of a welded steel-tube framework with aluminum cover and tailcone. The pilot controls the aircraft from the left seat, which is unusual for helicopters. The aircraft does not have a hydraulic system; a trim system absorbs rotor feedback and allows the pilot to position the desired stick setting.Failure of the trim system would require a fifteen-pound control force. (Flying, p. 65) The 480B engine is capable of producing 420 shp, but in this application it is derated to 305 shp for 5 minutes and 277 continuous shp, which is available to 13,000 MSL on a standard day. Thus hot-temperature or high-altitude operations have a considerable degree of power available. The engine drives a three-bladed rotor of 32 feet diameter and a tail rotor of 5 feet diameter. The main rotor and hubs weigh a total of 300 pounds, so there is considerable inertia in the system during a loss of power. Autorotation landings are uneventful.Flying, p. 62: \\" . . it was a nonevent that seemed more like a slightly steeper-than-normal approach with a gentle touchdown . .\\" Variants ;480 :Five-seat civil version based on the Enstrom TH-28, certified in November 1993.

The creation of vocational training began as early as the 1400s, but wasn't fully established until 1875 when Denmark passed legislation that would allow for the use of government grants towards technical and training schools.Nielsen, Soren P; Cort, Pia; European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, Thessaloniki (Greece).Undefined. 144. , 1999. Vocational training schools are jointly run by business and trade associations, such as unions who hope to create a form of stream-lined training into the labour force.Matthews, Hugh.Scandinavian Review; New York Vol. 80, Iss. 2, (Autumn 1992): 13. Through a combination of teaching in vocational schools and apprenticeship, mostly in private companies, students are trained for work in eight specific fields which include: construction, commerce, metal, agriculture, transportation, food, service, and media.Ministry of Education, Copenhagen (Denmark).Undefined, (1983). This form of education is very popular among students in the upper secondary division of school where over 50% join vocational training. The vocational secondary education in Denmark includes the addition of work-place based training. Many students utilize this time in vocational training to expand their skills and create a stronger program of focus for their field. The implementation of a workplace training is mandatory for at least 3 months.Field, S., et al. (2012), A Skills beyond School Review of Denmark, OECD Reviews of Vocational Education and Training, OECD Publishing. http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264173668-en A large proportion of Denmark's labor force comes from these vocational programs. The vocational study force has a long relationship with the industries students would enter after graduation, quickly and smoothly entering the labor force. The long term unemployment (12 months or more) is 19%, well below the average of other OECD countries. Vocational education takes 2-5 years and can be commenced after the completion of the compulsory primary folkeskole ('public school'), i.e. at age 15-16. Contrary to academically oriented types of secondary education such as the Gymnasium, vocational secondary education aims directly at jobs rather than higher education, although it is possible, with certain requirements, to enter a university to study for instance engineering upon completing vocational education. Students train for work in a specific profession (e.g. as an electrician or a chef), but the different education programmes are organized in eight main groups that share certain subjects: *Building *Crafts and technique *From earth to table (hotel, cooking, foods, agriculture) *Mechanics, transport and logistics *Commercial area (trade, office, finance) *Service *Technology and communication *Vocational elementary course In addition, it is also possible to pursue vocational secondary education aimed at work in social and health institutions such as nursing homes: Basic Social and Health Education (Social- og Sundhedsuddannelse or SoSu). Furthermore, there are programmes combining vocational elements with more academically oriented elements: Higher Technical Examination Programme (HTX) and Higher Commercial Examination Programme. These aim at higher education and are comparable to the more general and theoretical Gymnasium and Higher Preparatory Examination (HF).

Genesee had the distinction of serving in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, and returned home proudly with battle and campaign stars to her credit. The third ship to be named Genesee by the Navy, AOG-8 was launched 23 September 1943 by Cargill, Inc., Savage, Minnesota, sponsored by Mrs. Helen Rae Clark; and commissioned 27 May 1944, Lt. O. R. Heath in command.  World War II service  After shakedown, Genesee loaded her first cargo of high octane aviation gasoline at Aruba, Netherlands West Indies, 14 July 1944 and entered Pearl Harbor 11 August. Until the spring of 1945, she made five voyages from Pearl Harbor to Canton Island and the Phoenix Islands, a vital refueling base for planes flying to the South Pacific Ocean, and numerous inter-island runs. She reached Eniwetok 5 March 1945 and, after loading a maximum cargo of diesel oil and freight, sailed for Ulithi and Leyte to discharge her oil. Following her return to Ulithi and a round-trip voyage thence to Hollandia, Genesee loaded motor gasoline at Ulithi and steamed to Okinawa, arriving 20 May 1945.  End-of- war activity  She served the fleet through the summer, getting underway 26 August with motor and aviation gasoline for Tokyo Bay. She moored to the Yokohama Oil Docks 2 September 1945, the day of Japan's formal surrender ceremony on board battleship (BB-63). One of the first Allied tankers to anchor in Japanese homeland waters since 1941, Genesee delivered oil and gasoline to different Japanese ports until departing 14 December 1945 for Long Beach, California, arriving 19 January 1946.  Post-war operations  Until the winter of 1949 Genesee operated in the Pacific, visiting such distant ports as Samoa; Guam; Jinsen, Korea; Yokosuka; Tsingtao, China; Seattle, Washington, Kwajalein; and Kodiak, Alaska, while operating out of San Francisco, California, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and San Diego, California. She decommissioned at San Francisco 14 December, but the Korean War soon restored her to active duty.  Reactivated during Korean War  Recommissioned 28 July 1950, Genesee put in at San Diego 25 August and subsequently reached Pearl Harbor 5 October. Following voyages thence to Midway Island, Eniwetok, and Samoa, she sailed for Japan 8 January 1952, arriving Sasebo 23 January, and made frequent fuel-carrying voyages to Korea supporting United Nations Command forces. Genesee reached Guam 2 May and operated there until returning to Pearl Harbor 3 August 1952. Based at Pearl Harbor until the spring of 1960, Genesee cruised thence to Eniwetok, Guam, Subic Bay, Melbourne, Australia, Long Beach, California, and Yokosuka, Japan. She sailed 31 May 1960 for her new home port of Sasebo, Japan, arriving 17 June, and continued operations in Far Eastern waters. On 3 January 1961 she got underway for Subic Bay, where she stood by during the Laotian crisis until 25 January, and-returned to Sasebo when the danger of combat passed. Her home port was changed to Subic Bay early in 1962 and, through June 1964, Genesee was occupied with demanding training exercises and cruises in the Philippine, Korean, Japanese, and Okinawan waters. She arrived Pearl Harbor, her new home port, 26 July 1964 and made a run to Midway in August to deliver jet fuel. She then headed for the U.S. West Coast in the fall for Operation Hardnose off the Camp Pendleton area. The gasoline tanker next made a run to Pearl Harbor with gasoline and diesel fuel, arriving 31 October. She began a much needed yard overhaul at Pearl Harbor 15 December which was completed in March 1965.  Vietnam War operations  While Genesee was being overhauled, fighting in South Vietnam was intensified. Repairs completed, the tanker headed for the fighting zone where her outstanding service won her the Navy Unit Citation. She \\"contributed materially to the success of military operations by delivering over 9.8 million gallons of petroleum fuel, pumping over 2 million gallons of salt water to aid in air strip construction, delivering diesel fuel from her bunkers and maintaining bottom lay fuel lines on a most demanding schedule and frequently under most adverse weather conditions in an open sea anchorage.\\" Genesee returned to Pearl Harbor 16 November for upkeep and operations in Hawaiian waters. She sailed for the Far East once more 2 May 1966 and 3 June was again off Da Nang, South Vietnam, supporting the 3d Marine Amphibious Force. Late in October she left the war zone and steamed, via the Philippines and Japan to Pearl Harbor, where early in 1967 she prepared for future action. Genesee returned to Vietnam in 1968 and 1969. She was hit by enemy fire while up the Cửa Việt river in 1968. One sailor was killed (SF3 Ball) and another injured (SN Perkins).  Decommissioning and Chilean Navy Service Genesee was decommissioned (date unknown) and struck from the Naval Register, 25 June 1972. She was transferred to Chile under terms of the Security Assistance Program, 25 June 1972, and renamed Beagle (AOG-54), serving mostly as an auxiliary submarine tender, based on the port of Valparaíso. Genesee was decommissioned by the Chilean Navy on the 7th April 1982. After that served as an oiler hulk. Finally struck on 16 January 1992 and sunk in a Live fire exercise.  Military awards and honors  Genesee was awarded one battle star for World War II service: * Okinawa Gunto operation Genesee was awarded one battle star for her services during the Korean War: * Second Korean Winter Campaign She received five campaign stars for her services during the Vietnam War: * Vietnam Defense * Vietnam Counteroffensive * Vietnam Counteroffensive- Phase II * Vietnam Counteroffensive-Phase IV * Vietnam Counteroffensive-Phase IV Genesee’s crew was eligible for the following medals, ribbons, and commendations: * Combat Action Ribbon (28 April 1968) * Navy Unit Commendation * China Service Medal (extended) * American Campaign Medal * Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (1) * World War II Victory Medal * Navy Occupation Service Medal (with Asia clasp) * National Defense Service Medal (2) * Korean Service Medal (1) * Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (2-Vietnam, 1 July 1958 – 3 July 1965) * Vietnam Service Medal (5) * Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation (6) * United Nations Service Medal * Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal * Republic of Korea War Service Medal (retroactive) There was one personnel award: * Purple Heart (1-KIA Arthur Ball SFM3, 22 April 1968) * Navy and Marine Medal {Steven Friedman SK2, 1 May 1968}  References  *  External links  * NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive - AOG-8 Genesee Category:Patapsco-class gasoline tankers Category:Ships built in Savage, Minnesota Category:1943 ships Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Korean War auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Vietnam War auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Ships transferred from the United States Navy to the Chilean Navy Category:Auxiliary ships of the Chilean Navy ","title":"USS Genesee (AOG-8)"},{"id":"13068267","text":"Sweetman is an Irish surname.

It is just off the A16 Peaks Parkway just south-west of the A46 crossroads next to the Lisle Marsden CE Primary School in Wellow and on the Grimsby-Cleethorpes boundary (the A16). The school is of a religious foundation, and lies in the ecclesiastical parish of St Augustine of Hippo. History The school began in 1933 as Wintringham Secondary School on Eleanor Street. Grammar school The current school buildings in Weelsby Avenue, Grimsby, were opened in 1953 as Wintringham Grammar School to replace the former school on Eleanor Street, Grimsby. The school was first divided into a boys' and girls' grammar school on a combined site, with around 750 boys and a similar number of girls. The boys' school was only the Weelsby Avenue side of the site, and the girls' school (now demolished) was on the west side of the site, accessed via Park Avenue next to the tennis courts. The Highfields School was next door, to the north, which is now the Lisle Marsden CE primary school. The school was administered by the County Borough of Grimsby Education Committee, which had its offices on Eleanor Street. The headmaster of the boys' school in the 1950s was Ronald Gill. The headmistress of the girls' school until the late 1970s was Dorothy Dean. The schools were separate up to 1969 when a mixed 6th form was the start of a gradual merger. It shared the playing field, as were out-of-school activities. From September 1969, a sixth form block was built between the two sites, which was then co-educational with a size of 200. From the late 1960s until 1974, it was administered (but not taught) as the single-entity Grimsby Wintringham Grammar School for ages 11 to 18. The old Boys’ School became the Upper School, and the old Girls’ School became the Lower School. Music lessons were held in Highfield House, an old Victorian detached house on the school property. Comprehensive It became the comprehensive Wintringham School in September 1974. The school name comes from the Wintringham family, specifically John Wintringham. Also in 1974, administration was transferred over the Humber to Beverley, and Humberside County Council, in the Grimsby Division. The school became a comprehensive (incrementally) year by year, with the first all-ability year composed of ten forms. It also became an upper school with ages 12–18, as Grimsby became part of the three tier system. There was still streaming in the school, with two main streams: the ‘X’ stream and the ‘Y’ stream. The X forms took mainly GCE examinations and the Y forms took the CSE examinations, and/or fewer GCEs. In the late 1980s, headmaster Keith Bardgett switched the school from streaming to mixed-ability classes, the change starting with the new intake of pupils in September 1988. A restricted form of streaming remained, limited to specific subjects, notably Mathematics and foreign languages. From September 1990, the naming convention for classes switched to the modern nomenclature still in use today. At the same time, a re-organisation of local education saw Wintringham give up its 6th Form and take in new pupils a year earlier than was previously the case. This meant that the 2nd - 6th forms were replaced with Years 7 - 11. In 1996, administration passed back to Grimsby under North East Lincolnshire. Streaming similar to that of its grammar school days was re-introduced.  Oasis Academy Wintringham  Since September 2007, the school has been transformed into an Academy run by the Oasis Trust, and the new state-of-the-art buildings has replaced the current ones with a cost of £25 million. Construction started on 30 August 2007, being undertaken by Clugston Construction of Scunthorpe who finished in January 2009. The start of construction work was marked by a groundbreaking ceremony on 30 August 2007, where Steve Chalke and pupils from the new Academy drove the first spades into the ground where the Academy and community facilities would be built. The old school (Wintringham School) closed in August 2007 and opened as Oasis Academy Wintringham in the existing buildings in September 2007. The Academy transferred across to the brand new buildings during the academic year 2008-09 in February 2009. The sports hall is sponsored by Stagecoach. The Dean Suite is named after Dorothy Dean, the headteacher of the school from 1953 to 1975, who died on 23 October 2011 aged 96.

After the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'état brought an end to a three-year experiment in democracy (), a triumvirate of military personnel controlled the government until 1952, when it held presidential elections. These were free enough to produce results unacceptable to the government, leading them to be falsified and to one of the three leaders, Marcos Pérez Jiménez, assuming the Presidency. His government was brought to an end by the 1958 Venezuelan coup d'état, which saw the advent of democracy with a transitional government under Admiral Wolfgang Larrazábal in place until the December 1958 elections. Prior to the elections, three of the main political parties, Acción Democrática, COPEI and Unión Republicana Democrática, with the notable exclusion of the Communist Party of Venezuela, signed up to the Punto Fijo Pact power-sharing agreement. This period was characterised by the alternation of political power established in the Punto Fijo Pact; by the nationalisation of the oil industry in 1976 and the creation of PDVSA, the national oil and gas company; and by the rise of new social elites. Internationally, Venezuela became a founding member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The 1980s in particular were characterised by the flowering of art and culture and by the artistic development of the nation, especially in television. Pioneering media like RCTV made Venezuela famous with soap operas such as Kassandra.  Puntofijismo  Betancourt administration (1959-1964) After a military coup d'état on 23 January 1958 sent General Marcos Pérez Jiménez into exile, Venezuela's three main political parties signed the Punto Fijo Pact. The ensuing elections brought Rómulo Betancourt, who had been president from 1945 to 1948, back to power. Betancourt's government halted grants to multinational oil companies, created a Venezuelan oil corporation, and helped establish OPEC in 1960, an initiative led by Development Minister Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso. The administration also introduced a new constitution in 1961, dividing the government into executive, legislative, and judicial branches; pursued agricultural reform; and promoted an international doctrine in which Venezuela only recognised governments elected by popular vote. The new order had its opponents. On 24 June 1960, Betancourt was wounded in an assassination attempt led by the Dominican dictator Rafael Leónidas Trujillo. Around the same time, the left-wingers excluded from the Punto Fijo Pact (Revolutionary Left Movement and Armed Forces of National Liberation) began an insurgency that was backed by the Communist Party of Cuba and its leader, Fidel Castro.  Leoni and first Caldera term (1964-1974)  In 1963, Raúl Leoni was elected to succeed Betancourt as president. Leoni's government became known for public works and cultural development, but was confronted with continuous guerrilla warfare. Rafael Caldera won the next election. Before he took office in 1969, the Rupununi Uprising broke out in neighboring Guyana. The border controversy was resolved with the Port of Spain Protocol in 1970. Additionally, a truce with the guerrillas allowed their reintegration into political life.  First Carlos Andrés Pérez term (1974-1979)  Carlos Andrés Pérez took office in 1974, amid an oil crisis that had begun the previous year and had increased the global price of oil from $3 per barrel to nearly $12 per barrel. Venezuela nationalised its iron industry in 1975 and its oil industry the following year. Herrera Campins and Lusinchi administrations (1979-1989) Luis Herrera Campins was elected to the presidency in 1979, with the country in deep debt and bound by International Monetary Fund demands. In 1983, the Venezuelan currency, the bolívar, was devalued on what became known as Black Friday, unleashing an economic crisis. The subsequent government of Jaime Lusinchi did little to counter the crisis. Corruption increased, and the Caldas Corvettes crisis in 1987, sparked by a sovereignty dispute in the Gulf of Venezuela, generated one of the biggest moments of tension between Venezuela and Colombia. Second Carlos Andrés Pérez term (1989-1993) Pérez was elected again in 1988 and, looking to solve the recession, adopted economic measures that set off major protests, the biggest of which was the Caracazo wave of 1989. The same year, Venezuela held its first direct elections of governors and regional mayors. In February and November 1992, Hugo Chávez led two coup d'état attempts, and in 1993, Congress ousted Pérez. Octavio Lepage served as acting president for about two weeks, at which point the historian and parliamentarian Ramón José Velásquez took over the interim role. Pérez proved less generous with hand- outs than previously. Despite being elected after a populist, anti-neoliberal campaign during which he described the IMF as \\"a neutron bomb that killed people, but left buildings standing\\" and said that World Bank economists were \\"genocide workers in the pay of economic totalitarianism\\", he had become a closet liberalizer and globalizer. His economic adviser was Moisés Naím, today an influential journalist in the United States and the editor of the journal Foreign Policy, and he defined the presidential economic agenda, which included no price controls, privatizations, and laws, or their elimination, to attract foreign investment. Naím began at the lowest rung of economic liberalization, which was freeing controls on prices and a ten percent increase in that of gasoline, which in Venezuela is sacrosantly very low. The increase in petrol price fed into a 30 percent increase in fares for public transport In February 1989, barely into his second term, Pérez faced a popular uprising, which he had the army crush with a death toll of 276, according to government officials. It is known as the \\"caracazo\\" (from \\"Caracas\\"), where the rioting and looting was on an unforeseen scale. Pérez and Naím went on with their reforms, which had the full backing of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Venezuelan economy started picking up, but only slightly and Venezuelans, who are not very keen on globalization, were resentful. Rightly or wrongly, Pérez, who after his first presidency was a rich man, was singled out as Mr. Corruption himself. 1992 coup d'état attempts The MBR-200 officers started plotting seriously and on 4 February 1992 they struck. Hugo Chávez was a lieutenant-colonel, but other generals were also involved in the coup attempt. The plan involved members of the military overwhelming military locations and communication installations and then establishing Rafael Caldera in power once Perez was captured and assassinated. They almost had him cornered in the presidential palace, but he managed to escape to the presidential residence and from there, loyal troops cornerered Chávez arrested him. In exchange for prompting his co-conspirators to lay down their arms, Chávez, fully uniformed and unbowed, was allowed to speak on television to the entire nation in a moment that captured Venezuela's attention and granted him a place on the nation's political stage. On 27 November 1992, higher-ranked officers tried to overthrow Pérez but the conspiracy was easily put down. Impeachment and transition Pérez's downfall came when a legal process was begun to force to him reveal how he had used a secret but legal presidential fund, which he resolutely resisted. With the Supreme Court and Congress ranged against him, Pérez was imprisoned, for a while in a detention center, and then under house arrest. He handed the presidency in 1993 to Ramón J. Velásquez, an Adeco politician and historian who had been his presidential secretary. Though nobody has charged Velásquez with corruption, his son was involved in an illegal pardon for drug- traffickers, but was not charged. Velázquez oversaw the elections of 1993, and these were familiar and unique. Second Caldera administration (1994-1999) Rafael Caldera, who had been candidate for the presidency six times and won once, wanted to have another go, but COPEI this time resisted, led by Herrera Campins, and Caldera founded his own brand-new political movement, called Convergencia. COPEI chose a mediocrity from within its ranks. The Adecos chose the pardo Claudio Fermín. Petkoff had seen the futility of trying again and backed Caldera. Even Velázquez got into the act. When the returns were in, Caldera won and in the process shattered the strict bipolarity thesis. Abstentions reached a record of 40%. The main reason Caldera, who was 86 years old, won was in essence the same as for Pérez's victory in 1973: everybody knew him and the middle classes, probably decisive for the only time in Venezuela's history, thought that he could do the miracle that had been expected of Pérez, that is, in some manner to get the country back on track to the \\"good old times\\". Caldera assumed the presidency for the second time in 1994 and had to confront the Venezuelan banking crisis of 1994. He re-imposed exchange controls, which Pérez's administration had lifted as part of a general financial liberalisation (unaccompanied by effective regulation, which contributed to the banking crisis). The economy had suffered under the falling oil price, which led to a collapse in government revenues. The steel corporation Sidor was privatized, and the economy continued to plummet. Fulfilling an election promise, Caldera released Chávez and pardoned all the military and civilian conspirators during the Pérez regime. The economic crisis continued, and by the 1998 presidential election the traditional political parties had become unpopular; an initial front-runner for the presidency in late 1997 was Irene Saez. Chávez gained popularity amid the financial turmoil and was elected president in 1998. His administration promoted a new constitution, which was approved by referendum in December 1999. The adoption of the new constitution in 1999 ended the Puntofijismo, establishing the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.  Territorial organisation  The constitution of 1961 divided Venezuela into states, a capital district, federal territories, and federal dependencies. Over the years, some territories have been elevated to the status of states, including Delta Amacuro in 1991 and Amazonas in 1994. Each state has a governor and a legislative assembly.  Science and technology  Significant advances in the medical sciences took place during the Punto Fijo pact period. Jacinto Convit developed vaccines against leprosy and leishmaniasis, and Baruj Benacerraf was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1980 for his immunological research. In the field of technology, Humberto Fernández Morán invented the diamond knife and contributed to the development of the electron microscope.  Culture  The 1980s and 1990s were also a golden age of television in Venezuela. A number of Venezuelan telenovelas became popular internationally: Leonela (1983), Cristal (1984), Abigail (1988), Kassandra (1992), and Por estas calles (1992), all from RCTV; and Las Amazonas (1985), Ka Ina (1995), and El país de las mujeres (1998) from Venevisión. Several Venezuelans won international beauty contests: Maritza Sayalero (1979), Irene Sáez (1981), Bárbara Palacios Teyde (1986), and Alicia Machado (1996). Musicians like Franco de Vita, Ricardo Montaner, and Karina also became known on the international scene.

The primary purpose is to collect, preserve and archive historically valuable records from central authorities, such as ministries, agencies and national organisations and make them available to the public. The archive is part of the Ministry of Culture. Previously the term Danish State Archives (Danish: Statens Arkiver) was used as the collective name for the archive system. In 2014 the archives were reorganised, and the name Rigsarkivet (which had previously only applied to the Danish National Archives in Copenhagen) became the new collective name for the entire archive system. History Organisation as the Danish State Archives Prior to 2014, Danish State Archives was the term used to refer collectively to these archives: * Danish National Archives (Copenhagen) * Danish Data Archives (Odense) * Danish National Business Archives (Aarhus) *Regional Archives: ** Provincial Archives of Zealand, Lolland-Falster and Bornholm (Copenhagen), closed in 2012 when its collections were merged with the Danish National Archives in Copenhagen. ** Provincial Archives of Southern Jutland (Aabenraa) ** Provincial Archives of Funen (Odense) ** Provincial Archives of Northern Jutland (Viborg) Regional archives held records transferred from regional authorities, like courts of law, the county authorities, the police and many other local authorities. Records from central authorities, such as ministries, agencies and national organisations, were held at the Danish National Archives. The Danish National Business Archives kept registers, documents, etc. from companies and organisations in the business sector. The Danish Data Archives, the newest of the seven archive holding bodies, kept historical and social science studies such as registers, databases and other electronically stored information. Reorganisation in the 2010s In 2014, the Danish State Archives were reorganised, and the separate archives became reading rooms in a larger archive system. On 1 October 2014, the name Danish State Archives (Danish: Statens Arkiver) was replaced with the name Danish National Archives (Danish: Rigsarkivet). (In Danish) The new Danish National Archives were organised as: *Danish National Archives, Copenhagen (formerly the Danish National Archives in Copenhagen, which had absorbed the collections of the Provincial Archives of Zealand, Lolland-Falster and Bornholm in 2012) *Danish National Archives, Aarhus (formerly the Danish National Business Archives) *Danish National Archives, Aabenraa (formerly the Provincial Archives of Southern Jutland) *Danish National Archives, Odense (formerly the Provincial Archives of Funen) *Danish National Archives, Viborg (formerly the Provincial Archives of Northern Jutland) In 2015, Danish National Archives, Aarhus was closed and its collections were moved to Danish National Archives, Viborg. (In Danish) Reading Rooms Today the Danish National Archives includes four reading rooms (Copenhagen, Aabenraa, Odense, and Viborg). Danish National Archives, Copenhagen Location The headquarters of the Danish National Archives, Copenhagen are located next to Christiansborg Palace on Slotsholmen. A new purpose-built storage building was opened in 2009 at Kalvebod Brygge. It was designed by PLH Arkitekter. History The archive was founded in 1889 out of two older national archives, Gehejmearkivet (1296-1883) and Kongerigets arkiv (1861-1884). In 2012 the collections of the Provincial Archives of Zealand, Lolland-Falster and Bornholm were merged into the Danish National Archives. In 2014, the Danish National Archives was renamed Danish National Archives, Copenhagen and the term Danish National Archives came to represent all former Danish State Archives. Collections The Danish National Archives, Copenhagen holds the archives of the Danish overseas trading companies, including the archives of the Danish East India Company, the Danish Asiatic Company, the Danish West India and Guinea Company and the Danish West India Trading Company, and reflects Denmark's relations with foreign countries such as the European States, Russia, Turkey, North African states and the American states. The archives of the Danish overseas trading companies were inscribed on UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register in 1997. The Sound Toll Records, which provide detailed information about every ship and cargo that entered the Baltic and departed from the Baltic through the Danish straits starting in the 15th century, are held at the Danish National Archives and in 2007, the collection was inscribed on the Memory of the World Register. Storage The documents are stored on electrically powered mobile shelving – double-sided shelves, which are pushed together so that there is no aisle between them. A large handle on the end of each shelf allows them to be moved along tracks in the floor to create an aisle when needed. The units have a small AC or DC motor hidden in the base that automatically moves the units when a single button is pressed.

An early ally of William of Orange, he inherited large holdings of land but no great ability from his father, Sir Thomas Clarges, and largely used his Parliamentary seat to advance his own business and financial interests. Early career Clarges matriculated at Merton College, Oxford on 3 February 1670/1.Joseph Foster, \\"Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714\\", Oxford and London 1891-2. On 30 October 1674 he was created a baronet, an honour which his father had sought for him; Clarges' father was one of the oldest and most respected of the Country Party. As soon as he had come of age in 1674, his father sought for him a seat in Parliament, intending him to stand for Clitheroe; however he was ordered to make way for a nominee of the Duke of Albemarle, his cousin. Exclusion Parliament Appointed a captain in the Duke of Monmouth's Regiment of Foot in 1678, Clarges transferred to the Royal Dragoons the next year,Narcissus Luttrell, \\"Brief Relation of State Affairs\\", vol. 1, p. 509. the same year as he was elected Member of Parliament for Colchester in the general election. He was made a Freeman of Maldon. In Parliament he was with his father in opposition to the efforts to remove the (Catholic) Duke of York from the line of succession to the throne. These efforts were unsuccessful and Clarges lost his seat at the 1681 election when Titus Oates told the electors that he was a Papist. Also in 1681 he became a Major in the 1st Troop of Horse Guards. Dueling When the Duke of Albemarle fought a duel with Lord Grey of Warke in 1682, he chose Clarges to act as his second. Albemarle and Clarges both survived but came off worst in the duel, with Clarges being wounded and disarmed by Grey's second, Charles Godfrey.\\"History of Parliament 1660-1690\\", vol. ii, p. 81. Opposing James II Re-elected in 1685 after the Duke ascended the throne as James II, Clarges made his mark in Parliament as an opponent of the King's religious policies. Starting out as a conciliator, James II progressively moved to increase the involvement of the Roman Catholic Church in official life; Clarges drew attention to, and denounced each change. He resigned his commission in the army in October 1685, probably as a protest against the employment of Roman Catholic officers. He became a Freeman of Oxford in 1687.\\"History of Parliament 1690-1715\\", vol. iii, p. 575, citing \\"Oxford Council Acts\\" new series vol. ii, pages 191 and 196. When William of Orange landed, Clarges was sent by his father (said to be 'at great expense') to attend upon him at Exeter in November 1688. Election for Westminster In the 1690 general election, Clarges had the assistance of his fathers' resources and personal influence in seeking election in Westminster as a Tory. Running with Sir William Pulteney (who was a business partner of his father), they beat the two Whig candidates so easily that their opponents withdrew two days before the close of the poll.\\"History of Parliament 1690-1715\\", vol. ii, p. 397. Clarges suspected the motives and patriotism of the Whigs, who had fought for the exclusion of the Duke of York; he described them as \\"now making excuses for those, who most people think guilty of the basest and most dishonourable action that was ever done in this nation\\".\\"History of Parliament 1690-1715\\", vol. iii, p. 575, citing a letter Clarges wrote to George Clarke dated 10 July 1690. Clarges was largely inactive in the Parliament, his only major action being to supervise the later House of Commons stages of a Private bill to clarify the law on the new parish of St Anne which had been carved out of the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields in 1686. The Bill had been initiated by his father, who owned a large amount of land in the parish. Election difficulties At the 1695 general election, Clarges (who had just recovered from a serious illness) had a more difficult fight. His father died on 4 October just as the fight was at its height. Despite the support of the Bishop of London and the Duke of Leeds, Clarges was clearly behind on the show of hands on 24 October (on which he distributed £2,000 in bribes). He demanded a poll but finished some 700 votes behind. His new inheritance brought him land worth £5,000 a year, and it added to the wealth he had gained by marrying his third wife Elizabeth Gould in December 1690; Mrs Gould was the coheiress of a wealthy City draper. He declined to fight Westminster in the 1698 general election, but in 1701 found himself in need of a position in Parliament after granting a lease over land in Piccadilly to Thomas Neale. Under the terms of the lease, Neale was to spend £10,000 developing the land, and then pay rent to Clarges; however, Neale became insolvent and defaulted. Clarges could be sure of repossessing the land by passing a Private Bill, and stood in the January general election of 1701. The Court interest was against him and he finished fourth with 1,177 votes; the winners had more than twice as many.\\"Post Man\\", 16–18 January 1701. Return to favour Notwithstanding his exclusion from Parliament, Clarges petitioned for his Bill but saw it defeated at second reading by Neale's friends on 2 May 1701. Fortunately for Clarges, he recovered the property by some other means and developed it himself.Diary of John Evelyn, ed. by Harry Benjamin Wheatley (1879), vol. iii, p. 118. At the general election in 1702 he stood again in Westminster, after the accession of Queen Anne; the new Queen was a Tory supporter and so the Court interest was now on the side. The contest went to a poll and was very close, and a scrutiny of the votes was ordered, but at the end Clarges was elected with a small majority.The \\"Daily Courant\\" of 24 July 1702 and the \\"Post Man\\" of 23–25 July 1702 give differing figures. Parliamentary activity His first action in Parliament was to use Parliamentary privilege to commit a business enemy, William Sherwin, to jail. Sherwin had been involved in a long- running inheritance dispute over Clarges' estate in Yorkshire at Sutton upon Derwent, which the Clarges had inherited from Clarges' cousin the Duke of Albemarle. Sherwin contended that the Duke's mother's first husband, who had disappeared, was still alive making their marriage null and him the rightful owner of the property; he had failed to persuade several courts to support him, but nevertheless started to run the estate as his own. On 8 December, the House of Commons ordered Sherwin imprisoned.\\"History of Parliament 1690-1715\\", vol. iii, p. 576. Clarges also held a £500 pension granted originally to his father which came from the product of a 12d duty on coal shipped from Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He was appointed to report from a committee that the Newcastle coalowners were deliberately profiteering, and introduced a Bill to regulate coal shipments, although he did not pursue the matter. Retirement In poor health in 1704, Clarges decided not to defend his seat at the 1705 general election. He died in March 1706, being survived by his eight sons and four daughters (one daughter had predeceased him), from three marriages.

In 1853 he earned his medical doctorate from the University of Munich, where he studied under Karl Thiersch (1822–1895) and Franz Christoph von Rothmund (1801–1891). In the following years he continued his surgical studies with Auguste Nélaton (1807–1873), Charles Chassaignac (1805–79) and Jules Maisonneuve (1809–1897) in Paris, and under Bernhard von Langenbeck (1810–1887) in Berlin. During the early 1870s he travelled to England, where he learned techniques of pelvic surgery under Thomas Spencer Wells (1818–1897). From 1860 until 1890 Nussbaum was a professor of surgery at the University of Munich. During the Franco- Prussian War he served as a medical consultant for Bavarian troops. Nussbaum is remembered for the development of innovative surgical operations, and the introduction of Lister's antiseptic practices into surgery at Munich. Prior to antisepsis at Munich, there was an extremely high rate of death due to operative infection. Nussbaum's popular book on antiseptic treatment of wounds, Leitfaden zur antiseptischen Wundbehandlung, was later translated into several languages. He also published significant works on eye surgery, ovariotomy and bone transplantation. A device designed for use with writer's cramp, \\"Nussbaum's bracelet\\", is named after him. He is buried in the Alter Südfriedhof in Munich, Germany.

For this masque, the English composer Sir Edward Elgar wrote the music as his Op. 66, with a libretto by Henry Hamilton. The masque consisted of two tableaux: \\"The Cities of Ind\\" and \\"Ave Imperator!\\". Music The masque was first performed at the Coliseum Theatre in London on 11 March 1912. Elgar composed twelve pieces for contralto, bass, chorus and orchestra: Tableau I: The Cities of Ind *1a Introduction *1b Sacred Measure *2 – Dance of Nautch Girls *2a India greets her Cities *3 – Song (Agra): 'Hail, Immemorial Ind!' (The homage of Ind) *3a Entrance of Calcutta. India: 'Welcome Calcutta!' *3b Entrance of Delhi. Delhi: 'Stop! That place is mine' *4a Introduction *4b March of the Mogul Emperors.

First performance The London Coliseum programme for the first week of the performanceThe London Coliseum programme, week commencing Monday, 11 March 1912 shows that The Crown of India masque was the most important of the eleven acts in the show. There were two Tableaux: \\"The Cities of Ind\\" and \\"Ave Imperator!\\".Ave Imperator! (Latin): Hail the Emperor! The programme listed the cast, who personified 'India' herself, England represented by 'St. George', and various Indian cities. There were also attendant performers, in elaborate costumes, personifying other roles. Elgar attended the daily rehearsals for two weeks, then conducted the hour-long show two performances a day for a further two weeks. The cast included: * India - Nancy Price * St. George - Harry Dearth * Agra - Marion BeeleyMiss Marion Beeley, contralto * Delhi - May Leslie Stuart * Calcutta - Evelyn Kerry * Benares - Sybil Etherington * Cities, Mogul Emperors, Princes, Guards, Executioners, Courtiers, Fan Bearers, Ladies Attendant Syce,Syce (Hindi/Urdu): Indian stableman or groom Litter Bearers, Heralds, Trumpeters, etc. Extracts Elgar later extracted five of the pieces – 1(a), 2, 5, 8 and 4 – and added an intermezzo for solo violin to create The Crown of India Suite. The first performance was at the Hereford Festival on 11 September 1912, by the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by the composer. The Suite gained immediate popularity: during Elgar's lifetime, there were 102 live performances of it on the BBC.Jeffrey Richards: Imperialism and Music, Manchester University Press, 2001 The Crown of India March from the incidental music for the masque is also performed separately. Complete score The complete score for the Crown of India incidental music was only published in a piano-vocal version by Elgar's friend Hugh Blair. The remaining orchestral parts were destroyed in the 1960s. In 2007 the Elgar Society commissioned the composer Anthony Payne to complete the orchestration of the music for The Crown of India.

The word Crailo is derived from kraaien bos (Dutch for \\"crow's woods\\") and refers to van Rensselaer's Estate in Huizen, Holland, which is also named \\"Crailo\\".Spooner, pp. 189 Fort Crailo is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Starting as early as 1663 through the 18th century, the area surrounding the site had become synonymously known as Greenbush. The property consisted of flat alluvial farmlands, orchards, mills, a store, and ferry rights to Albany. As early as 1663, the estate later known as Hendrick's manor had a small fort for the protection of the local inhabitants from Indian attacks during the Esopus Wars and in 1675 during King Philip's War the local militia captain was instructed to install a palisade around this fort. The fields and farm buildings at Crailo were used to quarter British and colonial troops as early as 1694 and at intervals during each of the French and Indian wars. The property was inherited by Hendrick van Rensselaer, Kiliean's grandson, who built the house in 1707. His son, Johannes, was a captain in the colonial militia. Captain van Rensselaer inherited Crailo in 1740. The gunports were likely added after a raiding party of 80 French and Indians attacked Greenbush, killing up to five persons in 1746. The inhabitants of Albany witnessed this assault from across the river but troops were unable to cross in time to defend Greenbush. In 1751 and 1754 Captain van Rensselaer provided candles and firewood to the colonial garrisons at Albany and Schenectady. The house was expanded in 1762. The loopholes on the lower floor indicate the original defensive nature of the house. Fort Crailo is reportedly the place where, in 1755, British Army surgeon Richard Shuckburgh, quartered in the home, wrote the ditty \\"Yankee Doodle\\" to mock the New England colonial troops who fought with the British in the French and Indian Wars. Fort Crailo was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961. and The fort is operated by the State of New York as a museum of the Colonial Dutch culture in New York State. Exhibits include clothing, furniture, household and decorative items, and archaeological artifacts from \\"New Netherland\\" historic sites in New York and New Jersey. Many artifacts from the Fort Orange archeological dig in the early 1970s are on display.

The station contains a parking lot operated by the City of Harvard. A coach yard is adjacent to the station and is used to store trains during weekends and overnight hours. Harvard was the only Metra station located in the M zone, until the M zone was retired by Metra in 2018. Trains that traveled to Chicago passed through an entire fare zone to reach Woodstock. However, no stations were located in zone L. Originally, Hartland was the only station located in zone L, however, the stop was closed in 1984. Today, Harvard is located in fare zone J. It is the westernmost station of the Metra system, as well as the farthest stop from any other stops on its route. The next most westerly stop is Elburn on the Union Pacific/West Line and the next largest gap between two stations on the Metra system is between Lake Forest and Libertyville on the Milwaukee District/North Line. Harvard is the last station to use more than one track, as further beyond this station, the UP line is single tracked until reaching Janesville, Wisconsin. Being Chicago's most northwesterly commuter rail station, the Harvard station attracts commuters from the Rockford and Belvidere region of northern Illinois as well as South-Central Wisconsin.

In May 1999, RCD broke into parts and Lubero became a territory of RCD-ML. He was appointed at the electoral commission secretariat to organize the elections of the mayor of the new town of Butembo. In October 1999, he was appointed administrator of Lubero territory, succeeding Sikuly’Uvasaka Makala, elected mayor of Butembo. He served as Lubero administrator until 3 March 2003. Paluku's mandate centered on: * Integrating the forces of CGD/K-ML, called CPA (Congolese People’s Army), * The restoration of the State’s authority in Lubero. * Negotiation with the leaders of CGD/Goma and CGD/K-ML. * Negotiation at Nambole in Kampala (Mandela National Stadium) in the Ituri conflicts (in 2000). Mayor of Butembo Paluku was appointed mayor of the town of Butembo, succeeding Eric Kamavu (DRC Ambassador to Angola from 2006–2009) who became a Minister in the government of RCD/K-ML, located in Beni. He made efforts in putting up a town hall in Butembo in partnership with the Federation of Entreprises of Congo (FEC). In 2003, he initiated the building of the first public parking, the only one in the province of North Kivu. He repaired the main roads to give it a form of a town with round-abouts and sewerage. He built the Cugeki bridge. It was inaugurated on 2 July 2005. Paluku resisted the progress of the troops of RCD/Goma which camped at the gate of Butembo in June 2003. Mayor of Beni Following the reunification of the country, Paluku was named mayor of Beni on 9 July 2005 and officially assumed function on 18 July 2005. He restored refuse collection, repaired bridges, built offices for services and put up a building for the town of Rwenzori. During his mandate, Paluku got a degree in Health and Community Development at the Free University of the Great Lakes Region (ULPGL). Provincial Deputy In 2006, Paluku was elected member of the provincial assembly for the constituency of Butembo on the list of Forces of Renewal with 38,800 votes along with 160 candidates. Governor of North Kivu GOUVERNEUR Nord-Kivu,Opérateur PolitiqueRDC,Initiateur des projets de développement,défenseur attitré de la vision prospective et VICE-PRESIDENT MONDIAL de AIRF On 27 January 2007, Paluku was elected Governor of North Kivu by the provincial assembly of 42 deputies, with 25 votes for and 17 votes against. The five-year programme focused on: * Securitization of the province * Provincial reconciliation * Peaceful co-existence and development  National Deputy  On 28 November 2011, he was elected member of the National Assembly for the territory of Lubero.  BUREC  In 2012, just after the legislative and presidential elections, Lahongya created the political party called BUREC (United Block for the Renaissance and Emergence of Congo). In 2014 the province of North Kivu for the first time produced an equivalent of one million American dollars against a monthly average of 200 to 400 thousand dollars from 2009-2013. Butembo RTVH He is the founder of the local media operation of Butembo RTVH, a big media house in the region. Criticism In 2007, his election as the first Governor provoked criticism. He took part in radio debates, notably on Okapi Radio, the UN radio that is broadcast country- wide. In 2006, he was appointed spokesman of provincial governors. He was accused of ignoring the practical concerns of his station office, instead focusing exclusively on the defense of national territory alongside the armed forces. In November 2011, he gave electoral support to Joseph Kabila, a candidate who was rejected by the population of eastern Congo. This damaged his popularity. To make matters worse, while CGD/K-ML chair Mbusa Nyamwisi was the presidential candidate, Kahongya chose to campaign for the Majority. He then abandoned Nyamwisi, leading to some top leaders of the old rebellion RCD/KLM to call Palaku an opportunist. He was attacked as a Catholic who was at the basis of this diabolic machine against Mbusa Nyamwisi. He was accused of collusion with the M23 rebellion that started in April 2012. Nyamwisi was thrown out of the National Assembly in Kinshasa for his supposed links with Rwanda to destabilize the East, along with his colleague Roger Lumbala. Paluku was accused of embezzling public funds by using provincial projects to enrich himself. The misappropriation of at least 6 million American dollars by the provincial leadership was one of the charges that were used for different censure motions. Muhindo Nzangi Butomdo and Vahamwiti, who accused Paluku of misappropriation of 6 million, had lost to Paluku in the gubernatorial elections in 2007. Vahamwiti was elected as a provincial deputy in 2006 from Lubero for SMR (Social Movement for Renaissance) with Butondo. When Paluku was elected Governor, SMR launched a campaign to remove him.

The Doccia porcelain manufactory, at Doccia, a frazione of Sesto Fiorentino, near Florence, was in theory founded in 1735 by marchese Carlo Ginori near his villa, though it does not appear to have produced wares for sale until 1746.Battie, 103 It has remained the most important Italian porcelain factory ever since. In its first decades it was unusual in producing, alongside the usual tablewares and vases, etc, porcelain versions of statuettes and small sculptures, intended as bronzes, by Florentine sculptors of several decades earlier. After the death of its founder in 1757 the factory concentrated on producing more conventional wares, often borrowing styles from larger factories in Germany and France. Now known as Richard-Ginori, following its merger with Società Richard of Milan, by 2013 it was in bankruptcy and was acquired by Gucci. The Museo Richard Ginori della Manifattura di Doccia, a museum nearby dedicated to the factory and its history, is closed to visitors as of 2019. History Its early wares were of a soft-paste porcelain, as were most European porcelains with some exceptions, notably Meissen, where deposits of kaolin had been discovered and hard-paste porcelain was made. Vezzi porcelain in Venice had also made hard-paste with Saxon kaolin, but had closed in 1727. By around 1750 Doccia were making hard-paste.Hess, 212, 221 Ginori established the kilns at the foot of forested Monte Morello, whose timber fuelled them, and initiated experiments with local potting clays. He engaged J.K.W. Anreiter from Vienna to head the painting workshopHis son Anton succeeded him. and in 1737 a local sculptor, Gaspero Bruschi, as the chief modeller. Bruschi stayed at the factory until his death in 1780.Le Corbeiller, 12 Production began in 1737. By 1740 Ginori was confident enough of his products to send samples to Vienna and get a privilege for porcelain manufacture in the Austrian-ruled Grand Duchy of Tuscany, giving him the security of a monopoly.

Some statuettes of famous Roman sculptures were also produced.

With the revival of rococo styles in the nineteenth century, the Doccia manufactory reverted to its eighteenth-century models.

In 1950 the factory moved to a new building two miles away from the old site. The firm was declared bankrupt in January 2013. A deadline of May 2013 was set by the court to find a new buyer, hopefully one which would continue to maintain historic quality standards, operate the existing plant, employ its local workforce. Lenox, the American firm, and Apulum, a Romanian china manufacturer, showed interest and made joint bids. That effort proved unsuccessful and the firm was again put up for sale and in April, 2013 acquired by Gucci for €13 million, $16.8 million. Gucci's plans were to improve the factory in Florence, concentrate on high-end products, and sell products under its name in luxury markets such as China. Museum The Museo Richard Ginori della Manifattura di Doccia was opened in 1965 in a new purpose-built building near the factory. The collection had previously been housed in the eighteenth-century factory building. The museum and its collection was not included in the sale of the company to Gucci in 2013, and closed to visitors in 2014. In 2017 the Italian government agreed to buy it, with the sale completed in 2018. By then the building and parts of the collection (especially the unique collection of wax models) had suffered from lack of maintenance, and as of 2019 the museum remains closed to the public while restoration and conservation work continues.Amici di Doccia, \\"The Doccia Museum\\", accessed 14 June 2019.

Although the Kodiak Seamount is the oldest extant seamount in the Kodiak-Bowie chain, the adjacent lower slope contains transverse scars indicating earlier subduction of seamounts. The Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain is mostly extinct volcanoes that formed above the Bowie hotspot. This is a 100-to-150-km-wide morphological swell presumably of thickened hotspot generated crust, although there are no seismic refraction data across the swell to define crustal thickness. The crest of one such peak, Patton Seamount originally formed off Washington state as a submerged volcano 33 million years ago. Over time, as the Pacific Plate moved steadily northwest, Patton Seamount has carried off the Bowie hotspot and into the Gulf of Alaska. New volcanoes were formed one after another over the hotspot, creating the Kodiak–Bowie Seamount chain. Explorations of the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain have shown that despite the fact that most of the seamounts were created by the Bowie hotspot, all are unique in their size, shape, and volcanic features. The seamounts teem with deep-sea corals, sponges, and fish. Recent expeditions to these seamounts using manned submersibles and ROVs have discovered many marine species and have greatly expanded the knowledge of the range of deep sea corals in this region. For example, the Bowie Seamount is a biologically rich area with a dynamic and productive ecosystem. Because of this unique biological rich area, Bowie Seamount was declared a Pilot Marine Protected Area on December 8, 1998.Bowie Seamount Marine Protected Area The Kodiak-Bowie seamount chain is at the northern triple junction between the Pacific, North American, and Juan de Fuca plates.

Biography Kratz was sent by the then-newly- established Mennonite Central Committee,\\"Clayton Kratz: Went to Russia 1920\\", written by Paul Toews, mbhistory.org, retrieved 2007-09-02 Kratz and fellow volunteers Arthur Slagel and Orie Miller were sent to investigate the needs of Mennonites who were living in the areas of the former Russian Empire, and to bring relief assistance if needed. All three people sent by the Committee to serve the relief effort were still in their 20s. Kratz was 24-years-old, and younger than Slagel and Miller. He had finished his third year at Goshen College and was already engaged to be married. The trio left the United States on September 1, 1920, heading for Constantinople (later renamed Istanbul) in the Ottoman Empire. American Mennonites had already participated in the American Committee for Relief in the Near East and were familiar with the area. The trio were expected to gather supplies in Constantinople and transport them to the areas of southern Ukraine. Due to the ongoing Russian Civil War, the operations of paramilitary bands, epidemics of malaria and typhus, and an extended drought, the local populations in southern Ukraine were running out of food supplies. In Constantinople, it was decided that Slagel would remain in the city to organize the shipment of relief supplies, while Kratz and Miller would travel to Ukraine in person. Their destinations were Halbstadt (Molotschna) and Khortytsia (which has since been absorbed by Zaporizhia), settlements which served as administrative centers for the local colonies of Mennonites. Both settlements were in areas contested in battles between the Red Army and the White Army. The borders between the areas held by the two rival forces were at the time unstable. A paramilitary force under Nestor Makhno was also active in the area. Kratz and Miller reached Molotschna as expected, and were able to assess the needs of the local population. They then headed north towards Khortytsia. However, military conflicts in their area made it impossible for them to reach their destination, and they retreated back to Molotschna. Miller soon left for Constantinople, but Kratz remained in Ukraine. Kratz was reportedly urged to depart the area and head for Crimea, where he would be safer. He considered such a move to be cowardly and elected to stay in Molotschna. The Red Army soon captured Molotschna, and Kratz was arrested by the military authorities. He was released without incident, but days later Kratz was arrested for a second time. He was held with other political prisoners of the Red Army, and may have been suspected of serving as a spy for the Federal government of the United States. He was transferred with other prisoners outside the area of his capture. His further fate is unknown, but he never returned to the United States.

He was treasurer of the Diocese of Ossory in 1360, in which year he was elected Bishop of that Diocese by the Chapter. His election was cancelled by the Pope, who, however, in the following year appointed him Archbishop of Armagh. Sweetman revived the old controversy as to whether the Archbishop of Armagh had primacy over the Archbishop of Dublin, a claim which successive Archbishops of Dublin had always denied. He and Thomas Minot, Archbishop of Dublin from 1363 to 1375, maintained the dispute with such vehemence that King Edward III intervened personally in 1365, urging the two men to live in friendship and proposing that they settle the matter as a similar controversy between the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York had been resolved i.e. by each bearing his crozier in the other's presence. Sweetman replied at length insisting on the claim of Armagh to primacy and pointing out that Minot had failed to attend a meeting which convened to discuss the matter. This letter clearly had an effect, since Minot was summoned before the Privy Council of Ireland to answer a charge of contempt in failing to attend the meeting. Having thus asserted his authority, Sweetman was content to let the matter lapse, and no further action was taken against Minot.D'Alton, John, Memoirs of the Archbishops of Dublin Hodges and Smith Dublin 1838, pp. 138-141 Sweetman was present at the Irish Parliament of 1367 which passed the Statutes of Kilkenny. In 1374 he defeated an attempt by the Lord Deputy of Ireland, William de Windsor, to dispense with the Irish Parliament by ordering the clergy and laity of the Pale to attend the English Parliament. Sweetman argued that they had no such obligation, and that while out of deference to the King they would answer the summons they would not vote any taxation. Since this deprived the exercise of any point, it was not repeated.Pollard Dictionary of National Biography p. 198 Having governed the Primatial See for nineteen years he died in 1380, and is buried in Dromiskin, Co.Louth. He is one of the first recorded Sweetmans in Irish history: Maurice Sweetman, Archdeacon of Armagh, is likely to have been a nephew or cousin of Milo.

In his racing career, he ran twelve times and won two races. After his racing career, he stood as a stallion in South Korea. Background Commendable, a chestnut horse with a white blaze and four white feet, was sired by Gone West out of the mare Bought Twice, a half sister of the successful racehorse and sire Fappiano. As a yearling, he was consigned to the Keeneland July sales by the Taylor Made Agency, where he was bought for $575,000 by Robert and Beverly Lewis. Racing career 1999: two-year-old season Prior to the Belmont Stakes, Commendable earned $88,470 in seven races and his only win came in August 1999 in his debut: a Del Mar maiden race for two-year-olds. In his only other start at age two, he finished fourth in the Del Mar Futurity a month later. Despite his modest achievements in 1999, he was identified as a potential contender for the Triple Crown races by his trainer, D. Wayne Lukas. 2000: three-year-old season In 2000, Commendable lost four races leading up to the Triple Crown series, although he finished fourth in the San Felipe Stakes to Fusaichi Pegasus and the San Rafael Stakes to War Chant. In the Kentucky Derby, he finished seventeenth in a nineteen-horse field, after which his handlers chose not to run him in the Preakness Stakes. On a sweltering day at Belmont, Commendable was among the outsiders for the third leg of the Triple Crown, despite the absence of leading three-year-olds Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet. Lukas observed that he would need \\"a career best\\" to win. Ridden by Pat Day, Commendable raced prominently, took the lead half a mile from the finish and stayed on in the straight to hold off the 9/5 favorite Aptitude by a length and a half. The 67,000 crowd were reportedly stunned by the Commendable's win which was achieved in a slow time of 2:31.2. Following his Belmont win, Commendable finished fourth in the Dwyer Stakes and then finished eighth of the nine starters in the Haskell Invitational Handicap. He later took third in the Travers Stakes and second behind Tiznow in the Super Derby. Commendable did not race again, and his retirement was announced in November.http://espn.go.com/horse/news/2000/1130/913135.html Stud record He was retired to stud duty at Mill Ridge Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, where he remained until January 2005. He was then sold to the Korea Racing Association and exported to stand at a stud on Jeju Island, South Korea. Death Commendable died on April 10, 2014 of complications of colic. His death at the Jangsu Stud Farm in Jeolla, South Korea was confirmed in June 2014.

The exhibits at the museum are contained in over of fresh and saltwater displays. History The aquarium opened on June 14, 1986 as the Virginia Marine Science Museum. The focus of exhibits was on life in the rivers of Virginia, Chesapeake Bay, and the marine waters just off of Virginia. In 1996, the aquarium expanded, tripling its size. On November 21, 2009, the Virginia Aquarium opened a series of exhibits called \\"Restless Planet\\". The $25 million renovation designed by Chermayeff & Poole of Boston includes for habitats: Malaysian Peat Swamp, Coastal Sahara Desert, Red Sea, and Indonesia's Flores Island and doubled the number of species displayed by the aquarium. Some of the new animals include Komodo dragons, tomistomas, spotted eagle rays, and cuttlefish. Exhibits The two main exhibit buildings of the aquarium are the Bay and Main Building and South Building (opening summer 2021). The two are connected by a one-third mile outdoor nature trail running alongside Owls Creek Salt Marsh. Together the two buildings are home to more than 12,000 animals representing over 700 species. Main Building The Main Building houses displays intended to show the journey of water from the rivers of Virginia, through the Chesapeake Bay, and out into the ocean. The Restless Planet part of the displays are intended to show the forces that shaped Virginia. ;Chesapeake Bay Aquarium The Chesapeake Bay Aquarium starts with a touch pool where visitors can touch horseshoe crabs, Forbes’ sea stars, and whelk. The rest of the exhibit showcases species that live in the shallow waters around the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel including hermit crabs, spider crabs, and Hypsoblennius hentz. ;Norfolk Canyon Aquarium The Norfolk Canyon aquarium replicates the underwater environment of the Norfolk canyon, a canyon roughly 70 miles off the coast of Virginia. This exhibit is home to Sandbar Shark, Nurse Shark and Sand Tiger Shark as well as fish such as Crevalle Jack, Grey triggerfish and Southern stingray among others. ;Chesapeake Light Tower Aquarium The Chesapeake Light Tower Aquarium replicates the underwater environment of up to about off the coast of Virginia, and is home to loggerhead, green sea turtle, and Kemp's ridley sea turtle along with many fish including Atlantic spadefish, a large Atlantic Goliath grouper, Atlantic tripletail, cobia, lookdown, and permits. ;Restless Planet The new Restless planet expansion includes five immersive displays (a Malaysian Peat Swamp, the Coastal Desert, a replica of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea exhibit and a recreation of an Indonesian Volcanic Island), and new hands-on exhibits intended to show the forces that shaped the Virginia landscape into what it is today. Some of the animals in these exhibits include Komodo dragons, tomistomas, spotted eagle rays, Zebra Shark, Egyptian Cobra, Hedgehog and cuttlefish. South Building - Opens Summer 2021 The South Building opens summer 2021 and will feature North American river otters, a red octopus, moon jellies, and other amazing animals. This new building will give guests behind-the-scenes access to our Vet Center, Stranding Response Program, and Water Quality Lab. The new building will also include a large outdoor play area for kids with water tables, climbing nets, bubbles, and more. The Research and Conservation branch of the Aquarium is responsible for the Stranding Response Program, which responds to sick or injured seals, dolphins, whales, and sea turtles from local shores. The Marsh Pavilion will be closing to the public for renovations on January 2, 2019. Aviary The Virginia Aquarium Aviary was a half-acre habitat located behind the March Pavilion, and was home to 70 birds of about 30 species including a great horned owl, turkey vultures, great blue herons, brown pelicans, Fulvous whistling duck, great egrets, and ruddy ducks. Many of the birds had been injured and rehabilitated, and could not be released back into the wild. The aviary was badly damaged by a storm in the winter of 2015: though no birds were killed, most had to be dispersed to other wildlife centers. At the moment there is a crow and osprey on exhibit, with others off exhibit but used for educational programs. There are no current plans to rebuild the aviary.there are over 100,000 different types of animals here.

It was one of the original launch titles released for the Mega Drive in Japan and one of the six Genesis launch titles in the U.S. It was also later released on the Wii's Virtual Console service. Like Altered Beast, another launch title for the Mega Drive, Space Harrier II features digitized human voice recordings during gameplay, and is also an example of some of the Mega Drive's early sound, composed by Tokuhiko Uwabo (credited as \\"Bo\\"). Plot Harrier once again receives a call for help, this time from the 214th sector, light-years from his cruiser. Harrier travels there quickly with his \\"cosmic gate\\", and finds that Fantasy Land is once again being overrun by hostile forces. He resolves to once again save a world by fighting off the entire force himself. Once again. Gameplay Like the original, the game involves a superhuman hero who runs and flies towards a forever distant background on a checkerboard-styled ground. The player can hit any of the controller's buttons to cause the Space Harrier character to fire his large laser cannon (four shots at a time). There is also an option to turn on auto-fire in the game menu. As the playing field moves forward, enemies come from behind and from the far distance to attack the character, by either firing a projectile or trying to crash into him. The player must also dodge large objects in his path, some of which can be destroyed, such as trees, and others that cannot be, such as ionic columns and pylons. One hit from an enemy or a crash into these large objects will cause the player to lose a life; he/she can get extra lives for every certain number of points. Smaller objects, such as foliage, will only cause the character to trip; however, this leaves him/her vulnerable to attack for two seconds. If the player loses all lives, the game will be over. There are a total of 12 stages, each with its own end boss. A stage usually consists of different landscapes (small objects vs. large objects), and can also move at different speeds (slow vs. fast). Some stages, such as Stuna Area, have a mid-level boss that can be easily defeated. Although the player can select any stage to start the game at, all twelve levels must be completed before moving on to the Final Chapter stage. It is here that the player must defeat all the main bosses over again, and then fight the Dark Harrier in order to complete the game. Enemies move onto the screen in uniform clusters. A signal tone is played to alert the player that there is a non-stationary enemy now in the playing field. In many cases, the enemies move in a straight line along a pre-determined, pseudo- three-dimensional path. Waves of enemies also often come in pairs: one group will come from the left in the distance or foreground, followed by the same type and same number of enemies coming in from the right. Due to the inability of the Mega Drive to scale sprites, enemy, landscape, and shadow sprites are pre-rendered at different sizes.

History Marston Bigot was listed as \\"Mersitone-tora\\" in the Domesday Book, which gave the name of the then Saxon landowner as Robert Arundel. It became known as Marston Bigot some time after it was given by William the Conqueror to Roger de Bigod, which later became the Bigott family. The manor of Marston Bigot was held by the Crown after the execution of Lord Charles Stourton, 8th Baron Stourton in 1557. It was sold by Elizabeth I in 1596 to William Brown and James Orenge, or Orange. The parish was part of the hundred of Frome. Nearby is Marston Moat the site of a fortified manor house. Marston Bigot Park Marston Bigot Park encompasses approximately and includes Marston House, Marston Pond and the remains of the medieval shrunken village of Lower Marston. House Marston House The earliest description of Marston House is contained in a letter from Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, in 1641, when he purchased the Manor from Sir John Hippisley. In 1714, Marston was inherited by Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery, who rebuilt it. The house later passed to John Boyle, 5th Earl of Cork, and successive generations, who each left their mark on the house and grounds, including Edmund Boyle, 7th Earl of Cork who added Marston Pond, a boathouse, and three gate lodges. However late in the 19th century the house fell into disrepair and it was sold in 1905 to the Bonham-Christie family. Marston House and its grounds were used by the US Army during World War II, and were finally rescued from dereliction in 1984 by John and Angela Yeoman of Foster Yeoman Ltd, and used as the company headquarters. Foster Yeoman put the house on the market in 2012 at a price of £6 million. The house is a Grade II* listed building. It is built of squared and coursed Doulting stone with a slate roof and balustraded parapet, located on a long terrace with stone urns. The house is long but generally only deep, therefore presenting a massive facade when viewed from the park. In the three-storey central block of this front are four Ionic columns, which were built by Sir Jeffry Wyattville around 1817, with two- storey wings on either side, which were added in 1776 by Samuel Wyatt. Gardens The garden at Marston House is listed Grade II in the Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England. The gardens were laid out by Stephen Switzer between 1724 and 1745. They cover an approximately rectangular area of approximately . They include a rustic, rectangular-shaped, above-ground limestone grotto dating from 1743, north-east of the house near the Frome road, which was built by James Scott. Much of the 18th century layout is now hidden by a lake which was created in the 1820s and 1830s, as part of a restyling in the style of Capability Brown, with advice from William Sawrey Gilpin. Church The small stone church, dedicated to St Leonard, was built on the site of an older one and was opened to the public in 1789. It has a tower containing a fine peal of eight bells. It was altered in 1844 by Edward Davis. The nave has three bays with semi-circular headed windows with heavily enriched surrounds and an elaborate hammerbeam roof. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. The stained glass in the east window dates from the 15th century and is from Altenberg Abbey near Cologne, Germany. It depicts a scene from the early life of St Bernard, the driving force of the Cistercian order. Henry Waldegrave, 11th Earl Waldegrave, was rector of the village from 1905 to 1912, and lived in the rectory, which is also a listed building.

He had a notable collaboration with director Peter Yates that extended over six films including The Dresser (1983), which was nominated for numerous BAFTA Awards and Academy Awards. Lovejoy was an assistant to editor Anne V. Coates for films from The Horse's Mouth (1958) to Lawrence of Arabia (1962). He was next an assistant to editor Anthony Harvey on Dr. Strangelove (1964), which was produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick. Harvey subsequently became a director himself, and Kubrick promoted Lovejoy to be the editor for his subsequent film 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).. Reprint of 1997 edition. Kubrick and Lovejoy next worked together on The Shining (1980); Kubrick worked with other editors for his two films from the 1970s. Stephen Prince described Lovejoy's contributions to 1980s films as follows, \\"Ray Lovejoy cut Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), and he worked again with Kubrick on The Shining and supplied that film with an entirely different--tenser, more foreboding--texture than the stately science-fiction film possesses. Lovejoy also proved adept at editing for blockbuster effect. His cutting in Aliens sustained that sequel's narrative momentum with a speed and tension that its predecessor did not have, and his editing on Batman finessed that film's gaping narrative problems by simply rushing past them.\\" In 1987, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing for his work on the film Aliens (1986). In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild published a list of the 75 best-edited films of all time based on a survey of its members. Two films edited by Lovejoy are on this listing. 2001: A Space Odyssey was listed nineteenth, and The Shining was listed as forty-fourth. Lovejoy died of a heart attack on 18 October 2001.

The storm, which caused nine fatalities, formed from an area of disturbed weather on August 30, 2007, and became a tropical storm the next day. The cyclone moved parallel to the Mexican Pacific coast, but its proximity to the shore resulted in heavy rainfall over land. The most affected city was Acapulco, Guerrero, where six people were killed by landslides, and where over 100 families had to be evacuated after the La Sabana River flooded. Henriette then turned north and headed towards the Baja California peninsula, and became a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Henriette made its first landfall east of Cabo San Lucas at peak intensity, causing the death of one woman due to high surf. Hurricane Henriette then emerged over the Gulf of California, and made its second landfall near Guaymas. After causing heavy rains and killing four individuals in Sonora, the storm dissipated over the Sierra Madre Occidental and its remnants went on to cause flooding in New Mexico and Texas. Damage totaled about $275 million (2007 MXN, $25 million 2007 USD). It hit Mexico on the same day Hurricane Felix hit Nicaragua, only one of two occurrences in which a North Atlantic hurricane and a Pacific hurricane made landfall on the same day. Meteorological history Henriette originated from a tropical wave that departed the west coast of Africa on August 20, 2007. The wave produced some convection while in the Caribbean Sea but reached Central America on August 28 before any significant development could occur. Early on August 30, the area of low pressure, now 400 miles (640 km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico, started to gain clusters of strong convection. By the afternoon of August 30 the system continued to show strong convection and had developed a broad but well defined area of low to mid level cyclonic turning. By 0600 UTC that day the system became a tropical depression about southeast of Acapulco and was designated as Tropical Depression Eleven-E. Convection continued but the cyclone was encountering extensive easterly to north-easterly wind shear which stinted the strengthening of this storm throughout its history. The cyclone initially headed toward the west- northwest around a subtropical ridge that was centered over the western Gulf of Mexico. The depression moved north west, parallel with the west coast of Mexico due to being steered by the mid/upper-level ridge. On August 31, it strengthened to become Tropical Storm Henriette, 85 miles (137 km) south of Acapulco. Hurricane Henriette making landfall on the Baja California Peninsula. It continued to move along the Mexican coast bringing heavy rains. With continued strong convection, Henriette maintained its strengthening and was predicted to reach hurricane strength. However, despite the low wind shear and apparent warm waters. Henriette did not strengthen as expected. This is believed to be due to its proximity to land and colds waters being brought up due to Henriette's slow movement. The convection and strengthening continued and maintained itself as it moved away from Jalisco. Henriette turned westward and away from the Pacific coast of Mexico late on September 1 as the subtropical ridge built westward over northern Mexico. Henriette continued to improve in structure and with the formation of a distinct eye feature, reached hurricane strength on September 4 as it turned north-northwestward toward the Baja California peninsula, ahead of a mid-latitude trough approaching the west coast of the United States. The hurricane reached its peak intensity of 85 mph (135 km/h) that morning while centered about 75 miles (120 km)south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas. The center of Henriette made landfall just east of Cabo San Lucas on the afternoon of September 4 with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). It was over land for only about six hours before emerging into the Gulf of California. The brief interaction with land caused a slight weakening, but Henriette remained a Category 1 hurricane for most of that day. The next day it made final landfall near Guaymas in the state of Sonora. Henriette weakened quickly over land and dissipated over the mountains of northwestern Mexico early on September 6. The remnants of Tropical Storm Henriette continued to track across west Texas and southeastern New Mexico as it was being absorbed by a cold front moving through New Mexico. The flow of moisture from originating from these remnants, moderate instability, and marginal shear contributed to flash flooding and severe thunderstorms. Preparations September 2 five-day forecast track map The formation of Henriette was not anticipated well in NHC Tropical Weather Outlooks. The incipient system was first mentioned only about 31 hours before it became a tropical depression, and the potential for the formation of a depression was explicitly stated beginning only about 13 hours prior to genesis. On August 31, 2007 the National Meteorological Service in Mexico decreed zone of alert from Lagunas de Chacahua, Oaxaca to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. It requested the public to take precautions before the possible coming of rain, intense winds and storm surges in the south and southwestern coasts of Mexico. The Ministry of Education of Guerrero canceled classes at all schools in the evening and close the port navigation. Faced with the prospect of Henriette strengthening, The Head of the Harbor Bay in Acapulco stopped all travel for small craft and coastal fisheries. Also blue and yellow flags were raised as a preventive measure for swimmers. On September 4, the port of Mazatlán, Sinaloa had to be shut down to all navigation due to the inclement weather produced by the hurricane. The port authority reported that Henriette produced waves surpassing 4 meters (13 ft) in height. The Carnival Pride cruise scheduled to arrive at the port had to be diverted out to sea as a result of the port's closure. In the city itself, school was suspended for two days, and officials stated that approximately 600 families might have to be evacuated. Further north, the port of Topolobampo, Sinaloa was also closed due to Henriette's threat, and 20 families were evacuated from their homes in an ejido. In La Paz, the Municipal Direction of Civil defense informed that the first of 13 temporary shelters would be opened and anticipated the evacuation of more than 2000 people that lived in high-risk zones. In some areas, the local police recommended to the population, mostly those living in areas of high risk, that they should take care not to leave their homes unless necessary and to find evacuation routes and temporary shelters. Both Manuel Márquez de León International Airport in La Paz and Los Cabos International Airport in San José del Cabo were shut down, stranding 7,500–8,500 tourists. Henriette also forced the ports in Los Cabos to close completely, and the port in La Paz to close to small craft. Impact Henriette as a strong tropical storm to the west of Jalisco Henriette struck hardest in the resort town of Acapulco. Though the storm never passed closer than to the town, heavy rains along the coast saturated the ground, leading to mudslides. Six people were reported dead as a result of rockslides in two suburban neighborhoods of the city and in the port itself. Three were killed by a huge rock hitting their house, and the other three were killed when their dwellings partially collapsed. In addition, flooding from the overflowing of the River La Sabana, led to the evacuation of at least one hundred families from around the river by the Consejo Estatal de Proteccion Civil. Jorge Antonio Pacheco Albert, Director of Civil Protection for the Port of Acapulco, reported that approximately 800 were injured during the passage of Henriette along the coast and that 337 people relocated to temporary shelters. In Michoacán, Henriette damaged 10,000 square meters (107,000 sq. ft) of beach near Ixtapilla, destroying approximately 5,000 olive ridley turtle nests, comprising 10% of the endangered species's nests in the state. In Sonora, the hurricane destroyed 450 homes and damaged another 5,000 dwellings in Etchojoa and Huatabampo, which both have large Mayo Indian populations. The storm's precipitation flooded nearby agricultural fields, stopping wheat production, forcing local government to fumigate the region to try to prevent a dengue fever outbreak. Accessed via NewsBank. In the Yaqui River valley, two people were killed, and another 70 homes were destroyed by Henriette's winds. Throughout the state, 24,000 families were left homeless. Accessed via NewsBank One woman died due to high surf near Cabo San Lucas on the Baja California peninsula. Two fishermen were reported killed off the Sonora coast. The road connecting Guaymas to Ciudad Obregón was closed due to damage from the overflow of the brook Cocoraque which stranded around 600 cars. Lázaro Cárdenas was affected when the Acalpican River broke its banks. At least 50 houses located in the community of El Habillal, were flooded by water levels of up to . The residents had to leave their houses and be relocated in provisional housing. The remnants of Henriette caused flash floods and surface water 8-12 inches (20-30 cm) deep which covered roads with depths up to 1.5 inches (4 cm) in the U.S. States of New Mexico and Texas. Hail also accumulated on roadways. Damage in Mexico totaled about $275 million (2007 MXN, $25 million 2007 USD).

The building and its attached parking garage have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Public Service Building and Garage since 1996. It was built to house the offices of the Portland Gas and Coke Company and the Pacific Power and Light Company. The building's name reflects the fact that these utilities were \\"public services\\". A space in the Public Service Building fronting the corner of Salmon and Sixth streets became the first Niketown store. Structural details The north and south wings of the building were originally two stories tall, but were built up to their present height of 12 stories in 1957. Considered a skyscraper, once complete, the Public Service Building became the tallest building in Portland, holding that record until the 1960s. It was overtaken by the Hilton Portland Hotel in August 1962, when that building reached . The main power plant for the city was once located in the basement. The space is now used to house the city's main power feeds. Architectural details The Public Service Building was the third of three similarly Italianate buildings built in Portland by the firm of prolific local architect A.E. Doyle. The project's primary designer, Charles K. Greene, worked on the other Italianate Doyle-commissioned buildings in Portland: the smaller Bank of California Building (1924) and the Pacific Building (1926). Green initiated the design of this structure, but left Portland before the building was complete. Pietro Belluschi then completed the project. The first three floors of the Public Service Building are faced with gray terra-cotta, and the upper floors in gray brick. The cornices and details are also terra-cotta. The building has a stylized wave motif that can be seen along its moldings. The original roof, like its sister buildings, was clad in red clay tile. Pietro Belluschi's touch can be seen in the building lobby, where he designed elevator doors that represented the utility company tenants. Taking advantage of its being the tallest building in town, the utility companies added neon signs atop the roof: \\"POWER\\", \\"HEAT\\", \\"GAS\\", and \\"LIGHT\\", each aimed in a cardinal direction. At some point all four sides of this sign said \\"PACIFIC POWER\\". A.E. Doyle died in January 1928, only three weeks after the Public Service Building opened. Renovations Renovations to the Public Service Building took place in 1957, 1973, and 1999. The 1957 renovation raised the height of the building's wings to 12 floors. In 1973, the neon signs and original roofs were removed, and a new metal roof installed. The 1999 renovations focused on reducing energy costs with new technology, costing around $20 million. The building was sold in 1993 to the Goodman Family, also owners of parking garages and lots in Portland, for $3 million. Notable tenants The Niketown store in 2007, during light-rail construction on the transit mall. The store moved to another location in 2011. The first Nike retail store to be opened anywhere was located in the ground floor of the Public Service Building, at the corner of 6th and Salmon. Known as Niketown, a name later used for additional Nike stores in other major cities, it opened in November 1990. It closed at this location 21 years later, in October 2011, moving to a different location in downtown Portland.

She is also a member of Sigma Gamma Rho sorority. In 2017, she was inducted to the PGA America Hall of Fame. Early life Renee Powell was born in East Canton, Ohio. She began playing golf at the age of three. Her father, Bill Powell, is the first African American to create and build his own golf course in the US. He made miniature golf clubs for her to use as a child and was her golf teacher. Her early life was quiet, and Powell played a number of different sports as a young person, including archery, ballet and basketball. She helped maintain the Clearview golf course, driving a tractor. Powell entered her first amateur tournament at the age of 12 and won her division. Three years later, in 1960, she had 30 youth tournament trophies.

There were times she was not allowed to stay inside the official tournament hotels. When she toured with Canadian golfer Sandra Post, the two would work together to ensure that Powell would be able to get a room. Sometimes, however, Powell and Post would not be served at restaurants and left hungry. When they were not served, Powell would joke, \\"I didn't want to tell you, but it's because you're Canadian.\\" Powell did not make enough money to live just off her golf earnings, so she also worked at Wilson Sporting Goods and doing golf clinics and exhibitions. Her parents were also happy to help her out financially. By 1969, the LPGA insisted that they were an integrated tour and announced this at any towns they were visiting in order to head off problems before they might start for Powell.

Whitetopping is divided into types depending on the thickness of the concrete layer and whether the layer is bonded to the asphalt substrate. Unbonded whitetopping, also called conventional whitetopping, uses concrete thicknesses of 20cm (8\\") or more that is not bonded to the asphalt. Bonded whitetopping uses thicknesses of 5 to 15cm (2-6\\") bonded to the asphalt pavement and is divided into two types, thin and ultrathin. The bond is made by texturing the asphalt. Thin whitetopping uses a bonded layer of concrete that is 10 - 15cm (4-6\\") thick while an ultrathin layer is 5 to 10 cm (2-4\\") thick. Ultrathin whitetopping is suitable for light duty uses, such as roads with low traffic volume, parking lots and small airports. Fiber reinforced concrete is used in some thin whitetopping overlays and almost all ultrathin whitetopping overlays. Whitetopping is suitable for asphalt pavement with little deterioration, although repairs can be made to the asphalt if necessary. If the pavement is badly damaged, it should be completely removed and a new concrete pavement should be installed. The pavement should be relatively hard, as well. Deterioration of overlays is significantly increased on asphalt bases with high viscosity. If a grade or a distance between the pavement and a bridge needs to be preserved, the asphalt can be milled so that the height of the pavement does not change. However, whitetopping requires the asphalt layer to be at least 7.5cm (3\\") thick. If necessary, a section of new concrete roadway can be placed under a bridge with gentle slopes on either side that meet up with the whitetopped portions of the road.

Supporting the fleet at Okinawa  Late in March, as the war moved closer to Japan, Kishwaukee sailed for the Ryukyus to fuel ships engaged in the invasion of Okinawa. In spite of the constant enemy air raids, the oiler remained as station tanker until after Okinawa had been secured and continued servicing Allied ships in Okinawa until sailing for Japan, arriving Sasebo 22 December. Following six months as station tanker in the Far East, Kishwaukee cleared Japan 5 July and put into San Pedro, California, 31 July.  Post-war operations  From 1946 to 1950 Kishwaukee remained on active service with the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Based at Pearl Harbor she alternated tours in the Far East with cruises among the islands off the South and Central Pacific.  Korean War service  During the Korean War, she supplied vital fuel to Pacific Ocean staging areas and operated as a station ship out of Sasebo November through December 1950. Upon cessation of Korean hostilities, Kishwaukee resumed fuel shuttles from Pearl Harbor to the Pacific Islands and Alaska.  Post-Korean War activity  During 1954 the oiler unloaded cargo in French Indochina as the war in that country was nearing an end. That August she sailed to Formosa with a supply of aviation gasoline in anticipation of a possible Red Chinese attack on Nationalist held islands in the Formosa Straits. Kishwaukee returned Pearl Harbor 17 October and for the next three years continued runs between Hawaii and the Marshall Islands before sailing for the U.S. West Coast 10 November 1957. She arrived Astoria, Oregon, 11 December and decommissioned at Seattle, Washington, 2 April 1958. Her name was struck from the Navy List 1 July 1960. Kishwaukee remained with the Maritime Administration Reserve Fleet until October 1965, when her name reappeared on the Navy List.  Reactivated during the Vietnam War  The ship underwent extensive overhaul at the Swan Island Shipyard in Portland, Oregon, and recommissioned 1 September 1966. After fitting out, Kishwaukee arrived Pearl Harbor, her homeport, 7 October 1966. Following shakedown training, she sailed to the Far East 5 December and arrived, via Guam, at Subic Bay 22 December. The gasoline tanker entered the combat zone the last day of the year and supplied fuel for naval aircraft for strikes against targets ashore. From 2 January 1967 into April she operated out of Da Nang, South Vietnam, before departing for Yokosuka, Japan, arriving 30 April. Kishwaukee continued on to Pearl Harbor and joined ServRon 5 after her arrival 15 May.  End-of-service activity  Kishwaukee was decommissioned on 15 January 1970 at Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and laid up at INACTSHIPMAINTFAC West Lock, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. On 1 August 1974, she was struck from the Naval Register. Kishwaukee was disposed of by MARAD sale, 12 December 1978 to Mid Pacific Sea Harvesters, LTD for $56,480, for conversion to a fishing vessel.https://pmars.marad.dot.gov/DisposalCard/All/2887_AF.jpg Kishwaukee was converted to the fishing vessel Vicky Rae, serving as such until 1997 when she was scrapped in Shanghai, China.  Military awards and honors  Kishwaukee received two battle stars for World War II service: * Leyte operation * Okinawa Gunto operation During the Vietnam War, she was awarded seven campaign stars: * Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase II * Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase III * Tet Counteroffensive * Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase IV * Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase VI * Tet/69 Counteroffensive * Vietnamese Summer-Fall 1969 Kishwaukee’s crew was eligible for the following citations, medals and ribbons (shown in order of precedence): * Combat Action Ribbon (retroactive, Okinawa 1945, Danang 1969) * China Service Medal (extended) * American Campaign Medal * Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (2) * World War II Victory Medal * Navy Occupation Service Medal (with Asia clasp) * National Defense Service Medal (2) * Korean Service Medal * Vietnam Service Medal (7) * Republic of Vietnam Meritorious Gallantry Cross Unit Citation * Republic of Vietnam Civil Action Unit Citation * Philippines Liberation Medal * United Nations Service Medal * Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal * Republic of Korea War Service Medal (retroactive)  References   External links  * NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive - AOG-9 Kishwaukee Category:Patapsco-class gasoline tankers Category:Ships built in Savage, Minnesota Category:1943 ships Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Vietnam War auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Korean War auxiliary ships of the United States ","title":"USS Kishwaukee (AOG-9)"},{"id":"13068957","text":"The Tampa City Council is the legislative body of the municipal government of the U.S. city of Tampa, in Hillsborough County, Florida.

He is best known as a founding member of the Finnish cello metal band Apocalyptica, a band he left in 2001 to join the Finnish thrash metal band Hevein. Beginning in 2007, Lilja has been a recording and touring member of Tarja Turunen's solo band. Throughout his career, Lilja has continued to play classical music alongside rock, metal, and crossover projects. Early life and musical training Max Lilja was born in Vantaa, Finland. In 1980, he began playing the violin, but quickly switched to cello at age 7.Interview With Max Lilja by Winter Storm Belgium & Nederland (Tarja Turunen fan club) In 1985, Lilja began his studies in the Junior Academy of Helsinki's prestigious Sibelius Academy, after studying as a practice pupil for the Sibelius Academy cellist Panu Saari. In 1993, he was accepted into the Sibelius Academy's University-level program as a student of Dr. Raimo Sariola and Prof. Arto Noras. It was in this program that he first began to play covers of Metallica songs with the cellists who went on to form Apocalyptica. Lilja did quite well at the Sibelius Academy, earning the principal chair of the Academy's Symphony Orchestra in 1995.Bio from Max Lilja's homepage Apocalyptica In 1995, Max Lilja joined the future members of Apocalyptica in their experimentation with playing rock and metal music on the cello, which led to their first gig playing in a rock club. Within a year, Apocalyptica was founded and signed to Finnish indie label Zen Garden, and released their debut album Plays Metallica by Four Cellos in 1996. In 1997, this first album began worldwide sales, and Apocalyptica began touring and performing so frequently that Lilja dropped out of the Sibelius Academy to devote himself full-time to the band. Within the next three years, Lilja recorded two more albums with Apocalyptica, Inquisition Symphony and Cult. In 2001, Lilja toured with Apocalyptica for the last time as a member of the band. Hevein and Tarja In 2002, Max Lilja left Apocalyptica and joined Hevein. He appeared on their 2005 debut album Sound Over Matter, released through Spinefarm Records, as well as a couple of earlier demo recordings.Hevein – Sound Over Matter review from Metalstorm.net Hevein left Spinefarm Records, and financed their own self-released demo in 2012, while looking for a new label.HEVEIN Releases New Digital EP from Blabbermouth.net Later that year, Hevein disbanded, promising to regroup if funding to finish their latest album ever materialized.Hevein – Disband Indefinitely from Metalstorm.net In 2007, Lilja began performing with former Nightwish singer Tarja Turunen, as she launched her solo career.

It is native to Europe, northwest Africa and western Asia, from the central British Isles south to Morocco, and east to Kyrgyzstan.Flora Europaea: Rhamnus cathartica It was introduced to North America as an ornamental shrub in the early 19th century or perhaps before, and is now naturalized in the northern half of the continent, and is classified as an invasive plant in several US statesTorrey, J. (1824). A flora of the northern and middle sections of the United States: or, a systematic arrangement of all the plants hitherto discovered in the United States north of Virginia. Vol 1. New York:T. and J. Swords, pp. 513 and in Ontario, Canada.  Description  Rhamnus cathartica is a deciduous, dioecious shrub or small tree growing up to tall, with grey-brown bark and often spiny branches. The leaves are elliptic to oval, long and broad; they are green, turning yellow in autumn, and are arranged somewhat variably in opposite to subopposite pairs or alternately. The flowers are yellowish-green, with four petals; they are dioecious and insect pollinated. The fruit is a globose black drupe, across, and contains two to four seeds. The species was originally named by Carl Linnaeus as Rhamnus catharticus, but this spelling was corrected to cathartica as the genus name Rhamnus is treated as being of feminine gender.Bean, W. J. (1980). Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles 8th ed., vol. 3. John Murray .  Toxicity  The seeds and leaves are mildly poisonous for humans and most other animals, but are readily eaten by birds, who disperse the seeds in their droppings.Rushforth, K. (1999). Trees of Britain and Europe. Collins .Flora of NW Europe: Rhamnus cathartica The toxins cause stomach cramps and laxative effects that may function in seed dispersal. The chemical compounds responsible for this laxative effect are anthraquinone and emodin. The species name cathartica and the common name purging buckthorn refer to this effect. In 1994, R. cathartica was implicated in the outbreak of an idiopathic neurological disease in horses, although no causative agent was officially identified. In trials where rodents were fed the leaves and stems of R. cathartica, glycogen metabolism became abnormal and glycogen deposits formed in the cytoplasm of liver cells. Abnormalities in glycogen metabolism lead to diabetes in humans.  Ecology  Rhamnus cathartica is shade-tolerant, moderately fast-growing and short-lived. It is a food plant of the brimstone butterfly, Gonepteryx rhamni. The sulphur-yellow males are indicative of the presence of this species or of its alternative host, Frangula alnus. This species is the alternate host for the significant rust disease of cereals caused by Puccinia coronata. Rhamnus cathartica is also the primary overwintering host in North America for a significant agricultural pest of soybeans, the soybean aphid.  Allelopathy  Secondary compounds, particularly emodin, have been found in the fruit, leaves, and bark of the plant, and may protect it from insects, herbivores and pathogens. The emodin present in R. cathartica fruit may prevent early consumption, as it is found most in unripe fruits, which allows seeds to reach maturity before being dispersed. Birds and mice significantly avoid eating unripe fruits, and if forced to ingest emodin or unripe fruit, the animals regurgitate the meal or produce loose, watery stools. Allelopathic effects of exudates from R. cathartica leaf litter, roots, bark, leaves and fruit may reduce germination of other plant species in the soil. Soils in buckthorn-dominated areas are higher in nitrogen and carbon than normal soils, which speeds up decomposition rates of leaf litter. This can result in bare patches of soil being formed and R. cathartica performs well in such disturbed habitats, so this may be adaptive for the setting of its seed.  Invasive species  The species is naturalised and invasive in parts of North America.Minnesota Department of Natural Resources: Buckthorn – Invasive Species Rhamnus cathartica has a competitive advantage over native trees and shrubs in North America because it leafs out before native species.Barnes, W. J. (1972) The autecology of the Lonicera × bella complex. Dissertation, University of Wisconsin. Of the annual carbon gain in R. cathartica, 27–35% comes from photosynthesis occurring before the leaves of other plants emerge. Soil in woodlands dominated by R. cathartica was higher in nitrogen, pH and water content than soil in woodlands relatively free of R. cathartica, probably because R. cathartica has high levels of nitrogen in its leaves Michigan Department of Natural Resources: \\"Invasive Species—Best Control Practices, Common Buckthorn.\\" and these leaves decompose rapidly. Rhamnus cathartica is also associated with invasive European earthworms (Lumbricus spp.) in the northern Midwest of North America. Removing R. cathartica led to a decrease of around 50% in the biomass of invasive earthworms. Soils enriched by extra nitrogen from decayed buckthorn leaves and additional earthworm activity have a negative impact on North American forest ecosystems: \\"Invasive earthworms, which need rich litter, break [buckthorn leaves] down rapidly, destroying beneficial fungi and exposing bare soils in the process. These soils provide ideal conditions for buckthorn germination and seedling growth but many native trees and shrubs need the beneficial fungi and will not reproduce without it.\\" Common buckthorn can be found in most northern states of the United States and it is particularly prevalent in the Great Lakes states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. A current map of its distribution can be found at Early Detection and Distribution Mapping System (EDDmapS). EDDMapS. 2019. Early Detection & Distribution Mapping System. The University of Georgia - Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health. Available online at \\"http://www.eddmaps.org/\\"; last accessed October 27, 2019.  Control  Rhamnus cathartica is difficult to control in its invasive range, because it sprouts vigorously and repeatedly from the root collar following cutting, girdling or burning.Barnes, Burton V. and Wagner Jr., Warren H. (2004). Michigan Trees Herbicide application to newly cut stumps is a popular and effective control method, but seeds stay viable in the soil for several years before sprouting, so repeated treatments and long-term monitoring of infested areas is required. Garlon and Tordon and their derivatives have been found to be effective chemical means of control. Roundup can be used but is less reliable. An application of these chemicals in early winter reduces the risk of negatively affecting non-target species, as most have gone dormant by this time. It is also easier to spot infestations at this time of the year, as the leaves of R. catharticus stay out an average of 58 days longer than native plants. Mechanical control methods such as pulling and chopping of plants are more environmentally friendly, but also very time-consuming. Plants with stems less than half an inch in diameter or less than a metre (3') tall can easily be pulled, but pulling risks disturbing the roots of adjacent, native plants and harming them as well. Propane weed-torches may also be used to kill seedlings, which will generally not resprout if burned in spring or early summer.  Uses  Cutting board made from common buckthorn and Norway maple The bark and fruit of Rhamnus catharticus were used as a purgative in the past, although their potentially dangerous violent action and side-effects means they are now rarely used.Plants for a Future: Rhamnus cathartica The wood is hard and dense, but little-used because it is difficult to obtain in workable sizes.

The route is approximately in length and with its continuation into Tennessee as SR 395 connects Erwin, Tennessee to Flat Creek, North Carolina. Portions of this highway lie within the Pisgah National Forest and is one of the few highways in the state with an unpaved portion. Route description Mitchell County Beginning at the state line with Tennessee, NC 197 enters the Pisgah National Forest and winds south down the Unaka escarpment to Poplar. South of Poplar, NC 197 begins the first of three segments where it follows the North Toe River and the former Clinchfield Railroad. It intersects and overlaps NC 226 for a short distance near Red Hill. Yancey County The final segment of NC 197 that follows the Toe River does so in the reverse direction as the previous two times this occurred. This segment comes after a railroad crossing and a new concrete arch bridge that carries the highway across the Toe River into Yancey County. After leaving the river area, NC 197 continues through mountains and grassy knolls until it arrives at U.S. Route 19E (US 19E) just east of Burnsville. Following a short overlap with US 19E, NC 197 leaves US 19E in Burnsville as Pensacola Road and goes through the Cane River valley to Pensacola. From Pensacola, NC 197 turns right and proceeds over Cane River Gap into Buncombe County after passing through Murchison. Buncombe County As it enters Buncombe County, NC 197 (now North Fork Road) turns to gravel as it crosses the Cane River Gap for a short distance and reenters the Pisgah National Forest for a short distance. As it winds its way down to the Barnardsville valley it crosses over the headwaters of Ivy Creek four times before it continues onto the pavement near Barnardsville. From Barnardsville, NC 197 (as the Barnardsville Highway) becomes a relatively straight road that partially follows Ivy Creek until its junction with Future Interstate 26/US 19/US 23 at exit 15 near Flat Creek. Proceeding forward from the end of NC 197 is Jupiter Road (SR 1756). A right turn before the overpass allows access to west I-26/north US 19/US 23 to Johnson City, Tennessee. A left turn after the I-26 underpass allows access to east I-26/south US 19/US 23 to Asheville. History From the 1920s-1940s, NC 197 was formed, running from Cane Creek Post Office (near Burnsville) to Bakersville. Portions of that alignment are now NC 226. Between 1924 and 1948 the highway's route had been changed to run from the former NC 26 at Red Hill southward to Flat Creek along a route similar to that in use today. In the 1980s, NC 197 is extended from Red Hill to the Tennessee state line where it enters Tennessee as TN 395.

He was known for his furniture designs in leather. Education An icon of luxurious French Modernism, Jacques Adnet grew up with the 20th Century. He attended the Municipal School of Design in Auxerre and the École des Beaux-Arts Paris. He believed in the functional aspect of furniture combined with geometrical simplicity. Jacques Adnet was inspired by pre-classical styles and was well acquainted with traditional furniture. Until the age of 28, Jacques lived and worked hand in hand with his twin brother Jean at the Studio La Maitrise, where they met the Art Déco designer Maurice Dufrene. From 1928 to 1960, he directed La Compagnie des Arts Francais. His team of decorators included Francois Jourdain, Charlotte Perriand and Georges Jouve. Adnet presided over the Salon des Artistes Decorateurs from 1947 to 1949. During the 1950s, he created furniture and concentrated on the numerous commissions he received, such as the decoration of the private apartments of the President at the Elysée Palace or the meeting room of the UNESCO headquarters in Paris. In 1959 he became the director of École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs in Paris until 1970. Selected works Cabinet (1937) Adnet exhibited at the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes. Distinctly avant garde, Adnet and was among the first to expect metal and glass to integrate with the structure and decoration of furniture. In 1926 he designed the salle commune of the Ile-de-France. By 1928, had become Director of La Compagnie des Arts Français (CAF) - at the age of 28. CAF provided Adnet with an ideal platform from which to promote his modernist designs. These incorporated precious woods, chromed metals, embellishments such as mirror, leather, parchment and smoked glass in linear styles with decoration pared away wherever possible. In 1970 Adnet became director of École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs.

Kona Gold was foaled at Carlos Perez's Twilite Farm outside LaGrange, Kentucky. He was sold as a yearling for $35,000 at the 1995 Keeneland September yearling sale to trainer Bruce Headley on behalf of a partnership that included Headley, Irwin and Andrew Molasky, and Michael Singh. Headley trained Kona Gold at his base in southern California, where the horse was brought along very patiently. Kona Gold suffered a few minor physical setbacks, including a knee chip as a three-year-old that kept him from the races until May of his four-year-old season in 1998.  Early races  After a second-place finish in his debut at Hollywood Park Racetrack, Kona Gold won his next three races by a combined 28½ lengths. His first Graded stakes race (the Grade 3 Ancient Title Handicap at Santa Anita in which he finished 5th, beaten 2¼ lengths) was solid enough to earn him a trip to Churchill Downs for the 1998 Breeders' Cup Sprint. In his 6th lifetime start, Kona Gold finished 3rd, losing by two lengths.  1999  Kona Gold returned in January 1999, setting a Santa Anita Park track record for 5½ furlongs in the El Conejo Handicap with a time of 1:01 3/5. (The runner-up Big Jag, who chased Kona in vain throughout the stretch, went on to trounce his field in the prestigious Dubai Golden Shaheen that March.) Kona Gold's four additional 1999 starts resulted in four runner-up finishes, never losing by more than 2 lengths. In his '99 finale (the Breeders' Cup Sprint), he made up ground in the stretch but fell short by a half-length to Artax, who set a new Breeders' Cup Sprint stakes record and Gulfstream Park six-furlong track record of 1:07 4/5. Artax also won the Eclipse Award as champion sprinter of 1999. 2000 Kona Gold's best year in racing was at age six in 2000. He capped off the year with a victory in the Breeders' Cup Sprint and was subsequently voted the American Champion Sprint Horse. Kona Gold raced until he was 9 years old. After spending several years as a stable pony for former trainer Bruce Headley, he became a permanent resident of the Kentucky Horse Park in 2008 after the death of John Henry.\\"Kona Gold to live at Kentucky Horse Park\\", Thoroughbred Times, November 26, 2007 Death Kona Gold was euthanized on September 25, 2009, at the age of 15 after fracturing his left front leg while exercising in his paddock at the Kentucky Horse Park.

This year-round family-owned and operated business, founded in 1975, was built on the site of the Casino dance hall and night club, which was itself established in 1922. In addition to first-run movies, the Casino houses the Village Malt Shoppe, which features an old-fashioned soda fountain offering ice cream soda, malted milk, milkshake, egg cream and phosphates, as well as a large selection of ice cream flavors. There is also a redemption game room geared toward younger children, and an 18-hole miniature golf course. History The \\"Casino\\" name predates the existing Casino Theatre building and business, and goes back to a landmark dance hall built on the same spot in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania. Several decades later the building was transformed into a movie house, with seats placed on the flat dance floor and the screen on the stage. The \\"Casino Theatre,\\" complete with British spelling of \\"theater,\\" was born. The original one-story 1922 Casino building, originally used as a dance hall and night club, was converted to a movie theater after being purchased by Mrs. H.C. Smith of Stroudsburg. The theater building was purchased in 1974 by three local couples: George & Sheila Litz of Cresco, and two couples from Pocono Farms, Victor & Diane Genco and John & Ruth Hildebrand. The three families formed a business entity called LIGEND, Inc., from the letters of their last names, and incorporated it with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on March 12, 1975. The families renovated and modernized the vintage structure, opening for business on April 4, 1975, with the addition of an old-fashioned ice cream parlor called the Village Malt Shoppe, with 20 flavors of ice cream. The new decor featured paneling with an old-fashioned newspaper design, along with crisp white curtains and Tiffany-style lamps. The building was also home to two other LIGEND businesses: the Needles N' Things sewing and craft shop and the Early American Gift Shop. The single 200-seat Casino movie theater reopened that May with a showing of the classic Gone With the Wind. Less than a year after the grand reopening, disaster struck. On March 11, 1976, the renovated Casino Theatre and neighboring businesses burned to the ground. Operated as a summer business, the movie theater and malt shop were closed for the season at the time. The building had been broken into several times over the winter, fueling speculation about the cause of the fire. The Casino had been scheduled to open on April 26 with the movie musical 1776 in honor of the United States Bicentennial, and the local bicentennial committee had been planning to sell tickets to the show to raise money for a Fourth of July parade. Two hours after the first firefighters arrived at the scene, only the brick facade of the old wooden building remained. The new building opened just four months later, in July 1976, with a new single-screen movie theater and new ice cream parlor. The silver lining of the fire was that the resulting destruction of the original building meant that the new building was built with a slanted floor, allowing a modern movie-going experience instead of the neck-craning involved when watching a film from the flat floor of the old dance hall. Within just a few years, the Litzes bought out their partners and began expanding the operation. Today, after more than 30 years, the business is still owned and operated by the Litz family, and the Casino is in its second generation of family management. (With the third generation often employed there.) Over the years, the Litzes added a kitchen, miniature golf course and a game room targeted at pre-teens and younger, with prize redemptions. The 1950s theme of the decor dates to 2004, when a gift shop featuring nostalgia and retro items was added. Items featuring Betty Boop, Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, I Love Lucy, and other icons of the 1950s. For years, the Casino ran second-run movies or classics, permitting the theater to show a greater range of films by showing them for shorter periods of time, as makes sense for a business with a relatively small customer base. But as the population of The Poconos has grown, so has the Casino: The theater was twinned in 2003, when the Casino also started running first-run movies. The business continues to grow. For years, the Casino was a seasonal business, open for weekends only from mid-March through Memorial Day, then running full- time through the end of September, when it would revert to weekends only through Thanksgiving. In 2007, the Casino became a year-round operation. With a movie theater, malt shop, sandwich restaurant, children's arcade room, gift shop and miniature golf operation all under one roof, the owners are recasting the business as the Casino Theatre Entertainment Center.

Hines. Edward N. Hines (January 13, 1870 – June 4, 1938 ) was a member of the Wayne County Road Commission (of Wayne County, Michigan), from 1906 to 1938. A printer by trade, he is one of the great innovators in road development.  Career  As a cyclist in 1890, Hines formed a Good Roads organization in Michigan which advocated for the development of county roads. This led to the passage of the County Road Law in 1893, and a change to Michigan's Constitution in 1894. During this time, Hines was president of the Detroit Wheelmen cycling club, chief consul of League of American Wheelmen's Michigan Division, and vice-president of the League of American Wheelmen. Hines was appointed to the Wayne County Board of Roads at its inception in 1906, along with Henry Ford and Cassius R. Benton. In 1909, Hines was responsible for the construction of the first full mile of concrete road pavement in the world, the stretch of Woodward Avenue between Six Mile Road and Seven Mile Road in Detroit. Hines originated the concept of painting a line down the center of a road to separate traffic in opposing directions. The idea came to him after watching a leaky milk wagon leave a trail down the street. Painted center lines were first used in 1911 on River Road in Trenton, in Wayne County. This simple idea has since been recognized as one of the most important single traffic safety devices in the history of highway transportation. Snow removal from public roads was another of Hines' innovations. Hines, along with William E. Metzger and others, formed the Detroit Automobile Club in 1916. Hines was a national leader in the concept of landscaping highway rights-of-way. He was instrumental in movements to beautify highways by eliminating power lines and billboards. In the 1920s, Hines was a leader in the movement to acquire land along the Huron River and the Rouge River for the purpose of converting them into parks. In 1937, the Middle Rouge Parkway was renamed the Edward N. Hines Parkway, in his honor.  Honors and recognition  * In 1935, Hines was awarded the George S. Bartlett Award for outstanding contribution to highway progress. * He was later inducted into the Michigan Transportation Hall of Honor in 1972. * and in 2011, Hines received the Paul Mijksenaar Design for Function Award.

A wide range of damage can be repaired using paintless dent repair as long as the paint surface is intact. Paintless dent repair may be used on both aluminum and steel panels. The most common practical use for paintless dent repair is the repair of hail damage, door dings, minor creases, large dents and bodylines damage. The method can also be utilized to prepare a damaged panel for repainting by minimizing the use of body filler. This technique is currently known as \\"push to paint\\" or \\"push to prep\\". Limiting factors for a successful repair using paintless dent repair include the flexibility of the paint (most of today's refined automotive paint finishes allow for successful PDR) and the extent to which the metal has been stretched by the damage, which depends on the thickness of the metal, the curvature or flatness where the damage occurred and the intensity of the impact. Generally speaking, the shallower the dent, the greater the likelihood of paintless dent repair being a suitable option. Even dents several inches in diameter can be repaired by this method as long as the metal and paint are not stretched. It is possible to repair a shallow large dent or crease to an acceptable level, but very sharp dents and creases may not be suitable for paintless dent repair. History Although paintless dent repair can tie its origins to repoussé and chasing, which in antiquity can date its origins back to the 3rd Century BC with Gold, Silver, Copper, and Tin. Paintless dent removal was started by Frank T. Sargent in 1931, when he wrote a groundbreaking work \\"The Key To Metal Bumping\\".The Key To Metal Bumping:An Instructive Manual Of Body And Fender Repair Practices, Frank T. Sargent This book describes the tools of paintless dent repair, how to use them, and even gives illustrations on how one might predict the metal to move. Almost 20 years later Oskar Flaig made the first public display on record, in February 1960 during the \\"International Motor Sports Show\\" in New York City, USA. Oskar Flaig was an ordinary member of staff at Mercedes-Benz. His job was to take care of the paintwork of all the show cars presented at trade fairs. Damage, scratches on the paintwork and small dents, produced by the public during the day, needed to be re-painted at night, so the vehicles would be in perfect condition the next day. At the trade fair in New York City, Oskar Flaig used a hammer handle to push out a small dent, so he would need to apply less filler before painting. Nevertheless, the result already looked perfect after pushing. After the show, Flaig returned home to Germany and started developing techniques and tools to repair dents. He was eventually promoted to foreman at the Mercedes Sindelfingen plant where he was known as the “golden tinsmith” and started PDR training programs at all branch plants. These techniques were used in Germany for a long time before finally being promoted as a successful way to repair dents in the United States in 1979-1983 when Juergen Holzer moved from Germany to Minneapolis, Minnesota and started Dent Kraft (the first recorded business in the United States use paintless dent repair). In other forms of metal working, similar techniques of paintless dent removal, may have been employed as early as the 1930s in automotive assembly plants, and was popularized much later. Techniques The most common PDR techniques utilize metal rods and body picks to push out the dents from the underside of the body panel. Glue and specially designed tabs may be used to pull out the dents from the outside of the panel. Fine tuning the repair often involves tapping down the repair to remove small high spots. Technicians can blend high spots to match the texture of the paint called orange peel. Cracking or chipping can be avoided with the use of heat, although a re-painted surface has a greater likelihood of cracking.

Ray, and co-written by Larry Alexander.  Plot  As his father works on a tractor, young Matthew turns it on and kills him with it, damaging his own left hand in the process. Matthew is subsequently placed in a psychiatric hospital, and his mangled limb is replaced with a hook. At the age of eighteen, Matthew is released from the asylum, and returns home, discovering that in his absence his mother has married a neighbor named Mack Parsons. Matthew, who harbors incestuous feelings for his mother despite his aversion to sex, dislikes Parsons, and one night he murders him with an axe. Matthew's mother discovers what her son has done, and when an argument breaks out between them, Matthew knocks her to the ground, and she dies due to hitting her head on a rock. In the morning, a distraught Matthew hitches a ride with a young couple, whom he also kills, beating in the man's head with a rock and drowning the woman in a roadside stream. Matthew eventually reaches a town, where he makes the acquaintance of a painter and prostitute named Vera, who reminds Matthew of his mother. Matthew becomes obsessed with Vera, to the point of slitting the throat of one of her clients, a drunken sailor, in a jealous rage. Wanting to impress Vera and give her a better life, Matthew bluffs his way into a mansion, where he smothers the owner with a pillow, hacks the maid to death with a cleaver, and beheads the pet dog. Each night, Matthew sleeps with a mannequin in his bed. Matthew brings Vera to the mansion, but when she continually refuses his offers to live with him, he grows enraged, and takes her prisoner. Matthew tries to make Vera accept her new life, but she defies him at every turn, even after he bludgeons a doctor (who dropped by to see the house's owner) in front of her. One day, while trying to convince Matthew that she needs a bath, Vera realizes that he is disgusted and disturbed by sexuality, and she uses this to her advantage. Vera intimidates Matthew into trying to have sex with her, and while he is distracted, she stabs him with a loose door hook and tries to escape, but Matthew catches her and rips her throat out with his hook. With Vera dead, Matthew becomes completely unhinged and runs through town, chased by hallucinations of his victims. Matthew breaks into a church, and as the phantoms surround him, he uses his hook to kill himself.

Borst,\\"David W. Borst\\" (collegebroadcasters.us) who in late 1936 had established the first low- powered AM carrier current radio station on a college campus, \\"The Brown Network\\" at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. IBS's organizing convention was held at Brown on February 17-18, 1940, and attended by representatives from twelve colleges with existing or proposed carrier current stations. George Abraham was elected the IBS Chairman, Peter Thorpe the Advertising Manager, David Borst the Technical Manager, Joseph Parnicky the Program Manager, and Louis M. Bloch, Jr. the organization's Business Manager. IBS's role was defined as a medium for the exchange of ideas and programs, in addition to working to attract national advertising contracts for the member stations. The first IBS intercollegiate broadcasts began on May 9, 1940, with a five-part series that was carried by stations located throughout New England at Brown, Harvard, Williams, and Wesleyan universities, in addition to the Universities of Connecticut and Rhode Island.The Gas Pipe Networks: A History of College Radio 1936-1946 by Louis M. Bloch, Jr., 1980, pages 25-29. In August 1940, Bloch moved to New York City in order to promote the stations and sign advertising contracts for the then twelve-station organization, known informally as the \\"Gas Pipe Network\\". A small office was established at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street and a rate card prepared, operating under the slogan \\"From Princeton to Stanford, IBS Sells the Colleges\\".Bloch, Jr. (1980) pages 35-42. Although the initial IBS member stations were all AM carrier current stations that were financed by selling commercials, the organization eventually concentrated on promoting noncommercial educational FM stations. In 1940, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) established the first band for FM broadcasting, consisting of forty channels occupying 42 to 50 MHz, with five of these channels reserved for educational stations.\\"The Eastern Massachusetts Radio Timeline: the 1940s\\", (bostonradio.org) In 1945 the FM band was moved and expanded to one hundred channels, from 88 to 108 MHz. IBS, in an effort led by U.S. Commissioner of Education John W. Studebaker, organized witnesses to testify on behalf of educational radio, and was instrumental in getting the FCC to secure an FM \\"reserved band\\" of twenty education channels from 88.1 to 91.9 MHz.Bloch, Jr. (1980) page 74-75. Later, IBS helped promote the establishment of low-power 10-watt Class D licenses, to provide for low cost entry-level noncommercial stations.

The most powerful diesel-electric fireboat in terms of pumping capacity when built in 1938, Fire Fighter fought more than 50 major fires during her career, including fires aboard the SS Normandie in 1942 and the in 1944, the 1973 collision of the Esso Brussels and SS Sea Witch, and the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Service history Authorized for construction in early 1937 by Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia based on designs submitted by noted naval architect William Francis Gibbs and his firm Gibbs & Cox, Fire Fighter was laid down at United Shipyards as Hull #856 and was christened and launched on August 28, 1938, by Eleanor Grace Flanagan. After fitting out and sea trials, Fire Fighter officially entered service with the New York City Fire Department at 9:00 a.m. on November 16, 1938, with Engine 57 at Pier 1 at the Battery, which would later be organized as Marine Unit 1. Serving from this post through the mid-1960s, Fire Fighter would respond to two of her most famous actions; the fire and capsizing of the SS Normandie in 1942 and the fire aboard the ammunition-laden SS El Estero in 1943, among dozens of other vessel and pier fires across New York Harbor. Shifting with the majority of commercial steamship line freight operations from Manhattan to the Brooklyn waterfront, Fire Fighter served with Marine Unit 8 and Engine 223 at the 37th Street Pier through 1967 before shifting once again to the Homeport Pier in Stapleton where she joined Marine Unit 9, an assignment which made her the first-due marine firefighting asset at the heavily trafficked Narrows of New York Harbor and throughout the tight confines of both the Arthur Kill and Kill van Kull. With both waterways already heavily utilized by marine traffic calling at ports on the Chemical Coast, the rise of both the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal and Howland Hook Marine Terminal saw an increasing number of container ships transiting the same waters. These conditions led to several major vessel collisions and shoreside fires during her tenure in Staten Island, but the 1973 collision of SS Esso Brussels and SS Sea Witch would prove to be the largest fires she would ever fight single- handedly. For her and her crew's part in the response, firefighting and rescue of 31 surviving crewmen from the burning SS Sea Witch, the Fire Fighter was named a Gallant Ship and her crew received the American Merchant Marine Seamanship Trophy. To date, Fire Fighter remains the only fireboat to have received this award. A 1974 article in The New York Times described how fires in New Jersey frequently resulted in requests to the FDNY commissioner for the loan of Fire Fighter. Once authorized it would take Fire Fighter approximately 45 minutes to arrive at waterfront communities such as Carteret. The boat, as Firefighter, was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1989. and On September 11, 2001, Fire Fighter along with the rest of the FDNY Marine Units, responded to the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and took up a station at the foot of Albany Street in Battery Park City and began pumping at her maximum capacity to supply water to landside units fighting fires in the still-standing towers. Following the collapse of both buildings and resultant failure of the majority of the water mains serving lower Manhattan, Fire Fighter and the rest of the FDNY Marine Units became the sole source of water for firefighting efforts at Ground Zero, a duty which Fire Fighter maintained for a period of three weeks until sufficient repairs were completed on landside water mains to permit her release from what had become her longest emergency response call. Following a shipyard period in 2003 to rebuild her worn-out engines, the Fire Fighter resumed her post and continued to respond to marine emergencies, including a gasoline barge explosion in Port Mobil, Staten Island, in February 2003, and to the Crash of US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River in 2009. Replaced in frontline service by the fireboat Fire Fighter II, in 2010 at Marine Unit 9, Fire Fighter was placed into reserve status at the former Brooklyn Navy Yard where she remained in FDNY custody until October 15, 2012. Transferred on that date to the ownership of the non- profit Fireboat Fire Fighter Museum, Fire Fighter is now operated by an all- volunteer group dedicated to preserving the historic fireboat in running condition as a museum ship, befitting her over 70 years of service to the people and mariners of New York City and New York Harbor. As a museum ship Under the stewardship of the museum, Fire Fighter found a home in Greenport, New York on Long Island's North Fork and relocated to the village from the Brooklyn Navy Yard in February 2013. Eventually shifting to the village's commercial pier in accordance with their contractual agreement with the village, the museum has continued to grow in popularity and was granted 501(c)3 status by the IRS in October 2013 as a tax-exempt non-profit organization. The museum was awarded a National Park Service Maritime Heritage Grant in 2014 to pursue hull upkeep and preventative maintenance shipyard work. Gathering matching funds for the National Park Service grant lasted through December 2016, when Fire Fighter reported to Goodison Shipyard in Kingston, Rhode Island, for four months of shipyard work, overhaul and hull inspection. Completed in April 2017, Fire Fighter returned to Greenport, New York in her as-built, late 1930 FDNY color scheme, with a black hull, white topsides and buff smokestack, and with all topside brass returned to its bare metal appearance.

As an international he also played for the Irish Free State. In 1924 Kendrick was member of the Irish Free State team when it made its competitive debut at Olympic Games. In 1934 he was also a member of the first ever Free State team to play in a World Cup qualifier. His great nephew, Joe Kendrick Jr., also showed potential as a footballer and as youth was contracted to both Newcastle United and TSV 1860 Munich. Club career When Kendrick represented the Irish Free State at the 1924 Olympic Games he was playing as an amateur for Brooklyn F.C. of the League of Ireland. He then subsequently signed for Everton but failed to establish himself in their first team. He did, however, make one international appearance while an Everton player. He eventually returned to the League of Ireland and during the 1930s played for Dolphins, helping them win the League of Ireland title in 1935. Irish international Between 1924 and 1935 Kendrick made 6 appearances the Irish Free State. As a member of the squad that competed at the 1924 Olympic Games, he made his debut for the Free State against Bulgaria in their first ever senior international on 28 May. Other members of the team included Paddy Duncan, Tommy Muldoon and Dinny Hannon. Kendrick made his second appearance in the 2-1 defeat to Italy B on 23 May 1927. Together with Mick O'Brien, Harry Duggan and Tommy Muldoon, he became one of the first four English League based players to play for the Irish Free State. However Kendrick then had to wait nearly seven years before making his third appearance. On 25 February 1934 at Dalymount Park, together with Paddy Moore and Jimmy Kelly, he was a member of the Free State team that made its World Cup debut in a qualifier against Belgium. With the Free State trailing 4-3, in the 75th minute, a corner from Kelly was cleared only as far as Kendrick who then lobbed it towards Moore who then scored a dramatic equaliser. Two months later in another qualifier on 8 April 1934, Kendrick also played for the Free State in a 5-2 defeat against the Netherlands. He made his last international appearance, once again, against the Netherlands, in a 5-3 defeat on 8 December 1935.

Part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes, its summit is above sea level and contains a summit crater with two smaller craters nested within it. Beneath the summit, the volcano features a number of lava domes and lava flows, some of which originated in flank vents. While the occurrence of historical activity is unclear (aside from an episode in 2009–2010 where the edifice was uplifted by ), the volcano features vigorous fumarolic activity that creates a large plume of gas above the summit. Sulfur deposited by the fumaroles has been mined.  Context  Putana lies on the border between Chile and Bolivia, and is also known as Jorgencal, Jorjencal or Machuca. The area is remote and difficult to access and thus poorly studied. Volcanism in the Central Andes is the consequence of the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate and occurs in form of the long Central Volcanic Zone, one of four volcanic belts in the Andes. The Peruvian and the Pampean \\"flat slab\\" segments separate this volcanic belt from its neighbours, the Northern Volcanic Zone to the north and the Southern Volcanic Zone south respectively. Putana is part of the Central Volcanic Zone, which aside from this volcano contains a number of large calderas associated with silicic volcanism. Over 13 volcanoes in the Central Volcanic Zone have been active in historical time, out of about 69 with evidence of Holocene activity. Of these volcanoes Láscar is the most active volcano in the Central Volcanic Zone; a major eruption occurred there in 1993.  The volcano  Putana is a high volcano elongated from north to south. It is constructed by lavas and pyroclastic material, with effusive products such as lava domes and lava flows forming the bulk of the edifice. Most lava flows were viscous enough that they do not exceed of length, older flows are longer. Younger lava flows occur on the western slope, and some lava flows appear to be younger than the last glacial age. The summit contains a wide summit crater which itself contains two smaller craters, one is wide and lies on the northeastern side and the other with a width of is in the centre of the summit crater. Lava flows/lava domes are emplaced in the southern part of the main summit crater. Additional adventive vents occur on the slopes of Putana; a particularly noticeable fan- shaped flow northwest of Putana originated in such a flank vent. The volcano forms part of a complex of ash flows and cones which covers a surface area of . Putana was constructed on the Purificar and Tatio ignimbrites of Pliocene- Pleistocene age; the whole edifice is constructed around a pre-Holocene volcano. Volcanic rocks found at Putana include basaltic andesite, andesite and dacite. Minerals contained in the rocks include pyroxene in the andesites and biotite and hornblende in the dacites. Neighbouring mountains include the Cerros Aguita Blanca in the east, Cerro Amarillo in the southeast, Curiquinca south-southwest of Putana and Escalante and Cerro Colorado to the south- southwest. Curiquinca, El Apagado and Sairecabur together form a major volcanic group. The slopes of Putana drain north into the west-flowing Río Aguita Blanca, east into the Salar de Chalviri and southeast into the Río Blanco and from there into the Laguna Verde-Laguna Blanca system. The Río Putana originates on the northern flank of Putana, which forms its headwaters. It joins with the Río Jauna to form the Río Grande, which in turn joins the Río Salado to form the Río San Pedro de Atacama that eventually drains into the Salar de Atacama.  Eruptive history  The geologic history of Putana is unknown, due to the lack of detailed studies on the subject. The last eruption at Putana was reported from the late 19th century; one date given is 1810 with an uncertainty of 10 years and the eruption was described as a major one. Reports of an eruption on 2 July 1972 ± 182 days are uncertain, and other opinions say that there was no historical eruption there. Between late 2009 and early 2010, the volcano underwent an episode of deformation accompanied by earthquake swarms. Based on modelling, about of magma were intruded at a depth of during this episode, lifting the ground by about over a diameter of . Aside from this episode, Putana is seismically active, both in form of individual events, seismic swarms and triggered earthquakes; the 2010 Maule earthquake was accompanied by seismicity at Putana. View to the crater, with the in- crater and out-of-crater fumaroles visible  Fumaroles  Putana features active fumaroles, which generate a high plume above the volcano. This plume was seen as far back as the 19th century. The fumaroles have different shapes, from vents that are only centimetres wide to large wide openings. They occur in groups, in total four separate fumarole fields, two within the northeastern crater, one in the summit crater and one outside of the summit crater where about 30 individual fumaroles were reported in 1952. These fumaroles are visible as a thermal anomaly from space, but it is relatively weak with a temperature anomaly of only . These fumaroles exhale a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide, which is produced at a rate of . In addition they contain hydrogen, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride and nitrogen, while carbon monoxide, methane and oxygen are only minor components. Temperatures of have been measured, and the source appears to have temperatures of up to . The composition of the fumaroles indicates that the gases are ultimately of mainly magmatic origin, but interact with a slightly colder hydrothermal system before reaching the surface. The fumarolic activity at Putana lays down deposits of sulfur on the volcano, including one high cliff that was reported to be covered with sulfur in 1952. This sulfur was mined at the summit of the volcano, which is thus accessible by a road. Putana sulfur was noted to be extremely pure in that same year. It has been mined and transported down by truck from elevations of , one of the highest altitudes at which motor vehicles have been used. The Carnen sulfur mine is found on the southeastern flank, and more mines are found on neighbouring mountains. Operations in the Putana mine ceased in 1972.

Life and career Jean-Michel Frank was born in Paris, a son of Léon Frank, a banker, and his wife and cousin, the former Nanette Frank. He was a first cousin of Otto Frank and, therefore, a first cousin, once removed, of the diarist Anne Frank. From 1904, he attended the Lycée Janson de Sailly in Paris. He began law school in 1911, but in 1915, he was hit by the double blow of the deaths of his two elder brothers, Oscar and Georges, on the front lines of World War I and that of his father who committed suicide. In 1928, he lost his mother who had been in a Swiss asylum for several years. From 1920 to 1925 he traveled and visited the world. In Venice he met the cosmopolitan society that gathered around Stravinsky and Diaghilev. Around 1927, Eugenia Errázuriz revealed to him the beauty of 18th century styles and her own modern, minimalist esthetic, and he became her disciple. He then got in contact with a Parisian decorator called Adolphe Chanaux to do his apartment in the Rue de Verneuil. During the 1930s he worked with students at the Paris Atelier, now known as Parsons Paris School of Art and Design, where he developed the famous Parsons Table. In 1932, with Chanaux, he opened a shop at #140 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré. This was to be the consecration of ten years of collaboration, when he decorated for the Rockefellers and Guerlains. He designed Nelson Rockefeller's lavish Fifth Avenue apartment in New York in 1937. During the winter of 1939-40, he left France for Argentina. In Argentina, Jean-Michel Frank worked with his old friend and business associate Ignacio Pirovano on several important private and commercial projects.Hugo Beccacece: La Nación.

In 1941, Frank made a trip to New York City. Sadly overcome by depression he committed suicide by throwing himself from the window of a Manhattan apartment building, leaving all his personal possessions in his apartment in Buenos Aires. A unique collection of home furniture designed by Frank for Hermès in 1924 is considered a classic set of minimalist homeware. The iconic designs – including a sheepskin club chair and parchment-covered dressing table – hold an enduring popularity, and Hermès rereleased many of the items to great fanfare in early 2011.

Starring Jason Schwartzman and Natalie Portman as former lovers who reunite in a Paris hotel room, the 13-minute film acts as a prologue to Anderson's 2007 feature The Darjeeling Limited. It was shot on location in a Parisian hotel by a small crew and self-financed by Anderson, who initially intended it to be a stand-alone work. Its first showing was at the Venice Film Festival première of the feature film on September 2, 2007, and it made its own debut later that month at Apple Stores in four U.S. cities. The day after the film's première, it was made freely available from the iTunes Store for one month, during which time it was downloaded more than 500,000 times. The film garnered near universal critical acclaim from reviewers, who compared it favorably to The Darjeeling Limited and praised its richness, poignancy, and careful construction. Plot In a hotel lobby, the concierge answers a phone call from a guest's room. A man (Jason Schwartzman) lies on a hotel bed in a yellow bathrobe, watching the black-and-white American war film Stalag 17 and reading the newspaper. After ordering room service from the concierge in broken French, he receives a call from a woman whose voice he recognizes. She tells him she is on her way from the airport and asks for his room number. Despite objecting that he did not tell her she could come, the man consents nevertheless. He then hurriedly attempts to tidy the room – pausing to play the opening bars of the song \\"Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?\\" by Peter Sarstedt on his stereo system – and runs a bath. The man is again lying on the bed, now in a gray suit. Hearing a knock, he starts the song playing again before opening the door to a woman (Natalie Portman). After staring at him for several seconds, the woman breaks the silence by asking what music is playing. Receiving no response, she steps into the room and presents the man with a bouquet of flowers. When she moves to kiss him on the mouth, he turns his head away and they embrace instead. He closes the door and asks how she found him; she replies that it \\"wasn't actually that hard\\". She moves around the room browsing through his possessions, brushes her teeth with his toothbrush and declines to take the bath he had run for her. Stepping back into the bedroom, the woman turns to face the man and confronts him, asking slowly \\"what the fuck is going on?\\" He motions to her to join him on the bed and at her prompting, he reveals in the ensuing conversation that he has been living in the hotel room for \\"more than a month\\", and that he had left to escape their relationship. They lie back on the bed looking at one another before being interrupted by the arrival of room service. Once alone again, the two kiss and the man begins to undress the woman. They have an uncomfortable exchange about not having slept with other people and when he notices bruises on her arm after undressing her further, the woman chooses not to comment on them. Lying on top of him, she tells the man that she does not want to lose his friendship, that she loves him and never meant to hurt him. He responds coldly that he \\"will never be [her] friend\\", but holds her when she embraces him. \\"Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?\\" starts again and the man offers to show the woman his view of Paris. The woman is perched against an armoire, the man approaches and covers her naked body with the yellow bathrobe, and the two move towards the window. After they step out on the balcony, the man draws a toothpick from his pocket and hands it to her with an upwards nod, which she reciprocates. After looking out for another few seconds she clasps his neck lightly and they step back inside. Background and production The Hôtel Raphaël in Paris, which was used as the Hotel Chevalier of the film's title and where all of the scenes were shot Wes Anderson first approached Schwartzman and Portman about Hotel Chevalier in 2005. Schwartzman and Anderson had previously worked on Rushmore (1998), Anderson's cult second feature, and had been living together in Schwartzman's Paris apartment in the months leading up to the shoot. Portman was approached after the director obtained her email address from Scott Rudin, executive producer of 2004's Closer in which she starred. The actors appeared for free, and Anderson financed the remainder of the production himself. It was filmed at the Hôtel Raphael in Paris, on Avenue Kléber, two blocks south-southwest of the Arc de Triomphe. The Hôtel Raphael had previously been used as a setting for the films Love in Paris (1996) and Place Vendôme (1998). It was shot by a crew of 15 in Panavision and used props from Anderson's apartment. Filming took two and a half days, and editing (done on Anderson's computer) another week. Despite his use of a wardrobe from prestigious fashion designer Marc Jacobs and a handmade suitcase from Louis Vuitton, the director described the production as \\"like making a student film\\". Anderson initially intended it to be a stand-alone short film, but shortly before filming commenced, he realized that Schwartzman's character bore a close resemblance to one of the protagonists of a feature film he was writing at the time. That film would begin production a year later as The Darjeeling Limited. Chevalier takes place two weeks before Schwartzman's character (named Jack Whitman in the feature) joins his two older brothers on a journey in India in Darjeeling. The dialogue between the characters at the end of Chevalier is recounted by Schwartzman's character to his brothers at the close of the feature film, in the form of an excerpt from a short story he has composed. Portman's character has a brief cameo in the feature. Fox Searchlight Pictures, the studio that backed Darjeeling, was unaware of the short until the feature had been made and claimed to have no financial interest in it. Release Hotel Chevalier was screened as part of the program at the world première of The Darjeeling Limited at the 64th Venice International Film Festival on September 2, 2007. The short had its own première at Apple Stores in New York City, Chicago, San Francisco and Santa Monica, California, on September 25. Anderson, Schwartzman and Portman appeared at the New York screening in SoHo, after which they held a questions-and-answers session with the audience. The short was made available the following day as a free download from Apple's iTunes Store. On September 28, it preceded the showing of the feature on the opening night of the 2007 New York Film Festival. A press release posted before the première described the short as \\"the brief coda to a doomed romance and the prologue to The Darjeeling Limited\\". The film was withdrawn from iTunes after having been available for download for a month. It had been dismissed by USA Today columnist Susan Wloszczyna before its iTunes release as an amuse-bouche that was \\"destined to be a mere footnote\\",. It was downloaded nearly 500,000 times during its run, and received wide acclaim. Following its withdrawal from iTunes, the short was distributed in theaters as the prologue to the feature- length film. Although The New York Times reported in October 2007 that distributor Fox Searchlight Pictures intended to promote Chevalier as a competitor for the Best Live Action Short Film of the Academy Awards, it was not among that year's nominations. It was included as an extra feature on the Darjeeling 2008 DVD release, and Anderson's screenplay for the short was published in the Winter 2007 issue of the literary magazine Zoetrope: All- Story. Critical reception Hotel Chevalier was one of the year's most discussed short films, and attracted considerable praise from film critics, who compared it favorably to The Darjeeling Limited. Gary Susman of Entertainment Weekly described it as \\"an exquisite short story where we learn not much but exactly enough about these two characters\\", adding that \\"Chevalier sees Anderson working in his customary jewel-box/dollhouse mode, but the form and length really suit each other here.\\" Armond White of New York Press judged the short \\"moving and genuinely contemporary\\", citing its \\"lost- girl poignancy\\". The film drew some attention for Portman's brief, partial nude scene, and for her character's bruised body. Portman expressed disappointment at this undue focus, saying \\"[i]t really depressed me that half of every review ... was about the nudity\\". The episode made the actress reconsider the wisdom of this aspect of her performance, and she subsequently swore off nude appearances in film. While The Darjeeling Limited did receive generally positive reviews—having attained a 68% approval rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes—many of the champions of Hotel Chevalier tended to combine praise of Chevalier with subtle shots at Darjeeling. Portman's performance was praised by TIME reviewer Richard Corliss, who declared her to be \\"a comic actress in fresh bloom\\" in the \\"beguiling vignette\\", and expressed his wish that her role in Darjeeling had been greater. The feature, he felt, lacked \\"the feeling and wit of the short film\\". Stephanie Zacharek of Salon concurred, stating that \\"the untold story of Hotel Chevalier is 10 times more interesting, and infinitely richer, than the one told outright in \\", and calling the short \\"very close to perfect\\". The Guardian columnist Danny Leigh contrasted the lukewarm reception of the feature among bloggers and critics with the \\"genuine ardour\\" that greeted the \\"perfectly measured narrative\\" of Chevalier. He proposed that the constraints of the short-film format suited Anderson, whose trademark deadpan humor, idiosyncratic set designs and choice of soundtrack inclined to exhaust the viewers' patience in a feature-length work. A. O. Scott of The New York Times hailed Chevalier as \\"a small gem\\" in comparison to the \\"overstuffed suitcase\\" of the feature, and wrote that \\"It is worth seeking out, not only because it fleshes out part of the story of the Whitman brothers but also because, on its own, it is an almost perfect distillation of Mr. Anderson's vexing and intriguing talents, enigmatic, affecting and wry.\\" References Further reading * External links  Hotel Chevalier at Errata magazine * Hotel Chevalier at Short of the Week * Raphael Hotel Category:2007 films Category:American romantic drama films Category:American films Category:French films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Wes Anderson Category:Films set in hotels Category:Films shot in Paris Category:2007 short films Category:Films with screenplays by Wes Anderson Category:Films set in Paris ","title":"Hotel Chevalier"},{"id":"13069335","text":"Justine Priestley (born April 18, 1968) is a Canadian actress.

They formed in July 2006 and disbanded in 2011.  Biography  After the dissolution of the independent band Core the Child, vocalist Yuuki and drummer Shou started a new project called UnsraW. The band performed several \\"secret lives\\" with no releases, and were scouted by Speed Disk, a record label specializing in visual kei bands. After signing to Speed Disk, UnsraW released the singles \\"-9-\\" and \\"Gate of Death\\". Both singles were limited to a 1000-copy pressing, and sold out quickly. In late 2006, the band released its first EP, Spiral Circle in two types, which also sold out soon after release. Beginning in 2007, UnsraW began releasing material in Europe through import label CLJ Records, with their first full-length album Spiral Circle -Complete-, and concert DVD Screaming Birthday. The band went on to release another single leading to a pair of EPs in the summer of 2007 titled Abel and Kein (a reference to Cain and Abel). Abel was released in August, while Kein was released on September 26. The two EPs were released as a single album in Europe with a bonus track, and later in Japan with a differing bonus track. After a few shows initiating 2008, Yuuki became suddenly ill and unable to perform with the band. The rest of the members performed instrumental shows, not wanting to cancel any performances. In April, it was revealed Yuuki would be returning to music, but that he was still fighting a lung disease. In May UnsraW announced they would be pausing activities until Yuuki had recovered. In June 2009, UnsraW announced that Yuuki had made a full recovery, and they would perform two return lives scheduled in August to celebrate Yuuki's return. Unfortunately, due to a hand injury acquired in a motorcycle accident on 24 December 2008, bassist Jun decided to withdraw from the band. After restarting their activities in August, UnsraW announced the release of their first single after one-year hiatus. The single was released on 23 September and included three songs: Nightmare, Reborn, and Switch. On 13 January 2010 it was announced Rai would be leaving UnsraW on February 27, after their European tour. Upon Rai's departure, two new members were introduced: Madoka (円) and Jin (迅). It was also announced they'd be doing a one-man live show on 19 April 2010 called \\"Trace of Guilt\\" in Takadanobaba area. On 3 March 2011, Unsraw disbanded, following the departure of vocalist Yuuki. This information was released on their official website, but the band still performed their remaining scheduled shows. A year after their disbandment announcement, Yuuki made public on Unsraw's website his desire of doing a second final performance with the band due to his absence in 2011. The concert was scheduled on June 23.

The epicentre was located southwest of Colonia del Sacramento (Uruguay) and east of Buenos Aires (Argentina), with a hypocentre at a depth of .  Newspaper articles  On 5 June 1888, the Montevideo journal La Tribuna Popular reported the earthquake and its effects: The houses' woodwork creaked loudly, lamps swung, furniture moved and paintings fell off walls. Glassware objects broke and porcelain could be seen jolting out of cupboards. Astonished at the strong earthquake, inhabitants have had a sleepless night... Also, a Colonia del Sacramento local journal La Lucha reported on a particular event: The steamer 'Saturno' en route from the neighbouring country's capital (Buenos Aires) was calmly sailing in of water along the centre of the channel when she came to a sudden halt, as though she had run aground. The captain had soundings taken but the vessel, as if moved by some hidden force, was freed from the ground and continued on her way. Satellite view of the estuary of the Río de la Plata. North bank:Uruguay. South bank: Argentina  Consequences  Every settlement along the Río de la Plata's shore was affected, especially the cities of Buenos Aires and Montevideo. Only slight damage occurred since there were no high buildings or underground trains in those cities at the time. However, at no time since this earthquake have antiseismic building measures been taken in either of the two nations.  Background, precedents and provisions  The panic caused by this earthquake among the inhabitants of both banks of Río de la Plata was marked, because they were unfamiliar with seismic events, as are today's inhabitants. However, a previous event had been recorded: the 15 August 1848 earthquake which, just as that of 1888, caused no major damage and may have been seen as an isolated phenomenon or since its epicentre was faraway from the continent and thus distant from settlements, it may have been considered that future quakes would probably occur in those latitudes and cause no damage on the continent. It is worth mentioning, though, that there are no aseismic regions in the world. Such an event could therefore happen again in the River Plate as evidenced by 26 June 1988 and 10 January 1990 earthquakes, the latter being the only one registered on Uruguayan mainland territory. These earthquakes are believed to have originated in a particular region, the Punta del Este basin, which is highly faulted and where tectonic plates might experience certain movement thus causing the earthquake waves, according to Alberto Benavídez Sosa MGEOPHYS, agronomical engineer and former president of CERESIS (Seismology Regional Centre for South America) Earthquakes in the easternmost edge of the Pacific tectonic plates can occasionally be felt in the Argentine Atlantic coast, including Buenos Aires and only rarely on the Uruguayan coast.

Until its most recent destruction in 1979, it was, with a total length of , the second- longest covered bridge in the United States. The bridge was divided into two spans of roughly equal length, and rested on a central pier and shore abutments constructed from mortared rough stone. The eastern abutment has been shored up by the addition of a concrete footing. The bridge was wide, with a roadway width of . Because the state line is the western low-water mark of the Connecticut River, most of the bridge was in New Hampshire; only the western abutment is in Vermont. The site is now part of the Bedell Bridge State Park in Haverhill, New Hampshire.  History  There have been five bridges on this site. The first was built in 1805 and heavily damaged in 1823. Quickly rebuilt that year, it was washed away in 1841. A third bridge was carried away by a spring flood in 1862. The fourth bridge was destroyed in a storm on July 4, 1866, and replaced the same year. This fifth bridge was in service for 92 years, until it was closed to traffic in 1958. It was scheduled for demolition in 1973 due to heavy damage that year. A \\"Save the Bedell Bridge Committee\\" raised $250,000 to rebuild the bridge, which was completed by 1978, and included the establishment of the associated Bedell Bridge State Park in the area of the eastern abutment. The bridge was rededicated on July 22, 1979, only to be blown away again by a windstorm on September 14, 1979. The state park, as well as the abutments and a pier in the river, are all that remain. When first built, the bridge was in private ownership, and a toll was charged to cross it. In 1916, the towns of Newbury and Haverhill purchased the bridge and eliminated the toll.

The many pieces of the unique flag portray the various elements that made the city itself a success. The flag is one of the few non- quadrilateral flags in use. Creation of flag Although Tampa was named in 1849, it took almost 100 years for a flag to be created. Mayor D.B. McKay introduced the design to the city’s multi-national heritage. In turn he presented the banner to the board of Representatives and recommended that it be adopted as the official flag. On July 1, 1930 the board adopted the flag from its designer F. Grant Whitney. History and description “The colors are inspired by the national flags of the immigrants who settled the area: France, Great Britain, and the United States (red, white and blue); Italy (green, white, and red); and Spain (red and yellow).” The gold and red striped section is supposed to represent the flag of Spain who had a large part in both Tampa and Florida’s history with the Spanish exploration. In the flag the state recognized the British contribution to the city with the red, white chevron like stripes that are supposed to represent two of the three aspects that make up the British Union “portions of the Crosses of St. Andrew and St. George” The red, white, and blue along with the stars are a depiction of the country in which Tampa is located, the United States of America who bought the state in 1821 The red, white and blue on the left side of the flag is a representation of the French flag. The tip of the flag, which is red, green, and has a single white star, is a portrayal of the Italian flag. Both countries “had an influence on the culture and heritage” of the city of Tampa and creator Whitney wanted to incorporate the many immigrants who helped the city grow and thrive. “Fort Brooke was established and, in 1834, the Territorial Legislature created Hillsborough County, which is symbolized by a stylized \\"H\\"” The letter “H” is creatively disguised and made up of the representations of the flags of France and Spain with the blue line that forms the large “T” which is turned sideways. This “T” is much more visible to the eye and stands for the cities name: Tampa. “The City Seal of Tampa is featured over the white, gold and red stripes. The seal notes that the City of Tampa was organized in 1887. Tampa was incorporated as a village in 1849, as a town in 1855, and as a city in 1887.” With Tampa holding its annual Gasparilla pirate parade, many think the ship in the center of the flag is a reference to pirates, however the ship bearing the three masts with two sails a piece, is surprisingly supposed to be a rendition of the man who helped the more isolated city of Tampa flourish, Henry B. Plant. Incorporating Plant’s ship, the Mascotte, was important, as “The significant contributions to the development of Florida and Tampa Bay are why Success magazine dubbed Henry Plant “the King of Florida” in 1898.” Criticism The flag of Ybor City Since at least 2017, the city of Tampa flag has been criticized and ridiculed, even to the point of making the ranks of \\"the ugliest city flags on Earth,\\" for “trying too hard”. Another website thinks “This flag would make a great beach towel for tourists or a colorful cape for a Floridian superhero.” Most Tampa natives don’t even know they have a flag, and those who do are in favor of having it changed. “Out of the 224 people who had taken a survey on tampaflag.com of last week, 92 percent said they supported changing it.” \\" The dislike of the flag even has an online petition on change.org calling for a newly designed flag for the growing city of Tampa. Although most are in favor of changing the flag or completely redesigning it there is worry that people who have lived in the Tampa Bay area for generations could be upset to let it go. With all of the history and meaning the flag encapsulates, any new flag will need to be sure to capture both the history and essence of Tampa. One of the most historic and influential areas of Tampa, Ybor City, has its own flag (right) that is able to wrap the most important cultures that influenced the area and the industry that helped shape it all, the cigar.

He is of African-American ancestry, and achieved renown in the 1990s for his pioneering work in tracing the ancestry of African Americans via DNA testing. Biography Kittles was raised in Central Islip, New York. Although raised in New York, he has many family members in Georgia, one in particular is famous psychologist Levi Kittles from Sylvania Georgia. Rick holds a B.S. degree in biology from the Rochester Institute of Technology (1989), where he pledged Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, and a Ph.D. in biology from George Washington University in Washington, D.C. (1998). He is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. In 1990 he began his career as a teacher in several New York and Washington, D.C. area high schools. From approximately 1995 until 1999, as a researcher with the New York African Burial Ground Project (NYABGP), a federally funded project in New York City, in which Howard University researchers, led by anthropologist Michael Blakey, exhumed the remains of 408 African Americans from an 18th- century graveyard; Kittles gathered DNA samples from the remains and compared them with samples from a DNA database to determine from where in Africa the individuals buried in the graveyard had come. Beginning in 1998, as he was completing his Ph.D. at George Washington University, Kittles was hired as an assistant professor of microbiology at Howard University in Washington, D.C., and also named director of the African American Hereditary Prostate Cancer (AAHPC) Study Network at the university's National Human Genome Center. Kittles also co-directed the molecular genetics unit of Howard University's National Human Genome Center. He served in these positions until 2004. Beginning in 2004, he served as an associate professor in the Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology & Medical Genetics at the Tzagournis Medical Research Facility of Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. He is currently the leader of the Washington, D.C.-based African Ancestry Inc., a genetic testing service for determining individuals' African ancestry, which he co- founded with Gina Paige in February 2003. He also serves as an associate professor in the Department of Medicine and the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Illinois, Chicago. He was featured in the BBC Two films Motherland: A Genetic Journey and Motherland – Moving On (released in 2003 and 2004, respectively), as well as in part 4 of the 2006 PBS series African American Lives (hosted by Henry Louis Gates). On October 7, 2007, he was featured on the American TV newsmagazine 60 Minutes. In February 2008 he appeared in part 4 of African American Lives 2. He has published on genetic variation and prostate cancer genetics of African Americans. In addition, he discovered, through of a DNA analysis, he descends mainly of people of Dakar, Senegal, and Nigeria's Hausa people.  Scientific contributions  Rick Kittles was one of the earliest geneticists to trace the ancestry of Africans through DNA testing. This led, as mentioned in the biography section, him to co-found the company African Ancestry Inc., which set out to be the leading advocate for tracing the ancestry of individuals with African descent. Kittles is known for his work on prostate cancer but he devotes part of his time to study and research other diseases such as colon and breast cancer, sickle cell anemia, red blood cell immune response, and pulmonary hypertension. Kittles has been an advocate for studying prostate cancer among African Americans for much of his scientific career; his primary concern however, was to find out how genes and the environment increased the risk of prostate cancer. Kittles has performed a large amount of research, including publishing over 160 peer-reviewed articles, over his career with much of this work being devoted to issues such as genetic ancestry and health disparities among African Americans and other minority groups. Kittles has also been a part of many cutting edge developments including the progress of genetic markers and how an individuals ancestry can be used to help identify risk of disease and health outcomes. Nowadays, Kittles and his team have been busy conducting genetic sequencing trials to try and find variations in genes that affect a person's response to drugs.

A National Historic Landmark, it was the home of Roscoe Conkling (1829–1888), a powerful and controversial politician. He is responsible, perhaps, for the angry, political atmosphere that led to the assassination of U.S. President James Garfield. Early political career Roscoe Conkling's political career began as mayor of Utica in 1858, and rose through terms as U.S. Congressman 1859-1863 and 1865-1867. Finally he was U.S. Senator from New York 1868-1881. In 1870 he became boss of New York's Republican political machine. Conkling was mentor to Chester A. Arthur, and was instrumental in getting him appointed collector of the port of New York in 1871. In 1872 Conkling was offered the position of Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court by Grant, but he refused. A Party Divided When Rutherford B. Hayes became president in 1877, Conkling violently opposed him on the issue of civil service reform. In 1880, Conkling, as part of the \\"Stalwart\\" faction of the Republican Party, supported Grant's bid for a third term. The split in the Republican Party was so divisive that the 1880 Republican National Convention took 36 ballots to nominate James A. Garfield. The fact that Chester Arthur then accepted the nomination for vice-president infuriated Conkling. In May, 1881, Conkling and the other U.S. Senator from New York resigned from the Senate in protest of Garfield's political appointments. They expected to be immediately re-elected to the Senate by the New York State legislature, but this did not happen. Instead, they returned to New York to campaign for re- election. In the highly charged atmosphere while the New York legislature was deadlocked on this issue, crazed \\"Stalwart\\" supporter Charles J. Guiteau assassinated President Garfield. The resulting public outcry effectively ended Conkling's political career. Although Chester Arthur became president, he kept Conkling at a safe political distance. Arthur did offer him a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court in 1882, but again Conkling refused. The House The Roscoe Conkling House was designed by Philip Hooker in the Greek Revival style. It was begun between 1820-1824, and completed in 1830 by the Miller family. The house may also be known as the Miller-Conkling-Kernan House. Roscoe Conkling bought the house in 1863 and lived there until his death in 1888. The hip roofed brick house is covered with grey stucco scored to look like rock. The house was purchased from Conkling's family in 1894 by Nicholas Kernan. After this time, the two story East (left) wing was added, as well as the current porch, dormer and chimney tops. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1975. and The house and its park are part of the Rutger-Steuben Park Historic District. In 2005, the house was listed for sale.Utica NY 3 Rutger Park, within Preservation On-line listings It could be bought separately or together with another house at 1 Rutger Park that was designed by Andrew Jackson Davis.

Woodbridge entered service on April 20, 1775, the day immediately following the Battles of Lexington and Concord. He commanded a regiment of Minutemen, which was organized into Woodbridge's (25th) Regiment. During the Siege of Boston, Woodbridge's regiment was based at Cambridge near Boston, and participated in the Battle of Bunker Hill, the first large-scale battle of the war.Swett, S.: History of Bunker Hill Battle, With a Plan, Second Edition, Munroe and Francis, Boston (1826) pp. 5, 30.Frothingham, Jr., Richard: History of the Siege of Boston and of the Battles of Lexington, Concord, and Bunker Hill, Second Edition, published by Charles C. Little and James Brown, Boston (1851) Chapters V and VII, regarding the Bunker Hill Battle, pp. 136, 183. During the Siege of Boston and the Battle of Bunker Hill, Abijah Brown served as lieutenant colonel to Woodbridge, and William Stacy served as major. On June 17, 1775, immediately prior to the Battle of Bunker Hill, Woodbridge marched his regiment in good order from the mainland across the Charlestown Neck, an isthmus connecting the mainland with the Charlestown Peninsula and the battlefield. The regiment was under fire from British naval vessels as they crossed the neck to reinforce Col. William Prescott's regiment; British vessels were bombarding the battlefield and the Charlestown Neck prior to the assault of the British troops. General Israel Putnam, riding his horse from the battlefield to the neck, met Woodbridge's regiment and urged them to run to the battlefield. The rush to battle caused confusion and separation of Woodbridge's men as they arrived at the field of action. Parts of the regiment engaged and joined the battle. Woodbridge's regiment arrived at Bunker Hill immediately prior to the battle. A company from Woodbridge's regiment deployed on the right flank, and a portion of the regiment joined Colonel Prescott's regiment at the redoubt and breastwork on the hill.Ketchum, Richard M.: Decisive Day, the Battle for Bunker Hill, Henry Holt and Company, Owl Books Edition, New York (1999) p. 146. Woodbridge's regiment \\"was not commissioned, and there are few details of it, or of its officers, in the accounts of the battle.\\" Reports of the battle indicate that the American defenders on the right flank fought valiantly from behind what cover they could find.Ketchum, Richard M.: Decisive Day, the Battle for Bunker Hill, Henry Holt and Company, Owl Books Edition, New York (1999) p. 163. The men at the redoubt and breastwork fought until they had no more bullets, finally fighting with the butts of their guns, rocks, and their bare hands.Ketchum, Richard M.: Decisive Day, the Battle for Bunker Hill, Henry Holt and Company, Owl Books Edition, New York (1999) pp. 172–74. It is also reported that Woodbridge's regiment covered the retreat of the Continental Army across the Charleston Neck to the mainland after the hill was taken by the British. Lechmere's Point Woodbridge's regiment was actively involved throughout the Siege of Boston. On November 11, 1775, George Washington wrote to Congress of an incident during the siege, in which Col. Woodbridge and part of his regiment joined with Col. William Thompson's Pennsylvania regiment, defending against a British landing at Lechmere's Point, and \\"gallantly waded through the water, and soon obliged the enemy to embark under cover of a man-of-war…\\"Sparks, Jared: The Writings of George Washington, Vol III, Little, Brown, and Company, Boston (1855) p. 157. Pawlet Expedition Colonel Woodbridge served under General Benjamin Lincoln during the Pawlet Expedition of September 1777. A revolutionary force gathered at Pawlet, Vermont for a three-pronged attack of 500 men each against Fort Ticonderoga. Col. John Brown led a force against the outposts of Ticonderoga, Col. Samuel Johnson led a diversionary force against Mount Independence across Lake Champlain from Ticonderoga, and Col. Woodbridge led a covering force to Skenesborough (now known as Whitehall) at the south end of Lake Champlain. Col. Brown's attack successfully crippled the British position at Ticonderoga, preventing supplies or reinforcements from reaching General John Burgoyne, who surrendered the following month at Saratoga.Hoyt, Edward A.: Vermont History, Vol. 75, No. 2: The Pawlet Expedition, September 1777, Vermont Historical Society (2007).Allen, Paul: A History of the American Revolution, William Wooddy Jr. Printer, Baltimore (1822) p. 160.

Putana disguises as a young, beautiful woman and tries to kill the god by breast-feeding poisoned milk; however Krishna sucks her milk as well as her life via her breasts. Putana is also considered as a foster-mother of Krishna as she breast-fed him. By offering her milk, Putana had performed \\"the supreme act of maternal devotion\\",O'Flaherty p.250 in the shadow of her evil motives. The myth is told and retold in Hindu scriptures and some Indian books, which portray her variously as an evil hag or a demoness who surrendered herself to Krishna, though she initially came with evil motives. Putana is interpreted as an infantile disease or bird, symbolizing danger to an infant or desire respectively, and even as a symbolic bad mother. She is included in a group of malevolent Hindu mother goddesses called the Matrikas and also in the group of Yoginis and Grahinis (Seizers). Ancient Indian medical texts prescribe her worship to protect children from diseases. A group of multiple Putanas is mentioned in ancient Indian texts. Etymology The word \\"Pūtanā\\", broken as \\"Pūt\\" (virtue) and \\"nā\\" (no) means \\"devoid of virtue\\". Another explanation derives \\"Pūtanā\\" from \\"Pūta\\" (purifying), thus meaning \\"she who purifies\\". Herbert theorizes \\"Pūtanā\\" is derived from \\"Put\\", a hell in Hindu mythology, associated with parents and children.Herbert in Shashi p.844 Thus, Herbert proposes, on the basis of the etymology and her association with the Matrikas, that Putana is closely linked to motherhood.Herbert in Shashi p.846 White translates Putana as \\"stinky\\", and relates it to pustulant sores, the eruption of which is a symptom of chicken pox. Putana is also the name of the weapon of or a form of the goddess of small pox, Sitala.White p. 51 Legend Top panel: Krishna killing Putana. Bottom panel: The people of Vraj cutting Putana's body and burning her body. The legend of Putana and Krishna is narrated in many Hindu texts: the Bhagavata Purana, the Harivamsa (appendix of the Mahabharata), the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, the Vishnu Purana, the Garga Samhita and the Prem Sagar.Herbert in Shashi p.842 Putana, the \\"killer of infants\\", was sent by Krishna's evil uncle Kamsa to kill Krishna. Putana assumed the disguise of a young, beautiful woman and came to Gokul (Vraj) - Krishna's home-town. Her beauty resulted in her being mistaken by gopas (cowherds) as a manifestation of goddess Lakshmi. Stunned by her beauty, Krishna's foster-mother Yashoda allowed Putana to take the infant Krishna into her lap and breast-feed him. Putana had smeared her breast with a mandana, an intoxicant, to kill Krishna. However, Krishna squeezed her breasts and took her life away (prana), as well as her milk. In pain, Putana screamed, pleading for her release, but in vain. She ran out of the town with Krishna still clinging to her and finally fell dead. She then assumed her real demonic form, turning trees to a distance of three gavyuti (a unit of distance equivalent totally to 12 miles) to dust.Herbert in Shashi pp.842-4Olson pp.240-2 The people of Vraj cut Putana's body, burying her bones and feet and burning the flesh and skin. The fragrant smoke rose out of the flames, as Putana was cleansed of all sin by breast- feeding Krishna and she attained the same heaven that Yashoda acquired. Thus, Putana, like Yashoda, is also considered as a foster-mother of Krishna as she breast-fed him.Agrawal in Shashi p.822 In later versions of the myth, the intoxicant smearing on Putana's breast is replaced with poison or the milk itself is said to be poisoned. Another version of the tale portrays Putana as stealing Krishna at night, when everyone else is asleep. Dimmitt pp. 111-112 K. M. Munshi had a totally different take on the myth in his Krishnavatara series. Though Putana came with evil intentions, she is portrayed as being happy to see Krishna and her maternal instinct rises, telling her \\"Take this lovely boy to your breast. You are a wicked and miserable woman. You have never seen joy before, joy which thrills your whole body and mind with mad delight.\\" Overjoyed and forgetful of her poisoned breasts, she took Krishna in her lap and suckled him. In the process, she surrenders to Krishna saying \\"I give you all, my beloved child... I am yours.\\" Further, Putana is purified and liberated from her mortal body by Krishna.Kakar in Devy p.425 Previous birth The Garga Samhita (a work on the life of Krishna) and the Brahma Vaivarta Purana further tell of the previous birth of Putana as Ratnamala, the daughter of demon king Bali. When she saw Vamana, the previous avatar of Krishna as a dwarf, she felt a desire to have him as her son and suckle him. She soon changed her mind and decided to kill Vamana, after he overpowered her father and acquired his possessions. Krishna knew her desires and allowed her to fulfil both of them - to suckle him and to attempt to take his life.Herbert in Shashi p.845 Symbolism leftOne theory interprets Putana as being the first foe faced by Krishna (further numerous demons are sent by Kamsa to kill Krishna) or as the first obstacle of possessive maternal instinct faced by yogis. The legend assures a devotee liberation if they treat god as their own son.O'Flaherty p.280 Another theory interprets Putana as an infantile disease that Krishna survived, which can be cured by forcefully suckling the child affected. Further, the theory relates to Krishna's later life when he fights a demon called Jvara (fever). Gopal p. 96 In the Vishnu Purana, it is explicitly stated that Putana should work in the dark, symbolizing the lack of illumination of knowledge.Herbert in Shashi p.847 Her ear-rings are described not as radiant, but as quivering, signifying her unstable nature.Herbert in Shashi p.848 Agrawal equates Putana to Varuna, the Vedic god of darkness and chaos in the water. As Varuna pollutes life-giving water, Putana mixed her breast milk with poison. Thus, Putana stands for death and darkness.Agrawal in Shashi pp.822-3 O'Flaherty says: > The myth of Pūtanā is significant not merely for the image it presents ... > but for the intensity with which the image is depicted and the frequency > with which the myth itself is told in India.O'Flaherty p.54 Kakar further adds: > The secret fantasy of poisoned milk, of nourishment that kills, originates > early in life when the decisive separation between child and mother takes > place. The elevation of this fantasy,..., to the status of myth for a whole > culture indicates the intensity of (this) inner conflict... in the Indian > setting.Kakar p.147; O'Flaherty p.54 According to Kakar, Putana may represent a dangerous schizophrenic mother, who has trapped her child in an emotional net, of which he cannot let go. He interprets Krishna clinging to Putana's breast as not only the infant's excitement and anger, but also a form of \\"incestuous intercourse\\", as in the killing of other maternal demons.Kakar in Dey pp.424-5 By killing the \\"bad mother\\", the son kills \\"sexually ravenous maternal images in his psyche\\", leaving the protective images unhurt, and thus emerges as an adult, drawing boundaries between her and him.Kakar in Dey p.426 Textual descriptions Death of Putana, miniature c. 1725. Putana is defined as a yātudhānī at the beginning and the end of the Bhagavata Purana. Though the word yātudhānī is rarely used, yātudhāna - the masculine form - is frequently used in Hindu scriptures to mean an evil spirit. In the Rigveda, yātudhānas are to be killed, their bodies broken and their flesh eaten, just as Putana was treated.Herbert in Shashi pp.844-5 The Bhagavata Purana further tells of a gopi or milkmaid, narrating a hymn for protection from evil spirits including the Matrikas and Putana, even though Putana is dead. In another instance in the Purana, it is said that Putana and \\"her tribe\\" still had access to Krishna. Finally, the whole chapter is called \\"Deliverance of Putana\\", and not \\"Killing of Putana\\". Both incidences enforce the view that though Putana's mortal body is killed by Krishna, she lives on in the world as a spirit.Herbert in Shashi pp.846-7 and 849 In the Hindu epic Mahabharata, when mentioned with the Matrikas (Mothers) and the war-god Skanda, Putana is mentioned as a protectress rakshasi, a Grahini (female seizer), as well as a Matrika and Yogini.White p.48, 53 In the Harivamsa, an appendix to the epic, she is listed as a Grahini, with a prayer to protect the child at the end. In the Agni Purana, she is mentioned as a Grahini and also a Yogini. Group of Putanas The medical text Balatantra mentions Putana as the common name of 16 sisters of the demon king Ravana, who are permitted to eat the flesh of infants. The Buddhist text Saddharmapundarika Sutra and the 1131 CE encyclopedia Manasollasa by Western Chalukya king Someshvara III lists multiple demons, including a group of Putanas. The Brahmanda Purana and the Harita Samhita mention Putanas as a sub-group of Matrikas and Grahinis, whose individual names include Kali and Dakini.White p.53 In Ayurvedic medicine The Death of the Demoness Putana: Folio from a Bhagavata Purana Series. c. 1610 The Ayurvedic medical text Sushruta Samhita describes Putana as \\"black in colour, with a gaping mouth and projecting teeth and disheveled hair, clad in filthy garments, very smelly, and dwelling in empty broken-down buildings.\\" It further prescribes an offering of crow dung, fish, a rice dish, ground sesame and alcohol to Putana and recitation of hymns to Putana, urging her to protect the baby, along with other treatments. Kumaratantra (\\"Rituals related to childhood\\"), a branch of Ayurveda, specifically mentions that it aims to heal diseases that arise from \\"empoisoned milk of Seizers\\" (Grahini), Putana being one. As per Kumaratantra, all childhood diseases falling on the third day, the third month, or the third year of a child's life are attributed to Putana, regardless of the disease's symptoms.White p.62 Depiction as a bird Putana is portrayed as a bird in sculpture and myth. Kushan images of Putana as a bird are found in Mathura, Deogarh and Mandor. In a third-century version of Harivamsa, Putana is called the \\"nurse of Kamsa\\", who comes to a child as a female bird (shakuni), and is one of many birdlike female divinities mentioned in Harivamsa.White p.52 Putana's bird form symbolizes desire of materialistic objectives. In some texts, Putana is described as a Vaki, a female crane, thus a symbol of crookedness and hypocrisy.Agrawal in Shashi p.824 Notes References     * Category:Rakshasa Category:Hindu goddesses Category:People related to Krishna Category:Characters in the Mahabharata ","title":"Putana"},{"id":"13069668","text":"St. Paul's Cathedral is the cathedral of the Episcopal Diocese of Western New York and a landmark of downtown Buffalo, New York.

Unlike other \\"buckthorns\\", alder buckthorn does not have thorns. It is native to Europe, northernmost Africa, and western Asia, from Ireland and Great Britain north to the 68th parallel in Scandinavia, east to central Siberia and Xinjiang in western China, and south to northern Morocco, Turkey, and the Alborz in Iran and Caucasus Mountains; in the northwest of its range (Ireland, Scotland), it is rare and scattered. It is also introduced and naturalised in eastern North America.Rushforth, K. (1999). Trees of Britain and Europe. Collins .Flora Europaea: Frangula alnusDen virtuella floran: Frangula alnus (in Swedish, with detailed maps)Stace, Clive, et al. Interactive Flora of NW Europe: Frangula alnus  Description  Winter shoot with buds Alder buckthorn is a non-spiny deciduous shrub, growing to , occasionally to tall. It is usually multistemmed, but rarely forms a small tree with a trunk diameter of up to . The bark is dark blackish-brown, with bright lemon-yellow inner bark exposed if cut. The shoots are dark brown, the winter buds without bud scales, protected only by the densely hairy outer leaves. The leaves are arranged alternately on petioles. They are ovate, long by wide (rarely to by ). They have 6–10 pairs of prominently grooved and slightly downy veins and an entire margin. The flowers are small, in diameter, star-shaped with five greenish-white acute triangular petals, hermaphroditic, and insect-pollinated, flowering in May to June in clusters of two to ten in the leaf axils. The fruit is a small black berry in diameter, ripening from green through red in late summer to dark purple or black in early autumn, containing two or three pale brown seeds. The seeds are primarily dispersed by frugivorous birds, which readily eat the fruit.Blamey, M. & Grey-Wilson, C. (1989). Flora of Britain and Northern Europe. .  Taxonomy and naming  Flowering shoot Alder buckthorn was first formally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 as Rhamnus frangula. It was subsequently separated by Philip Miller in 1768 into the genus Frangula on the basis of its hermaphrodite flowers with a five-parted corolla (in Rhamnus the flowers are dioecious and four-parted); this restored the treatment of pre-Linnaean authors, notably Tournefort.Miller, P. (1754). The Gardener's Dictionary, 8th ed. Facsimile at Botanicus.org Although much disputed historically, the separation of Frangula from Rhamnus is now widely accepted, being supported by recent genetic dataBolmgren, K., & Oxelman, B. 2004. Generic limits in Rhamnus L. s.l. (Rhamnaceae) inferred from nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequence phylogenies. Taxon 53: 383–390. though a few authorities still retain the genus within Rhamnus (e.g. the Flora of China). The genus name Frangula, from Latin \\"to break\\", refers to the brittle wood. Both the common name alder buckthorn and specific epithet alnus refer to its association with alders (Alnus) on damp sites. Unlike other \\"buckthorns\\", alder buckthorn does not have thorns.Vedel, H., & Lange, J. (1960). Trees and Bushes in Wood and Hedgerow. Methuen & Co Ltd.Natural England: Alder buckthorn Other recorded names include glossy buckthorn and breaking buckthorn; historically, it was sometimes called \\"dogwood\\" through confusion of the leaves with those of dogwood Cornus sanguinea.  Ecology  Alder buckthorn grows in wet soils in open woods, scrub, hedgerows and bogs, thriving well in sunlight and moderate shade, but less vigorously in dense shade; it prefers acidic soils though will also grow on neutral soils. Frangula alnus is one of just two food plants (the other being Rhamnus cathartica) used by the common brimstone butterfly (Gonepteryx rhamni). The flowers are valuable for bees, and the fruit an important food source for birds, particularly thrushes.  Invasive species  Frangula alnus was probably introduced to North America about 200 years ago, and in Canada about 100 years ago. It was planted for hedgerows, forestry plantings, and wildlife habitat, but has become an invasive species, invading forests in the northeastern United States and wetlands and moist forest in the Midwestern United States. It is predicted to continue to expand its North American range with time. Its invasiveness is assisted by its high adaptability and pollution tolerance. It is one of three species of buckthorn that occurs without cultivation in eastern Canada.Catling, P.M., and Z.S. Porebski. 1994. The history of invasion and current status of glossy buckthorn, Rhamnus frangula, in Southern Ontario. Canadian Field-Naturalist 108:305–310 It invades forests and grows in the understory in spots with a lot of light. These areas, usually where a tree has fallen, normally allow locally native tree seedlings to grow and eventually fill in the gap in the canopy. But when Frangula alnus invades and grows in these locations, its dense canopy prevents light from reaching the ground and therefore prevents other seedlings from growing. It tends to grow more densely and with larger individuals in lower topographical areas with moist, fertile soils, and is very problematic for land managers. Uplands forests are not invaded as easily as lower lying ones. Hemlock-oak stands, which tend to be older stands of trees, are much less suitable for Frangula alnus because the density of the tree canopy creates a more shady environment that is not as suitable for Frangula alnus. Eastern white pine stands are easily invaded because they allow more light to reach the forest floor, and tree stands that are cut are very quickly invaded while undisturbed stands are rarely invaded.  Control  Small saplings can be hand-pulled, but control of larger examples is best achieved using herbicides. Frangula alnus and the related species Rhamnus cathartica have been banned from sale, transport, or import to Minnesota and Illinois. It is considered invasive, but not banned, in Connecticut.  Uses   Decorative  Frangula alnus 'Asplenifolia' with autumn colours Alder buckthorn has limited decorative qualities without conspicuous flowers or bold foliage, and is mainly grown for its conservation value, particularly to attract Brimstone butterflies. A variegated cultivar Frangula alnus 'Variegata' and a cultivar with very slender leaves 'Asplenifolia' are sometimes grown in gardens as ornamental shrubs. The cultivar 'Tallhedge' has been selected for hedging.  Medicinal  Galen, a Greek physician of the 2nd century A.D., knew of alder buckthorn, although he did not distinguish clearly in his writings between it and other closely related species. All of these plants though, were credited with the power to protect against witchcraft, demons, poisons, and headaches. The bark (and to a lesser extent the fruit) has been used as a laxative, due to its 3–7% anthraquinone content. Bark for medicinal use is dried and stored for a year before use, as fresh bark is violently purgative; even dried bark can be dangerous if taken in excess.  Charcoal  Alder buckthorn charcoal is prized in the manufacture of gunpowder, being regarded as the best wood for the purpose. It is particularly highly valued for time fuses because of its very even burn rate. The wood was formerly used for shoe lasts, nails, and veneer. The bark yields a yellow dye, and the unripe berries furnish a green dye.  References  External links *Frangula alnus - information, genetic conservation units and related resources.

The Advanced Attack Helicopter program followed cancellation of the Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne. After evaluating industry proposals, the AAH competition was reduced to offerings from Bell and Hughes. Following a flight test evaluation of prototypes, Hughes' YAH-64 was selected in December 1976. Background Probable axes of attack of the Warsaw Pact through the Fulda Gap and the North German Plains (according to the U.S. Army) During the mid-1960s, the United States Army initiated the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) program, which led to the development of the Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne for use in the anti-tank gunship role. The US Army pursued the AH-1G HueyCobra as an \\"interim type\\" for the \\"jungle fighting\\" role. However, the Army's broader concern was the task of protecting Western Europe from the legions of Warsaw Pact armor to the east.First Generation Cobras, Vectorsite.net, 1 December 2008. Critical Technology Events in the Development of the Apache Helicopter The main scenario used by NATO throughout the Cold War was that, if the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact forces were to conduct a massive tank offensive attack on Western Europe, they would probably cross either the Fulda Gap (capturing Frankfurt first and then aiming for the westward bend of the Rhine south of Wiesbaden: a total distance of just 85 miles), or cross the North German Plain (see map). The Advanced Attack Helicopter was conceived from the need to defend against such an attack. In 1971, political friction increased between the Army and the Air Force over the close air support (CAS) mission.Campbell, Douglas. The Warthog and the Close Air Support Debate, p. 84. Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 2003. . The Air Force asserted that the Cheyenne would infringe on the Air Force's CAS mission in support of the Army, which had been mandated with the Key West Agreement of 1948.Dahl, Arden B. The Warthog. The Best Deal the Air Force Never Wanted, p. 2. National War College. 2003. The Department of Defense (DOD) conducted a study which concluded that the Air Force's A-X program, the Navy's proposed Harrier, and the Cheyenne were significantly different and that they did not constitute a duplication of capabilities.OAVCSA 1973, p. 9. The Army convened a special task force under General Marks in January 1972, to reevaluate the requirements for an attack helicopter. The task force conducted flight evaluations of the AH-56, along with two industry alternatives for comparison; the Bell 309 KingCobra and Sikorsky S-67 Blackhawk. In 1972, the Army conducted a competitive fly-off of the helicopters from the spring 1972 until July 1972. The Army determined that the three helicopters could not fulfill its requirements.Center of Military History. \\"Chapter V: Force Development\\". Dept. of the Army Historical Summary, 1972.

The report recommended funding of the Air Force's A-X program, which would become the A-10 Thunderbolt II, and limited procurement of the Harrier for the Navy. The report never referred to the Cheyenne by name and only offered a lukewarm recommendation for the Army to continue to seek to procure attack helicopters, so long as their survivability could be improved.Bonin, John A., MAJ, USA. Towards the Third Dimension in Combined Arms: The Evolution of Armed Helicopters into Air Maneuver Units in Vietnam, p. 33. Fort Leavenworth, Kansas: US Army Command and General Staff College, 22 April 1986. The Cheyenne program was canceled by the Army on 9 August 1972.Landis and Jenkins 2000, pp. 79–82. The helicopter's large size and inadequate night/all-weather capability were reasons stated by the Army for the cancellation. Requirements, proposals, and prototypes A YAH-63A prototype An early Hughes YAH-64A prototype with T-tail Following the cancellation of the AH-56 Cheyenne the US Army sought an aircraft to fill an anti-armor attack role. The Army wanted an aircraft better than the AH-1 Cobra in firepower, performance and range. It would have the maneuverability to fly nap-of-the-earth (NoE) missions.Bishop, Chris. Apache AH-64 Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) 1976–2005. Osprey Publishing, 2005. . On 17 August 1972, the Army initiated the Advanced Attack Helicopter (AAH) program.OAVCSA 1973, p. 10. AAH sought an attack helicopter based on combat experience in Vietnam, with a lower top speed of 145 knots (269 km/h) and twin engines for improved survivability.Landis and Jenkins 2000, pp. 81–82. To this end, the US Army issued a Request For Proposals (RFP) for an Advanced Attack Helicopter (AAH) on 15 November 1972. The AAH requirements for reliability, survivability and life cycle costs were very similar to the UTTAS requirements.Advanced Attack Helicopter (AAH) (1970–1981) – Global Security The Army specified that the AAH was to be powered by twin General Electric T700 turboshaft engines that produce 1,500 shp (1,120 kW) each. The T700 was the same powerplant fit specified for a new Army utility helicopter competition that would be won by the UH-60 Black Hawk. The AAH would be armed with a 30 millimeter cannon and 16 TOW anti-tank missiles. The missile armament specification was later modified to include an alternate load of 16 laser-guided AGM-114 Hellfire anti-tank missiles. The Hellfire was then in development and promised greater range and lethality than TOW.Model 309 KingCobra / Model 409 AAH (YAH-63), Vectorsite.net, 1 December 2008. Proposals were submitted by five manufacturers: Bell, Boeing-Vertol (teamed with Grumman), Hughes Aircraft, Lockheed, and Sikorsky. In June 1973, Bell and Hughes Aircraft's Toolco Aircraft Division (later Hughes Helicopters) were selected as finalists, and were each awarded contracts for the construction of two prototype aircraft. This began the phase 1 of the competition. Each company built two prototype helicopters for a flight test program. Bell's Model 409/YAH-63A prototype featured a three-wheel landing gear in a tricycle arrangement, and placed the pilot in the cockpit front instead of the usual rear seat, to help with nap of earth flying.Bishop, Chris. Huey Cobra Gunships. Osprey Publishing, 2006. . Hughes' Model 77/YAH-64A prototype featured a three-wheel landing gear with the third gear at its tail. Its cockpit placed the pilot in the rear seat. Faced with a flight deadline of the end of September,\\"AAH under attack\\". Flight International, 16 October 1975. Hughes' YAH-64 first flew on 30 September 1975, while Bell's YAH-63 first flew on 1 October. The second YAH-64's first flight was on 22 November, and second YAH-63 flew on 21 December 1975. The first YAH-63 crashed in June 1976, but a static test prototype was brought up to flight standard and, along with the second prototype, entered the flyoff against Hughes' YAH-64s. The Army put all four helicopters through a demanding program of flight testing during 1976. The Army flyoff began in June of that year.\\"Attack helicopter contenders\\". Flight International, 22 May 1976.\\"The soldier's helicopter\\". Flight International, 12 June 1976. A separate competition was conducted for the sensor and targeting suite for the AAH, with Martin Marietta and Northrop submitting proposals in November 1976. During the prototype evaluation, the Army changed the AAH primary antitank weapon from the proven TOW wire-guided missile to the new Hellfire laser-guided missile, with over twice the effective range. This was risky because Hellfire had not even been flown at the time, with the initial development contract with Rockwell International signed in October 1976.Boeing AH-64 Apache, Vectorsite.net, 1 July 2007. Selection and afterward A YAH-64A After evaluating test results, the Army selected Hughes' YAH-64A over Bell's YAH-63A on 10 December 1976. Both designs were regarded as good, but the Hughes design seemed to have an edge in survivability. Reasons for selecting the YAH-64A included its more damage- tolerant four-blade main rotor and reduced stability of the YAH-63's tricycle landing gear arrangement.Donald, David. Modern Battlefield Warplanes. AIRtime Publishing Inc, 2004. . The AH-64A then entered phase 2 of the AAH program. This called for building three preproduction AH-64s, and upgrading the two YAH-64A flight prototypes and the ground test unit up to the same standard. Weapons and sensor systems were integrated and tested during this time, including the new Hellfire missile. The Phase 2 program suffered through a number of delays for various reasons and stretched out to over five years. The first Phase 2 flight, of an upgraded initial prototype, was on 28 November 1977, with the first flight of a newbuild preproduction prototype on 31 October 1979. Initial Hellfire launches had already taken place by then, with first firings in April 1979. A competitive evaluation of preproduction helicopters, one fitted with the Martin Marietta sensor / targeting suite and the other fitted with the Northrop suite, was performed, with Martin Marietta winning the competition in April 1980. An initial production order for 11 \\"AH-64A Apache\\" attack helicopters was issued on 26 March 1982.

His acting career spanned 40 years. Lopez was born in New York City of Puerto Rican descent. Lopez began his acting career in theater, based in New York. He was signed to a contract at Warner Bros. Studios in 1954, his first appearance being Bogus Charlie in Drum Beat. Lopez appeared as Spanish Joe in Battle Cry (1955), as Rodrigues in Mister Roberts in 1955, then had the leading role in The Steel Jungle (1956) and appeared as Toro in Cry Tough in 1959. He also played in a number of B-movies and Westerns early on in his career, including the Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), The Young Guns (1956) and The Lone Ranger. Although he was part of the supporting cast in Mister Roberts, his role was prominent – he played opposite Henry Fonda and James Cagney, who were both established stars at the time. However, he was perhaps best known as Lieutenant Lou Escobar in the 1974 film Chinatown, which he starred in opposite Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. He reprised the role sixteen years later (with Escobar promoted to Captain) in The Two Jakes in 1990. Also right before this time he starred opposite Charles Bronson playing drug gang leader Ed Zacharias in 1987's Death Wish 4: The Crackdown. Among his many television appearances, one of his more well-known roles is that of Esteban Rodriguez in the Star Trek episode \\"Shore Leave\\". Lopez also appeared in an episode of Bonanza, as the cold-blooded outlaw Duke Miller, who kills a man over being first in line to get a haircut. He was Joaquín Castañeda, a mestizo that fought to free his people, on Zorro, starring Guy Williams. Lopez also appeared in episode 14, \\"Night Of The Long Knives\\" originally airing December 16, 1966 of The Time Tunnel television series; the Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea episode \\"Savage Jungle\\"; McLintock! (1963) as Davey Elk; the Juan Moreno's Body Timeless Video Group DVD collection - \\"Checkmate\\" as a migrant Mexican fruit picker accused of murdering the son of the owner of the orchard; and Kelly's Heroes (1970) as Pvt. Petuko. Lopez died of lung cancer at The Rehabilitation Centre of Beverly Hills in Beverly Grove, Los Angeles, at age 78. He was survived by several nieces and nephews. His ashes were interred at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

He studied medicine at the University of Leipzig and the University of Jena, and received his doctorate in 1665. In 1668 he was promoted to the anatomical chair at Leipzig, and in 1690 succeeded Gottfried Welsch (1618–1690) as Stadtphysikus for the city of Leipzig. In 1691 he was appointed city-physician, and in 1691 professor of therapeutics.The General biographical dictionary. He later held the office of rector at the University of Leipzig (1693–94). Bohn was known for his pioneer work as a medical-legal officer in forensic medicine. He introduced the policy of thorough autopsies of the deceased, and specialized in the investigation of lethal wounds. He also did early research concerning the physiology of the circulatory system. Many of Bohn's scientific writings were burned prior to his death, as stipulated in his will.

Wilshire (February 8, 1932 – January 1, 2013) was an American philosopher who taught in the philosophy department at Rutgers University, from which he retired as Professor Emeritus in 2009. Beginning as a specialist in William James, he became known for his work on philosophy and theater, his criticisms of analytic philosophy, and his interest in Native American philosophy. Biography Wilshire's father, Gilbert Wilshire, piqued his interest in science and astronomy at an early age, so that he began reflecting on the \\"big questions\\" (creation, the nature of the universe, and related issues). His mother June was very religious and devout. As a teenager in high school he met E. J. Carnell, the philosophical theologian who was president of Fuller Theological Seminary. The young student was deeply impressed by the man, his thoughts, and found him to be inspirational. He started his college career as a freshman at Pasadena City College, where he was a navigator. In his junior year he moved on to Wheaton College. Among works influential on his early formation were Living Issues in Philosophy by Harold Titus, Lord Jim by Joseph Conrad, and World Hypotheses by Stephen Pepper, which was a source for key metaphors that guided much of his later thinking. Wilshire received his BA from the University of Southern California (USC) and his MA and PhD from New York University (NYU). While attending USC, he drove a taxicab to make ends meet, experiencing encounters with people he felt gave him insight into the human condition. Early in his graduate school career, he was drafted to serve in the Korean War. Shortly after being drafted he fell ill with pneumonia and then scarlet fever, which led to his being stationed around the United States: first at Fort Ord in Monterey, California, then at Fort Jackson in Columbia, South Carolina, and finally in Atlanta, Georgia, where he gave crude psychology tests to draftees. While in Atlanta, Wilshire read Sydney Hook's dissertation The Metaphysics of Pragmatism. He also enjoyed acting in local theater productions (his was a dramatic physical presence at 6' 4\\" tall). Some of his influential friends of the time were Harold Citron and Frank Wittow, founder of an Atlanta theater. His interest in acting and theater eventually led to the publication of one of his most widely influential books in 1982: Role-Playing and Identity: The Limits of Theatre as Metaphor, a meditation on the nature of performance. After being honorably discharged, he traveled to New York City to join the American Theatre Wing to study theater, funded by the GI Bill, which paid $110 a month. During that time he took a course in social philosophy at NYU with the Marxist Sydney Hook. The 50-page paper he wrote for the course, “The Problem of Work,” was a defining event that convinced Wilshire he would be a philosopher. Another mentor at NYU was William Barrett, who was well known for debating prominent scientists of the time. While a graduate student he taught in the NYC public schools and took education classes. He completed his master's degree within two years, writing his thesis on “Kierkegaard’s Theory of Truth,” then proceeded to complete his PhD with a 1966 dissertation: “William James and Phenomenology: Philosophical Issues in William James’ Principles of Psychology.” In 1967 he moved to the south campus of Purdue University as a tenure-track assistant professor of philosophy. By 1969 he moved to Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, with a tenured position, where he remained the rest of his professional career. His first book, William James and Phenomenology (1968), brought together continental thought and William James’s genius for lively description. Wilshire went on to become an eminent James scholar, editing William James: The Essential Writings (1971). He also explored the hitherto unsuspected link between American philosophy and Native American thought, arguing in The Primal Roots of American Philosophy for deep affinities between Ralph Waldo Emerson, William James, and Charles Sanders Peirce with Black Elk. A philosophical pluralist, Wilshire became the leader of the American Philosophical Association’s Committee on Pluralism in the 1970s and 1980s. The Rutgers philosophy department turned in an increasingly analytic direction over the years he taught there. Ironically, he wrote one of the most trenchant critiques of analytical philosophy, Fashionable Nihilism (2002), while teaching in a department that was rated the number one analytic department in the United States by the end of his career. Every August for many years he hiked in the high Sierra Nevada mountains. Wilshire authored seven books, among them Wild Hunger (1999), a theory of the roots of addictive behavior as traceable to the lack of experiencing open landscape in modern times, and Get ‘Em All, Kill ‘Em! (2004), an exploration of the nature of genocide that was a grief response to the accidental death of his adult daughter Rebekah after she was thrown from a horse. In 2001 he was awarded the Herbert Schneider Award from the Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy. Upon retirement in 2009, he and his wife, Donna Esther Welch Wilshire, moved to Columbia, Missouri. During these final years he underwent the death of his wife and suffered a massive stroke a couple years before passing away on New Year's Day, 2013. He composed his final work in this period, The Much-at-Once: Music, Science, Ecstasy, the Body (New York: Fordham University Press, February 2016; ), which seeks to rediscover the fullness of life in the world by way of a more complete activation of the body's potentials; it is being published posthumously. Select publications *Romanticism and Evolution: The Nineteenth Century (New York: Capricorn Books, 1968), volume 6 in The Spirit of Western Civilization, \\"a series of independent but related volumes on the dominant ideas of the great ages of Western Civilization.\\" Wilshire wrote a 20-page introduction and brief commentaries on selections from Rousseau, Kant, Schiller, Blake, Wordsworth, Goethe, Coleridge, Emerson, Hegel, Marx, Mill, Darwin, Spencer, James, Baudelaire, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, and others. *William James and Phenomenology: A Study of \\"The Principles of Psychology\\" (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1968; ). *Role Playing and Identity: The Limits of Theatre as Metaphor (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1982; , ). Wilshire places theater at the center of his study of human phenomenology. *Wild Hunger: The Primal Roots of Modern Addiction (New York: Rowman & Littlefield, 1999; ) is an earnest examination of the roots of the addictive behaviors plaguing contemporary societies, which makes an impassioned plea for rediscovering our primal need for ecstatic involvement with the world and other human beings. *Fashionable Nihilism: A Critique of Analytic Philosophy (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2002; ) is a collection of nine related essays. Wilshire criticizes the impersonal nature of analytic philosophy, and how it is overwhelmingly accepted by contemporary academia. The book has been criticized for neglecting to clearly define the analytic methods it criticizes,Review by David Hoekema and for misrepresenting various authors and groups.Brian Leiter, Replies to Hoekema and Wilshire *Get 'Em All! Kill 'Em!: Genocide, Terrorism, Righteous Communities (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2004; ) advances a comprehensive theory of genocide and terrorism, attempting to explain their motivations and receptions psychologically. In the book Wilshire analyzes five historical cases of genocide: \\"Nazis' in Europe, Serbs' in Bosnia, Pol Pot's group's in Cambodia, Hutus' in Rwanda, [and] whites' in California.\\"Wilshire, Bruce. Get 'Em All! Kill 'Em!: Genocide, Terrorism, Righteous Communities, p XV. *The Much-at- Once: Music, Science, Ecstasy, the Body (New York: Fordham University Press, February 2016; ). Appealing to our powers of hearing and feeling, with a special emphasis on music, Wilshire engages composers, writers, and thinkers ranging from Beethoven and Mahler to Emerson and William James.

He was particularly known for his lacquered screens and other art objects.Félix Marcilhac, Jean Dunand: His Life and Work, Thames and Hudson, London, 1991Cabanne (1986) pp. 191-192  Biography  Jules-John Dunand was born in Lancy, Switzerland, on 20 May 1877. He later adopted the French first name of Jean, and became a naturalized French citizen in 1922. At the age of fourteen, he began studying sculpture at the Geneva School of Industrial Arts, where he won several prizes and received his diploma. In 1897 he moved to Paris and begn to work as a sculptor and a copper craftsman. He participated in the 1904 Salon of the National Society of Fine Arts, and in 1905 he was selected a member, after completing an interior for the Countess de Bearn. He worked with a very wide range of materials, including steel, copper, pewter and silver, which he worked with hammer and glided, and encrusted with gold or mother-of-pearl, and then often decorated with enamels and patinas. His works included vases, plates, boxes, and jewelry.Cabanne (1986) pp. 191-192 In about 1912, he began working with Seizo Sugawara, a Japanese lacquer painter who had emigrated to France, and began to use that ancient and almost forgotten technique in his own work, making large decorative panels and screens. He also sometimes decorated pieces of furniture by other designers, including Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann and Pierre Legrain. His themes were greatly varied, from floral and animal designs, to a kind of neo- cubism, to oriental designs.Cabanne (1986) p. 192 For the 1925 Paris Exposition of Decorative Arts, he worked on one of best-known exhibits, a proposal for the interior of an Art Deco French Embassy, creating a smoking room entirely decorated in lacquered panels. He also contributed to Ruhlmann's House of a Collector. He contributed to the interiors of many apartments, and of ocean liners; he decorated the smoking room of the ocean liner .Cabanne (1986) p. 192 His works can be found in museums in Amsterdam, Denver, Detroit, Geneva, Lausanne, Le Havre, London, Miami, Minneapolis, New York, Paris, Pittsburg, Quimper, Reims, Richmond, San Francisco, Tokyo and Zurich.

In 1896, Queen Victoria sanctioned the issue by the British South Africa Company of a medal to troops who had been engaged in the First Matabele War. In 1897, the award was extended to those engaged in the two campaigns of the Second Matabele War, namely Rhodesia (1896) and Mashonaland (1897). The three medals are the same except for name of the campaign for which the medal was issued, inscribed on the reverse. In 1927, the government of Southern Rhodesia re-issued the medal and instituted a new clasp, to commemorate the Pioneer Column that operated within Mashonaland in 1890. Those previously awarded the medal were required to exchange it for the new version. The majority of awards were to colonial and locally raised troops, rather than members of the regular British Army. Description The medal is circular, made of silver and in diameter. It was manufactured by Heaton and Company of Birmingham. The obverse depicts a left facing effigy of Queen Victoria wearing a diadem and veil. Around the edge is the inscription Victoria Regina. The reverse, designed by Richard Caton Woodville Jr, depicts a charging lion, wounded in the chest with an assegai. In the foreground are native weapons and a shield, in the background is a mimosa bush, and below the scene the inscription: BRITISH SOUTH AFRICA COMPANY. The recipient's first eligible campaign is inscribed at the top on all versions of the medal except the 1927 issue. The medal is mounted on an ornate swivelling suspension bar decorated with shamrocks, thistles and roses. The medal hangs from a wide ribbon of watered silk in golden yellow with three dark blue stripes. They were named to the recipient using a number of different engraved and impressed styles, depending on when the medal was issued. Clasps The recipient's first eligible campaign is inscribed on the reverse, either MATABELELAND 1893, RHODESIA 1896 or MASHONALAND 1897, with any subsequent campaign indicated by an appropriate clasp. The one exception is the medal for Mashonaland 1890, issued in 1927, where the reverse bears no details of the campaign, with all eligible campaigns represented by a clasp. The four clasps issued were: # Matabeleland 1893 (Only awarded with the 1927 medal. Originally recipients received the medal without clasp, with the campaign inscribed on the reverse) # Rhodesia 1896 # Mashonaland 1897 # Mashonaland 1890 (Awarded in 1927) Four men were entitled to the medal with all four bars, although only one was issued.

He attended Oregon State University in the 1930s, where he was a starting linebacker and fullback on the Oregon State Beavers football team, though he would ultimately graduate with a business degree from the University of Oregon due to OSU cutting his program of study. He would later go on to a successful career in the homebuilding industry, starting his first building business in the late 1940s. His businesses were based in the East Bay city of San Leandro, California where he lived. He and his wife Gladys, son Michael W. Valley and daughter Tamara A. Valley later moved to Piedmont, California in the late 1960s. Valley was one of the original owners (along with Chet Soda, Donald Blessing and five other investors) of the Oakland Raiders football team, and a founding member of the American Football League. He took control of the franchise in 1960 and served as the managing general partner of the team with Ed McGah until forced out of this role by Al Davis in 1972. Valley subsequently sold his stake in 1976. Along with his wife, Gladys L. Valley, they left the majority of their net worth to the Wayne and Gladys Valley Foundation, based in Oakland, California. Valley died in 1986 and his wife continued operating the Foundation until her death in 1998. Gladys is survived by her two children Michael W. and Tamara A.Valley.

History Interior The building was built as Church of the Holy Trinity, and opened in 1847. Following years of controversy, the parish was closed in 1957, and the building stood mostly empty for the next 12 years. The present name of the parish reflects the fact that St. Ann's, the oldest Episcopal parish in Brooklyn, moved into the then empty Holy Trinity building in 1969. The church possesses some of the earliest figural stained-glass windows made in the United States, crafted by William Jay Bolton. The church was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987. The designer for Holy Trinity was prominent 19th century American architect Minard Lafever, with stained glass by William Jay Bolton and John Bolton. In 1859 English architect Gervase Wheeler was hired to enlarge and make improvements in the chancel such as modifications to the reading desk and adding pews; Wheeler was directed to follow the original plan in his work.Tribert, Elizabeth Rose. \\"Gervase Wheeler: Mid-Nineteenth Century British Architect in America\\" (thesis) Graduate Program of Historic Preservation, University of Pennsylvania, 1988; pg 114 A rectory was constructed immediately west of the church between 1895 and 1897. The ground floor of this building now serves as the parish hall. Following the departure of the St. Ann Center for Restoration and the Arts in 1999, the church complex continued to lease school, office, programming, rehearsal and concert space to a wide range of community service and arts groups. However, in 2013, full-time tenants were moved out of the Parish House. St. Ann's Church (1787) St. Ann's Church (organized 1787) was originally named in honor of Ann Ayscough Sands (1761–1851), who was an early patron with her husband Joshua Sands. The church previously occupied the elaborate High Victorian Gothic building still standing on the northeast corner of Clinton and Livingston streets, built 1877-1878 to designs by James Renwick Jr. of Renwick & Sands. That church, which featured stained glass by Henry E. Sharp, was sold to the Packer Collegiate Institute.Stern, Robert A.M., Mellins, Thomas and Fishman, David. New York 1880: Architecture and Urbanism in the Gilded Age. (New York: The Monacelli Press, 1999), p.875-876. Bolton stained glass windows The windows of St. Ann & the Holy Trinity Church were created by William Jay Bolton with the assistance of his brother, John Bolton, between 1845 and 1848. Though preceded by a figural window Bolton made for Christ Church Priory in Pelham, NY, these windows are the first complete canon, or set, of figural stained glass windows made in North America. The Bolton windows consist of six distinct sets totaling 55 glass installations, of which 54 remain. When the church reopened in 1969, the problem of repairing the large building after a long period of deferred maintenance initiated many conservation projects and campaigns for the complicated and costly task of restoring the church and its endangered stained glass windows. The World Monuments Fund in collaboration with the St. Ann's Center for Restoration and the Arts initiated projects in 1988 and continued repairs led to the site's listing in the World Monuments Watch in 2002 and 2004. One of the stained glass windows, a 19' high and 10' wide window (5.8 x 3 meters) from the church's organ loft are on display in the American wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The window depicts a musical scene of Miriam and Jubal standing beneath an arrangement of musical instruments articulated in bright purple and gold painted glass Peabody Memorial Organ The Peabody Memorial Organ was built by Ernest M. Skinner in 1925. It is the third instrument to be installed since the church opened in 1847. The organ was designed by and built by Ernest Skinner as his Opus #524, the gift to the church from parishioner and financier George Foster Peabody in memory of his brother. The organ comprises 4,718 pipes, ranging from 2 inches to 32 feet in length, as well as 20 chimes and a 61-note celesta. In 1999, it was recognized by the Organ Historical Society as \\"An Historic Instrument of Special Merit\\" — the musical equivalent of Landmark status. It is the largest E.M. Skinner organ in New York City. Virgil Fox and Louis Vierne, organist at the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris were among the world-famous organists that played the organ in Brooklyn. Gregory Eaton, prior Dean of the Brooklyn Chapter of the American Guild of Organists was the director of music and organist from 1993 to 2014. Restoration projects In 1979 the New York Landmarks Conservancy, a private, not-for-profit organization started a preservation program for the church called the St. Ann Center for Restoration And Arts. Through the program's efforts the chancel was renovated, 64 stained glass windows restored and the exterior fence repaired. The church received a Sacred Sites Grant of $10,000 for brownstone façade and roof restoration of parish house wing in 2014. A site visit confirmed that brownstone façade is deteriorated, shedding large sections of projecting trim. Roofs are actively leaking and temporarily patched and tarped and wood windows are severely deteriorated. The large parish hall wing and formerly fully leased community spaces suffer from active leaks, plaster failure and weather infiltration as a result of the ongoing deterioration of the exterior envelope. The estimated cost of the restoration of the exterior and interior structures of the building is $6 million. Since 2012, The Forum at St. Ann's Arts & Culture Series organizes fundraising events with exhibitions, film screenings, poetry and book readings, panel discussions and concerts for the ongoing restorations.

She was elected to the House of Representatives for the first time in the 2005 general election and served as Deputy Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry. She was one of 83 so-called \\"Koizumi Children,\\" LDP candidates elected for the first time amid the widespread popularity of reformist prime minister Junichiro Koizumi; Koizumi touted Katayama as a \\"madonna of reform.\\" Katayama and 72 other \\"Koizumi Children\\" were defeated in the 2009 general election, in which the Democratic Party of Japan routed the LDP. Following the 2009 election, Katayama commented that \\"the past four years have been a fight against the symbols of Koizumi's reforms, and we have proved they were wrong.\\" She later characterized herself as a \\"war-displaced orphan\\" in 2011. She married political science professor Yōichi Masuzoe in 1986 while working at the Ministry of Finance. They separated after several months, divorced in 1989 and are both remarried. Masuzoe later became a prominent media personality and member of the House of Councillors, and both Masuzoe and Katayama were considered by the LDP as candidates for the 2014 gubernatorial election in Tokyo. Prime Minister of Japan Shinzō Abe, who led the LDP to endorse Masuzoe in his successful election, said that he wanted Katayama more than anyone else to stand in support of Masuzoe, but Katayama responded that it was difficult for her to do so given Masuzoe's publicized dispute over support payments to one of his extramarital children, who is disabled. On 1 May 2019, she attended the presentation of the Three Sacred Treasures to Emperor Naruhito. In the last such ceremony in 1989, only males were allowed to be in attendance; however in 2019 all cabinet members were allowed to attend regardless of sex, although only male adults from the imperial family could attend.

They are usually gray-brown with yellowish or white markings, and can reach up to in length. They are found in Southern Africa, northwards to Angola, Zambia, and Mozambique. Taxonomy First described by François Marie Daudin in 1802, these lizards were previously classed as a subspecies of Varanus exanthematicus, but have since been declared a distinct species based upon differences in hemipenal morphology.Bohme, W. (1991). New finding on the hemipenal morphology of monitor lizards and their systematic implications. Mertensiella, 2, 42-49. The generic name Varanus is derived from the Arabic word waral ورل, which is translated to English as \\"monitor\\". Their specific name comes from a compound of two Latin words: albus meaning \\"white\\" and gula meaning \\"throat\\".  Diet  V. albigularis albigularis are generalists, feeding opportunistically on a broad variety of prey in the wild. Tortoises make up a significant part of their diet, and are swallowed whole due to the hard shell. Otherwise, they consume very little vertebrate prey, eating primarily invertebrates, especially millipedes, beetles, molluscs and orthopterans. Millipedes for example form nearly a quarter of their diet; the monitors are apparently resistant to its poisonous secretions. Although not averse to occasionally scavenging the corpses of vertebrate prey, even those as large as vervet monkeys, such prey seems usually too fast to catch for these monitors. This contrasts with what is often a diet of mostly vertebrates in captivity, such as rodents or poultry.  Predation  Martial eagle feeding on a white-throated monitor. It is hunted by birds of prey such as eagles. Captivity This subspecies is kept as a pet.

Manuterge is the name given by the Roman Catholic Church to the towel used by the priest when engaged liturgically. Description There are two kinds of manuterges. One serves the needs of the sacristy. The priest uses this at the washing of hands before mass, before distributing Communion outside of Mass, and before administering baptism. It can also be used for drying the hands after they have been washed on occasions not prescribed by the rubrics, but still customary after Mass. There are no prescriptions as to material and form for the towel used in the sacristy. It is usual to have it hanging over a roller, the two ends being sewn together so as to make it into a circular band. The custom of washing the hands before Mass may date from Early Christian tradition since the ceremony is expressly mentioned in the sacramentaries of the ninth and tenth centuries. The other manuterge is used in the Mass for drying both the hands at the Lavabo, an action performed by the priest after the Offertory as he recites the psalm, \\"Lavabo\\", and also by the bishop before the Offertory and after the Communion. It is kept on the credence table with the finger-bowl and cruets. There are no ecclesiastical regulations regarding the form and material of this manuterge. The towel, which is used after the Offertory during the recital of the psalm \\"Lavabo\\", is usually small (18 in. by 14 in.), only the points of the thumb and two fingers, and not the whole hand, being usually washed.

New York: Simon & Macmillan. 0-02-864604-5 When the Lambie family traveled to Addis Ababa, Ras Tafari requested that Dr. Lambie build a hospital there, offering him a tract 12 acres in size at Gullele outside the city. Upon his return to the United States, Dr. Lambie approached his board for help with this endeavor. Although they recognized the need for a hospital the board was unable to provide him with the necessary funds, which led Lambie to embark on a fund-raising tour of his country. It was while visiting a small town in Ohio that he encountered W.S. George, a successful businessman who provided him with US$ 70,000 to found the hospital.Richard Pankhurst, An Introduction to the Medical History of Ethiopia (Trenton: Red Sea, 1990), p. 207 Construction on the hospital began in 1922, which became the biggest building in Ethiopia at the time. In 1928, having initially launched the Abyssinian Frontiers Mission in 1927, then merged it with SIM (at that time \\"Sudan Interior Mission\\") in Ethiopia, Dr. Lambie negotiated permission to begin mission work south of Addis Ababa, as far as Sidamo. This was a delicate procedure because Ras Tafari was subject to strong pressures from some in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. In 1932, Dr. Lambie built a leprosy hospital on the edge of Addis Ababa, now part of ALERT. At the urging of Ras Kassa, Dr. Lambie investigated building a hospital in Lalibela in 1934, but the outbreak of the war prevented this. Emperor Haile Selassie I appointed Dr. Lambie secretary-general of the new Ethiopian Red Cross to oversee the efforts of Ethiopian and foreign medical teams. After Italy occupied Addis Ababa in 1935, Lambie at first submitted to the Italian regime in order to continue his work, going as far as to retract his reports about Italian use of mustard gas in the Second Italo- Abyssinian War. Upon the restoration of Emperor Haile Selassie to the throne, Dr. Lambie left Ethiopia; because he had acquired Ethiopian citizenship in order to own the property his hospital was built on, he was forced to apply for naturalization.John Spencer, Ethiopia at Bay: A personal account of the Haile Selassie years (Algonac: Reference Publications, 1984), p. 85 note to p. 80 In 1946, he joined the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions (IBPFM). He went on to work in Nigeria, Sudan, and in Palestine where he built the 90 bed Berachah Tuberculosis Sanitarium in Bethlehem and started Baraka Bible Presbyterian Church, Bethlehem in 1953. He died at Christ’s tomb, on April 14, 1954.  Writings  *Lambie, Thomas. 1935. Abayte! or Ethiopia's Plea for Help. *Lambie, Thomas. 1939.

Intuitively speaking, the spectral density characterizes the frequency content of the signal. One purpose of estimating the spectral density is to detect any periodicities in the data, by observing peaks at the frequencies corresponding to these periodicities. Some SDE techniques assume that a signal is composed of a limited (usually small) number of generating frequencies plus noise and seek to find the location and intensity of the generated frequencies. Others make no assumption on the number of components and seek to estimate the whole generating spectrum.  Overview  Example of voice waveform and its frequency spectrum A periodic waveform (triangle wave) and its frequency spectrum, showing a \\"fundamental\\" frequency at 220 Hz followed by multiples (harmonics) of 220 Hz. The power spectral density of a segment of music is estimated by two different methods, for comparison. Spectrum analysis, also referred to as frequency domain analysis or spectral density estimation, is the technical process of decomposing a complex signal into simpler parts. As described above, many physical processes are best described as a sum of many individual frequency components. Any process that quantifies the various amounts (e.g. amplitudes, powers, intensities) versus frequency (or phase) can be called spectrum analysis. Spectrum analysis can be performed on the entire signal. Alternatively, a signal can be broken into short segments (sometimes called frames), and spectrum analysis may be applied to these individual segments. Periodic functions (such as \\\\sin (t)) are particularly well-suited for this sub-division. General mathematical techniques for analyzing non- periodic functions fall into the category of Fourier analysis. The Fourier transform of a function produces a frequency spectrum which contains all of the information about the original signal, but in a different form. This means that the original function can be completely reconstructed (synthesized) by an inverse Fourier transform. For perfect reconstruction, the spectrum analyzer must preserve both the amplitude and phase of each frequency component. These two pieces of information can be represented as a 2-dimensional vector, as a complex number, or as magnitude (amplitude) and phase in polar coordinates (i.e., as a phasor). A common technique in signal processing is to consider the squared amplitude, or power; in this case the resulting plot is referred to as a power spectrum. Because of reversibility, the Fourier transform is called a representation of the function, in terms of frequency instead of time; thus, it is a frequency domain representation. Linear operations that could be performed in the time domain have counterparts that can often be performed more easily in the frequency domain. Frequency analysis also simplifies the understanding and interpretation of the effects of various time-domain operations, both linear and non-linear. For instance, only non- linear or time-variant operations can create new frequencies in the frequency spectrum. In practice, nearly all software and electronic devices that generate frequency spectra utilize a discrete Fourier transform (DFT), which operates on samples of the signal, and which provides a mathematical approximation to the full integral solution. The DFT is almost invariably implemented by an efficient algorithm called fast Fourier transform (FFT). The squared-magnitude components of a DFT are a type of power spectrum called periodogram, which is widely used for examining the frequency characteristics of noise-free functions such as filter impulse responses and window functions. But the periodogram does not provide processing-gain when applied to noiselike signals or even sinusoids at low signal-to-noise ratios. In other words, the variance of its spectral estimate at a given frequency does not decrease as the number of samples used in the computation increases. This can be mitigated by averaging over time (Welch's method) or over frequency (smoothing). Welch's method is widely used for spectral density estimation (SDE). However, periodogram-based techniques introduce small biases that are unacceptable in some applications. So other alternatives are presented in the next section.  Techniques  Many other techniques for spectral estimation have been developed to mitigate the disadvantages of the basic periodogram. These techniques can generally be divided into non-parametric and parametric methods. The non-parametric approaches explicitly estimate the covariance or the spectrum of the process without assuming that the process has any particular structure. Some of the most common estimators in use for basic applications (e.g. Welch's method) are non-parametric estimators closely related to the periodogram. By contrast, the parametric approaches assume that the underlying stationary stochastic process has a certain structure that can be described using a small number of parameters (for example, using an auto- regressive or moving average model). In these approaches, the task is to estimate the parameters of the model that describes the stochastic process. Following is a partial list of non-parametric spectral density estimation techniques: * Periodogram, the modulus-squared of the discrete Fourier transform * Bartlett's method is the average of the periodograms taken of multiple segments of the signal to reduce variance of the spectral density estimate * Welch's method a windowed version of Bartlett's method that uses overlapping segments * Multitaper is a periodogram-based method that uses multiple tapers, or windows, to form independent estimates of the spectral density to reduce variance of the spectral density estimate * Least-squares spectral analysis, based on least squares fitting to known frequencies * Non- uniform discrete Fourier transform is used when the signal samples are unevenly spaced in time * Singular spectrum analysis is a nonparametric method that uses a singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix to estimate the spectral density * Short-time Fourier transform *Critical filter is a nonparametric method based on information field theory that can deal with noise, incomplete data, and instrumental response functions Below is a partial list of parametric techniques: * Autoregressive model (AR) estimation, which assumes that the nth sample is correlated with the previous p samples. * Moving-average model (MA) estimation, which assumes that the nth sample is correlated with noise terms in the previous p samples. * Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) estimation, which generalizes the AR and MA models. * MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) is a popular superresolution method. * Maximum entropy spectral estimation is an all-poles method useful for SDE when singular spectral features, such as sharp peaks, are expected.  Parametric estimation  In parametric spectral estimation, one assumes that the signal is modeled by a stationary process which has a spectral density function (SDF) S(f; a_1, \\\\ldots, a_p) that is a function of the frequency f and p parameters a_1, \\\\ldots, a_p. The estimation problem then becomes one of estimating these parameters. The most common form of parametric SDF estimate uses as a model an autoregressive model \\\\text{AR}(p) of order p. A signal sequence \\\\\\\\{Y_t\\\\\\\\} obeying a zero mean \\\\text{AR}(p) process satisfies the equation :Y_t = \\\\phi_1Y_{t-1} + \\\\phi_2Y_{t-2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\phi_pY_{t-p} + \\\\epsilon_t, where the \\\\phi_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\phi_p are fixed coefficients and \\\\epsilon_t is a white noise process with zero mean and innovation variance \\\\sigma^2_p. The SDF for this process is : S(f; \\\\phi_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\phi_p, \\\\sigma^2_p) = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2_p\\\\Delta t}{\\\\left1 - \\\\sum_{k=1}^p \\\\phi_k e^{-2i\\\\pi f k \\\\Delta t}\\\\right|^2} \\\\qquad |f< f_N, with \\\\Delta t the sampling time interval and f_N the Nyquist frequency. There are a number of approaches to estimating the parameters \\\\phi_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\phi_p,\\\\sigma^2_p of the \\\\text{AR}(p) process and thus the spectral density: * The Yule-Walker estimators are found by recursively solving the Yule-Walker equations for an \\\\text{AR}(p) process * The Burg estimators are found by treating the Yule-Walker equations as a form of ordinary least squares problem. The Burg estimators are generally considered superior to the Yule-Walker estimators. Burg associated these with maximum entropy spectral estimation.Burg, J.P. (1967) \\"Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis\\", Proceedings of the 37th Meeting of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. * The forward-backward least-squares estimators treat the \\\\text{AR}(p) process as a regression problem and solves that problem using forward-backward method. They are competitive with the Burg estimators. * The maximum likelihood estimators estimate the parameters using a maximum likelihood approach. This involves a nonlinear optimization and is more complex than the first three. Alternative parametric methods include fitting to a moving average model (MA) and to a full autoregressive moving average model (ARMA).  Frequency estimation  Frequency estimation is the process of estimating the complex frequency components of a signal in the presence of noise given assumptions about the number of the components.Hayes, Monson H., Statistical Digital Signal Processing and Modeling, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1996. . This contrasts with the general methods above, which do not make prior assumptions about the components.  Single tone  If one only wants to estimate the single loudest frequency, one can use a pitch detection algorithm. If the dominant frequency changes over time, then the problem becomes the estimation of the instantaneous frequency as defined in the time–frequency representation. Methods for instantaneous frequency estimation include those based on the Wigner-Ville distribution and higher order ambiguity functions. If one wants to know all the (possibly complex) frequency components of a received signal (including transmitted signal and noise), one uses a multiple-tone approach.  Multiple tones  A typical model for a signal x(n) consists of a sum of p complex exponentials in the presence of white noise, w(n) :x(n) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^p A_i e^{j n \\\\omega_i} + w(n). The power spectral density of x(n) is composed of p impulse functions in addition to the spectral density function due to noise. The most common methods for frequency estimation involve identifying the noise subspace to extract these components. These methods are based on eigen decomposition of the autocorrelation matrix into a signal subspace and a noise subspace. After these subspaces are identified, a frequency estimation function is used to find the component frequencies from the noise subspace. The most popular methods of noise subspace based frequency estimation are Pisarenko's method, the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method, the eigenvector method, and the minimum norm method. ; Pisarenko's method: \\\\hat{P}_\\\\text{PHD}\\\\left(e^{j \\\\omega}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\left|\\\\mathbf{e}^H \\\\mathbf{v}_\\\\text{min}\\\\right|^2} ; MUSIC: \\\\hat{P}_\\\\text{MU}\\\\left(e^{j \\\\omega}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sum_{i=p+1}^M \\\\left|\\\\mathbf{e}^H \\\\mathbf{v}_i\\\\right|^2}, ; Eigenvector method: \\\\hat{P}_\\\\text{EV}\\\\left(e^{j \\\\omega}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sum_{i=p+1}^M \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_i} \\\\left|\\\\mathbf{e}^H \\\\mathbf{v}_i\\\\right|^2} ; Minimum norm method: \\\\hat{P}_\\\\text{MN}\\\\left(e^{j \\\\omega}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\left|\\\\mathbf{e}^H \\\\mathbf{a}\\\\right|^2} ; \\\\ \\\\mathbf{a} = \\\\lambda \\\\mathbf{P}_n \\\\mathbf{u}_1  Example calculation  Suppose x_n, from n=0 to N-1 is a time series (discrete time) with zero mean. Suppose that it is a sum of a finite number of periodic components (all frequencies are positive): :\\\\begin{align} x_n &= \\\\sum_k A_k \\\\sin(2\\\\pi u_k n + \\\\phi_k)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_k A_k \\\\left ( \\\\sin (\\\\phi_k) \\\\cos(2\\\\pi u_k n) + \\\\cos(\\\\phi_k) \\\\sin(2\\\\pi u_k n) \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_k \\\\left(\\\\overbrace{a_k}^{A_k \\\\sin(\\\\phi_k)} \\\\cos(2\\\\pi u_k n) + \\\\overbrace{b_k}^{A_k \\\\cos(\\\\phi_k)} \\\\sin(2\\\\pi u_k n)\\\\right) \\\\end{align} The variance of x_n is, for a zero-mean function as above, given by :\\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n^2. If these data were samples taken from an electrical signal, this would be its average power (power is energy per unit time, so it is analogous to variance if energy is analogous to the amplitude squared). Now, for simplicity, suppose the signal extends infinitely in time, so we pass to the limit as N\\\\to \\\\infty. If the average power is bounded, which is almost always the case in reality, then the following limit exists and is the variance of the data. :\\\\lim_{N \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n^2. Again, for simplicity, we will pass to continuous time, and assume that the signal extends infinitely in time in both directions. Then these two formulas become :x(t) = \\\\sum_k A_k \\\\sin(2\\\\pi u_k t + \\\\phi_k) and :\\\\lim_{T\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{2T} \\\\int_{-T}^T x(t)^2 dt. The root mean square of \\\\sin is 1/\\\\sqrt{2}, so the variance of A_k \\\\sin(2\\\\pi u_k t + \\\\phi_k) is \\\\tfrac{1}{2} A_k^2. Hence, the contribution to the average power of x(t) coming from the component with frequency u_k is \\\\tfrac{1}{2}A_k^2. All these contributions add up to the average power of x(t). Then the power as a function of frequency is \\\\tfrac{1}{2}A_k^2, and its statistical cumulative distribution function S( u) will be :S( u) = \\\\sum _ {k : u_k < u} \\\\frac{1}{2} A_k^2. S is a step function, monotonically non-decreasing. Its jumps occur at the frequencies of the periodic components of x, and the value of each jump is the power or variance of that component. The variance is the covariance of the data with itself. If we now consider the same data but with a lag of \\\\tau, we can take the covariance of x(t) with x(t + \\\\tau), and define this to be the autocorrelation function c of the signal (or data) x: :c(\\\\tau) = \\\\lim_{T\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{2T} \\\\int_{-T}^T x(t) x(t + \\\\tau) dt. If it exists, it is an even function of \\\\tau. If the average power is bounded, then c exists everywhere, is finite, and is bounded by c(0), which is the average power or variance of the data. It can be shown that c can be decomposed into periodic components with the same periods as x: :c(\\\\tau) = \\\\sum_k \\\\frac{1}{2} A_k^2 \\\\cos(2\\\\pi u_k\\\\tau). This is in fact the spectral decomposition of c over the different frequencies, and is related to the distribution of power of x over the frequencies: the amplitude of a frequency component of c is its contribution to the average power of the signal. The power spectrum of this example is not continuous, and therefore does not have a derivative, and therefore this signal does not have a power spectral density function. In general, the power spectrum will usually be the sum of two parts: a line spectrum such as in this example, which is not continuous and does not have a density function, and a residue, which is absolutely continuous and does have a density function.

Former guest house, currently used as the Steepletop Visitors Center East Hill leads through the Steepletop property, on a rolling section of cleared land in the middle of the woods. Its most visible building is the guest house on the east side of the road, currently used as the Millay Society's offices. It is a two-story building, sided in shingles with a gabled roof and two exterior brick chimneys. To its southeast is a stable now used as a garage, with a second floor studio. A barn with curved roof is located on the northeast. Just north of it, across the road, is the main house, Millay's primary home during her years of residence. It is a two-story white clapboard-sided house with a steep gabled roof and central chimney, built into ground that rises up from the short unpaved driveway on the west. A one-and-a-half-story wing projects from the north. The four-bay west (front) facade has a single-bay, single-story gabled porch sheltering the main entrance, a doorway with sidelights and transom. The north wing has three shed-roofed dormer windows, an interior chimney and a single- bay, single-story projection on its west just north of the main entrance. Its north end has a double door and single window in the gable field. On the wing's east side is a screened porch with a single shed dormer above. Behind the main door is a small full-length hallway with stone floor. It is decorated with photographs of Millay and art objects collected by her and Boissevain, including a bust of Sappho and a desk made for Millay. An adjacent parlor has a wide brick mantelpiece and paintings of and by Norma Ellis and her husband Charles, who lived in the house after her sister's death. At the east end of the hall is the dining room. To its north is the kitchen, as remodeled by Ladies' Home Journal in 1947 for a feature story, by their friend and an editor at the magazine, Alice Blinn. Its pantry is to the west, with a small room containing a wood stove on the north. Beyond that is a large storage room with concrete floor, bathroom and closet. It contains file cabinets with recordings of readings of Millay's work. A stairway leads up to the second floor, with the library on the south. All its walls have shelves of Millay's books. At the northeast corner is her bedroom, which still has furniture she bought and dresses she wore to poetry readings. A newer bedroom, used by her sister and her husband, is to the west. alt=A small house with unpainted wooden siding in the middle of some pine trees with a field beyond Northwest of the house is a small one-story wooden cabin, used by Millay as a writing studio. It has a door at the west end, one window on the north face and two on the south. Within are a stove, chaise longue, bureau, desk and chair, and a table with magazines from 1949, all as Millay left it. Farther away from the house are two more buildings and Millay's grave. A gabled icehouse is to the north; the Ellises converted it into a workroom and storage space. West of the driveway is a swimming pool complex, with a roofed terrace Millay referred to as \\"the bar\\" and lawn she called \\"the dingle\\". Her gravesite is off a dirt road that branches off to the west from East Hill a thousand feet (305 m) north of the main house. History The guest house is believed to have been built in the late 18th century, considerably predating the main house, which is believed to have been built around 1870. Millay and Boissevain bought the property, which had been a blueberry farm and moved in in 1925, after the period in which critics and scholars generally believe she had done her best work. She continued to write since the rural setting provided sufficient distance from the outside world, and the couple lived there except for periods of travel. The couple built the barn shortly after moving in, from a kit they bought from Sears. Millay grew her own vegetables in a small garden near the icehouse, and had the writing cabin built. The couple also had a tennis court built. After World War II, in the late 1940s, she left Steepletop less frequently. Boissevain died in 1949, making her even more reclusive in the year before she was found dead at the foot of the stairway in the main house. The fall was the proximate cause of death, but what led to it is unknown. Her sister Norma and her husband, painter Charles Ellis, moved in afterwards. In 1973, they established Millay Colony for the Arts on the seven acres (2.8 ha) around the guest house and barn. After her husband's death in 1976, Norma continued to manage the colony program until her death in 1986. During that time, in 1980, she renovated the barn into housing for visiting artists. In 1997 a disabled-accessible main building was built on colony property. The colony continues to offer one-month residencies to writers, visual artists and composers from the U.S. and other countries. The Edna St. Vincent Millay Society remains in charge of the main house, the outbuildings around it and the grounds as a whole. It operates the property as a historic house museum dedicated to Millay and has spent much effort on restoring the house and grounds. In 2003 the Friends of the Millay Society built the Millay Poetry Trail along the dirt road leading to her grave and those of several family members. The trail is open to the public and posted with her nature poetry along the shaded route.

The peaceful and traditional people, located on the shores of a large bay, are surrounded by the rough pastoral folk in the surrounding hills, who feel increasing pressure from the unscrupulous and lowly followers of the dreaded head forester. The narrator and protagonist lives on the marble cliffs as a botanist with his brother Otho, his son Erio from a past relationship and Erio's grandmother Lampusa. The idyllic life is threatened by the erosion of values and traditions, losing its inner power. The head forester uses this opportunity to establish a new order based on dictatorial rule, large numbers of mindless followers and the use of violence, torture and murder. The tale may readily be understood as a parable on national socialism, the evil and \\"jovial\\" head forester being Hermann Göring. Others see it as a description of Germany's fight against the threat of Stalinism or communism, the head forester (or \\"chief ranger\\") being Joseph Stalin.Cf. Guido Giacomo Preparata (2005): Conjuring Hitler – How Britain and America made the Third Reich. Pluto Press, London Ann Arbor 2005, p. 255seqq. Following this interpretation the book would have predicted in 1939 the ultimate failure of Germany's imminent war against the Soviet Union. The book was not censored in Nazi Germany, perhaps due to Jünger's significant repute in right-wing circles. Its sharp disapproval of violent masses, as well as its prediction or description of death camps, was noted and helped Jünger's rehabilitation after the Second World War although he had not gone into exile like most anti-Nazi authors. Jünger himself, however, refused the notion that the book was a statement of resistance, describing it rather as a \\"shoe that fits various feet\\". The work is typical for Jünger's Aestheticism that responds to destruction with placidity. It displays the determination to conserve values even in the face of annihilation, perhaps all the more so because the victory of the mindless masses follows brutalization as a virtual force of nature.

Academically, the school offers for senior years the National Certificate of Educational Achievement assessment system (NCEA).

These are generally to the west and south of the city of ChristchurchSt Thomas of Canterbury College, website. (Retrieved 10 June 2018) History Origins A Christian Brothers' school in Christchurch was first proposed in the 1880s. The third Catholic Bishop of Christchurch, Patrick Francis Lyons (Bishop 1944–1950) acquired land on Sockburn in West Christchurch and formally invited the Christian Brothers to provide the staff. There was no progress for several years. Eventually Brother Marlow, the Provincial of the Christian Brothers, and Edward Michael Joyce, the fourth Catholic Bishop of Christchurch (Bishop 1950–1964), agreed, and St Thomas of Canterbury College held its first classes on 6 February 1961 (Waitangi Day – not a public holiday then).Donaldson, p. 12; Early days The initial roll was 99 students in Forms 1–3 (years 7–9). The foundation staff were Brothers James Ignatius McClintock (Principal), Ian T Mahon and Carroll. Brother Simon Germaine Coughlan joined them in 1962. The school expanded its area when eight acres was acquired on the other side of Middle Park Road to be used as sports fields. Later several smaller areas were acquired to extend the fields, provide better access to them from the school, provide changing sheds and to provide a site for a residence for the Brothers. In 1964 Edward Joyce, the Bishop of Christchurch, transferred the ownership of the school to the Christian Brothers. The college obtained scholastic success very early, especially when three students (J.G. Cleary, P.M. Heffernan and K.F. Hosking (Cleary and Hosking were both in the lower sixth form)) obtained Junior National University Scholarships in 1967.J.C. O'Neill, The History of the Work of the Christian Brothers in New Zealand, unpublished Dip. Ed. thesis, University of Auckland, 1968, pp. 120–126. The New Zealand Herald commented that this was remarkable as St Thomas of Canterbury College was a new school and it was only the third year that it had an upper sixth form).\\"Auckland Grammar Top Scholarship School\\", The New Zealand Herald, 24 January 1968, p. 2. 2011 earthquake Except for minor damage, the college was spared by the Christchurch earthquakes. As a result of the 22 February earthquake in 2011, Catholic Cathedral College relocated to St Thomas of Canterbury College and \\"site shared\\". The reason for this was that although it was not significantly damaged, parts of Catholic Cathedral College were under the unstable 400-ton dome of the Christchurch Catholic Cathedral. Because the dome was in imminent danger of collapse, the college had to move. St Thomas' restricted its own use of the school to the morning and Catholic Cathedral College took over the school in the afternoon. The dome was removed on 26 July and Catholic Cathedral College moved back to its own site on 1 August 2011.\\"Catholic Cathedral College to go home\\", Stuff, 11 July 2011. (retrieved 26 January 2012)  Golden jubilee  In spite of the threat of earthquakes, the college celebrated its Golden Jubilee or 50th anniversary on 6–9 October 2011.St Thomas of Canterbury Newsletter, 29 September 2011, No 28(retrieved 26 January 2012) \\"Around three hundred people were present and they revelled in: sports, fire dances, haka, tours, hangi, dancing, food, drink, rugby and spiritual celebrations.\\"\\"STC 50 Years on\\", St Thomas of Canterbury College Newsletter, 27 October 2011, No 30, p. 1. (retrieved 27 January 2012) The events included a \\"50th Jubilee Celebration Day\\" to allow Old Boys to meet the pupils and see the school operating during a school day. An assembly included a Powhiri, Waiata and other songs, a Samoan fire dance, a PowerPoint presentation of the history of the College, the presentation of a time capsule and the cutting of a Jubilee Cake. John Airey, the first student to arrive at the college on 6 February 1961 was presented to the assembly. This was followed by a Hangi. There were sporting competitions with St Kevin's College to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of sporting exchanges between the two Colleges (they started in the school's first year). St Thomas's won the Rugby (54–0), but lost the Basketball (59–57) and the Football (4–0). A cricket match had to be cancelled because of rain. The 50th Celebration Dinner was held at the Showgate Room at Riccarton Raceway Function Centre. Former staff members including Christian Brothers were present. All these events were timed not to clash with games of the 2011 Rugby World Cup. The Jubilee Mass was celebrated by Bishop Barry Jones of Christchurch on Sunday 9 October in the St Thomas of Canterbury College hall.\\"Thomas Times Newsletter\\", St Thomas of Canterbury College, April 2012 (Retrieved 26 February 2013).  Christian Brothers  The last Christian Brother involvement on the teaching staff of the college was in the early 2000s, but the Christian Brothers, as proprietors, continued to appoint their representatives to the board under the Private School Conditional Integration Act 1975. In 2019, the Christian Brothers transferred ownership of the college to the Bishop of Christchurch and so ceased, after 58 years, to have any formal institutional connection with the college.Daniel Birchfield, \\"St Kevin's to change hands\\", Otago Day Times, 13 June 2019 (Retrieved 21 June 2019)Jeff Dillon, \\"Southern college changes ownership after 90 years\\", NZ Catholic 14 July 2019, p. 3.

The book, published in 1995 by Hamish Hamilton was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. Synopsis The book is set in Medieval England sometime near the end of the 14th century and the events described in the book take place in an unnamed village in Northern England (north of the Humber). A priest fleeing from his diocese joins a group of travelling players. The players are travelling toward their liege lord's castle where they are expected to play at Christmas but, short of money, they decide to stage their plays at a village en route. When a morality play from their usual repertoire fails to earn them enough money, Martin, the leader of the group convinces them to stage 'the play of Thomas Wells', a play based on the story of the murder of a young boy from the village.Heather Kennedy McDonald, \\"'The Play's the Thing': Considering the Morality Play in Morality Play, in: Falling into Medievalism, ed. Anne Lair and Richard Utz. Special Issue of UNIversitas: The University of Northern Iowa Journal of Research, Scholarship, and Creative Activity, 2.1 (2006) . The murderer has already been found, a young woman from the village, and the play seems simple enough, however they soon find that the facts don't fit. The line between the play and reality blurs and, line-by-line, they arrive at the truth about the murder. Critical Reaction The novel is unique in its portrayal of medieval English drama and mystery plays, as it implies that instead of merely rehearsing and performing standard Biblically- based morality plays of the period, that an acting troupe might actually create and structure a play around events in their village, community or surrounding culture. The existence of such culturally-connected playcraft is important to scholars of the period, as it implies that works such as the N-Town Plays may have a provenance beyond simple Biblical literalness, and may speak to the concerns of the culture at that period, much as later drama of the Elizabethan period spoke directly to cultural concerns. Characters *Nicholas Barber: The main character, a young priest who, unable to escape the lure of spring, has fled from his duties. *Martin Ball: The leader of the players. *Tobias: A player.

He received his Ph.D. from Leipzig in 1883. He then spent two years in Switzerland for his health. From 1885 to 1886 he became an instructor in Old Testament theology at the University of Erlangen. In 1886, he left for the United States, where he became linguistic editor of the Sunday-School Times, and a professor of Assyrian at the University of Pennsylvania. The next year, 1887, he also became curator for the Semitic department of the University of Pennsylvania's museum. In 1894, Hilprecht took a D.D. degree from the University of Pennsylvania, and an LL.D. from Princeton in 1896. As second Assyriologist in charge, he participated in the first campaign of excavations at Nippur (modern Nuffar, Iraq) in 1889. In the following two campaigns he was a member of the scientific committee in Philadelphia and eventually travelled to Constantinople to examine the portable finds and arrange the separation/acquisition of duplicate pieces for the newly constructed University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Philadelphia. He also rearranged the Imperial Ottoman Museum for which the director Hamdy Bey showed his gratitude with a favorable separation of the findings. During the fourth and last campaign he was coordinating director of the expedition, sending out John Henry Haynes accompanied by his wife Cassandria as field director from 1898-1900 (later in 1899 efforts were increased by sending out two young architects H. V. Geere and C. S. Fisher). Hilprecht himself overtook the responsibility of the whole excavation for the last part of this campaign from March 1 until May 11, 1900. Afterwards he undertook the editing of the publications programme of the \\"Babylonian Expedition of the University of Pennsylvania\\"(=BE). This publication series incorporated also quantities of bought cuneiform tablets, acquired in Baghdad from the antiquities dealers which tried to undermine the efforts of continuing the US excavations. With announcing the discovery of the Temple Library of Nippur after finishing the fourth campaign, some other team members including the former expedition director John Punnett Peters built a strong opposition against Hilprecht who claimed \\"the cream\\" of nearly every important discovery as his work. Some American orientalists joined in and the so-called \\"Peters-Hilprecht-Controversy\\" was born. This fierce controversy fought in newspapers and even lectures prevented most of the research of the acquired material for the next years. After his resignation in 1911 of which (besides the \\"Peters-Hilprecht-Controversy\\") the main reason was the breakup of his bureau late in 1911. The numbered boxes were opened, confused and burned (including the files of the archaeological context). After this the publication series were changed to the \\"Publications of the Babylonian Section\\" (=PBS). Afterwards he returned to the United States, where he became a citizen.\\"Hilprecht, Hermann Volrath,\\" The Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed., Columbia University Press. He died in Philadelphia in 1925. After his death his second wife, according to H. V. Hilprechts last will, handed over his collection of Babylonian antiquities to the University of Jena founding the \\"Frau Professor Hilprecht Collection of Babylonian Antiquities\\" (eventually Germanized under the regime of the Nazis in \\"Frau Professor Hilprecht Sammlung Babylonischer Altertümer\\") in remembrance of his first wife. It incorporates more than 2000 cuneiform tablets and pieces and the personal archive of him. One of the most recognized pieces is the \\"city map of Nippur\\" one of the earliest city maps recovered presumably from the late Kassite period. Works He is known among Assyriologists by his Freibrief Nebukadnezars I (Leipzig, 1883). In the spring of 1887, he delivered, in the chapel of the University of Pennsylvania, a course of lectures on \\"The Family and Civil Life of the Egyptians,\\" \\"The Most Flourishing Period of Egyptian Literature,\\" and \\"Egypt in the Time of Israel's Sojourn.\\" His other literary works consist of contributions to Luthardt's Theologisches Literaturblatt (Leipzig), and to other periodicals.

A blizzard tends to reduce visibilities to 1/4 of a mile (400 m) or less. A Severe Blizzard Warning is a variation issued in some cases of winds above 45 mph / 20 m/s and temperatures below 10 °F/-12 °C. Most local weather offices will activate and broadcast the SAME alarm tone on relevant NOAA Weather Radio stations for both varieties of warning. When the Wireless Emergency Alerts system went live in 2012, blizzard warnings were initially sent as alerts to mobile phones, however, this practice was discontinued in November 2013. In Canada, comparable warnings are issued by Environment Canada. These are the main two types of Canadian blizzard warnings as of 2010: * National warning below tree line – when winds are 40 kilometres/hr or greater with widespread reductions in visibility to 400 metres (1/4 mile) or less from blowing snow or blowing snow with falling snow for at least 4 hours. * Northern (Arctic) warning above tree line – same as national warning but must last for at least 6 hours.

Life and career Lafever began life as a carpenter around 1820. At this period in the United States there were no professional schools of architecture and few who claimed the title architect. Most structures were designed and put up by builders, and architects and builders were trained by working under master builders. In 1829 Lafever published The Young Builders' General Instructor, followed by Modern Builders' Guide in 1833, The Beauties of Modern Architecture in 1835 and The Architectural Instructor in 1850. His pattern books were influential in spreading his Greek Revival style. Three of his buildings which were subsequently designated National Historic Landmarks are: * First Presbyterian Church (Sag Harbor) (tall steeple destroyed in a hurricane) * St. Ann and the Holy Trinity Church * Sailors' Snug Harbor Other notable buildings include: * Benjamin Huntting House, now the Sag Harbor Whaling Museum * Church of the Holy Apostles (New York, New York) listed on the National Register of Historic Places * Strong Place Baptist Church, Cobble Hill, Brooklyn (1851–52) * First Unitarian Church AKA Church of the Savior, Brooklyn Heights Historic District 1844 Rutgers Presbyterian Church (Rutgers Street, Lower East Side, New York, New York) 1843 One of his most successful acolytes was John F. Rague who designed and built the 1837 Old Capitol of Illinois and the 1840 Territorial Capitol of Iowa.The Wisconsin Magazine of History Vol. 10, No. 2, Dec., 1926. Pattern books Lafever wrote five pattern books that were influential in spreading his Greek Revival style, most notably \\"The Modern Builder's Guide\\" (1833) and \\"The Beauties of Modern Architecture\\" (1835). The Greek Revival Government Street Presbyterian Church in Mobile, Alabama is a National Historic Landmark that was designed using many of the latter book's detailed guidelines. and That church's tall steeple, like the steeple of Lafever's First Presbyterian Church in Sag Harbor, was destroyed in a hurricane. Other historic structures built using Lafever's designs include Rose Hill Mansion, a National Historic Landmark in western New York, which was built in the style of a two-story Greek temple with Ionic columns in 1837. and Two mansions in the Boston Post Road Historic District-- the 1838 Peter Augustus Jay House and Lounsberry-- were built using Lafever's designs, and greatly resemble illustrated plates found within Lafever's books.Jay Heritage Center. Rose Glen, an antebellum plantation house near Sevierville, Tennessee, was modeled after Lafever's \\"Design for a Country Villa,\\" which appeared as the frontispiece in both The Modern Builder's Guide and The Beauties of Modern Architecture.Robbie Jones, The Historic Architecture of Sevier County, Tennessee (Sevierville, Tenn.: Smoky Mountain Historical Society, 1997), pp. 232-237. Lafever did not confine himself to a single style. His St. James' Church, New York on James Street near Madison Street in Manhattan (1837) is Greek Revival as is his building for Sailors' Snug Harbor, his First Presbyterian Church (Sag Harbor) (1844) is Egyptian Revival, his brownstone St. Ann and the Holy Trinity Church at Montague and Clinton Streets in Brooklyn Heights (1847) is Gothic Revival and his Church of the Holy Apostles at Ninth Avenue and 28th Street in Manhattan (1848–1854) is Romanesque/Italianate. His last commission was the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn, which opened in 1854. The Packer building is in Tudor Gothic style, with 30 schoolrooms, and a two-story-high chapel on the third floor. It has two towers of different size, and the “off-center arrangement of two large peaked gables, give the school the exterior appearance of picturesque irregularity common to the Gothic revival.” However, the interior is compact and symmetrical, with long crossed hallways dividing the building into quadrants. Architectural historian Andrew Dolkart calls Lafever’s design of Packer one of the earliest and most sophisticated evocations of English- inspired Collegiate Gothic, creating the educational atmosphere of Oxford and Cambridge. A list of his churches, extant and not, and a well-researched biography is included in a 2006 nomination for First Reformed Protestant Dutch Church of Kingston.

She was then sold to Greece, where she served as Ariadni (A414) until 2003. United States Navy (1943-1972)  World War II  Tombigbee was laid down on 23 October 1942 at Savage, Minnesota, by Cargill, Inc.; launched on 18 November 1943; sponsored by Mrs. F. R. Stoltz; and commissioned on 13 July 1944 at New Orleans, Louisiana, Lt. Comdr. A. O. Askland, USNR, in command. It is named for the Tombigbee River. Following shakedown, Tombigbee departed Galveston, Texas, on 13 August, bound for the U.S. West Coast. She transited the Panama Canal en route, reached San Diego, California on the 28th, pushed on for the western Pacific, and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 4 September, where she paused briefly before proceeding on to Eniwetok, in the Marshalls, joining Service Squadron 10. Her tanks filled with fresh water instead of the oil for which she was designed, Tombigbee began replenishing the tanks of the ships of the fleet and worked out of Guam and Ulithi, continuing this duty for the remainder of the year. The ship's first taste of combat came while she lay anchored at Ulithi on 20 November 1944. A Japanese midget submarine slipped into the anchorage area and torpedoed the oiler , which was anchored less than from Tombigbee. The tanker remained on the Guam- Ulithi \\"express\\" water supply run through January 1945. On 7 February, while she was steaming toward Guam, orders rerouted Tombigbee to Saipan. Subsequently removed to Tinian with a full load of water, she supplied water until 19 February, when she joined Task Group (TG) 50.9 and got underway for the Volcano Islands. At 09:24 six days later, Tombigbee was detached from the task group and entered the harbor at Iwo Jima. There, the water carrier lay-to and kept out of the line of fire of the supporting battleships, cruisers, and destroyers. Rough seas hampered her water-discharging operations, but the need for fresh water overrode considerations, such as the desire to avoid minor hull damages caused by the ships bumping and scraping each other in the tossing waves. After remaining in the Iwo Jima area until 9 March, the ship proceeded to Guam, where she reloaded her holds with more of her precious liquid cargo. Later in the month, Tombigbee joined the invasion force heading for the Ryūkyūs. On 1 April, Easter Sunday, the day broke cool and slightly overcast, with a calm sea; a perfect day for an amphibious operation. Tombigbee arrived off the beaches of Okinawa at 05:45 and steamed to a position on the eastern side of the island, close to the transport group. As she neared the anchorage, a Japanese kamikaze, its pilot intent on bigger game than the water carrier, flew past the tanker's starboard side and crashed into before that ship could unload her troops. The next day, Tombigbee shifted her anchorage to Hagushi on the western side of the island. During succeeding weeks, Tombigbees men saw numerous kamikazes crash into combat ships and auxiliaries. Meanwhile, they often remained at general quarters up to 20 hours a day while supplying water to landing craft and amphibious warfare ships. The ship made trips to Kerama Retto and reloads from fleet tankers that brought water from the Philippines. Tombigbee remained off Okinawa through the end of the war, and her historian noted that \\"the entire harbor went wild\\" when news arrived that Japan had accepted unconditional surrender terms. The tanker departed the Ryūkyūs on 21 September, bound for Japanese waters, and, two days later, arrived at Sasebo to participate in occupation operations. She twice returned to Okinawa for reloading. By November, Army and Navy doctors judged the water supply around Nagasaki as fit, and the tanker began replenishing her depleted tanks with local water to supply the ships still on duty in Japanese ports.  Operation Crossroads  Following this tour of duty, for which she received the Navy Occupation Service Medal, Tombigbee supported the ships participating in the atomic bomb testing (Operation Crossroads) in the Marshalls at Bikini Atoll, from 1 April to 5 September 1946. During the assignment, she made periodic trips to Eniwetok for replenishment of water. Four days after her arrival at Pearl Harbor on 14 September, the ship headed for the west coast for an overhaul which lasted into 1947. Upon her return to the western Pacific, she began conducting local operations in the Marshalls; at Eniwetok and Kwajalein, which continued from 13 January to 14 March. Then, following brief repairs at Pearl Harbor, Tombigbee was again deployed to the Far East. She operated out of Guam; Yokosuka, Japan; Pusan and Jinsen (Inchon), Korea; Tsingtao, China; Buckner Bay and Naha, Okinawa; as well as at Manila in the Philippine Islands. The tanker remained in the Far East until 1 August, when she departed Tsingtao, bound for Long Beach, California. After overhaul, the ship returned to the Orient and touched at familiar ports before heading for the west coast late in the summer of 1949 for inactivation. On 12 December 1949, Tombigbee was placed out of commission, in reserve, at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California.  Korean War  The North Korean invasion of South Korea, commencing on 25 June 1950, triggered the reactivation of many Navy ships, including Tombigbee. The gasoline tanker was recommissioned at Mare Island, California, on 28 July 1950 and was deployed to the Middle Pacific (MidPac) operating area where she served until near the end of hostilities in Korea. On 13 May 1953, she sailed for the northern Pacific and operated in that area until 22 December when she was transferred back to MidPac. On 27 March 1954 Tombigbee was part of the fuel supply network for aircraft and other support vehicles on Bikini, Eniwetok, & Kwajalein atoll during the AEC Nuclear weapons tests.  Cold War  The tanker conducted logistic support operations in the Pacific through 1964, taking part in various fleet operations. During the period from 1953 to 1964, the ship participated in Operation Rocky Shoals (22 October to 22 December 1958), Operation Twin Peaks (13-31 May 1959), Operation Blue Star (26 February to 6 April 1960), Operation Long Haul and Operation Pack Mule (8 September to 20 October 1960), Operation Green Light (10 May to 28 June 1961), and Operation Silver Sword (27 October to 6 November 1961), and her areas of operation ranged from Maui, Hawaii, to Yokosuka, Japan. She deployed to the Far East in the spring of 1962, conducting logistic support operations out of Subic Bay, Philippines, from 16 May to 8 June before proceeding to Yokosuka and technical availability. For the remainder of the year, the ship conducted local operations out of Pearl Harbor before departing the Hawaiian area on 18 December for Port Lyttelton, New Zealand, and participation in Operation Deep Freeze 1963. Following a port visit to Lyttelton from 5-9 January 1963, Tombigbee pressed on for the colder climes of McMurdo Sound and conducted operations in support of \\"Deep Freeze\\" from 18-22 January before returning - via Nelson, New Zealand and Sydney, Australia - to Pearl Harbor. After local operations out of Pearl, the tanker was deployed to the Marshalls for local petroleum-carrying operations through the late summer before returning once again to the Hawaiian Islands for local operations and technical availability at Pearl Harbor. Tombigbee continued her unglamorous but vital support duties in the Pacific. She was again deployed to the Marshalls - Kwajalein and Eniwetok - and also conducted local operations out of Pearl. Returning to the west coast in the spring, the tanker participated in Exercise \\"Pinetree\\" from 21-28 May 1964 before returning to Pearl Harbor. Two shuttle runs between Pearl Harbor and Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii; classified operations, and technical and restricted availability at Naval Station Pearl Harbor, occupied the ship through late October, before she was again deployed to the Philippines. While in the Far East, Tombigbee operated out of Subic Bay; Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Hong Kong; and Yokosuka before departing Japan on 7 June and arriving at Pearl Harbor on the 18th. She remained in Hawaiian waters for the rest of 1965.  Vietnam War  Upon completion of her regular overhaul at Pearl Harbor, Tombigbee conducted regular refresher training before departing Pearl on 21 February 1966 for passage to Subic Bay, where she made port on 12 March. Deploying to coastal waters off Vietnam, the tanker conducted two logistic support deployments, from 18 March to 6 June, and from 11 July to 28 August, before returning to Pearl Harbor for restricted availability, independent ship exercises, and operations as a submarine target reference vessel. Homeported at Pearl Harbor in 1967, Tombigbee began the new year with operations with Submarine Flotilla 5 and Destroyer Flotilla 5 on antisubmarine warfare exercises off Maui before she conducted exercises in anticipation of her second WestPac deployment. On 6 September, she departed Pearl Harbor, bound, via Guam and Subic Bay, for South Vietnam and arrived at Da Nang on 4 October. She conducted logistics support operations in the I Corps tactical zone from 4 October to 2 December, from 29 December 1967 to 26 January 1968, and from 25 February to 19 March. Availability at Subic Bay punctuated her tours in the combat zone. Following a return to Pearl Harbor for overhaul and independent ship exercises, Tombigbee was redeployed to WestPac. She arrived at Da Nang on 23 November for further operations in I Corps, supporting the Vietnamese counteroffensive operation. On 22 December, while engaged in these activities, she assisted LCU-1500 which encountered difficulties and was in danger of being swept ashore and foundering in heavy surf. Continuing under the operational command of Naval Support Activity, Danang, Tombigbee carried her support mission of supplying petroleum products for air and ground forces engaged in combat in I Corps through the middle of 1969. Following a routine return to Pearl Harbor for upkeep and availability, the tanker was again deployed off Vietnam with Service Squadron 5 through 1971, supporting Operation Market Time in the Vietnamese coastal waters, with periodic visits to such ports as Singapore; Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Hong Kong; Brisbane, Australia; and Subic Bay. She also conducted surveillance operations of Soviet warships operating in the vicinity of American forces in the South China Sea.  Decommissioning and sale  After returning to Pearl Harbor at the end of 1971, Tombigbee was placed in reduced operating status from 1 February 1972. From 31 May to 7 July, the ship underwent inactivation preparations; and, on the latter date, 7 July, the ship was decommissioned at Pearl Harbor and transferred to the Greek Navy. Hellenic Navy (1972-2003) Renamed Ariadni (A414) - after the mythical daughter of King Minos who helped Theseus to escape from the labyrinth - the ship served with the Hellenic Navy as a support tanker through 1979. Final Disposition: reported withdrawn from Greek naval service in 2003, fate unknown.  Military awards and honours  In U.S. service, Tombigbee was awarded two battle stars for World War II service: Iwo Jima operation, Okinawa Gunto operation. She was awarded 11 engagement stars for her service in the Vietnam War: Vietnamese Counteroffensive, Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase II, Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase III, Tet Counteroffensive, Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase VI, Tet69/Counteroffensive, Vietnam Winter-Spring 1970, Sanctuary Counteroffensive ,Consolidation I Her U.S. crew was eligible for the following medals: China Service Medal (extended), American Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (2), World War II Victory Medal, Navy Occupation Service Medal (with Asia clasp), National Defense Service Medal (2), Korean Service Medal, Antarctica Service Medal, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (3-Vietnam), Vietnam Service Medal (9), Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation (6), United Nations Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, Republic of Korea War Service Medal (retroactive)  References  * NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive - USS Tombigbee (AOG-11) Category:Patapsco-class gasoline tankers Category:Ships built in Savage, Minnesota Category:1943 ships Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Korean War auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Vietnam War auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Ships transferred from the United States Navy to the Hellenic Navy Category:Auxiliary ships of the Hellenic Navy ","title":"USS Tombigbee (AOG-11)"},{"id":"13070455","text":"Lennart Larsson (born 9 July 1953) is a Swedish former footballer who played as a midfielder.

Bastien teamed up with Lou Klein to form the Bastien Brothers tag team and, in 1960, won the United States Tag Team Championship from Eddie and Jerry Graham in April 1960. They won the title twice more, from the Grahams and then from the Fabulous Kangaroos (Roy Heffernan and Al Costello). Bastien went on to win several more tag team championships. Bastien was the frequent tag team partner of Billy Red Lyons. The duo unmasked wrestler Don Jardine in 1972. Bastien was the booker in Dallas, Texas. In 1964, Bastein appeared in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), and teamed briefly with champion Bruno Sammartino. He returned for one match in Madison Square Garden in June 1970 (his last appearance there), being pinned by Professor Tanaka but prior to that, putting on an amazing performance, dominating most of the match. He had a hot main event run in Florida in the late 1960s, including memorable bouts with Johnny Valentine. In his retirement, Bastien became a trainer and a promoter, and discovered future wrestlers Steve \\"Sting\\" Borden and Jim \\"The Ultimate Warrior\\" Hellwig at a Gold's Gym and convinced them to become professional wrestlers. Bastien and professional wrestling manager Rick Bassman formed an alliance of wrestlers called Powerteam USA, of which Borden and Hellwig were a part. The team debuted in November 1985, and after the other two members left the group, Borden and Hellwig continued to tag together. Personal life Bastien was good friends with fellow wrestler Roddy Piper and was the best man at his wedding. Bastien served as president of the Cauliflower Alley Club for six years from 2001 to 2007, but was reported in 2010 to be suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, his health progressively getting worse. Bastien died on August 11, 2012 at age 81.

First, the objective of a financial statement audit is to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to conclude on whether the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of a company and the results of its operations and cash flows. In developing that conclusion, the auditor evaluates whether audit evidence corroborates or contradicts financial statement assertions. Second, auditors are required to consider the risk of material misstatement through understanding the entity and its environment, including the entity's internal control. Financial statement assertions provide a framework to assess the risk of material misstatement in each significant account balance or class of transactions. Both United States and International auditing standards include guidance related to financial statement assertions, although the specific assertions differ. The PCAOB and the IFAC address this topic in AS 1105 (updated from AS 15 as of December 31, 2016) and ISA 315, respectively. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants identifies the following financial statement assertions: #Transactions and events #*Occurrence — the transactions recorded have actually taken place. #*Completeness — all transactions that should have been recorded have been recorded. #*Accuracy — the transactions were recorded at the appropriate amounts. #*Cutoff — the transactions have been recorded in the correct accounting period. #*Classification — the transactions have been recorded in the appropriate caption. #Accounts balances as of period end #*Existence — assets, liabilities and equity balances exist. #*Rights and Obligations — the entity legally controls rights to its assets and its liabilities faithfully represent its obligations. #*Completeness — all balances that should have been recorded have been recorded. #*Valuation and Allocation — balances that are included in the financial statements are appropriately valued and allocation adjustments are appropriately recorded. #Presentation and disclosure #*Occurrence — the transactions and disclosures have actually occurred. #*Rights and Obligations — the transactions and disclosures pertain to the entity. #*Completeness — all disclosures have been included in the financial statements. #*Classification — financial statements are clear and appropriately presented. #*Accuracy and Valuation — information is disclosed at the appropriate amounts.

Anti-cardiolipin antibodies (ACA) are antibodies often directed against cardiolipin and found in several diseases, including syphilis, antiphospholipid syndrome, livedoid vasculitis, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, Behçet's syndrome, idiopathic spontaneous abortion, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). They are a form of anti- mitochondrial antibody. In SLE, anti-DNA antibodies and anti-cardiolipin antibodies may be present individually or together; the two types of antibodies act independently. This is in contrast to rheumatoid arthritis with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) because anti-cardiolipin antibodies are present in both conditions, and therefore may tie the two conditions together. Anti-cardiolipin antibodies can be classified in two ways: * As IgM, IgG or IgA * As β2-glycoprotein dependent or independent ** In autoimmune disease, ACA are beta-2 glycoprotein dependent ** In syphilis, ACA are beta-2 glycoprotein independent and can be assayed using the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test Apolipoprotein H involvement β2-glycoprotein I has been identified as Apolipoprotein H and is required for the recognition of ACA in autoimmune disease.

History The second album followed 2002's HTP and the Live In Tokyo recording. Between the two releases both Hughes and Turner had issued solo albums, Hughes’ Songs In The Key Of Rock and Turner's JLT. HTP 2 follows similar musical territory to the debut; a retro hard rock sound infused with AOR and some funk, with vocal trade-offs between the two singers. JJ Marsh, Hughes’ regular guitarist features on the record and co-wrote many of the songs. Other musicians include Hughes’ keyboardist of the time Ed Roth and drummer Shane Gaalaas. There are special guest appearances from guitarists Steve Vai and Jeff Kollman and Red Hot Chili Peppers (now Hughes’ regular) drummer Chad Smith. Smith, Kollman and Roth later formed the all-instrumental group Chad Smith's Bombastic Meatbats, pulling in Kollman's former Edwin Dare bandmate, Kevin Chown, on bass. The Japanese version of the album includes a bonus track entitled Keep On Shining. JJ Marsh later recycled the instrumental middle part of \\"Lost Dreams\\" for his own song \\"The Change\\" on his solo album \\"Songs from Planet Marsh\\". After the subsequent tour for the album Hughes and Turner agreed to put their collaboration on a permanent hiatus, so this is, to date, the final Hughes Turner Project recording.

The Treaty of the Three Black Eagles, or Treaty of Berlin, was a secret treaty signed in September and December 1732 between the Austrian Empire, the Russian Empire and Prussia. It concerned the joint policy of the three powers regarding to the succession of the Polish throne in light of the expected death of King Augustus II of Poland (and Elector of Saxony from the House of Wettin) and the Polish custom of royal elections. It intended to exclude the candidacies of Augustus' son, Frederick Augustus, and of Stanislas Leszczynski, who had already been king of Poland from 1704 to 1709. However, in 1733, as Stanislas was about to be elected, Russia and Austria signed Löwenwolde's Treaty (on 19 August 1733) to support Frederick Augustus. Stanislas eventually had to leave Poland, and Frederick Augustus was elected as Augustus III of Poland. Name The usual name comes from the fact all three signatories used a black eagle as a state symbol,Cierlińska, Hanna (1982) A Panorama of Polish History Interpress Publishers, Warsaw, Poland, page 73, in contrast to the white eagle, a symbol of Poland. Another name is the Treaty of Berlin, where it was signed by Prussia (Russia and Austria had signed on 13 September 1732 and were joined by Prussia on 13 December). Terms The three powers agreed that they would oppose another candidate from the House of Wettin as well as the candidacy of the pro-French Pole Stanisław Leszczyński, the father-in-law of Louis XV.Corwin, Edward Henry Lewinski (1917) The political History of Poland Polish Book Importing Company, New York, page 286-288, Instead, they chose to support either Infante Manuel, Count of Ourém, brother of the Portuguese king,Tuttle, Herbert and Adams, Herbert Baxter (1883) History of Prussia.

None of the three parties seriously supported Infante Manuel.Schlosser, Friedrich Christoph (1844) History of the eighteenth century and of the nineteenth till the overthrow of the French empire: Volume III Chapman and Hall, London, page 294, The agreement had provisions for all three powers to agree that it was in their best interest that their common neighbour, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, did not undertake any reforms that might strengthen itMarácz, László Károly (1999) Expanding European unity: Central and Eastern Europe Rodopi, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, page 134, and for its elected monarch to be friendly towards them. In addition to the obvious, increasing the influence of the three powers over the Commonwealth, Austria and Russia also discreetly wanted to reduce the possibility of a French-Prussian-Saxon alliance. Prussia received promises of support for its interests in Courland (now southern and western Latvia). Löwenwolde's Treaty The political situation changed rapidly, and the Treaty of the Three Black Eagles was superseded soon after it had been formulated. With the death of Augustus II on 1 February 1733, Austria and Russia distanced themselves from the earlier treaty, which was never ratified by the Empress of Russia. Their primary goal, the disruption of the French-Saxon-Prussian alliance, had already been achieved and so they sought to secure support from various Polish and Saxon factions. Thus, on 19 August 1733, Russia and Austria entered into the Löwenwolde's Treaty with Saxony in the person of the new elector, Frederick Augustus II of Saxony. The treaty was named after one of the chief diplomats involved in the negotiations, the Russian Karl Gustav von Löwenwolde. The terms of Löwenwolde's Treaty were straightforward. Russia would provide troops to ensure Frederick Augustus's election and coronation, and Frederick Augustus would, as the Polish king, recognise Anna Ivanovna as Empress of Russia, relinquish Polish claims to Livonia and remain unopposed to Russian interestsThat effectivity meant supporting the rule of Ernest Biron, a Russian court favourite.

However, the election sejm in Wola went ahead and picked Leszczyński on 12 September 1733, which was announced by the interrex, Primate Potocki.William Macpherson indicated that Leszczyński's election was caused partly by French gold.

The interference of various foreign powers into the Polish election led to the War of the Polish Succession (1733–1738), between Augustus III, with his foreign allies Austria and Russia, against the supporters of Leszczyński, allied with France. Prussia reluctantly sent 10,000 troops. In the Treaty of Vienna of 1738, which formally ended the war, Leszczyński renounced his claim to the Polish throneStanisłas Leszczyński renounced the throne 'voluntarily and for the sake of peace', which implied that his election had been legal.

It is a private and co-educational school. History The school was established in 1983 during the term of Hon. Eufrasio Mascarinas as mayor of the town. Bohol's prominent educators together with the local government unit had joined hands to build a community college for local residents who are economically challenged to send their children to big cities to obtain college education. During that time, Tagbilaran City was the only nearest place that offers college education and only few are capable of sending their children to Cebu and Manila for higher education. It is through the efforts of then Sangguniang Bayan secretary, Cesar Mascarinas, parish priest Msgr. Camilo V. Auza and an educator Fr. Josemaria S. Luengo, Ph.D., that drafted the idea of funding a college into a reality. Finally, Resolution no. 78 (series of 1983) of the town council was passed for this act. The first set of the Members of the Board of Trustees and Incorporators of the school were: *Rev. Fr. Josemaria S. Luengo, Ph.D. *Lourdes H. Torrefranca, Ph.D. *Most Rev. Felix S. Zafra, D.D. *Benjamin L. Mejorada, Ph.D. *Msgr. Camilo V. Auza, H.P. *Rose P. Alfafara, O.D. *Mariano M. Lerin, Ph.D.; CPA *Cesar C. Mascarinas, M.A. Unfortunately, because of a memorandum prohibiting the opening of new collegiate institutions, the secretary of Education and the director of Private Schools at the time junked the school's application for permit to operate. However, Mr. Gulayan, a local boatman and a long-time friend of President Ferdinand Marcos during the Japanese occupation, became an effective catalyst for the approval after seeing Marcos at the Malacañang Palace.

Alfonso de Ceballos-Escalera y Gila (born March 4, 1957 in Madrid) is a Spanish aristocrat, who holds the title of Marqués de la Floresta & Viscount of Ayala in the Kingdom of Spain and Duke of Ostuni of the former Kingdom of the Two-Sicilies (Italy). Arms of Marquisate of the Floresta. A lawyer and historian, the Marquess de la Floresta & Viscount of Ayala is the Chronicler of Arms for the Autonomous Community of Castille & Leon. He also claims the title of Duke of Ostuni (in the Two Sicilies).Cf. Don Alfonso Ceballos- Escalera y Gila, Certificación de Armas de Seňor Don Eduardo P. Brillantes y Balderas Madrid, Segovia 2006. The Marquess is author of many books on jurisprudence, history, royalty, nobility, heraldry and genealogy. He is a retired Lieutenant-Commander (OF-3) of the Spanish Navy and holds the rank of Captain in the Merchant Marine Fleet. He has also been awarded a doctorate in Law, a doctorate in Political Science and a doctorate in History as well as receiving many orders of knighthood. King of Arms of Spain The heraldic office of Spanish King of Arms dates back to the 14th century. Historically heralds were accorded titles of office after Iberian provinces or major cities, whilst the Reyes de Armas represented Spanish kingdoms. Accordingly, chroniclers of arms were variously named for España, Castilla, León, Frechas, Sevilla, Córdoba, Murcia, Granada (created in 1496 to honour the reunification of Spain), Bethune, Estella, Viana, Libertat, Blanc Lévrier, Bonne Foy, Las, Gounzcuant, Lamas, Navarra, Cataluña, Sicilia, Aragón, Nápoles, Toledo, Valencia and Mallorca. Such appointments were for life (ad vitam) and at least fifteen Spanish families produced more than one herald over the past five hundred years. His role as King of Arms combines that of formally registering pedigrees and the granting of new armorial bearings. In the past the nature of continuous border conflict between the Moorish and Christian kingdoms of medieval Iberia Peninsula helped to create a sense of ethnic identity, or limpieza de sangre, and heraldry was a significant outlet for expressing national identity; attempts from time to time were made to make arms distinctive of class as well as ethnicity, and the Spanish kings restricted arms to members of the nobility by virtue of Law 64 of the 1583 Cortes de Tudela and was again reiterated by Law 13 of the 1642 Cortes. After 1915 Cronistas Reyes de Armas were appointed by the Spanish Ministry of Justice on behalf of the Crown, and have authority to grant armorial bearings to subjects of the Spanish Crown and others as well as being tasked with approving the genealogies of claimants to noble titles. As Cronista de Armas de Castilla y León, nominated by Decree of the Junta de Castilla y León, the 9 of May 1991, published in the Official Bulletin, ranked as Director General (High level State Officer), the marquess continues this tradition being mandated to grant arms and verify family pedigrees.Decreto 105/1991, 9 May (Boletín Oficial de Castilla y León de 16 May 1991).

Colin's best friend, Zippy, advises him that if he does nothing, he will one day look back with regret, so he resolves to travel to Blackpool and tell his wife that he loves her. Leaving the newsagent in the hands of his regular customers, he starts travelling. His first stop-off is at a motorway cafe, where he tries to strike up a conversation with a waitress, but his clumsy attempts at small talk are ignored. In the evening, he heads into a biker pub. He chats with landlord, Ron, and his barmaid, Mandy. He also talks to one of the bikers, Ian, who challenges him to a game of darts. Colin then joins Ian and his girlfriend for a few drinks in the makeshift campsite at the back of the pub, and Ian persuades Colin to allow him to cut his hair. Colin attends a performance at the pub by English folk singer Kate Rusby. Colin spends the rest of the evening entertaining his new friends with darts stories of his hero, Eric Bristow, and toothbrush juggling around the campfire. When he wakes the next day, all his new friends are gone. Taking a break to stretch his legs he meets an eco-warrior chained to a tree, and shares a cheese sandwich. Later he happens on a group of girl guides and spends a few hours in their company. He has a heart to heart with the guide leader, Sonja, explaining how he gave his wife everything she ever wanted, yet it was not enough. He heads up a highway, pulling in at a fork in the road. He climbs off his bike to check the map, and his moped is crushed under the wheels of a speeding lorry. While walking along the road, he is passed by Ron, who is taking Mandy to Blackpool for a dirty weekend. She brought her daughter along with her, seeing this weekend as more of an opportunity to get away with her kid. In Blackpool, Ron asks Colin to return the favour of the lift by taking the kid out of the way for a few hours. Ron chats up the hotel receptionist, so Colin takes Mandy and her daughter if for a stroll. The three of them have fun at a fair. Come evening, Colin says he needs to go find his friends. As he is walking around the town, he sees his wife. Colin runs in the opposite direction and spends the night on a sea front bench. The next day he goes to the darts finals. He finds Geoff having an argument with the opposing team, which deteriorates into a brawl. He asks Sandra if she would mind stepping out for a chat, and despite Geoff trying to stop her, she agrees. She tearfully confesses her regret and that she no longer wants to be involved with Geoff. She realizes that she has been very stupid, and is looking for forgiveness. Colin tells her that he loves her more than anyone else in the whole world, but that he does not want to go back to his old life. He has experienced some of the wider world, and wants to continue on the road to see what is around the next corner. He offers her the newsagent and wishes her goodbye. Colin walks past a cafe and nods a hello to his hero, Eric Bristow, who nods in return. Colin gets a new moped, and gets back on the road. Mandy and her daughter wave at Colin from a bus.

Career  Sjöberg played much of his career with Malmö FF in Allsvenskan during the 1970s. Already during his first season for Malmö FF, the club, much to his goal scoring capacity won the top Swedish football league, Allsvenskan in 1974, under English manager Bob Houghton. This was repeated the following season. When he then left for Karlsruher SC in the Bundesliga during the 1976-77 season, his former Swedish club only came second in Allsvenskan, behind Halmstad BK, which were led by another Englishman, Roy Hodgson. As Sjöberg returned to Malmö FF they won Allsvenskan again! So during four years, Malmö FF won Allsvenskan at three occasions, in which Sjöberg participated during the three \\"golden years\\" only. After scoring a goal for Sweden in the 1978 World Cup in Argentina against Brazil, the well bearded Sjöberg become interesting for an Arabian Sheik, who bought him for a club in Saudi Arabia. This became a rather short adventure for him, and likewise a shorter time in the old North American NASL league (not to be confused with current Major League Soccer) and a club from Chicago followed. This time he was absent from Malmö FF for less than 12 months. However he missed an indeed very important season for Malmö FF, and didn't participate in the club's most well known international achievement so far (also by summer of 2014), to reach the final of the European Cup in 1978-79 season. (which though was lost to Nottingham Forest by a single decider). He did though return to Malmö FF for a third time and for some more seasons. He ended his career in Lunds BK. Sjöberg was capped 45 times for the Sweden national football team and scored a goal against Brazil in the 1978 FIFA World Cup. With Malmö FF he won Allsvenskan and became Swedish Champion in 1974, 1975 and 1977. He coached BSC Young Boys with Roland Andersson.

Lagoa da Conceição combines beaches, dunes, hills, and the biggest lagoon on the island. With such diversity, it has become the most well-known tourist spot in Florianopolis. The area has a small town center with a medical clinic, post office, pharmacies, supermarkets, boutique stores and specialty shops. The town gets particularly crowded during the Brazilian summer vacation, i.e. the months of January and February. Lifestyle Many expats and Brazilian people from other cities choose to live by the lagoon because of its stunning views, safety, nature and quality of life. Most people living around the lagoon choose to move here for a life more connected to the nature, to practice sports, Yoga, to eat healthy. Most people believe in a harmonious life and are very relaxed. The little town is full of vegetarian restaurants, organic food, gyms and spas. Highest safety standards in South America allow people to walk around day and night, hitchhike, commute by bicycle and have eco friendly everyday life. The History of the region around the lagoon is a plus with all the folklore, netting tradition, old Portuguese architecture, graffiti, and a charming 18th century church on the top of the hill. The Holy Spirit Feast (Festa do Divino) is a festival that takes place 40 days after Easter. The celebration dates to the colonial era and includes a parade, music, and street food. Hipsters Market Every Saturday and Sunday there is a Market on the main square in front of the little bridge with art crafts, vintage items, vinyl discs, organic food, local honey. For those who are after traditional bobbin laces, there are some street-side vendors where towels, curtains, and even dresses may be found. They're handmade items, not only in lace, but also crochet and woven. On Sundays there is the Feirate, or Art Fair in the Bento Silveiro square, with over 80 craftsmen. Anything, from educational wooden toys to tapestries may be found here. During the off season the fair goes from 10 am to 6 pm, during the high season, from 5 pm to midnight. Sports With a water temperature that averages 27 °C during summer, shallow water and an absence of waves make the lake a calm place for kids and family groups. Halfway down Rendeiras Avenue, on the edge of the lagoon, two sand courts guarantee an ideal spot for playing volleyball and foot volleyball. You can also have fun there at night as the area is lighted for night-time sports. There are also several boat rides for remarkably low prices. The boats usually leave from the end of Rendeiras Avenue. You can also rent kayaks and pedal boats there, as well as take windsurfing, kite surfing, and canoeing lessons. Accommodation There are several establishments, mostly bed-and-breakfast hotels and worldwide famous hostels. The Lagoon put Florianópolis among the top destinations for backpackers and foreign travelers in South America. The best rated hostels of Brazil are located here. Although the area is very famous, most travelers stay in small hostels or guesthouses to enjoy the local atmosphere. The advantage of staying by the lagoon is the easy access to many parts of the island. For those who come without a car and who don't intend to rent one, Lagoa da Conceição is a very well supplied neighborhood in regards to public transportation, including buses and boats. Local people are also very friendly and always offer rides to visitors. Nightlife The large variety of bars makes Lagoa nightlife the most popular destination in Florianópolis. The fun starts early at the many cafés in the small center, which tend to get packed at the end of the afternoon, especially in the summer. Some of the finest restaurants in town are located in Lagoa. The menus vary: there is typical local seafood to pizza, through Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, Old Azorean cuisine and sandwiches. The food truck parking lot is a meeting point for hipster from all over the world. There are also calm places with live music, alternative bands, nightclubs, bars with dance floors or open air bars. In high season the large number of people enjoying these attractions result in traffic jams from the Lagoa hill to the end of Rendeiras Avenue, but you can also walk everywhere as distances are short and the place is known for its Zero Violence statistic. The Lagoa da Conceição district also includes beaches, namely Praia Mole and Joaquina, both of which have hosted major international professional surf tour events. Windsurfing, sailing, kayaking, kite surfing and jetskiing are very popular activities on the lake and at the adjacent beaches there are always surfers in the water regardless of the temperature. The dunes between Lagoa da Conceição and Joaquina are where sandboarding was born. The hills around the lagoon afford a perfect lift off for hangliders and paragliders. There are also several trails for ecological hikes and biking.

History  Nodo Jiman (\\"Proud of my voice\\") features amateur singers who live in the locality where the competition is held. The first competition was held on the radio in 1946, just after the end of World War II. It has been featured in two Japanese movies. Nodo Jiman celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2015. Boy band SMAP became an integral part of the celebrations, making guest appearances throughout the year. Band member Shingo Katori served as a \\"special MC\\" alongside regular presenter Sen Odagiri on the 12 April broadcast.http://www.nhk.or.jp/nodojiman-blog/900/213995.html  Overview   Regular Show  Each week Nodo Jiman is broadcast from a different city in one of Japan's 47 prefectures; at the beginning of the show the host would announce the local venue in which the live broadcast is held, then describe the landmarks and culture of the prefecture and city hosting the broadcast. 20 contestants - each of them a solo singer, a duet, or a group of three or more - perform in each week's competition. After being introduced by the host (usually by stating his or her occupation), each contestant states his or her participation number and the name of the song he or she is performing, then has about one minute to perform. At the end of the minute, a certain number of bells are rung to rate the performance. One or two bells means the contestant sang poorly and is eliminated, while a melody of eleven bells means the contestant sang well enough and has passed. Two special guests - well-known artists in the Japanese recording industry - appear during each broadcast. They interact with the contestants and give feedback on their performances. After all the contestants have performed, each guest performs one of his or her best songs. Near the end of the broadcast, one of the guests presents a to one of the eliminated contestants whose performance was thought to be memorable or interesting. Finally, all of the contestants who have passed are called to center stage, and the most outstanding of these is declared .  Annual Championship  Every year, early March, about 15 of the best \\"Champions\\" performances the year before perform again, this time at NHK Hall, to define who will be the \\"Grand Champion\\" of the year.

It is found in the skin of poison frogs from the genera Dendrobates, Epipedobates, Minyobates, and Phyllobates and toads from the genus Melanophryniscus. Its name comes from the pumiliotoxin family (PTXs) and its molecular mass of 251 Daltons. When the toxin enters the bloodstream through cuts in the skin or by ingestion, it can cause hyperactivity, convulsions, cardiac arrest and ultimately death. It is especially toxic to arthropods (e.g. mosquitoes), even at low (naturally occurring) concentrations.  Chemical properties   Structure  The chiral centers in pumiliotoxin 251D can give several stereoisomers of the compound. Only one form of the toxin is present in nature and has toxic properties. Image:PTX (+) and (-).jpg Two enantiomers of pumiliotoxin 251D. On the left the plus enantiomer is shown which is toxic. On the right side the minus enantiomer, which is not toxic, is shown. The side chain conformation of substituents at the C-2’ position plays an important role in the toxicity of the compound.  Synthesis  The synthesis of pumiliotoxin 251D is quite complex and contains multiple steps. One of the starting materials of the synthesis include the N-Boc derivative of L-proline methyl ester (1). Then, a Wittig type of reaction followed by dehydration with thionyl chloride and pyridine results in alkene 2. When alkene 2 undergoes epoxidation with m-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA), epoxide 3 is formed. This then reacts with the lithium salt of dibromoalkene (6) to afford compound 7. Deprotection of compound 7 followed by cyclization and iodination results in vinyl iodide 8. After purification, this yields the hydrochloride of pumiliotoxin (+)-251D (9). Pumiliotoxin (−)-251D can be synthesized in a similar way with minor alterations to the overall synthesis.  Accumulation  Like many other frog poisons, pumiliotoxin 251D originates from arthropods. The frogs have a diet of insects that could contain the toxin then it is accumulated in secretory granular glands of the skin of the frog. Some frog species of the Dendrobates genera can convert pumiliotoxin 251D in allopumiliotoxin 267A which is five times more toxic than pumiliotoxin 251D. Only one of the enantiomers can be hydroxylated to this more potent form of the toxin. The lack of pumiliotoxin 251D in eggs and tadpoles confirms that the toxin is not passed over from adult frogs to their offspring. The tadpoles are therefore not readily protected from predators.  Toxicity   Mechanism of action  In general, pumiliotoxins are known as positive modulators of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs, membrane proteins). Pumiliotoxin 251D is not such a poison. However, it does block the influx of Na+ ions in mammalian VGSCs. Pumiliotoxin 251D is able to shift the V1/2. This is the potential at which the sodium open probability is half maximal. Both the steady-state activation and inactivation curves of each mammalian VGSCs are shifted to a more negative potential. PTX 251D shifts the V1/2 of insect VGSCs even further than the mammalian VSGCs. This explains why it is especially toxic to insects, like mosquitoes. Furthermore, the presence of PTX 251D results in a six time higher permeability of the VGSCs for K+ ions. This severely disturbs the delicate sodium-potassium equilibrium in the nerve system. The effect of pumiliotoxin 251D on the voltage-gated potassium channels (VGPCs) currents is quite small. The toxic has an effect on the deactivation kinetics of the potassium channel. It inhibits its inactivation. This effect is still under investigation. PTX 251D also completely inhibits the activity of Ca2+-stimulated ATPase. This results in a decreased reuptake of Ca2+ and thus a high concentration of free Ca2+ in the organism. This may be related to the potentiation and prolongation of muscle twitch caused by the inhibition. The mechanism of biotransformation of PTX 251D is still unknown.  Effects  Pumiliotoxin is a toxin found in poison dart frogs (genus Dendrobates and Phyllobates). It affects the calcium channels, interfering with muscle contraction in the heart and skeletal muscle. PTX 251D has several effects. It rapidly induces convulsions and death to mice and insects (LD50 being, respectively, 10 mg/kg and 150 ng/larvae). These convulsions are the result of the uncontrollable distortion of the sodium-potassium equilibrium in the neurons. This is caused by the inhibition of the VGSCs. It also acts as cardiac depressor, causing cardiac arrest. This can be explained by its negative effect on the cardiac VGSC hNav1.5/β1. Although nothing is known of how well PTX 251D penetrates into the brain where convulsions are originated, the observation of convulsions can be explained through inhibition of VGPCs.  Treatment  Symptomatic treatment of PTX 251D poisoning include reducing the convulsions using carbamazepine. This drug targets the affected VGSCs. Phenobarbital also shows positive effects by interacting with the affected Ca2+ channels. Ineffective drugs include diazepam and dizocilpine.

The short was released on November 6, 1948 and features Elmer Fudd and Sylvester. Plot The cartoon begins with Sylvester in an alley, strolling past the line of trash cans as if he is at a buffet, trying to find bits of appetizing food; a kitten arrives and starts doing the same, Sylvester yells at him that \\"this side of the street\\" is his and throws the kitten away. The weather is freezing and snowy; Sylvester finds a house and bangs on the door, begging for shelter. He falls down, 'frozen', when Elmer Fudd answers the door. Elmer sits Sylvester in a comfortable chair near the fireplace and tells the cat to consider this his home. More banging on the door is revealed to be the kitten, who also falls down 'frozen' when Elmer opens the door. Elmer tells them both that he would like to have a cat around, but he cannot keep both of them. He decides to sleep on it and, much to Sylvester's chagrin, choose in the morning which one gets to stay. Sylvester then imagines ways to get rid of his competition; he decides to frame the kitten by pouring all the milk in the fridge on him and then dropping the bottle, making it look like the kitten did it. Elmer thinks the kitten has done it by accident because he must be very hungry, and doles out a large meal to him. Next, the kitten plays with a ball of string, but Sylvester has tied the end to a stack of glasses and dishes. Soon, the kitten pulls enough on the string that the entire stack falls and breaks. The kitten quickly tries to glue them back together, but Sylvester breaks every one that is fixed. Elmer catches Sylvester breaking his dishes, and tells the cat that he is making it very easy for him to make up his mind which of them to keep. Sylvester hypnotizes the kitten, leads him to Elmer's bedroom, provides the kitten with a baseball bat and instructs him to hit the sleeping Elmer on the head; the kitten misinterprets Sylvester's visual instruction and hits Sylvester instead, causing the dazed cat to climb into bed with Elmer. Elmer wakes up, throws Sylvester down the stairs and warns him he will be held responsible for the next disturbance. Sylvester sets a wind-up mouse toy loose and the kitten chases it, following it into a mouse hole. Sylvester nails a piece of wood to the mouse hole. From behind the walls, however, the kitten starts knocking out the nails holding up paintings and shelves hanging on walls. Sylvester, remembering Elmer's warning, tries to catch all of the falling objects as the kitten (still trapped in the walls) makes his way upstairs. The chandelier above Elmer's bed crashes to the floor before Sylvester can stop it. Elmer, awakened again, issues a final ultimatum. If Sylvester so much as makes one more peep, he is out of the house for good. The kitten, having overheard, takes advantage and starts making a huge racket. Sylvester places a pair of earmuffs on the sleeping Elmer, in an attempt to drown out the kitten's noise (which involves a shotgun, a parade drum, and a slamming door). Sylvester literally blows his top and begins chasing the kitten; panicking, the kitten turns the radio on full-blast, activates the coin-operated pianola and proceeds to make noise in a variety of other ways. The earmuffs fail, and Elmer runs down the stairs yelling that he has \\"made up [his] mind who's weaving these pwemises!\\"; however, he is interrupted by a knock at the door—Elmer's landlord serves him an eviction notice, presumably due to the excess noise {\\"In other words GET OUT!\\"}. The cartoon ends with Sylvester, the kitten, and Elmer looking for food in the trash alley.

He first appeared in JLA #62 and was created by Joe Kelly and Doug Mahnke. Fictional character biography Rama Khan's earliest appearance is 1,004 BC, with no information given about his exact birth date. In the land of Atlantis, he became the joint ruler of Atlantis, sharing the post with Gamemnae. Khan had earlier journeyed to Atlantis from the faraway land of Jarhanpur to assemble a group of heroes to protect the realm. Later on, in the 21st century, Rama Khan reappeared in Jarhanpur as its elemental defender. When he kidnapped a boy and separated him from his mother because the child was his spiritual successor, Khan found himself in conflict with the Justice League.JLA #62 (March 2002) He broke Wonder Woman's lasso of truth, resulting in reality unravelling as the nature of existence began to be defined by belief rather than truth; the Earth was the center of the universe for two weeks before anybody noticed, it became flat for a few hours,JLA #63 (April 2002) and the Moon was even made of cheese at one point. Although Jarhanpur's nature as living land protected it from this chaos,JLA #64 (May 2002) the League, resolved to stop this before the world became defined by the beliefs of every individual person on the planet, confronted Rama Khan once again, during which Wonder Woman accepted why the Lasso had broken; when she'd confirmed that Rama Khan was telling the truth about the need for a successor to his position, her denial of this truth had caused the lasso to break and cause a subsequent breakdown of the rules of truth. With this self-discovery, Jarhanpur helped Diana to repair the Lasso, restoring reality and undoing the initial damage. As an aftereffect of this restoration, the land rejected Rama Khan; he was now focused more on preserving his position than respecting the wishes of the land, which wished to help Diana and her teammates rescue its people. Powers and abilities Rama Khan's abilities are largely based on his birthplace, Jarhanpur. With the aid of magic, Rama Khan can turn a handful of its soil into fire, granite, or wine. Khan is also super strong, immortal, and is a great magician. In other media Rama Khan makes his live-action debut in the fifth season of Supergirl, portrayed by Mitch Pileggi. He first appears in the episode \\"Tremors\\" where he is depicted as a high-ranking Leviathan member with superhuman powers of seismic and earthen-materials manipulation, including kinetic control of kryptonite, who comes to Earth from Krypton's sister planet Jarhanpur during the Age of Dinosaurs. According to the series, Rama Khan is responsible for a number of cataclysmic events, such as the biblical flood, the Destruction of Pompeii, the 526 Antioch earthquake, the Yellow River Flood, and the 1970 Bhola cyclone.

The compounds of the pumiliotoxin-A class are primarily found in the skins of frogs, toads, and other amphibians and are used as a chemical defense mechanism to ward off predators, microorganisms, and ectoparasites. The compounds were originally discovered in neotropical dendrobatid frogs, but are also found in the mantellid frogs of Madagascar, myobatrachid frogs of Australia, and bufonid toad of South America.Saporito, R. A.; Garraffo, H. M.; Donnelly, M. A.; Edwards, A.L.; Longino, J. T.; Daly, J. W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004, 101, 8045-8050. Frogs possessing this defense mechanism have aposematic coloring.Jain, P.; Garraffo, H. M.; Spande, T. F.; Yeh, H. J. C.; Daly, J. W. J. Nat. Prod. 1995, 58, 100-104.  Biological activity  The poison-dart frog family Dendrobatidae has yielded many different alkaloids categorized into several different classes, almost all of which have shown high pharmacological activity on muscle and nerve cells.Aoyagi, S.; Wang, T. C.; Kibayashi, C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115, 11393-11409. The pumiliotoxin-A class, specifically, contains many molecules which have had a favorable effect on the heart. Allopumiliotoxins, the most complex member of this class, have a wide range of biological activities, the full understanding of which has not been fully discerned due their incredible complexity and subsequent synthetic difficulties. Among allopumiliotoxins, those with a β-oriented C-7 hydroxyl group have shown greater activity in comparison to α-epimers of this position. Allopumiliotoxin 339A has been shown to stimulate sodium influx and phosphoinositide breakdown in the cerebral cortical synaptoneurosomes of guinea pigs and is one of the most active allopumiliotoxins. It is more biologically active than pumiliotoxin B, which has had similar biological effects on the secondary messenger system, causing muscle rigidity and some favorable effects on the heart.Overman, L. E.; Robinson, L. A.; Zablocki, J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 368-369. Pumiliotoxins and allopumiliotoxins are very toxic in general.Saporito, R. A.; Donnelly, M. A.; Jain, P.; Garraffo, H. M.; Spande, T. F.; Daly, J. W. Toxicon 2007, 50, 757-778. Pumiliotoxin B has caused death in mice when 20 μg was given in injections below the skinFranklin, A. S.; Overman, L. E. Chem. Rev. 1996, 96, 502-522.  Nomenclature  There are three divisions within the pumiliotoxin-A class: allopumiliotoxins, pumiliotoxins, and homopumiliotoxins. Once the compound’s specific class is determined, it’s given a number based on its molecular weight. These biologically active compounds are complex and have structural variations that allow for specific molecular recognition. Therefore, the way 2 isomers are differentiated is by a letter after the number. Therefore, for example, allopumiliotoxin 339A is an allopumiliotoxin with a molecular weight of 339 g/mol but there are other isomers with the same molecular weight. Allopumiliotoxin 339A has an axially oriented hydroxyl group at the 7-position in the indolizidine nucleus that differentiates it from allopumiliotoxin 339B. A (+) or (-) sign preceding the name of an allopumiliotoxin refers to the compound’s optical activity. Compounds that rotate a plane of polarized light clockwise are referred to as dextrorotatory and are preceded by a (+) sign. Compounds that rotate a plane of polarized light counterclockwise are referred to as levorotatory and are preceded by a (-) sign.Bruice, P. Y. Organic Chemistry; Pearson Prentice Hall: Upper Saddle River, NJ, 2007; pp 212-213.  Structure  The different divisions of compounds in the pumiliotoxin-A class arise from differences in the carbon backbone and/or the substituents attached to it. The difference between allopumiliotoxins and pumiliotoxins occurs at the 7 position. At this position, allopumiliotoxins have a hydroxyl substituent whereas pumiliotoxins have a hydrogen. Both have methyl and hydroxyl groups at the C-8 position. Homopumiliotoxins contain a quinolizidine ring in the place of the indolizidine ring and methyl and hydroxyl groups at its C-9 position. All three contain an alkylidenyl side-chain. General Structures  Isolation  As stated previously, these alkaloids were first discovered in the skins of frogs. They can be isolated from the frog’s skin by mincing the skin and extracting the compounds by trituration. A series of extractions involving an acid-base extraction are needed to isolate the allopumiliotoxins. The skins of the frogs may contain a number of different allopumiliotoxins. For example, the skin of Dendrobates tricolor was found to contain alkaloids 251D, 271, 341A, and 323B.Daly, J. W.; Tokuyama, T.; Fujiwara, T.; Highet, R. J.; Karle, I. L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980, 102, 830-836. Also, different frogs contain different alkaloids in their skin. Dendrobates auratus, for example, was found to contain (+)-allopumiliotoxin 339A (a compound not present in the skin of Dendrobates tricolor).Aoyagi, S.; Wang, T. C.; Kibayashi, C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 10653-10654.  Synthesis  Allopumiliotoxins are very biologically useful but are rare in nature. For this reason, many groups have researched syntheses for various alkaloids of this type. The main problem with allopumiliotoxin synthesis arises from the alkylidene side chain because the stereochemistry of it can be difficult to control by Wittig-type functionalizations. Total synthesis of (+)-allopumiliotoxin 267A was achieved using a chiral dihydropyridone intermediate that was formed from the addition of ethyl lithiopropiolate to the N-acylpyridinium salt which results from the reaction of (+)-trans-2-(α-cumyl)cyclohexyl chloroformate and 4-methoxy-3-methyl-5(triisopropylsilyl)pyridine. This intermediate was then subjected to various additions and oxidations to yield the final allopumiliotoxin. The synthesis of (+)-allopumiliotoxin 323B’ has also been achieved using an intermediate from the previous synthesis.Michael, J. P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002, 19, 719-741. (+)-Allopumiliotoxin 339A has been synthesized using an iodide-promoted iminium ion alkyne cyclization followed by condensation with acetylenic salt. Subsequent reactions led to the enantiopure product after 16 steps and a 7.5% yield. Other synthetic methods have been carried out for this molecule. One of which was achieved through the use of a Nozaki-Kishi Cyclization. Allopumiliotoxin 267A was synthesized using a similar cyclization.  Analysis  The pumiliotoxin-A class compounds are typically analyzed by GC-MS because the different classes show different prominent peaks. Allopumiliotoxins show corresponding ions of C4H8N+(m/z 70) and C10H16NO2+(m/z 182). The mass spectra of pumiliotoxins show prominent ions of C4H8N+ (m/z 70) and C10H16NO+ (m/z 166).

The Mosler Safe Company was a manufacturer of security equipment—most notably safes and bank vaults—from 1874 until its bankruptcy in 2001. Founded in Cincinnati by Gustave Mosler and Fred Bahmann as Mosler, Bahmann & Company in 1867. In 1874 after Gustave's death, the Mosler family had a falling out with Mr. Bahmann, leaving Mosler, Bahmann & Company to start the Mosler Safe & Lock Company. Both companies remained in Cincinnati until the 1890s. When Mosler Safe & Lock Co. outgrew its original factory it relocated to Hamilton in 1891, where it remained until its 2001 bankruptcy. Mosler, Bahmann & Company remained in business until around 1898. Its safes and vaults were renowned for their strength and precision manufacture: several Mosler vaults installed in Hiroshima's Mitsui Bank building prior to WWII survived the nuclear attack, a fact the company widely publicized in its marketing. When the US government began building bunkers and silos during the Cold War, Mosler became the de facto gold standard contractor for blast doors. Mosler built the vault formerly used to display and store the United States Constitution and Declaration of Independence. One example, installed at the Atomic Energy Commission's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, weighed approximately 138 tons including the frame. Despite the weight (\\"the largest and heaviest hinged shielding doors in the world\\"), each 58-ton blade could be opened and closed manually by one person. Mosler also built the gold vaults for the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox. Mosler was controlled by its founding family until 1967, when they sold it to American Standard Companies. American Standard then sold the division to a group of Mosler managers and outside investors in 1986. After 134 years in business, Mosler filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August 2001, citing continuing debt problems, and ceased operations shortly thereafter. Diebold subsequently announced programs to support former Mosler customers and ended up buying much of the former company in bankruptcy court a few months later. The Mosler name carries on to this day in Canada as Chubb-Mosler and Taylor Safes Ltd., the outcome of a 1950s merger of Mosler's Canadian operations with those of Chubb Security, followed by the acquisition of Taylor Safes of Canada in the following decade.

He was an innovator in legal education, setting up courses on labour law, as well as demanding and orientating his students to do internships in trade unions, in regional work inspection stations, in the National Institute of Social Insurance (Brazil) or in human resources departments of private and public companies. He also stimulated his students to write monographs on theoretical and legal topics for magazines, periodicals and other publications, under their own names or as collaborators. He founded the Brazilian Partido Democrata Cristão (Christian Democrat Party) in July 1945. Later he abandoned this idea and regretted his involvement in politics. He established in São Paulo, in 1954, the first World Congress of Labour Law (ILO). As the first professor of Labour Law in Brazil, he was inherently the founder of the Social Law (today's Labour Law) Department at the University of São Paulo in 1938.

Known as Big Pool Road, the state highway runs from Interstate 70 (I-70) in Big Pool east to MD 68 near Pinesburg in western Washington County. MD 56, which features a pair of one-lane bridges, provides access to Fort Frederick State Park and the eastern trailhead of the Western Maryland Rail Trail. The state highway was first constructed in the mid 1910s from what is now U.S. Route 40 (US 40) south to Big Pool. The highway was extended east toward the village of Big Spring in the early 1930s and to MD 68 in the late 1950s. MD 56 was truncated at I-70 in the mid-1990s. Route description MD 56 begins at the westbound I-70 ramps of Exit 12. Big Pool Road continues as a county highway north for to an intersection with US 40 (National Pike) in Indian Springs. The state highway crosses I-70 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway), intersects the eastbound ramps of the diamond interchange, then curves southeast as a two-lane undivided road into the village of Big Pool, where the highway passes the eastern trailhead for the Western Maryland Rail Trail. The rail trail is adjacent to CSX's Lurgan Subdivision, which in turn is adjacent to the Big Pool, a reservoir that was part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and is now used for recreation as part of Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. MD 56 veers east away from the railroad track through farmland and passes the entrance to Fort Frederick State Park. The state highway crosses Green Spring Run before reaching the hamlet of Big Spring, where the highway parallels the Lurgan Subdivision. MD 56 crosses Camp Spring Run on a one-lane bridge before veering east again at Big Spring Road, which heads north toward Clear Spring. The state highway crosses Little Conococheague Creek on a one-lane bridge built in 1907 prior to intersecting Dam Number 5 Road, which heads south to Power Plant and Dam No. 5 on the Potomac River. MD 56 reaches its eastern terminus at MD 68 (Clear Spring Road) in the hamlet of Charlton near Pinesburg. View west along MD 56 in Ashton History The first section of MD 56 was constructed as a state-aid road from US 40 south to Big Pool in 1916. In 1930, the state highway was extended east to the access road to Fort Frederick State Park. The access road was designated MD 44 between 1946 and 1969. MD 56 was extended east to Four Locks Road in Big Spring in two sections between 1930 and 1934. The state highway was extended to its eastern terminus at MD 68 near Pinesburg in 1958. Big Pool Road originally had a right-angle turn at Ernstville Road in Big Pool. That intersection was bypassed when a curve was constructed concurrent with the construction of MD 56's interchange with I-70 in 1964. The portion of MD 56 between US 40 and I-70 was transferred to county maintenance around 1995.

The neighborhood is located in ZIP Code 78726 and is bordered by Farm To Market 2222 (FM2222) on the south, Ranch Road 620 North (RR620) on the west, Anderson Mill Road on the north, and a major headwater tributary of Bull Creek to the east as well as the Balcones Canyonland Preserve. The preserve gives the neighborhood of over 1300 homes a semi-rural feeling despite being less than four miles to major shopping and employment centers. The major bisecting road is Boulder Lane, which winds its way through the picturesque, upper-middle-class neighborhood of single-family homes. Boulder Lane is a loop, and crosses RR620 in two places (north and south entrances). The neighborhood is approximately 5 miles from Lake Travis and Lake Austin. Ranch Road 620 runs into the new toll roads of State Highway 45 at Lakeline Mall. Fast ways to get downtown is by taking 620 to 183 and going south. Another fast route is taking 620 to 2222 and then onto 360 to the left or the right. Left will take you to Gateway Theater on 183 and right will take you out to southern Austin and that is also a good route to the airport and San Antonio. Canyon Creek was former ranch and hunting land, much of which was once a working cattle ranch owned by former US Congressman Jake Pickle. It was developed by the Blanton Company in the wake of the savings and loan meltdown in the United States in the late 1980s. Perry Blanton and his company envisioned and developed a completely planned community filled with homes, parks, and connecting trails. It contains significant protected habitat for the golden-cheeked warbler and black-capped vireo, two endangered bird species native to central Texas. The neighborhood developed rapidly in the 1990s, and was completely built out by 2005. In the mid-1990s, Round Rock Independent School District authorized the construction of Canyon Creek Elementary School in the neighborhood. Education Public Schools Canyon Creek is served by two School Districts: Round Rock Independent School District (RRISD) * Canyon Creek Elementary School, a National Blue Ribbon school * Grisham Middle School, recently recognized as an International Baccalaurate World School (IB) * Westwood High School, an Exemplary high school ranked number 78 in the U.S. News and World Report survey in 2006 Leander Independent School District * Grandview Hills Elementary School, an International Baccalaurate World School * Four Points Middle School * Vandegrift High School Private Schools Canyon Creek has nearby private schools: * Hill Country Bible School (K-12) * Summit Christian Academy (K-12) * Canyon Creek Preschool (birth - 5 years) Nearby University * Concordia University Texas (4 year, private, on the grounds of the former Schlumberger corporate campus) Churches Nearby religious institutions include: * Church at Canyon Creek (Southern Baptist Convention) * St. Thomas More Catholic Church (Austin Diocese, Catholic) * Hill Country Bible Church (Bible) * Cypress Creek Community Church (Missionary Church-USA, on the grounds of Summit Christian Academy, Cedar Park) * Live Oak Unitarian-Universalist Church (UU, Cedar Park) * Dell Jewish Community Center Campus (containing both conservative and reform Jewish synagogues) * Peace Lutheran Church (Lutheran, Missouri Synod) Shopping Lakeline Mall is less than four miles away, and three large grocery supermarkets (HEB, HEB-Plus, and Wal-Mart) are within two miles. Recently, a large shopping plaza has been constructed nearby as well; it has several restaurants and a movie theater. The neighborhood is notable for having two parks (Homeowners Association Park and Trailhead Park), nature trails, enormous protected lands surrounding it, close proximity to Austin high technology employers, and a surprisingly diverse population of Anglos, East Asians (primarily Chinese), Asian-Indians, and an active political community.

It is a white Colonial Revival farmhouse built in the late 19th century, a period when most large new houses in Cornwall were being built as boardinghouses to serve those who came to the area as a summer resort. The Wood house, too, would be used as a boardinghouse where guests could take in the mountain air and views of the surrounding mountains. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Signs around the property indicate that it is currently owned by nearby Storm King Art Center. It is sided in white clapboard, with a gabled roof shingled in asphalt and pierced by two chimneys, one stone and the other brick. The cornice is bracketed. A porch with two classical columns runs the length of the western (front) facade. Building The two-and-a-half-story house sits in the middle of its lot, with views of Schunemunk Mountain to the south and the Hudson Highlands to the east. Immediately to the west is the New York State Thruway. It is sided in white clapboard with a gabled roof covered in asphalt shingles, pierced by two chimneys, one stone and the other brick. The roofline is marked by a bracketed cornice. A small porch on the western (front) facade is supported by two classically styled columns. The Dutch door at the entrance leads into a central hall, ending in a rear Dutch door. Oak flooring is original, but the lath and plaster walls on the first story have been covered over with drywall. An original staircase leads to the second story, where the plaster walls remain uncovered. More original furnishings, including fixtures for gas lamps, are up the disappearing staircase in the attic. Many of the doors in the house and their hardware are original. A three-car-garage and breezeway are connected to the house. Built later, they are architecturally sympathetic. History The house was built around 1890 as the center of the much larger Wood farm. At that time most larger houses in Cornwall were built to serve as boardinghouses (or, as with the Walter Hand House, both farmhouses and boardinghouses). It is a rare example of a late-19th-century farmhouse in the town, albeit later used as a boardinghouse as well due to the mountain scenery. Only two substantial exterior renovations have been undertaken. The stone chimney was added to the south end around 1930, and in 1996 the garage and breezeway were added. The interior walls on the first story were also covered in drywall at some point in the late 20th century.

Mathias Botanical Garden, Los Angeles, California Archontophoenix cunninghamiana (Bangalow palm, king palm, Illawara palm, piccabben, piccabeen) is an Australian palm. It can grow over 20 m tall. Its flower colour is violet and the red fruits are attractive to birds. It flowers in midsummer and has evergreen foliage. The piccabeen palm grows in the wet subtropics on the sides of Mt Warning Volcano in northern NSW and over the border in Queensland's Lamington National Park, for example. It seeks a good water supply so ravines and grottos are well populated. Its fronds do not create a nesting environment for insects or macrofauna like rodents, so are a tolerable tree for urban environments. Originally in Australia from the landbridge created 45,000 years ago by the receding ocean levels during the last glacial, the probable 'native' environment in prehistory was Indonesia. It has become a noxious weed in many areas where it has been used as an ornamental plant. In southern Brazil, it has become an invasive species, profiting from the local extinction of the endangered native palm Euterpe edulis.Frisch & Frisch (2005), page 354, Christianini (2006) In New Zealand, A. cunninghamiana could invade native forests, since it has the same ecological requirements as the native nikau palm.

Mukhlas was a senior and influential Jemaah Islamiah leader with ties to Osama bin Laden. Early life and background Different reports place Muklas' birthdate at either 2 February or 9 February 1960, in Solokuro, Lamongan, East Java. He attended the Al-Mukmin Islamic school founded by Abu Bakar Bashir with his brothers Amrozi bin Nurhasyim and Ali Imron. He recruited these two brothers to manufacture the explosives and purchase the vehicles used in the 2002 Bali bombing. After graduating from Al-Mukmin, Muklas sought to continue his Jihad studies at various training camps in Afghanistan. He fought in the Soviet–Afghan War between 1980 and 1989, as a member of Osama bin Laden's \\"International Brigade.\\" Muklas admitted that he met with Osama bin Laden in 1987, and that; \\"he and other top JI personnel were careful to nurture ties to bin Laden and al-Qaeda in the years that followed.\\" Muklas secured the funds, through senior JI member Hambali, needed to perform the 2002 Bali bombing. Political and religious activism Jemaah Islamiah After the eventual defeat of the Soviet Union and installation of the Taliban as Afghanistan's rulers, Muklas returned to South East Asia to conduct operations for Jemaah Islamiah. He was named head of JI's \\"Mantiqi One\\", a regional network covering Sumatra, Singapore, Malaysia and southern Thailand. Muklas then co-founded an Islamic school in Malaysia that was to be used as a local training ground for JI operatives. Lukmanul Hakiem In 1991, Muklas, at the behest of Abdullah Sungkar and Abu Bakar Bashir founded Lukmanul Hakiem, a pesantren or Islamic boarding school based on his old school at Ngruki. It was created to link up with other madrassahs and serve to recruit future jihadists. Lukmanul Hakiem employed Noordin Mohammad Top, a Malaysian national, as school principal and he used this role to recruit Muhammad Rais and others for the 2003 Marriott Hotel bombing in Jakarta. Abu Bakar Bashir, Abdullah Sungkar, Muklas, Noordin Top, all taught at the school. JI bomb maker Azahari Husin served on the board of directors. Noordin Top was promoted to director, when Malaysian law was adjusted, however Muklas continued to operate as leader by proxy. 2002 Bali bombing Muklas admitted to being present and in command at the planning meetings for the Bali bombings, and recruited two of his brothers to help assemble and transport the bombs used in the Bali attacks. Approximately 35,000 was contributed to the Bali bombings by Wan Min Wan Mat, a leader of the JI network in Malaysia. This money was transferred through Hambali, Jemaah Islamiah's head of operations. The money was provided in cash and according to claims by Muklas, the money was not just used for the bombings in Bali, but also in other attacks in Indonesia. After acquiring al- Qaeda funds, Muklas recruited two of his brothers to handle the logistics of the bomb plot. His younger brother Amrozi, was convicted who is also situated on \\"death row\\" for his conviction in the attack, personally selected the Mitsubishi van that was to be used outside the Sari Club. Amrozi also assembled the car bomb, and backpack bomb used at Paddy's Pub, in an empty warehouse in Denpasar. Capture On 4 December 2002 Muklas was arrested while hiding in the Central Javanese town of Solo. He confessed to police that he was the head of one of Jemaah Islamiah's four cells and had ordered the Bali bombings. He admitted to being present and in command at the planning meetings for the Bali bombings, and that he had recruited two of his brothers to help assemble and transport the bombs used in the attacks. He also confessed that another Jemaah Islamiah leader Riduan Isamuddin, (also known as Hambali), had provided the funds for the attacks. In a transcript of his police interview he explained: Wan Min bin Wan Mat, a JI leader in Malaysia, later revealed to police that at Hambali's request he had given Muklas cash of approximately 35,000 for the operation. He also asserted that the money had come directly from al-Qaeda, and that the money was not just to be used for the bombings in Bali, but also for other attacks in Indonesia. At his trial, two hundred witnesses linked Muklas with the attacks. Speaking to documentarian from prison, Muklas stated (translated into English by Haryanto): . Trial and sentence His trial began on 16 June 2003. During his trial Mukhlas accuses police interrogators of torturing him into confessing a role in the attacks. He asks the court to ignore his earlier admissions of guilt. Before a panel of five Indonesian judges, on 2 October Muklas was found guilty of coordinating an act of terrorism and sentenced to death. He was the third Bali bomber to receive the death penalty after his brother Amrozi and Imam Samudra. Muklas showed no remorse during the proceedings and used his time in court to denounce George W. Bush and the United States. He declared that the terrorist atrocity was \\"carried out to avenge the suffering of Muslims at the hands of America and Israel.\\" Judge Cokorda Rai Suamba summed up the trial saying: Upon hearing the sentence he immediately started screaming \\"Allahu Akbar\\" and began doing star jumps. He then hugged his lawyers and told the court the judgement was made under laws he did not believe in. Despite his professed wish to die as a martyr, he like Amrozi and Samudra appealed the sentence. Execution Originally incarcerated in Denpasar's prison, he was moved to the high-security prison island of Nusakambangan in October 2005. Together with the two other bombers who received death sentences, he launched a constitutional challenge against the use of firing squads. Mukhlas preferred beheading. Despite an initial decision by Muklas, Amrozi and Imam Samudr to not seek a Presidential pardon, on 21 August 2006, Muklas and his co-conspirators authorised their lawyers to file a last appeal which was lodged on 7 December on the basis of retroactive legislation. On 25 September 2008, the Supreme Court of Indonesia rejected the final appeals of Imam Samudra and Mukhlas; having dismissed Amrozi's appeal earlier that month. In October 2008 he remained unrepentant and claimed revenge would be taken for his death. During the month, his final appeals were rejected by Indonesia's constitutional court and the Attorney General's office announced that he would be executed by firing squad in early November 2008. According to a source in Indonesia's Attorney General Office, the executions were to be done before the end of Sunday, 9 November 2008. This was reportedly delayed from the original plan to allow a representative from the family to identify the body post-execution. From Mukhlas's family, his younger brother, Ali Fauzi were sent as a representative of his family. Mukhlas, along with Amrozi bin Nurhasyim and Imam Samudra were shot on 00:15 local time on 9 November 2008. They were executed by firing squad.

Known for most of its length as Cearfoss Pike, the state highway runs from MD 63 in Cearfoss east to Key Circle in Hagerstown. MD 58 was constructed in the late 1920s along what was originally a turnpike called the Hagerstown and Cross Roads Turnpike. Route description View east from the west end of MD 58 at MD 63 in Cearfoss MD 58 begins at the Cearfoss Roundabout in Cearfoss, where the highway intersects MD 63 (Greencastle Pike) and the county- maintained portion of Cearfoss Pike, which heads northwest toward Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, becoming Pennsylvania Route 416 at the state line. The roundabout is north of MD 63's intersection with MD 494 (Fairview Road). MD 58 heads southeast as two-lane undivided Cearfoss Pike through farmland and scattered residences. Between Point Salem Road and Terps Boulevard, MD 58 expands to a four-lane divided highway and meets I-81 (Maryland Veterans Memorial Highway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. Within the interchange, the state highway enters the city of Hagerstown and its name changes to Salem Avenue. The road passes northeast of a park and ride lot past the interchange. East of I-81, MD 58 enters a densely populated residential area, reduces to a two-lane street, and reaches its eastern terminus at the intersection with Key Circle. Salem Avenue continues southeast as a municipal street toward downtown Hagerstown. History The predecessor highway of MD 58 was the 19th century Hagerstown and Cross Roads Turnpike, which followed essentially the same alignment as modern MD 58 between the tollgate at Broadfording Road, now just east of I-81, and Cearfoss. What is now the county-maintained portion of Cearfoss Pike was originally the Mercersburg Road. About of that county highway from Cearfoss to Conococheague Creek was paved as a state-aid road in 1916 but was not taken into the state road system and was never part of MD 58. MD 58 was paved from Broadfording Road to Garden View Road in 1928 and extended to Cearfoss in 1930. The state highway was rebuilt starting in 1956; the highway was expanded at that time to a four-lane divided highway around its interchange with I-81, which was completed in 1958.

Singaravelu and Singaravelar, was a pioneer in more than one field in India. In 1918, he founded the first trade union in India. On 1 May 1923 he organised the first ever celebration of May Day in the country. Singaravelar was a major leader of the Indian independence movement, initially under the leadership of Gandhi, but later, joining the budding communist movement. In 1925, he became one of the founding fathers of the Communist Party of India; and chaired its inaugural convention in Kanpur. Though the British Government arrested him along with other leaders on charges of conspiring to wage war against the Crown, he was set free, soon after, on account of his failing health. Singaravelar was also a path-breaking social reformer who in his early life took to Buddhism, seeing it as a weapon against the evil of untouchability, which was particularly severe in the 19th-century India. He was also in the forefront of Self respect movement, in the Madras Presidency that fought for equal rights for backward castes. Though in his advanced years, he withdrew from active politics, Singaravelar remained a staunch advocate of the causes he had pioneered till his death at the age of 85. Early life Singaravelar was born into a fisherman family, the third son of Venkatachalam and Valliammai in Madras (now called Chennai).Vasantha Kumaran, P. Singaravelar Godfather of Indian Labour. Chennai: Poornimaa Publication, He matriculated in 1881 and then, from Madras Christian College, he passed F.A. (First examination in Arts) in 1884. Singaravelar took his bachelor's degree from the Presidency College under the Madras University. He joined the Madras Law College and got his B.L. degree in 1907. Thereafter Singaravelar practised law at the Madras High Court. In 1889, Singaravelar married Angammal. Their only daughter was Kamala. Seetha, his grand-niece, married Philip Spratt in 1939. Singaravelar was successful as a lawyer; within a short period, he earned enough wealth to acquire estates in Madras town and suburbs. Singaravelar and Maha Bodhi Society Around this time,Singaravelar had shown growing willingness to combat social evils such as untouchability. The leading voice of the oppressed classes at the end of the 19th century was Iyothee Thass(also referred to as Pandit C. Ayodhya Dasa and Iyothi Thass) (1845–1914). He was born into a fisherman family(most backward caste) and had concluded that rationalist ideas of Buddhism could be used as a weapon against untouchability. He and other oppressed class people from Tamil Nadu decided thence forth to call themselves Buddhist, and live accordingly. In 1890 he started Sakya Buddhist Society and later in 1900, South Indian Buddhist Association in Madras.Materialien zum Neobuddhismus (Materials on Neobuddhism Accessed on 14 November 2007 Influenced by Iyothee Thass, Singaravelar also became growingly open to Buddhist ideas. Anagarika Dharmapala, the Ceylonese Buddhist missionary founded the Maha Bodhi society for revival of Buddhism in 1891. Iyothee Thass and Col. Olcott of the Theosophical Society, Adyar in Madras, wanted to convene a meeting on Dharmapala's arrival in Madras. The meeting that took place on 8 August 1898 was held at Royapettah house of Singaravelar. Later on 28 September the Madras branch of the Maha Bodhi Society was inaugurated in the presence of a large gathering. At this meeting a resolution was moved by Singaravelar to form, in Madras, the first branch of the Maha Bodhi Society.Jayawardane, Lakshman Pioneer of Buddhist Revival Movement in South India. accessed on 14 November 2007 Much later, in 1923, when Singaravelar issued the manifesto of his newly formed Party Labour and Kishan Party of Hindusthan, he signed it as 'M. Singaravelu (Indian communist) President, Madras Maha Bodhi Society'.Ralhan 1997, p.119 Singaravelar and early labor movement In the history of working class movement in India, Madras came to occupy an important place when, within six months of the Russian Revolution, Singaravelar, on 27 April 1918, formed the first trade union in India, called the Madras Labor Union of the British-owned Buckingham & Carnatic Mills.Murugesan 1975, p.33 Chettiiar became its first president. Singaravelar and other activists of the period, like Thiru Vi Ka (Tamil for 'Mr. V. K.' – standing for Mr. V. Kalyanasundaram) organised more unions such as M.S.M. Workers Union, Electricity Workers Union, Tramway Workers Union, Petroleum Employees Union, Printing Workers Union, Aluminium Workers Union, Railway Employees Union, Coimbatore Weavers Union and Madurai Weavers Union. From their inception trade unions in Madras were drawn into long, and often bloody, confrontations with the management. According to the noted economist Amiya Kumar Bagchi, > Madras had led the trade union movement with the organisation of workers > into Madras Labour Union, but the movement could not flourish in a region > with abundant labour, slow industrial growth and employees who were > determined not to make any concession to labour organisations. Buckingham & Carnatic Mills workers' strike is a case in point. The management of the Mills did not even concede workers right to combine. The union was banned by the British authorities. A flash point occurred when a British manager threatened workers with a gun, which was snatched by workers and started firing back. The police came and opened fire killing two young workers. Singaravelar, Thiru Vi Ka, and other leaders called for a strike on 21 June 1921. The management retaliated by instigating a caste war through recruitment of workers from 'low' castes to fill the strikers' vacancies. The strike turned into a caste war between two warring groups. On 29 August 1921, police firing near the Mills' premises in Perambur, near Madras, killed seven people. When their funeral procession was taken out some miscreants threw stones, leading to another round of caste violence. Two more firings – on 19 September and 15 October 1921 followed. After six months, the strike came to an end, failing to meet any of its objectives. From then Singaravelar started seeking political backing for the working class movement. Aluminium workers in Madras struck work in July 1922. Singaravelar speaking in Tamil Nadu Congress Committee meeating in September 1922 said that the Indian National Congress should take up the cause of labour.Murugesan 1975, p.39 Later he led a strike of workers of Addisons press. in December 1922 he was in the forefront of Madras Tramways workers strike.Singaravelar also presided over the strike of 30 August 1924 by the scavengers of Madras Corporation. Singaravelar's contact with émigré communists Singaravelar attracted the attention of the émigré Communist Party of India, which was founded by M. N. Roy, Shaukat Usmani and others in Tashkent on 17 October 1920. Describing the formation of earliest communist groups in India, S. A. Dange is quoted as below: > The Tashkent Party (ie. CPI) and the Executive Committee of the Communist > International tried to build contacts independently and through me with > communist group in Calcutta led by Muzaffar Ahmed and the group in Madras > led by M. Singaravelu.Ralhan 1997, p.85 Abani Mukherji, a close associate of M.N. Roy, smuggled himself to India from Moscow via Berlin in December 1922 and surreptitiously met local communist leaders. After meeting Dange at the Gaya session of the Congress in December 1922, and meeting Bengal communist groups, Mukherji moved to Madras and met Singaravelar. Mukherji helped him with his efforts to form Hindustan Labour Kishan Party and also to draw up its manifesto.Ralhan 1997, p.117 Earlier Singaravelar had met Dange at the Gaya session of the Congress.Murugesan 1975, p.4 Singaravelar and the Congress When Gandhi launched non-cooperation movement starting from September 1920 to February 1922 Singaravelar accepted Gandhi's leadership and became one of the influential leaders of the Presidency Congress Party. He set fire to his lawyer's gown at a public meeting in May 1921 as symbolic of boycotting the British courts. In May 1921, he wrote a letter to Mahatma Gandhi explaining his action, \\"I have given up my profession as a lawyer today. I shall follow you as you strive for the people of this country.\\" An important event of the period was the visit of Prince of Wales and his consort to India. When they came to Madras, Singaravelar organised the boycott of the delegation through an unprecedented hartal or complete shutdown of shops and establishments of the town. The shutdown was complete, but there were instances of compulsion. Gandhi in an article in Young India, dated 9 February 1922 criticized the hartal and Singaravelar for not imbibing the true spirit of non-cooperation movement. He quoted a letter from one of his disciples, Dr. Rajan: > Just two days ago, Mr. Singaravelu Chettiar, president Madras District > Congress Council, held a public meeting on the Madras beach. The first > resolution congratulated the citizens of Madras on their successful hartal > and the second resolution condemned the excesses committed that day. > I wired to Mr. Singaravelu not to have this ugly meeting but evidently no > notice seems to have been taken of itThe Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi > Volume. 26: 24 January 1922 – 12 November 1923 p. 132.

Stubborn and implacable > resistance against internal corruption is enough resistance against the > Government.The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi Volume. 26: 24 January 1922 > – 12 November 1923 p. 134. Singaravelar in Gaya congress convention When the Indian National Congress met in Gaya, in 1922,Singaravelar participated, seeing himself as a representative of workers. He spoke in favour of labour legislation and felt that the labour movement in India must be a part of the congress movement. M. N. Roy praised him for calling himself a communist, in Vanguard dated 1 March 1923 > That Singaravelu participated in the Gaya Congress Meeting in which people > with different ideas took part will be considered a historic event. When > many leaders were afraid that their honour and respect as important leaders > will be lost and young men were afraid of the steps that the government > would take, this sixty-year-old grey-haired elder called him a communist\\". > It is impossible not to praise him.Murugesan 1975, p.168 The theme of his speech was that \\"it is necessary approach the workers personally and make Trade Unions a part of the Congress.\\" Following his speech, the Gaya meeting adopted the Labor Resolution that said, > It is the opinion of this conference that all Indian Labourers should be > united. To safeguard their rights and prevent their exploitation and for > equal distribution of wealth among all, the various labour and kisan unions > should be unified and for this purpose, a committee of sixIncluding > Singaravelu Chettiar. has been constituted. The first May Day in India On 1 May 1923, Singaravelar founded the Labour Kishan Party of Hindusthan(a party of workers and peasants) in Madras. The foundation ceremony was purposefully kept on the May Day; and for the first time in India, under the auspices of the newly formed party,Murugesan 1975, p.4 the day was observed as International Workers' Day. On that occasion, again for the first time the red flag was used in India.M.V.S. Koteswara Rao. Communist Parties and United Front – Experience in Kerala and West Bengal. Hyderabad: Prajasakti Book House, 2003. p. 110 Singaravelar made arrangements to celebrate the May Day in two places in the One meeting was held at the beach opposite to the Madras High Court; the other was held at the Triplicane beach. The Hindu newspaper, published from Madras reported, > The Labour Kisan party has introduced May Day celebrations in Chennai. > Comrade Singaravelar presided over the meeting. A resolution was passed > stating that the government should declare May Day as a holiday. The > president of the party explained the non-violent principles of the party. > There was a request for financial aid. It was emphasised that workers of the > world must unite to achieve independence.Murugesan 1975, p.169 Labour Kishan Party of Hindusthan Labour Kishan Party of Hindusthan was a part of a larger, but not inter-connected, moves by various Indian communist groups to find a mass-based political platform. Dange, for instance, wrote to M. N. Roy of the émigré Communist Party of India and a leader of the Comintern, regarding his desire to start a Socialist Labour Party of India. In reply, Roy explained the relation between émigré Communist Party of India and 'mass party of revolutionary nationalist struggle',and further said that \\"each of the Indian \\"centres\\" produced a separate scheme and it was some time before they could agree to combine.\\" Roy was probably referring to Singaravelar's proposal to start a similar party. Same year Dange wrote in his journal Socialist that all his activities were now a part of the Labour Kishan Party of Hindusthan and he asked for opening up of its branches everywhere.Murugesan 1975, p.90-91 Singaravelar announced that it would join the Indian National Congress and would strive to function as the labour and farmer wing of that party. Labour Kishan Party was a precursor to Workers and Peasants Party of 1925 that would function within the Congress, as a left wing platform for the same. In the manifesto of the party Singaravelar described Congress 'our chief political organ, appear to define \\"nation\\" by referring to propertied class.Ralhan 1997, p.93 In December 1923 Singaravelar started a fortnightly journal called The Labour Kisan Gazette. Singaravelar also started the Tamil Weekly Thozhilalar in which he wrote about the working class movements spreading in various parts of the world during the early part of the 1920s. In 1925, Singaravelar was elected as a member of the Madras Corporation. On Singaravelar's initiative first ever mid-day meal scheme was introduced in Madras for providing cooked meals to children in corporation schools. Formation of Communist Party of India In the Gaya congress session of 1922, the president of the session, C. R. Das moved a resolution for 'Council- Entry programme,' that is, 'Non-Cooperation from within the Councils.' He however met with vehement opposition from the Mahatma and the 'no-changers'. C. Rajagopalachari led the Council-Entry opposition. The resolution lost. M. N. Roy wrote, > It has been proved at Gaya, if proof were still needed, that the National. > struggle can be led, neither by the reactionary petty-bourgeoisie acting > through the orthodox “No-Changers” under the divine guidance of St. > Rajagopal, nor by the radical intellectuals desirous of harking back to the > folds of Constitutionalism, under the guise of loyalty to the memory of > Tilak. Between these two centripetal forces, Bengal's “Sentimental > Tommy”(C.R. Das) croaked. Before he could wreck the Councils, the Councils > wrecked him. What is to be done? A new party must be organised.Roy, M. N. On > the Gaya Congress. Marxist Internet Archive Early communists like Dange, Singaravelar, M. N. Roy's associate, Abani Mukherji, a deportee from Fiji and a lawyer Manilal Doctor were present at the Gaya session and saw Gandhi's support to the 'no-changers.' Efforts to form a unified platform intensified. On 29 January 1923, Dange wrote to Singaravelar that, > You perhaps know that Roy wants to hold a conference of Indian Communists in > Berlin. I think it is a mad venture Indians to go hunting Communism in > European Conference, whatever has to be done must be done in India.Ralhan > 1997, p.40 Kanpur Bolshevik Conspiracy case In January 1924 the Government of India compiled a brief on activities of communists in India. The Government Counsel recommended prosecution against the first eight in the list, namely, M. N. Roy, Muzaffar Ahmed, Shaukat Usmani Gulam Hussain, S. A. Dange, Singaravelu, Ramcharan Lal Sharma and Nalini Gupta. But no recommendations were made against S. D. Hussain, M. P. T. Velayudham (an associate of Singaravelar), Sampurnand, Manilal Doctor and Satya Bhakta.Ralhan 1997, p.43 The report was submitted to the Governor General and on further legal scrutiny some lacunae were found. The scope of the case was revised to bring in a conspiracy angle: that the Third Communist International had appointed Roy as its agent and had instructed him to establish a communist party with the help of Shaukat Usmani, S. A. Dange, Singaravelu, Gulam Hussain and Muzaffar Ahmed. As the charges were getting framed Dange and Singaravelar were arrested under Regulation III of 1918 that allowed detention without trial in August 1923. Subsequently, Muzaffar Ahmed (Calcutta), Shaukat Usmani (Kanpur) and Gulam Hussain (Lahore) were arrested. On 20 December 1923 Nalini Gupta was also arrested under the same regulation. Roy evaded arrest since he was abroad. Ramcharan Lal Sharma was not arrested because he had migrated to the French territory of Pondicherry due to police harassment. On 17 March 1924 cases were framed against the accused in what was called the Cawnpore (now spelt Kanpur) Bolshevik Conspiracy case. The specific charge was that they as communists were seeking \\"to deprive the King Emperor of his sovereignty of British India, by complete separation of India from imperialistic Britain by a violent revolution.\\" Out of the six accused in custody only four—S. A. Dange, Shaukat Usmani, Muzaffar Ahmed and Nalini Gupta—were produced. Singaravelar, now 64, was confined to bed due to illness. He was later released on bail.Ralhan 1997, p.54-55 Gulam Hussain was pardoned after he confessed that he had received money in Kabul.Ralhan, O.P. (ed.) Encyclopedia of Political Parties New Delhi: Anmol Publications p.336 The case attracted interest of the people towards Comintern plan to bring about violent revolution in India. Communist trials had taken place in India, in frontier towns like Peshawar where Russian trained muhajir communists were put on trial. \\"But no case had attracted public gaze like the Kanpur case. Pages of newspapers daily splashed sensational communist plans and people for the first time learned such a large scale about communism and its doctrines and the aims of the Communist International in India.\\" Names of accused like S.A. Dange, Muzaffar Ahmed, Shaukat Usmani and Singaravelu Chettiar came to be recognised across the country. First communist conference In 1924, shortly after the Kanpur Conspiracy Case, Satyabhakta, a Congress worker in the United Provinces had decided to organise a 'legal' Communist Party, that is, a party that would not attract treasonable charges such as in the Kanpur case. Initially no significant notice was taken of Satyabhakta's venture, but when Nalini Gupta was released from the jail (July 1925) and later when Muzaffar Ahmed was released in September on grounds of poor health, their interest fell on Satyabhakta's party for organizational work—in the absence of any other structure.Ralhan 1997, p.59. Satyabhakta then announced a communist conference in DeMarxistcember 1925, at Kanpur, to be concurrently held with Indian National Congress convention. His idea was to demarcate himself from the existing communist groups. N. N. Roy was skeptical when he wrote in the October 1925 issue of his magazine,Masses of India that > It is premature to say that what shape this 'Communist Party' will > ultimately assume and how far it is going to be Communist in Programme and > actions.Ralhan 1997, p.59. The conference was held on 25–26 December 1925. Singaravelu Chettiar was elected to preside over the session. The meeting adopted a resolution for the formation of the Communist Party of India.The two major Indian communist parties, namely, Communist Party Of India (CPI) and the Communist Party of India ()(CPI(M)) maintain different views on exactly when the Communist Party of India was founded. The date maintained as the foundation day by the CPI is 26 December 1925. But according to the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the party was founded in Tashkent, USSR on 17 October 1920. According to the Constitution, the object of the Party was, to quote, > establishment of workers' and peasants' republic based on socialisation of > means of production and distribution, by the liberation of India from > British imperialist domination.Ralhan 1997, p.1 The British Government's extreme hostility towards communists, made them to decide not to openly function as a communist party; instead, they chose a more open and non-federated platform, under the name the Workers and Peasants Parties. Singaravelar and railway employees' strike Employees of various railway systems in India, the North-Western Railway, Bengal Nagpur Railway, and The East Indian Railway went on to strike demanding better working conditions and for better treatment by the management.Singaravelar went on a tour to north India to extend his support to the striking railway employees. In February 1927 he reached Bhopal and met the striking workers. In Howrah and Bengal 30,000 workers were on strike. Singaravelar along with a group of workers from Madras State also took part in the strike. South Indian Railway Strike After returning from his North Indian tour Singaravelar was drawn into another railway employees' strike. In 1927, the workers of the South Indian Railways were resisting measures by the management to retrench them through a fresh assessment of their skills. Also the management had decided relocating employees working in different railway workshops to one near Tiruchirapalli(Trichy). The workers demanded the withdrawal of both these measures. When the management refused to accede to their demands, the workers went on strike from 19 July 1928. All the railway employees, irrespective of their seniority, joined the strike. from 21 July 1928 the trains were stilled. The strike eventually failed. Singaravelar along with a prominent leader of the strike, Sakkarai Chettiar, and a number of employees were arrested.Singaravelar was sentenced the ten years imprisonment, which was reduced to 18 months on appeal.

Ramasamy's self-respect movement (that advocated for upliftment of intermediate castes and opposing upper castes viz. the brahmins) and the communist movement should work together to save the Tamil labour forces from the clutches of both religious and economic exploiters. This appealed to Naicker and he published Singaravelar's contributions in his magazine,Kudiyarasu. In 1931, Naicker undertook a journey to Soviet Russia and other European countries. On his return, he invited Singaravelar to Erode for discussions. Naicker convened a meeting of the movement at his residence on 28–29 December 1932, and drew out what was called the Erode Plan. Naicker had taken a decision to support pro-British Justice Party and to oppose the Indian National Congress in the elections that followed. Unlike Congress, the Justice Party had agreed to implement a policy of appointments to government jobs in proportion to caste ratios, as demanded by the leaders of the self-respect movement. Significance of Singaravelar's association with the self-respect movement is brought out by Karthigesu Sivathamby, a prominent Tamil scholar from Sri Lanka who has closely studied the social movements in Madras province, > By this time the rationalist movement, through its association with the > world socialist movement, was becoming more scientific.

H.. Marigowda is also known as Father of Horticulture in India. 8 August is celebrated as M.H.Marigowda Foundation Day. Dr Manmohan Attavar is the President of M.H. Marigowda Horticultural Education and Research Foundation. Dr Marigowda, a horticultural expert, had dedicated his life for the development of the field of Horticulture, as it would help in uplifting farmers and provide healthy food for the society as a whole. He had envisaged setting up of farms and farmer outlets in every district and taluk in the State, apart from measures to offer courses in horticulture at Lalbagh. When Dr. M.H Marigowda took the charge of the post of the Superintendent of Horticulture in Mysore, in 1951, the developmental works in the state started with an unprecedented pace. * In 1963, consequent to the formation of the separate Department of Horticulture, he was elevated to the post of the Director of Horticulture. Several schemes which were earlier handled by the Agriculture Department, were transferred to this newly created Department. * In 1965, the reorganization of the Department took place and several posts were created in order to carry over the task of Horticulture development in the state. Also, a large number of new scheme were sanctioned. * In 1956, as a result of reorganization of the state, the Horticultural activities were extended to all the 19 districts. Thus, he was responsible for elevating the minor Department of Horticulture to a major Department. * During his term, he took the Horticulture to the rural areas and to the common man. * He set into implementation of a unique pattern of Horticulture development i.e., \\"4-Limbed Model of Horticulture\\". To suit to this, he ** established the Horticulture Produce Co-operative Marketing Society and the Nurserymen’s Co-operative Society at Bangalore. ** started as many as 357 farms and nurseries all over the state. ** His visualization of the farms and nurseries was in developing them as progeny orchards, nursery centers and places of demonstration of new crops and technology to the farmers. ** Seed testing, soil testing and plant protection laboratories were started at Lalbagh by him. Several park and gardens were laid out in different cities and towns of the state. The area of Lalbagh Botanical Garden was expanded to and planted with additional native and exotic species of plants during his period. ** Dr. Marigowda was a staunch advocate of Dry Land Horticulture and the principals and practices of these technologies were demonstrated in most of the farms started by him. This inspired the farmers of the state to practice Dry Land Horticulture on vast dry and drought prone tracts of the state. ** Mixed cropping and intercroppings got special fillip during his times. Thus, through multifarious achievements and feats, the state of Karnataka became the \\"Horticultural State of India\\", and Dr. Marigowda’s name became immortal in the annals of Horticulture development in Karnataka.

The highly-nitrogenous compound most commonly encountered in the human subjects with urea cycle disorders, associated with uremic conditions in the body. These conditions, such as uremia or hyperammonemia, tend to cause high levels of nitrogen in the form of ammonia in the blood. Uremic conditions are a result of defects in enzymes that convert ammonia to urea, the primary nitrogenous waste metabolite in the urea cycle. Metabolism Phenylacetylglutamine is the primary metabolite of the degradation of phenylacetate when in the presence of glutamine in the liver. It is also produced in higher concentrations in the body through the metabolic degradation pathway of the pharmaceutical compounds sodium phenylbutyrate, glycerol phenylbutyrate, and sodium phenylacetate, considered more toxic, that are used as treatments for the physiological dysfunction in urea cycling. Phenylbutyrate is beta-oxidized into phenylacetate which is conjugated with glutamine in the liver and excreted by the kidney. Phenylacetylglutamine is the product of uremic conditions that require an alternative pathway to the urea cycle for nitrogen waste removal. This process produces comparable levels of phenylacetylglutamine in urine in relation to urea levels in a properly functioning urea cycle. In 24 hours 80-100% of a dose of phenylbutyrate is excreted in the urine as phenylacetylglutamine. The metabolism and conjugation of phenylacetate with glutamine in the liver involves amino acid acetylation carried out by the enzyme phenylacetyltranferase or glutamine N-acetyl transferase. The enzyme catalyzes the reaction of the substrates phenylacetyl- CoA and L-glutamine to produce CoA and alpha-N-phenylacetyl-L-glutamine and phenylacetic acid. The catalytic enzyme has been isolated in the human liver mitochondria. Furthermore, phenylacetylglutamine has been found in human urine, but not in the excretory material of rats, dogs, cats, monkeys, sheep, or horses. Throughout the metabolic process, phenylacetylglutamine is bound and conjugated by free-plasma in the kidney to remove excess nitrogen through its excretion in the urine. As a biomarker Elevated levels of nitrogen in the blood increase the amount of glutamine, the primary, non-toxic carrier of ammonia in the blood, within patients with hyperammonemia and inborn errors in urea synthesis. Phenylacetylglutamine levels in the urine serves as a more effective biomarker for the excretion of nitrogenous waste than measures of blood plasma, which fluctuate and are a less effective therapeutic monitor of waste nitrogen levels. A 24-hour metabolic urine test of phenylacetylglutamine provides a non-invasive biomarker of waste nitrogen that most consistently reflects the dose of phenylbutyric acid or glycerol phenylbutyrate used to treat patients with urea-cycle disorders. Phenylacetylglutamine isotopically labeled with 14C also serves more broadly to characterize relative rates of cellular reactions and functions as a general, non-invasive biomarker for gluconeogenesis and citric acid cycle intermediates in the liver. Chronic kidney disorder High levels of phenylacetylglutamine in the urine following metabolism by the gut microbiota, may also indicate early renal decline associated with kidney dysfunction and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In CKD phenylacetylglutamine is considered a uremic toxin, which is uptaken, circulated and retained in the blood after microbial fermentation of certain proteins and amino acids in the gut. Blood serum levels of phenylacetylglutamine in CKD are used as a mortality determinant. Blood plasma levels of phenylacetylglutamine increase with exposure to cigarette smoke, in patients with ischemic heart failure, cardiovascular risk, or hypertension, in the development of renal disease and in patients with type 2 diabetes.

The dam's purpose includes flood mitigation, irrigation, water supply and conservation. The impounded reservoir is called Split Rock Reservoir. Location and features Commenced in 1984, completed in 1987, and upgraded in 2012, the Split Rock Dam is a minor dam on the Manilla River, located approximately upstream, north of Manilla and north of Tamworth, accessed by a turnoff from Fossickers Way. The dam was built by Abignano Pty Limited on behalf of the New South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation to supply water for irrigation, flood mitigation and potable water for towns in the Namoi Valley, including Manilla and Barraba. Together with Keepit Dam, Split Rock Dam supplies extensive irrigation water in the Namoi Valley. The dams also supply water for the town of Walgett and generates hydro-power for the national grid. The dam wall constructed with of concrete faced rockfill is high and long. The maximum water depth is and at 100% capacity the dam wall holds back of water at AHD. The surface area of Split Rock Reservoir is and the catchment area is , mostly from the Upper Manilla and Ironbark Creeks plus small creeks and gullies, too, including Crow Mountain and Eumur Creeks. The concrete chute spillway is capable of discharging . An 8.1 million upgrade of facilities was completed during 2012 and involved construction of a new, high, concrete parapet wall on the embankment. At the time of its initial construction in 1987, Split Rock Dam incorporated the latest dam technology with an intake tower that can select water from any specified depth. This ensures that cold, de-oxygenated water from lower levels is mixed with water that contains more oxygen from the warmer layers above, before it leaves the storage. In 2013, Tamworth Regional Council announced a project to construct a pipeline from Split Rock Dam to Barraba to ensure local residents have access to a quality water supply would proceed. Additional project infrastructure includes a pumping station near the dam, a pressure tank, and upgrades to Barrabra water treatment plant.

Biography Early career Lee was born in Hinsdale, New Hampshire, educated in the public schools in Augusta, Maine, and graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., in June 1931. After attending Air Corps Flying Schools at Randolph and Kelly fields, Texas, General Lee received his wings in October 1932. He was assigned to the 55th Pursuit Squadron of the 20th Pursuit Group at Barksdale Field, Louisiana. While at Barksdale he performed pilot and other squadron officer duties. In early 1934 when U.S. airmail contracts were cancelled by the president, Lieutenant Lee joined other officers in his group flying the airmail in the central zone. In May 1937 he was assigned to the First Cavalry (Mechanized) at Fort Knox, Kentucky. In addition to participating in intensive training as a junior officer in Troop \\"C,\\" First Mechanized Cavalry Regiment, Lieutenant Lee commanded several detachments, guarding the shipments of gold that were being shipped from various mints in the United States, to the Fort Knox Gold Repository. The following year he returned to the U.S. Army Air Corps and was assigned to the 12th Observation Squadron, Godman Field, also at Fort Knox. During 1938 to 1940 he was aide-de-camp to General Adna R. Chaffee, Jr., the \\"father\\" of the Armored Force. During this period of his career he assisted in the development of operations teamwork between air and ground forces. In 1940 Captain Lee attended the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field, Alabama. During 1940-1941 he commanded the 12th Observation Squadron. World War II In late 1941 Major Lee became chief of corps aviation, Headquarters I Armored Corps, and later air officer for Armored Force headquarters. In 1942 Lieutenant Colonel Lee organized at Godman Field, and commanded the newly activated 73rd Observation Group, later to become the 10th Recce Group and Wing, now assigned to Allied Command Europe, NATO and stationed in England. In January 1943 he was promoted to colonel and became chief of staff of the First Air Support Command at Morris Field, North Carolina. He continued in this position through successive reorganizations and redesignations of this command as I Tactical Air Division and the Third Tactical Air Command. In August 1944, Colonel Lee joined the Ninth Air Forces in France where he served as deputy commander for operations under Lieutenant General Hoyt S. Vandenberg and shared responsibility for the defeat of Germany in four major campaigns: Northern France, the Rhineland, the Ardennes, and Central Europe. He was promoted to brigadier general in January 1945. At the end of hostilities when the Ninth Air Force took up its occupation role, he served as chief of staff. Late in 1945 General Lee was assigned to the air section of the Theater General Board at Bad Nauheim as it completed its analyses and reports on the European campaigns. Post war In January 1946, General Lee returned to the United States and in April he became the first chief of Staff of the newly organized Tactical Air Command at Langley Field, Virginia, where he remained until August 1946 when he entered the first class of the National War College. After graduation from the National War College, General Lee was assigned in July 1947 to Tactical Air Command as deputy commanding general. During this assignment, in February 1948, he was promoted to major general. From November 1948, he served as commanding general until July 1950. From Langley Air Force Base, General Lee went to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, and assumed command of Air Task Group 3.4, a special assignment to Operation Greenhouse that culminated in the atomic test at Eniwetok during the spring of 1951. When this assignment was completed in July 1951, General Lee was named the deputy director of plans under the deputy chief of staff for operations, Headquarters U.S. Air Force, Washington, D.C., with a simultaneous duty as the Air Force member of the Joint Strategic Plans Committee. Shortly thereafter he became the director of plans. In November 1953, General Lee was assigned to command the Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force and the Twelfth U.S. Air Force in Europe. The former constituted the largest tactical air forces in Allied Command Europe, consisting of all United States, French and Canadian air forces on the continent of Europe committed to the Supreme Allied Commander. In June 1956, command of the two air forces was separated. General Lee retained command of the Allied Tactical Air Force. When he returned to the United States in July 1957, he became commander of the Ninth Air Force, Tactical Air Command, with headquarters at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina. One year later, on July 15, 1958, General Lee assumed the rank of lieutenant general and arrived at United Nations Command headquarters, Seoul, Korea, to become chief of staff, United Nations Command and U.S. Forces, Korea. In September 1959 he returned to the United States to become vice commander of the Air Defense Command in Colorado Springs, Colorado, becoming commander in March 1961. He was promoted to general on June 4, 1963, and became air deputy to the supreme allied commander, Europe, on August 1, 1963. Honors and awards A command pilot with more than 9,000 hours flying time, Lee includes among his awards and decorations the Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star Medal, Air Medal and Army Commendation Medal.

Moss recently set a second world record at London's Brick 2014 event, erecting a 20-foot-tall balloon replica of a LEGO minifigure that has been recognized in Guinness World Records 2016. Moss is also the founder of one of the first 50, non-academic websites established on the internet: BalloonHQ.com, an online community and resource for amateur and professional balloon artists. He currently owns and operates Airigami, LLC, with his wife and business partner, Designer Kelly Cheatle. Background Moss grew up in Queens, NY, and studied music at Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School (as featured in the movie “Fame”). He began entertaining publicly in 1985, as a New York City street performer, after learning to juggle and perform magic tricks. He has since developed a reputation for elevating the art of balloon sculpture to new and unexpected heights, earning favorable reviews from audiences and critics worldwide and displaying installations in more than a dozen countries on four continents. His work has been recognized by The Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press, CNN Headline News, PBS, Smithsonian magazine, Cabinet, The Guardian and The Huffington Post. In addition, Moss has appeared on programs like The Martha Stewart Show and NBC's Today show. He has also performed at the White House on multiple occasions. Moss presented at TEDx Rochester in both 2009 (\\"Building Community through Balloon Sculpture\\") and 2014 (\\"Living in a Bubble\\") and has authored several published books about ballooning. Moss graduated from the University of Rochester with an undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics/Computer Science and a master's degree in Elementary Education and has worked as a programmer. Those interests intersect in his performance of \\"How to Catch a Mouse: Simple Machines at Work,\\" a humorous science-themed program designed to educate and entertain school-age children at the Corning Museum of Glass and elsewhere. The program is currently under license and, as such, is performed around the world. Major works  Balloon HQ  In 1992, Moss started an email discussion list for balloon twisters. In 1994, those listings were archived online and visual content was added, marking the official launch of BalloonHQ.com. As internet usage exploded in the late 1990s, nearly every serious balloon artist joined the BalloonHQ Community. This prompted Moss, its founder, to partner with Sheena Beaverson and Mark Balzer, who helped administer the site. Site discussions led to the first balloon twisting convention (T-Jam 1999), the first international balloon art photo contest and the free dissemination of balloon art ideas and designs. Today, in addition to sustaining an important industry dialogue, BalloonHQ calls attention to key industry events and provides members with access to customizable portfolios and specialized educational materials. On an annual basis, Moss communicates with and advises an estimated 500,000 site visitors.  World Record In 2000, Moss and Sorell were commissioned to create a world-record-sized balloon sculpture in Moi, Belgium. They designed and depicted a scene showing two soccer players kicking a ball into a goal. At the time, the sculpture was the largest non-round balloon sculpture in the world. It was constructed of more than 40,750 inflated latex balloons. The installation was built without framing, line or glue and relied only on traditional balloon twisting methods. Forty-two additional crew members and more than 640 man-hours were required to construct the sculptural piece, which stood tall and was roughly wide. Each of the latex soccer players stood an unprecedented tall. World’s First Piloted Balloon Sculpture In July 2003, Moss orchestrated the creation of the “Fantastic Flying Octopus” - an impressive, air-bound balloon sculpture that was piloted by John Ninomiya. A 23-member balloon artist team, an eight-member flight crew and hundreds of community members helped build and launch the first-ever, piloted, latex balloon sculpture (which took five days and 700 man hours to complete). Nearly 20,000 twisting balloons were assembled by artists from around the U.S. and Canada to create the \\"Fantastic Flying Octopus,\\" with several thousands of people showing up to observe construction and the eventual launch of the cluster balloon craft, in Sodus Bay, NY. It was powered solely by wind and of helium. Balloon Manor Beginning in 2004, Moss shifted his focus to \\"Balloon Manor” – a haunted house made entirely of latex balloons. Moss organized and led a design team of professional balloon artists and community volunteers to build, promote and run the functional, Halloween- themed balloon installation. Each life-sized structure required more than 100,000 balloons and 50 crew members to build. \\"Balloon Manor\\" attracted 10,000-plus visitors annually through 2008 before being put on hold. On November 10, 2013, Moss and Cheatle completed a successful Kickstarter campaign to fund a revival of the popular \\"Balloon Manor\\" concept. The first subsequent installation, \\"The VERY Tall Tale of Jack & His Beanstalk,\\" was a latex adaptation of the English fairy tale \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" (aka \\"Jack the Giant Slayer\\"). Built in the historic Sibley Building in downtown Rochester, NY, between February 1 and 4, 2014, it featured a five-story beanstalk topped by a castle that appeared to be floating on balloon clouds.  Airigami, LLC  In 2005, Moss launched Airigami, LLC, through which he conceives and constructs creative content made entirely of balloons. Projects range from life-sized, individual sculptures to record-breaking, on-site installations for use at national and international museums (i.e., The Strong National Museum of Play, Virginia Museum of Natural History, Rochester Museum and Science Center), art galleries (i.e., Phelps Arts Center), trade shows and more. Several large-scale creations conceived, designed and produced by Airigami have appeared in promotional videos, award-winning illustrations, animation formats and TV programs. The company's air-filled recreations of master works like “Girl with a Pearl Earring” by Johannes Vermeerr, “American Gothic” by Grant Wood and Sandro Botticelli's “The Birth of Venus” have helped distinguish Moss and Cheatle as masters in their own right. Other Appearances Moss and Cheatle were both featured on the December 24, 2013, \\"Pop, the Tragic Dragon\\" episode of the A&E; reality TV series \\"Shipping Wars.\\" The show documented the over-the-road, bubble-wrapped transport of a 20 ft. wide, 10-foot-high dragon made entirely of artfully-bended latex balloons, by Moss and Cheatle, for the Brooklyn Children's Museum in Brooklyn, NY. Its shipment, from Upstate N.Y., was overseen by Christopher Hanna and Robbie Welsh, representing the Strong Museum of Play. The show's crew successfully delivered the dragon sculpture, with minimal damage, under Moss and Cheatle's direction. Educator Larry Moss is a popular industry educator. He has taught balloon art in Europe, Asia, and America. He is also the author of several books and has designed balloon kits which are popular among children and adults worldwide.

Known for most of its length as Leitersburg Pike, the state highway runs from the intersection of Potomac Street and Northern Avenue in Hagerstown east to the Pennsylvania state line near Leitersburg, where the highway continues as Pennsylvania Route 316 (PA 316). MD 60 connects Hagerstown with Leitersburg and Waynesboro, Pennsylvania. MD 60 was paved over the course of an old turnpike from Hagerstown toward Waynesboro in the mid-1920s. The state highway was reconstructed in the mid-1950s, including the highway's bypass of Leitersburg. Route description View north along MD 60 at MD 418 in Leitersburg MD 60 begins at an intersection with Northern Avenue, Eastern Boulevard, and Potomac Avenue in the city of Hagerstown. Northern Avenue heads west past St. Maria Goretti High School. Eastern Boulevard heads east toward the historic home Rockland Farm. Potomac Street heads south toward downtown Hagerstown, passing through the Oak Hill and Potomac-Broadway historic districts and by the Zion Reformed United Church of Christ and the Hagerstown Armory. MD 60 heads north as Potomac Avenue, a four-lane divided highway that soon narrows to a two-lane undivided road. The route leaves the city limits of Hagerstown before reaching a junction with Marsh Pike, which heads north toward the suburbs of Paramount and Long Meadow. MD 60 continues northeast as Leitersburg Pike through farmland, passing the Dorsey-Palmer House before crossing Marsh Run. MD 60 crosses Antietam Creek and passes the Lantz-Zeigler House before reaching Leitersburg. The state highway intersects MD 62 (Little Antietam Road) on the west side of the unincorporated village before curving to the north to bypass the village while Leiter Street, the old alignment of MD 60, continues straight to pass through the Leitersburg Historic District. North of the village center, MD 60 intersects Leiters Mill Road and the western end of MD 418 (Ringgold Pike), then curves north and receives the other end of Leiter Street. The state highway starts to parallel Antietam Creek as it reaches its eastern terminus at the Pennsylvania state line. The highway continues north as PA 316 (Wayne Highway) toward Waynesboro. MD 60 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from its southern terminus at Eastern Boulevard in Hagerstown north to Marsh Run. History The predecessor highway of MD 60 was the Hagerstown and Waynesboro Turnpike, which ran from Hagerstown to the Pennsylvania state line via Leitersburg. MD 60 was paved as a modern highway from Hagerstown to Leitersburg in 1923 and from Leitersburg to the state line by 1927. The first relocation of MD 60 occurred in 1941 when the highway's bridge over Antietam Creek was replaced. The state highway was reconstructed from its western terminus to the western end of the Antietam Creek relocation in 1952. The segment of MD 60 between Antietam Creek and Leitersburg was rebuilt in 1953 and 1954. The bypass of Leitersburg was constructed and the highway north to the state line was reconstructed between 1954 and 1956. Junction list Auxiliary route MD 60A is the designation for the unnamed one-lane ramp from eastbound MD 60 to eastbound MD 418 in Leitersburg.

She is an FBI special agent, and appeared in both season 7 and season 8. Concept and creation Wersching previously had worked together with 24 crew members on a failed television pilot entitled Company Man. She was cast for the part of Renee Walker a week before filming began, saying that \\"they spent a long time trying to figure this role out. They toyed with the coldness of her and went back and forward a lot.\\" \\"The story is being told from her point of view,\\" reveals the show's Executive Producer Howard Gordon. \\"She is somebody who has probably pressed up against the limitations of what's been allowed [according to the law]. Her soul is in balance in the question. Is it worth doing whatever's necessary at the personal price it extracts?\\" Characterization Renee is tough and strong willed, and has been shown to disobey orders or push the limits of the law when she believes such actions are necessary. Throughout Day 7, she takes in what Jack Bauer does and gradually becomes more rogue and puts justice before the job. When first meeting Jack, Renee was reluctant to do the things that Jack Bauer would do in order to get what they needed such as torture, but by the end of Day 7, Renee resorts to torture in order to get the answers that she needs. Appearances Season 7 Renee is introduced when she pulls Jack Bauer out of a Senate hearing so he can advise and aid the FBI in tracking down Tony Almeida, who has been involved in terrorist activities. Over time, she gives him more power, allowing him to interrogate Almeida. After Jack subdues her and escapes with Almeida, her anger and guilt over his betrayal lead her to torture a prisoner for information and attempt to track Jack and Tony down personally. While observing them assisting Emerson in the kidnapping of Ule Matobo, she is captured. Jack convinces Emerson to keep her alive temporarily, but later is ordered to shoot her. Jack deliberately shoots off center only grazing her neck but is forced to bury her alive as she plays dead. She temporarily dies, only to be resuscitated by Bill and Chloe, who explain the situation and the need for her to remain \\"dark\\" from the FBI, and bring her into their operation. She aids their operation by using her FBI credentials to bypass security at the building where Dubaku is operating, and participates in the assault on Dubaku's control center, resulting in the destruction of the CIP device and the Matobos' rescue. A meeting between the Matobos and the President is arranged, where they explain the situation to her and Ethan Kanin. Renee convinces Jack to trust Larry Moss for help tracking Edward Vossler. To coerce him into talking, Renee goes to Vossler's house and takes his wife and child hostage. With his family in danger, Vossler gives Jack the location of Dubaku's hideout, where Henry Taylor is being held captive, but then attempts to overcome Jack and is killed. Renee is shaken up when Jack informs her of Vossler's death, but resolves to continue on. Renee and Jack meet at Dubaku's hideout, but are unable to prevent Taylor from being shot and seriously wounded during the rescue attempt. Larry Moss scolds Renee for her actions involving Vossler's family, but Renee defends her actions as necessary, even though she may not be comfortable with them. Jack and Renee then travel to the residence of Marika Donoso, whom Dubaku has developed a relationship with under an assumed identity, and who is preparing to leave the country with Dubaku, along with her sister Rosa. After learning Dubaku's true identity, Marika agrees to help them by keeping her meeting with Dubaku and allowing Jack and Renee to track them. Rosa objects, but Renee promises to keep Marika safe. While trailing Dubaku and Marika, Jack and Renee run into a police roadblock and are arrested. With their arrest sorted out and overturned, Jack and Renee resume tracking Dubaku, chasing him until Marika causes Dubaku's car to crash, killing her and seriously injuring Dubaku. Renee is visibly shaken up, and after being confronted by Rosa, gets into an argument with Jack, where she slaps him. A kiss was originally scripted into the scene, but was written out. Wersching commented that a kiss for that moment would be too much of a cliché. At the hospital, Dubaku is killed by an assassin sent by Juma. Renee tracks the assassin which leads her to the Potomac where Juma is assembling his forces. When Juma and his men leave, Renee jumps to their boat where she discovers their target to be the White House. During Juma's siege on the White House, Renee and Larry help coordinate the rescue operations and counterattack. Later, Jack relays intelligence from Bill on another pending threat, but when he and Renee bring this information to Larry, Larry has Jack arrested, stating he'll \\"look into it\\". Renee approaches Ethan Kanin, who orders Larry to allow Jack to proceed with the investigation. Larry suspends Renee indefinitely, saying he can no longer trust her. During her suspension, Jack is framed for the murders of Ryan Burnett and Senator Mayer. Jack contacts Renee secretly, so she helps him identify and track the killer. She is discovered, though, when a message is intercepted, and is arrested. She returns to active duty once Jack is cleared of the murders. She is visibly upset when she discovers that Jack has been fatally exposed to the bio-weapon during his attempt to secure it. Afterwards she debriefs Jack back at the FBI headquarters and both of them help to co- ordinate the subsequent raid on the Starkwood compound and Almeida's search for the bio-weapon, eventually resulting in its successful destruction. Renee also encourages Jack to try the experimental procedure suggested by his doctors; using a sample of genetically compatible stem cells from a close relative may cure him of the pathogen's effects and save his life. Jack refuses treatment and Renee looks into his file. When Kim calls looking for her father, Renee explains the situation to her without Jack's knowledge, upsetting him and causing an emotional clash. After Larry Moss is killed by Almeida and Galvez in their successful theft of the last canister of the bio- weapon, she is visibly upset and personally leads the search for Galvez, Almeida not having been discovered yet. Renee is inside the abandoned building wired with explosives by Galvez when it explodes, but a warning from Jack saves her. After Jack tells her the truth about Almeida, she puts on an APB alert to capture him, though he manages to escape. Renee and Jack later follow up a lead on Jibraan Al-Zarian who they believe may be involved with the terrorists. Eventually they locate and raid Jibraan's house, freeing his brother but are one step behind Almeida and his team, who have already left, having managed to coerce Jibraan into helping them, and are preparing to launch their attack. Renee and Jack manage to recapture Almeida, only to have Jack commandeer the vehicle and help Tony escape. As he is doing so, Jack explains that Tony's accomplices have operatives in place, placing his daughter's life in danger, and asks Renee to save her. Renee calls Kim at the airport and warns her about the operatives, but the call is cut off. As security closes in, a firefight breaks out. Renee arrives to find Kim safe after chasing a surviving operative into a parking garage. With Kim's help, she is able to locate Jack, and goes with a team to rescue him. Renee is able to disarm an explosive device that Tony has attached to Jack, and the two are able to apprehend Tony just as he is about to exact his revenge for his wife's death on Alan Wilson, the head of the conspiracy. Wilson calmly denies all involvement and refuses to cooperate, so Renee seeks out Jack for advice. She tells him that she knows they do not have a case against Wilson, so he has no reason to cooperate. She also knows that if the rest of his organization is not brought to justice they will strike again, and she does not know if she will able to live with herself knowing she could have stopped it. He tells her that he cannot tell her what to do, as he has been wrestling with those kind of problems all his life. For him, when he sees innocent lives in danger, everything else becomes less important; and he will do whatever it takes to save those lives. He denies regretting anything that he has done today; but reminds her that she works for the FBI. As such, she has to uphold the law, a law that Jack knows (in his mind) has to be more important than the innocent lives, but he does not think his heart could bear to see the lives lost. He tells her the only advice he can give is that she try to make the decisions she can live with. An emotional Renee tells him she does not know what to say, and Jack gently caresses her face and tells her not to say anything. Jack is then taken to the hospital, and Renee takes Wilson to the FBI headquarters. Renee enters to Wilson's holding room and shuts down all the monitoring equipment. When Janis interrupts with a form for Renee to sign, and refuses to leave when she realizes what Renee intends to do, Renee subdues her, forcing her to handcuff herself. Despite Janis's pleas, she puts down her FBI badge, enters the holding room, and closes the door. Season 8 Renee Walker returns in episode 4 of the 8th season and is now a former FBI special agent after an incident with Alan Wilson in season 7 (it is implied that she tortured him to near death). She is summoned to CTU because of her unique knowledge of the Russian Syndicate in New York after having worked as an undercover agent in their ranks six years prior. Brian Hastings, the current director of CTU, requests that she resume her undercover identity to set up a competing buy for the nuclear fuel rods President Hassan's brother is attempting to procure. Unhappy with her decision to go back undercover, Jack attempts to convince her that she is too mentally fragile to handle the operation. Despite her inability to return to a normal life, and recent suicide attempt, Renee decides that she will indeed agree to go back undercover. After Jack fails to dissuade Brian Hastings from allowing Renee to go back undercover, he volunteers his field experience as her partner in the operation. The initial stage of the operation involves locating the head of the Russian Syndicate in New York, a man named Vladimir Laitanin. Renee visits an old accomplice in the mob, who is presently on parole, to convince him to take her and Jack to Vladimir. After a brief conversation with her contact, he declines to help her because of the monitoring device attached to his arm which is part of the conditions of his parole. She convinces the contact that she is able to remove the device without alerting the authorities. She then proceeds to place her contact's arm in a vise and without warning removes his thumb and the device with a nearby power saw. Upon hearing the contact's screams, Jack rushes into the contacts shop to see what Renee has done and says that she has gone too far. Jack is persuaded by Renee to continue the mission, and the contact drives Renee to Vladimir as Jack follows. Renee is put through a 'test' of sorts by Vladimir, to make sure she is legit. He believes her cover and she is in. She tells Vladimir that she has a buyer for him (Ernst Meier, who is Jack undercover), someone who is interested in fuel rods. He has connections, and she wants him to call them. Laitanin agrees with a steep price of five million to make the calls alone. She excuses herself to use the shower. She tells Jack over comm that she is going dark. She sleeps with Laitanin to keep her cover. Laitanin reveals to her that his plan is to take the five million 'Meier' is willing to pay for Laitanin's phone calls and kill Meier in the process. Renee tries to warn Jack, but Vladimir chokes her, taking the phone away from her. He tells her not to go against him ever again. Meanwhile, Jack is meeting with Laitanin's men, in a parking lot. Jack has agent Ortiz and his men set, so they can take the men out if need be. Laitanin's men do attempt to eliminate Jack, however Ortiz saves him by eliminating three of the men with support from a sniper on top of a distant building. Jack subdues the fourth and final man, and forces Laitanin to meet with him. After talking with Laitanin, and asking to talk to Renee and being denied, Jack transfers the money. Laitanin's men have their orders to kill Jack, but before their chance, they are killed by Ortiz. Jack is furious at Lugov (Laitanin's man) and orders him to take him to Vladimir to finish their deal. In the next hour, Jack and Lugov arrive at Laitanin's safe house. Jack asks to speak with Renee privately, she assures Vladimir that it is fine. Out of earshot, Jack tells Renee that he plans to take her out of play, so that he can go undercover in her place. She refuses, saying that she is the only reason Laitanin is still going along with the deal, and that pulling her out now will make what she has done for nothing. Laitanin interrupts them, saying that they need to start making calls before the deal takes place. Renee, Jack, and Laitanin go back into his office and he begins making calls. As he hangs up with another contact who knows nothing, he asks Renee to cut him some bread. He offers a vodka to Jack, which he takes, reluctantly. He goes back to Renee and suggestively helps her cut the bread, he thanks 'Meier' for breaking in Renee in the six years since he'd seen her. Jack tells him to stop wasting time and make more phone calls. Laitanin gets angry and sends Jack out to wait with Lugov, and his other man out to get more vodka. Laitanin apologizes for the late hour, then announces he has a business proposition regarding nuclear rods newly on the market. Knowing that Bazhaev is the only person with an organization that could pull off such a deal, he offers to put him on the phone with a buyer, but Bazhaev furiously denies any knowledge, saying that nobody deals in nuclear materials, and hangs up. Laitanin tells Renee that nobody knows anything about her supposed deal, and threatens to give up. She manages to persuade him to keep trying. Jack gets up and moves toward the office, trying to hear what's happening inside. Laitanin hangs up with Roman, who had no knowledge of the rods, and tells Renee that he has called all his contacts and none of them have turned up anything useful. He ignores her pleas that he keep making calls, saying that they have five million dollars, and each other, which isn't so bad. He is angered when she reveals that she only came for the deal, not him, and punches her in the face. Losing control, she grabs the knife and stabs Laitanin in the eye, proceeding to stab him several times in the throat and chest. She ends up impaling him 17 times. Jack races into the office and tries to pull her off him, only for Renee to spin around and stab Jack. Horrified, she watches as Jack collapses, while Lugov enters and prepares to shoot her. Before he can do so, Jack pulls out the knife and flings it across the room, burying it in Lugov's throat. He then readies his gun and shoots through the wall into the adjacent garage, killing the other guard outside. Jack goes over to Renee and hugs her, noticing the state of Laitanin's body, while she begins to cry. She tells Jack that she doesn't have anything, or anyone. He returns that she has him. Jack and Renee talk about what happened to Vladimir, and Renee seems to need convincing that it was in fact, self-defense. She didn't think it would work, since she stabbed Valdimir so many times. Jack told her it was just that, nothing else. It was self- defense. Meanwhile, Jack calls Cole and tells him and his team to come and pick them up. He also told him of what happened to Laitanin and his men. It was clear to Jack that someone Vladimir called had to know something, they would start there. Cole tells Jack that he and his team are 10 minutes out. Jack and Renee hear the team entering and Jack comments that they really did rush over to them. It turns out that it is Bazhaev's men. He allows himself to be captured after assuring Renee's safety in a water heater closet in the bathroom. When Cole's team gets there they send video of the safehouse. Renee comes out of hiding and immediately wants to know where they took Jack, and Cole said he had no idea what she was talking about. She tells him she's talking about the Russians, she then asks him about the drones they have, Cole tells her no movement has been detected outside the warehouse. Meanwhile, Jack is seen in the tunnel system with Bazhaev's men. Jack is tortured, but ultimately gets free and gets Bazhaev personally. He makes a deal with him, giving him and his son, Josef immunity. He tells them where the rods are, they send a team out and the fuel rods are gone. Jack eventually finds his way back to CTU. Renee is taken back to CTU, they want a statement from her and they want a psychiatric evaluation done on Renee in medical. Chloe takes her statement. Hastings gets a call from the DoD and they tell him that CTU and Hastings will not take the fall for this (Laitanin's death and the supposed dead end in finding the fuel rods). The DoD suggests that Renee take the fall, and he tells Hastings that they are sending some one from their office to interview Renee. Jack calls CTU and gets Chloe, after talking to her, he asks her to patch him through to Renee. Renee and she asks him what he meant that she had him, he tells her that he meant it just like it sounded. She asks him what they do next, and he says that they will figure it out. Jack figures out that they are setting Renee up to have her take the fall, and he busts into the interrogation and chokes the DoD woman, throwing her against the wall. Telling her that after everything Renee has done for this country, this is how they treat her. He then leaves with Renee, only to be stopped at the door by a guard. He tells the guard that he better put his weapon away because he's only going to get hurt. Jack and Renee attempt to leave the room, only Jack ends up on the floor, after being shocked with a stun gun. Jack is taken into custody and to Hastings office, Renee is taken to medical. Later, Hastings agrees to drop the charges against Walker only if Jack would help CTU until the entire threat is over. After CTU is taken out by the EMP bomb, Chloe calls Renee to say Jack is missing. She tells Chloe to \\"do what you have to\\" to get CTU back on-line. She leaves to find Jack at the docks area. Just as one of the snipers lines up to kill Jack, she takes him out with a shot to his head. Seconds later, she kills the remaining sniper, saving Jack and Agent Ortiz. After failing to rescue Hassan, Renee goes to Jack's apartment with him and the two have sex. Shortly after talking with Chloe and being informed that Samir (who executed Hassan) died, Renee says that she recognized one of the EMT's as possibly being part of the Russian crime ring she infiltrated years ago. Following this, she is shot by a sniper. Jack rushes her to the hospital, but she eventually dies. Renee's death is honored with the final silent clock of the episode. Her death prompts Jack to seek violent retribution against those responsible. Among others he brutally tortures and kills the sniper Pavel Tokarev, and also kills CTU mole Dana Walsh, Russian foreign minister Mikhail Novakovich (along with seven of his bodyguards) and planned to assassinate President Yuri Suvarov before being talked out of it by Chloe O'Brian, who told him that Renee would not want him to do this in her name.

Description It grows as an erect, multi-stemmed shrub, with a lignotuber, from 0.3 to two metres high. It has slender needle- like leaves from two to 17 centimetres long and 0.6 to 2.25 millimetres wide, and panicles of white or grey flowers. Taxonomy It was first published in 1838 by Stephan Endlicher, based on material collected by Charles von Hügel from the vicinity of King George Sound. It has since had a fairly involved taxonomic history. In 1839, John Lindley published a purported new species, C. sclerophyllum, but this has since been demoted to a subspecies of C. stoechadis. In 1848, Carl Meissner published C. canaliculatum; this was demoted to a variety of C. stoechadis by George Bentham in 1870, but has since between restored to specific rank. In 1919, Michel Gandoger published two new species, C. elegantulum and C. proximum, but both of these have since been found to be synonymous with C. stoechadis. In each case, the current status was designated by Eleanor Bennett's 1995 treatment of Conospermum for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. There are two subspecies: C. stoechadis subsp. sclerophyllum and the autonym C. stoechadis subsp. stoechadis. Distribution and habitat It occurs on sand and laterite, on sandplains throughout the Southwest Botanic Province, and also east as far as Southern Cross. Ecology It is not considered threatened.

Monsignor Ocáriz is the fourth person to head Opus Dei since its founding in 1928. He is widely published in philosophy and has been a consultor of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith since 1986. Life, studies and work Fernando Ocáriz Braña was born in Paris on 27 October 1944 to José Ocáriz Gómez and María Dolores Braña, and is the youngest of eight children. He joined Opus Dei on September 7, 1961. He studied Physics at the University of Barcelona, where he graduated in 1966. In the 1960s, as a theology student, he lived in Rome alongside Saint Josemaría Escrivá, the founder of Opus Dei. He received a licentiate in theology from the Pontifical Lateran University in 1969 and a doctorate in theology from the University of Navarra in 1971. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1971, and was especially involved in ministry to young people and to university students during the first years of his priesthood. Since 1986, he has been a consultor of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, as well as other departments of the Roman Curia: the Congregation for the Clergy (since 2003) and the Pontifical Council for Promoting the New Evangelization (since 2011). He has also been a member of the Pontifical Theological Academy since 1989. In 2009, it was announced that he would participate in the doctrinal discussions between the Society of St. Pius X and the Holy See. In the early 1980s, Ocáriz was among the professors who began the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross, where he was a tenured professor (now Emeritus Professor) in Fundamental Theology. Ocáriz was appointed Vicar General of the Prelature of Opus Dei on 23 April 1994. In 2014, he was named Auxiliary Vicar of Opus Dei. He became the provisional head of Opus Dei upon the death of the then Prelate of Opus Dei, Javier Echevarria, in December 2016. He was elected the new prelate of Opus Dei on 23 January 2017, and on the same day was appointed by Pope Francis as such. Prelate of Opus Dei A few weeks after his election, on 14 February 2017, Ocariz transmitted to the members of the prelature the conclusions of the General Congress of Opus Dei, outlining the main priorities of the prelature. Among the priorities, the foremost place was given to the centrality of the Person of Jesus Christ. Ocariz explained that this means: *Go deeper into contemplative prayer in the midst of the world, and to help others to walk in paths of contemplation; *Rediscover the value of ascetical means; *Reach whole person: intelligence, will, heart, relationships with others; *Foster inner freedom, to do things out of love; *Help to think, so decide with personal responsibility; *Trust in the grace of God, to be on the alert against voluntarism and sentimentality *Express the ideal of the Christian life without confusing it with perfectionism, accepting one's own weakness and that of others; *Practice hopeful abandonment, based on divine filiation On the process of formation, he stressed, aside from the supernatural means: *Clear, positive, encouraging tone *Encouraging active participation *Showing practical impact to lead towards unity of life *Attitudes such as humility, joy, generosity and sincere interest in others On the Catholic Church, Ocariz pointed to: *Developing mutual appreciation among the faithful of the Church *Dealing closely with Bishops and priests *Collaborating in catechesis, premarital courses, social work, in parishes or other places that need it On new apostolic challenges, the prelate specified: *All to be protagonists of new culture, new legislation, new fashion *Continuous self-improvement in gift of tongues and empathy *Getting and training experts *Developing a personalized plan of formation *Training opinion leaders *Full support to educational work *Starting new educational center to reach both children and parents On the family, the priorities are: *Support for the mutual love of spouses and the Christian life of the family *Shaping public opinion in favor of large families On the youth, Ocariz stressed the importance of this apostolate: *Teaching prayer *Teaching values of friendship, study, reading, professional excellence, fortitude, temperance, service *Teaching the youth to give reason for their faith and value total self-giving to God, and vocation to form a Christian family *Developing attractive ways to continue dealings with graduates (former parents and students): young professionals, single or newly married. *Professionalizing alumni associations *Performing works of mercy, spiritual and corporal *Deep study of Social Doctrine of the Church, through courses and conferences *Promoting research with international impact Writings He has written a number of philosophical and theological works, specializing in the areas of fundamental theology, christology, ecclesiology and the questions regarding the spirit of Opus Dei. *Hijos de Dios en Cristo, Pamplona 1969 *Hijos de Dios en Cristo.

The dam's purpose includes flood mitigation, hydro-power, irrigation, water supply and conservation. The impounded reservoir is called Lake Pindari. Location and features Commenced in 1967 and completed in 1969, the Pindari Dam is a minor dam on the (New South Wales branch of the) Severn River, and is located approximately north of Inverell, on the upper reaches of the river, within the Border Rivers region. The dam was built by Citra Australia Limited under contract to the New South Wales Water Department of Land and Water Conservation. The dam wall height is and is long.

The ungated uncontrolled rock cut with concrete sill spillway is capable of discharging . An upgrade of facilities in 1995 involved doubling the height of the wall from its original and increasing capacity to its current levels. Pindari Dam is operated in conjunction with Queensland's Glenlyon Dam, located on the Dumaresq River, to supply NSW water users in the Border Rivers valley. The name of the dam originates from the Aboriginal words meaning \\"high rock\\" and is the name of an early pastoral run which adjoined the reservoir.

Scaramouche became public domain in the United States on January 1, 2019. Plot André-Louis Moreau (Ramon Novarro) loves Aline de Kercadiou (Alice Terry), the niece of his godfather, Quintin de Kercadiou (Lloyd Ingraham), and she him. However Quintin would prefer she married the Marquis de la Tour d'Azyr (Lewis Stone), a middle-aged nobleman, rather than someone who does not even know who his parents are. One day, expert swordsman de la Tour first toys with, then kills André's friend Philippe de Vilmorin in a duel. André turns to the King's Lieutenant for justice. However, when the official learns who the accused is, he immediately orders André's arrest. André flees. Meanwhile, France nears the brink of revolution. When one orator in favor of liberty and equality is shot down by a soldier, André fearlessly takes his place and remains undaunted when he is grazed by a bullet. When the dragoons are called out to disperse the mob, an admirer named Chapelier helps André escape. He joins a wandering theatre troupe led by Challefau Binet (James A. Marcus). André writes better plays for them to perform, and they become very successful, eventually performing at a theatre in Paris. André becomes engaged to Binet's daughter, Climène (Edith Allen). Aline and de la Tour attend a performance of his latest work, however, and she and André spot each other. She goes to see him, but he does not wish to renew their relationship. De la Tour, despite loving Aline, cannot help trifling with Climène. By chance, Aline and Countess de Plougastel (Julia Swayne Gordon), with whom she is staying, see him in a carriage with Climène. Aline informs de la Tour she never wants to see him again. De la Tour blackmails the countess into helping him, reminding her of an incident in her past. Meanwhile, in the National Assembly, the aristocrats, unable to effectively respond to the reform-minded delegates with words, resort to duels to eliminate their leading opponents. Chief among the duelists is de la Tour. In desperation, Danton and Chapelier recruit André to reply in kind. The Chevalier de Chabrillone (William Humphrey) is his first victim. Eventually, he gets what he wants: a duel with de la Tour. He disarms his foe, then allows him to pick up his sword. After André wounds the nobleman in his sword arm, de la Tour gives up. When news reaches Paris that the Austrians and Prussians have invaded France in support of the beleaguered King Louis XVI, the French Revolution erupts. In the fighting, de la Tour is overwhelmed and left for dead. When he revives, he staggers to the residence of the countess. André heads there too, to rescue his love and his mother the countess (whose identity has been revealed to him by de Kercadiou), armed with a passport signed by Danton authorizing him to do anything he wants. When the two bitter enemies spot each other, de la Tour demands the passport. André refuses, whereupon de la Tour draws a pistol. The countess throws herself in front of de la Tour, then reveals that he is in fact André's father. The two men have an initially uneasy reconciliation. When de la Tour starts to leave, André offers him his sword. Thus armed, de la Tour faces the rioters in the street and perishes. André places the two women in a covered carriage. At the Paris gate, a man spots the aristocrats inside and demands they be handed over to the mob. Moreau pleads with them to let them go for his sake. The masses respond with extravagant sentimentality, and the trio are allowed to leave Paris.

He was a member of the Trencavel family, ruling the lands of the elder branch. He was the second son of Bernard Ato IV and Cecilia of Provence.Cheyette, 26. When his father died in 1129, he redistributed his six viscounties between his three sons. The eldest, Roger I received Carcassonne, Albi, and Razès; Raymond received Béziers and Agde; while the youngest, Bernard Ato V, received Nîmes.Graham-Leigh, 42. In 1132 Roger and Raymond agreed that in the event of Roger's death without heirs, Carcassonne would pass to Raymond. In 1150 Roger died and his three viscounties all passed to Raymond. After a series of disputes, the viscounty of Agde was divided between Raymond and Bernard Ato, with the latter holding the title. In November of the same year that he inherited his brother's viscounties, Raymond made a treaty with Raymond Berengar IV, Count of Barcelona whereby he swore fealty to the count of Barcelona and agreed to hold Carcassonne, Razès, and Lautrec from the count as a vassal. The sixteenth-century historian, Gerónimo Zurita, wrote in the Anales de la Corona de Aragón (\\"Annals of the Crown of Aragon\\") that Raymond Berengar IV marched an army to Narbonne to intimidate Raymond to submit, but there is no primary contemporaneous source which verifies this.Graham-Leigh, 110. However, Raymond Berengar IV had been at Arles in September to negotiate a truce with Raymond des Baux to put an end to the Baussenque Wars and was probably accompanied by an armed host, so it is at least probable that he had an army present in the region at the time when he made the treaty with Raymond. In 1151 Raymond made a mutual defence treaty with Ermengard of Narbonne, but he included a clause which prohibited him from being required to wage war on Toulouse.Graham-Leigh, 111. That Raymond was still trying to maintain his rapidly disintegrating alliance with Toulouse following his submission to Barcelona may imply that his submission had not been voluntary. In 1152 Raymond acquired Mèze in a purchase from his nephew Gerald de Roussillon.Graham-Leigh, 11. In 1158 the agreement with Raymond Berengar was renewed. Throughout his career Raymond had very good relations with Alfonso Jordan, Count of Toulouse, and accompanied him on the Second Crusade in 1147. He remained with Alfonso until the latter died in 1148.Graham-Leigh, 98. After his return to Europe, however, relations with Toulouse went sour -- possibly concerning Raymond's sworn allegiance to Barcelona -- and he quarrelled with Alfonso's son Raymond V, who imprisoned him in 1153. He was released only on the payment of a ransom of 3,000 Marks in 1154. Though William of Newburgh states that Raymond was deprived of his lands by the count of Toulouse, charter evidence from 1155 to 1157 indicates that he lost no major possession.Graham-Leigh, 101. Out of hatred for the count of Toulouse, Raymond participated in Henry II of England's expedition against Toulouse in 1159.Graham-Leigh, 99. By 1163 he had made peace with Toulouse and the count had reimbursed him for the ransom of 1153. In 1131, at the very onset of his reign, Raymond was confronted with the formation of a consulate, a political office then becoming popular in the cities of southern France. Consuls were usually high-ranking citizens, but they could be noblemen or courtiers as well.Graham-Leigh, 147 n148. Towards the end of his reign Raymond seems to have supported the nobles against the citizens and this got him murdered in the cathedral of Béziers in 1167.Graham-Leigh, 147. While he was campaigning with his nephew Bernard Ato VI against Raymond of Toulouse, he was forced to mediate between a knight and a citizen and, choosing in favour of the knight, he punished the citizen (apparently moderately). Nonetheless, there was outrage among citizenry and Raymond arranged a meeting in Béziers. The bourgeoisie arrived secretly armed and, on a signal, assaulted and killed the viscount. By his wife Saure, Raymond left a son and successor, Roger II, who inherited all his viscounties, but was unable to occupy Béziers until 1168, despite a siege led by Alfonso II of Aragon on his behalf in 1167. Roger punished the citizens of Béziers by permitting the Aragonese troops to enter the city and kill them. Raymond's death possibly forms the subject matter of the poem A People Grieving for the Death of their Lord by Guillem Augier Novella.Graham-Leigh, 31. His death is recorded by such diverse chroniclers as William of Newburgh, Robert of Torigny, Gaufred de Vigeois, and Pierre des Vaux-de-Cernay.Graham-Leigh, 17. The chronicle of Newburgh, however, refers to Raymond as \\"Guillem\\" and can thus not be counted as completely reliable, though the details surrounding his death are largely corroborated. Vaux-de- Cernay, on the other hand, describes the massacre of 7,000 citizens of Béziers by the Albigensian Crusade in 1209 as divine justice on the city for the treachery shown to their lord and their bishop, who had had his teeth knocked out trying to defend Raymond from attack.Graham-Leigh, 26.

The state highway runs from MD 65 in Fairplay north to the Pennsylvania state line near Cearfoss, where the highway continues as Pennsylvania Route 163 (PA 163). MD 63 is an L-shaped route that passes through central Washington County on the south and west sides of Hagerstown. The state highway connects with multiple local and long-distance highways that serve Hagerstown, including Interstate 81 (I-81) and U.S. Route 11 (US 11) in Williamsport and I-70 and US 40 in Huyett. MD 63 also joins MD 68 in a concurrency through Williamsport. The Spielman Road portion of MD 63 was constructed in two segments from Spielman to Downsville and from there to Williamsport in the mid 1910s and early 1930s, respectively. The Greencastle Pike portion of MD 63, which follows a former turnpike, was constructed as MD 398 from Williamsport to Cearfoss in the early 1930s. MD 63 was extended to its present termini, assuming MD 398, and was rebuilt from Williamsport to Huyett in the late 1950s. The state highway was reconstructed along with MD 68 south of Williamsport concurrent with I-81 in the mid-1960s. Route description MD 63 begins at an intersection with MD 65 (Sharpsburg Pike) in the hamlet of Fairplay. The state highway heads west as Spielman Road, a narrow and curvaceous two-lane undivided highway through farmland and scattered residences. MD 63 crosses a one-lane bridge over Marsh Run just prior to Reichard Road; makes a sharp turn to the south adjacent to Marsh Mills; makes another sharp turn to the west; crosses a one-lane bridge over St. James Run; and crosses Norfolk Southern Railway's Hagerstown District at-grade in the hamlet of Spielman. The state highway widens as it starts to curve to the northwest through farmland, crossing Downey Branch and intersecting MD 632 (Downsville Pike) in the village of Downsville. MD 63 passes the historic home Rose Hill, crosses a Winchester and Western Railroad line at-grade, then makes a turn to the east and intersects MD 68 (Lappans Road). Governor Lane Boulevard continues east through an industrial park while MD 63 turns north to join MD 68 in a concurrency north into Williamsport. View north along MD 63 at MD 632 in Downsville MD 63 and MD 68 expand to a four-lane divided highway through their interchange with I-81 (Maryland Veterans Memorial Highway). A park and ride lot is located within the northwest quadrant of this interchange. At the northern end of the interchange, the state highways enter the town of Williamsport, where the highways follow municipally-maintained Conococheague Street through the Williamsport Historic District. In the center of town, the two highways meet US 11 (Potomac Street). MD 68 continues north while MD 63 turns east onto Potomac Street to join US 11 in a short concurrency. MD 63 leaves US 11 by turning north onto Artizan Street. At the north town limit of Williamsport, state maintenance resumes and MD 63's name changes to Greencastle Pike. The old alignment of MD 63, Honeyfield Road, parallels the state highway on the west as the highway enters a mix of farmland, forest, and industrial properties and crosses over Semple Run and CSX's Lurgan Subdivision. MD 63 crosses a tributary of Conococheague Creek and expands to a four-lane divided highway through its interchange with I-70 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway). MD 63 northbound/MD 68 westbound in Williamsport MD 63 continues north as a two-lane undivided highway past several industrial parks and farms before intersecting US 40 (National Pike) in the village of Huyett, where the highway is paralleled by the old alignment, Huyett Lane, to the east. The state highway starts to curve to the northeast through farmland, crossing Rush Run and intersecting Broadfording Road before approaching the village of Cearfoss. MD 63 intersects MD 494 (Fairview Road) before meeting MD 58 (Cearfoss Pike) and the county-maintained portion of Cearfoss Pike at the Cearfoss Roundabout. Shortly thereafter, the state highway reaches its northern terminus at the Pennsylvania state line. The highway continues as PA 163, which immediately turns east onto Mason Dixon Road to closely parallel the state line east to I-81 and US 11. Williamsport Pike continues north as a quadrant route called State Route 3001 toward Greencastle. History MD 63 was originally assigned to Spielman Road between Spielman and Williamsport. The portion of the highway from Williamsport north to Cearfoss was originally MD 398, which was the descendant of the 19th century Williamsport and Greencastle Turnpike. MD 63 was paved from the Norfolk and Western Railway at Spielman west to Downsville in 1916. Spielman Road was paved from Downsville to Williamsport in 1933. MD 63 originally had its northern terminus at MD 68 at the southern town limit of Williamsport, now the corner of Artizan Street and Sunset Avenue. MD 68 followed Sunset Avenue from the direction of Lappans to the MD 63 junction, then turned north along Artizan Street to its northern terminus at US 11. MD 398 was paved from US 11 to the branch of Conococheague Creek just south of present-day I-81 in 1930. Greencastle Pike was constructed to Cearfoss by 1933. MD 63 began to take its modern form in the late 1950s. The MD 63 designation was extended east from Spielman to MD 65 in Fairplay in 1957. MD 63 was also extended north past US 11 and replaced MD 398 between Williamsport and Cearfoss. The state highway was extended north from Cearfoss to the Pennsylvania state line in 1958. Reconstruction and relocation of the highway from the northern limit of Williamsport to a short distance north of US 40 in Huyett began in 1957. The realignments bypassed what are now Honeyfield Road, Celeste Drive, Kemps Mill Road, and Rock Hill Road north of Williamsport and Huyett Lane in Huyett. The Williamsport-Huyett project included a bridge over the Western Maryland Railway that was completed in 1959. MD 63 was later expanded to a four-lane divided highway concurrent with the construction of its interchange with I-70, which opened in 1967 along with the stretch of I-70 from MD 68 to I-81. Construction shifted to the south side of Williamsport in the mid-1960s. MD 68, which had been extended west to Clear Spring in 1956, was relocated south of Williamsport, replacing Sunset Avenue and what is now Kendle Road, in 1965. MD 68 was relocated for a grade separation of the Cumberland Valley Railroad and to tie into an interchange with I-81 and the south end of Conococheague Street. MD 63's route north into Williamsport, Artizan Street, was cut off by the construction of I-81, so the state highway joined MD 68 in a concurrency north to US 11. The new alignment of MD 63 and MD 68 was built as a four-lane divided highway around the interchange with I-81, which originally only contained ramps to and from the direction of West Virginia when the interchange opened with the completion of I-81 in 1966. That interchange was completed with ramps to and from Hagerstown between 1981 and 1989.

Plot summary Man Crazy is told from the point of view of a young woman, Ingrid Boone, writing to her therapist about her life. At the beginning of the novel Ingrid's father, Luke Boone, a hot tempered Vietnam veteran, is absent and on the run after killing a man over a drug deal. Ingrid and her beautiful mother, Chloe Boone, drift from place to place as Chloe carries out a series of relationships with different men. Chloe's attention is directed to her lovers and to alcohol more than to her daughter. In adolescence, Ingrid begins to self-harm, compulsively scratching her face and body to the point of inflicting sores. She also turns to promiscuity and drug abuse. She doesn't have any real friends and is known as \\"Doll Girl\\" as she openly gives herself to much of the school's male population. Despite her troubles, Ingrid is a good student and wins a prize for a poem, which she is asked to read at a school assembly. Her anxiety and low self-esteem cause her to appear in front of the school with her face bloody from scratching and reading, not her own, but another poet's work. After leaving home, Ingrid gets involved with Enoch Skaggs, a brutal, charismatic leader of the motorcycle gang/cult, Satan's Children. Her nickname becomes \\"Dog Girl\\" because of her blind devotion to the cruel Skaggs. She undergoes one dehumanizing act after another: gang rape, physical mutilation, being locked in a cellar for days, and watching a sacrificial killing. In a last-minute escape, Ingrid is rescued when there is a showdown between the biker gang and the police. Ingrid undergoes counseling, including the telling of her story, and a suggestion is given of a relationship with her doctor.  Literary criticism  Brigitte Frase of the San Francisco Chronicle called the novel well-constructed but seemingly constructed from psychological profiles of dysfunctional families, traumatized war veterans, and cult leaders and followers. A. O. Scott of the New York Review of Books felt that the violence seemed gratuitous because of the \\"absence of a persuasive context\\" and that Skaggs's hold over Ingrid was insufficiently explained. Scott called the prose \\"fluid but impersonally competent\\".

History The Christeen, recognized as a National Historic Landmark, was built in 1883 for Captain William Smith to harvest oysters in Oyster Bay and Cold Spring Harbor. Throughout her long life the Christeen worked in the waters of Greenport, Southhold, Connecticut, and New Jersey. The sloop was named for Captain Smiths 13-year-old wife. In 1914 an engine was installed and the Christeen was used as a cargo vessel transporting potatoes between Long Island and New London, and furniture and other goods between New York City and the eastern end of Long Island. From 1958 to 1976 she was a pleasure yacht and finally in 1989 was abandoned and nearly sunk in New London, Connecticut. After being saved by Tradewinds Education Network in Connecticut, the Christeen was donated to the Oyster Bay non-profit organization Friends of the Bay and in 1991 she finally returned home. After surviving 16 major hurricanes, numerous nor'easters, and severe neglect, the Christeen was restored and set sail to work on Oyster Bay Harbor again, this time fulfilling her new mission: to serve as a floating classroom to educate students of all ages about the operation of historic vessels and protection of the marine environment of Oyster Bay and Long Island Sound.

The state highway runs from U.S. Route 40 (US 40) in Hagerstown east to the Pennsylvania state line near Ringgold, where the highway continues as Pennsylvania Route 997 (PA 997). MD 64 is an L-shaped route in northeastern Washington County, connecting Hagerstown with Smithsburg, Cavetown, and Chewsville and Smithsburg with Ringgold and Waynesboro, Pennsylvania. The state highway is maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration except for the municipally-maintained portion within the city limits of Hagerstown. MD 64 was once a turnpike between Hagerstown and Smithsburg. The state highway was constructed from Smithsburg to the Pennsylvania state line in the mid 1910s and from Hagerstown to Smithsburg in the early 1920s. MD 64 was reconstructed in its entirety in the 1950s, resulting in bypasses of all four communities east of Hagerstown the highway serves. Route description MD 64 begins at an intersection with US 40 (Dual Highway) in a commercial area adjacent to the municipal golf course in the eastern part of the city of Hagerstown. The state highway heads north as Cleveland Avenue, a two-lane undivided street through a residential neighborhood. MD 64 turns east onto Jefferson Street, which heads east across Hamilton Run past Westwood Street, beyond which the highway leaves the city limits and becomes state-maintained. Jefferson Street becomes Jefferson Boulevard at Pangborn Boulevard. MD 64 crosses Antietam Creek and passes close to Antietam Hall as the highway passes between residential subdivisions. The state highway intersects Robinwood Drive, which passes through the suburb of Robinwood and Hagerstown Community College, before beginning to parallel CSX's Hanover Subdivision just west of Chewsville. MD 64 veers east away from the rail line as Track Side Drive, which is unsigned MD 804 and the old alignment of MD 64, continues to parallel the tracks. MD 804 provides access to the southern end of MD 62. MD 64 receives the other end of MD 804, Twin Springs Drive, on the east side of Chewsville. View east along MD 64 at MD 77 in Smithsburg After passing between salvage yards, MD 64 continues east through farmland. The state highway passes between a pair of residential subdivisions before crossing Beaver Creek and reaching Cavetown. Old Georgetown Road parallels the north side of the highway as the old alignment while MD 64 bypasses the unincorporated village to the south, where the highway intersects MD 66 (Mapleville Road) and its name changes to Smithsburg Pike. MD 64 curves to the northeast, intersecting Cavetown Church Road, unsigned MD 844 and the old alignment of MD 77, and modern MD 77 (Foxville Road), which heads east opposite Leitersburg Smithsburg Road, which heads northwest into the town of Smithsburg. MD 64 intersects the southern end of MD 491 (Raven Rock Road) and crosses over the Hanover Subdivision before curving to the north. The state highway veers north and intersects Fruit Tree Drive and Water Street, which were formerly MD 92, then continues northwest and meets the northern end of MD 66 (Bradbury Avenue), which is the old alignment of MD 64 heading north from Smithsburg. MD 64 continues north, crossing Little Antietam Creek before reaching the community of Ringgold, where the highway intersects Windy Haven Road, the old alignment of MD 64, and MD 418 (Ringgold Pike). MD 64 receives the other end of the old alignment, Barkdoll Road, before reaching its eastern terminus at the Pennsylvania state line. The highway continues north as PA 997 (Anthony Highway) toward Waynesboro. MD 64 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from Eastern Boulevard in Hagerstown east to MD 77 near Smithsburg. History One of the predecessor highways of MD 64 was the Hagerstown and Smithsburg Turnpike between the two municipalities. The other major section of MD 64, the highway from Smithsburg to the Pennsylvania state line, was paved in 1916. The Hagerstown-Smithsburg highway was paved around 1923. The all-weather highway generally followed the old turnpike except for a deviation just west of Chewsville to avoid two grade crossings of the Western Maryland Railway. Within Hagerstown, MD 64 was marked from US 40 (now US 40 Alternate) north along Mulberry Street to Jefferson Street. By 1950, MD 64's western terminus was moved to the new US 40 and used Cannon Avenue to reach Jefferson Street. The state highway was moved to its present course along Cleveland Avenue in 1954. MD 64's name east from Hagerstown has varied, being named Cavetown Pike by 1950, becoming Smithsburg Pike by 1964, and changed to Jefferson Boulevard around 1983. MD 64 was rebuilt from end-to-end in the 1950s. The first section to be reconstructed was from the Hagerstown city limit to just west of Chewsville in 1952. The next section, from just west of Chewsville to just west of Cavetown, was completed in 1954 and featured the bypass of Chewsville. The third section was a bypass of Cavetown from just west of the community to Wolfsville Road, now MD 64's intersection with MD 77. That highway was completed in 1956. The old alignment through Chewsville was designated MD 804. The final two segments of MD 64 to be worked on were from Wolfsville Road to south of Ringgold, completing the bypass of Smithsburg; and from south of Ringgold to the Pennsylvania state line, including a bypass of Ringgold. Both projects were completed in 1958. The old alignment of MD 64 from Cavetown to north of Smithsburg, consisting of Water Street, Pennsylvania Avenue, and Bradbury Avenue, was remarked as a northern extension of MD 66.

MD 65 connects central and southern Washington County and serves as the primary access point to Antietam National Battlefield. The state highway, which was originally laid out as a turnpike, was constructed in its modern form in the mid-1920s. MD 65 was rebuilt in the early 1950s and relocated through Antietam National Battlefield by the early 1980s. Route description MD 65 begins at an intersection with MD 34 (Main Street) in the town of Sharpsburg. Church Street continues south toward Burnside's Bridge across Antietam Creek. MD 65 leaves Sharpsburg and heads north as two-lane undivided Sharpsburg Pike through Antietam National Battlefield, where the highway curves to the northwest and back north while the old alignment of MD 65, Dunker Church Road, continues straight to serve as the main entrance to the battlefield park.

MD 65 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from MD 63 at Fairplay north to its northern terminus in Hagerstown. History The predecessor highway of MD 65 was the 19th century Hagerstown and Sharpsburg Turnpike. The first section of modern MD 65 was paved from Hagerstown to a point between Lappans and Fairplay around 1923. The remainder of the highway was completed south to Sharpsburg in 1926. MD 65 was extended south along Church Street and Burnside Bridge Road to Burnside's Bridge between 1930 and 1933. By 1961, MD 65's southern terminus was rolled back to MD 34. MD 65 was rebuilt and widened from Sharpsburg to Hagerstown in 1952 and 1953. MD 65's interchange with I-70 opened in 1968 when I-70 was completed from I-81 east to US 40. The interchange originally had two straight ramps on the north side of the interchange and two loop ramps on the south side; a straight ramp from eastbound I-70 to southbound MD 65 was added around 1995. MD 65 was placed on a new alignment through Antietam National Battlefield by 1981. Junction list Auxiliary route MD 65A is the designation for Colonel Henry K.

It operates 24 acute care hospitals and over 200 clinics in Northern California. Sutter Hospital Association was founded in 1921 as a response to the 1918 flu pandemic. Named for nearby Sutter's Fort, its first hospital opened in 1923. Later known as Sutter Community Hospitals, the organization eventually merged with a number of struggling hospitals in the surrounding area. In 1996, Sutter merged with California Healthcare System, expanding its footprint into the San Francisco Bay Area. History  Origins  The organization takes its name from one of Sacramento’s original European settlements, Sutter's Fort, built by California pioneer John Sutter. In response to the 1918 flu pandemic, community leaders constructed the first Sutter Hospital in the vicinity of the fort, replacing an old adobe house that had previously served as a makeshift hospital. Sutter Medical Center, Sacramento occupies this site today. Other Sutter Health-affiliated hospitals date back to the 1800s and were some of Northern California's earliest health care providers. For example, California Pacific Medical CenterCalifornia Pacific Medical Center Women Pioneers in San Francisco Medicine, San Francisco Medical Society. SFMS.org in San Francisco was formed out of successive hospital and medical school mergers dating back to the city's earliest days of organized medicine. In 1866, the predecessor of today's Sutter Medical Center of Santa Rosa opened its doors to residents of Sonoma County. Many of the health care facilities that eventually became part of the Sutter Health network were created as charitable hospitals by community members in cities coping with growing populations, epidemics, fires, floods and earthquakes.Sacunion.com Late 20th Century Government cutbacks, the advent of managed care, and other financial pressures fueled an increase in hospital and physician organization mergers, acquisitions and affiliations.California's Closed Hospitals, Nicholas C.

Meanwhile, in the San Francisco Bay Area, another affiliation of hospitals was forming. By 1986, Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco, Mills- Peninsula Hospital in San Mateo and Marin General Hospital in Greenbrae had created an affiliation known as California Healthcare System (CHS). Berkeley- based Alta Bates Corporation (now known as Alta Bates Summit Medical Center) joined CHS in 1992, the same year that saw the creation of California Pacific Medical Center, formed through a merger of Pacific Presbyterian and Children's Hospital of San Francisco.

Ninety-Five Barrels Alleged Apple Cider Vinegar, 265 U.S. 438 (1924), was an in rem case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that apple cider vinegar is mislabeled when that vinegar is made from dried apples.. The label at issue indicated that the vinegar was made from \\"selected\\" apples. Douglas Packing Company, the manufacturer, admitted to dehydrating fresh apples and then re-hydrating the apples with pure water to produce vinegar. Additional chemicals were used in the manufacturing process for vinegar made from dried apples, but neither party alleged that this affected the vinegar. Other than this and the difference in apples, the manufacturing process was the same. The trial judge, who tried samples of the vinegar at issue and apple cider vinegar made from fresh apples, concluded that there were only slight differences in appearance and taste. Chemical comparison yielded similar results for both liquids. There was no claim that vinegar from dried apples was of inferior quality. However, the court found first that the dried apple vinegar was not identical to vinegar as commonly understood—that produced from fresh ingredients. Second, fresh apples contain the apple juice that is normally used in the production of apple cider vinegar, whereas Douglas Packing used water as a substitute ingredient. Finally, the court found that \\"made from selected apples\\" misled the reader into thinking that the apples were fresh instead of dried. These three issues—an imitation under the same name, false or misleading ingredient listing, and misleading labelling—were all a part of the Pure Food and Drug Act section defining \\"misbranded\\". For this reason, the Supreme Court found that the apple cider was misbranded under the statute.

Known as Rohrersville Road, the state highway runs from U.S. Route 340 (US 340) in Weverton north to US 40 Alternate in Boonsboro. MD 67 parallels the western flank of South Mountain in southeastern Washington County, connecting Boonsboro with Weverton and Rohrersville. In conjunction with US 340 and US 40 Alternate, MD 67 connects Hagerstown and Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, a link that made the highway one of the original state roads marked for improvement in 1909. The first section of the state highway was constructed through Rohrersville around 1920. The remainder of the highway was built between Boonsboro and Weverton in the late 1920s and early 1930s. MD 67 was reconstructed with multiple relocations starting in the late 1950s, culminating in a relocation at the southern terminus to tie into the US 340 freeway in the late 1960s. Route description View north along MD 67 in Gapland MD 67 begins at a trumpet interchange with US 340 (Jefferson Pike) in Weverton within the Potomac Water Gap near Harpers Ferry. The two-lane undivided highway crosses Israel Creek and heads north through the Pleasant Valley, the valley of Israel Creek between Elk Ridge to the west and South Mountain to the east. Just north of Israel Creek, MD 67 intersects MD 67D, a connector east to Weverton Road that provides access to the Appalachian Trail at the Weverton Cliffs within South Mountain State Park. Within the hamlet of Garretts Mill, the highway intersects Garretts Mill Road, which heads west toward the Robert Clagett Farm and the Magnolia Plantation, and receives the other end of Weverton Road, which is accessed via MD 67E. MD 67 passes along the edge of Brownsville, which is served by parallel Boteler Road, which uses MD 67C to rejoin MD 67 north of Brownsville. MD 67 continues north around the village of Gapland, access to which is provided by Gapland Road. Gapland Road also heads east to Crampton's Gap, a mountain pass through South Mountain that provides access to Burkittsville in the Middletown Valley. Crampton's Gap is the site of the Battle of Crampton's Gap, Gathland State Park, and the National War Correspondents Memorial. MD 67 crosses Israel Creek near its headwaters, enters the valley of Little Antietam Creek, and approaches Rohrersville. The highway bypasses the village to the east, during which the route crosses Little Antietam Creek; MD 858F (Main Street) loops through the village. The valley widens as MD 67 approaches Rohrersville. MD 67 continues north through Locust Grove and to the west of Park Hall, which contains Kefauver Place. The highway parallels another loop, Mount Carmel Church Road, which leads to the Nicodemus Mill Complex, as the route crosses Dog Creek. MD 67 passes a park and ride and enters the town of Boonsboro immediately before it reaches its northern terminus at US 40 Alternate (Boonsboro Pike). History The highway from Weverton to Boonsboro was marked for improvement by the Maryland State Roads Commission as one of the original state roads in 1909. However, by 1915, the uncompleted highway was deemed as not forming a necessary part of the main arterial system. The first section of MD 67 to be improved was Main Street through Rohrersville, which was paved by 1921. The modern road was extended north to Boonsboro in 1925 and 1926. Construction began on MD 67 from Rohrersville to Gapland in 1926 and was completed in 1928. The paved highway was extended through Brownsville to north of Garretts Mill in 1929 and 1930. The southern end of pavement remained north of Garretts Mill until the modern road was extended south through Weverton to US 340 in 1934 and 1935. MD 67 was reconstructed from Boonsboro to Gapland starting in the late 1950s, leaving behind several sections of old alignment that were designated sections of MD 858. Two of these sections, Main Street in Rohrersville (now MD 858F) and Mount Carmel Church Road north of Rohrersville, were bypassed in 1959. The southern terminus of MD 67 was relocated when US 340 was relocated as a four-lane divided highway through Weverton in 1964. Portions of MD 67 through Brownsville and Weverton were bypassed concurrent with the construction of MD 67's trumpet interchange around 1969.

Over the next several years, he purchased an additional , almost forty different parcels of land, and built of bridle paths. Harriman hired Carrère and Hastings to design a home, which was begun in 1905. Harriman had planned it for many years, but lived in it for only a few months before his death in 1909. The house features a dramatic music room, modeled after a medieval great hall. Around the central courtyard is a brick corridor lined with murals by Barry Faulkner. Harriman commissioned a number of American artists to decorate the house. James Earle Fraser did a bas-relief portrait of Harriman over one of the fireplaces, as well as a fountain in the interior court; Malvina Hoffman did a bust of Mrs. Harriman; and Charles Cary Rumsey did a fountain of the Three Graces, a marble fireplace surround that featured a caricature of architect Thomas Hastings, and corbel carvings of bighorn sheep in the music room.

Fir was built by the Moore Drydock Company in Oakland, California in 1939. On 22 March 1939, the U.S. Lighthouse Tender Fir was launched. She was steam driven with twin screws, in length, had a beam of , drew of water, and displaced 885 tons. Fir was fitted with a reinforced bow and stern, and an ice-belt at her water-line for icebreaking. She was built with classic lines and her spaces were lavishly appointed with mahogany, teak, and brass. The crew did intricate ropework throughout the ship. The cost to build Fir was approximately 390,000. Fir's homeport was Seattle, Washington for all but one of her fifty one years of service when she was temporarily assigned to Long Beach, California when was decommissioned on 1 July 1982. On 1 July 1939 the United States Lighthouse Service became a part of the United States Coast Guard. On 1 October 1940 Fir was commissioned as the United States Coast Guard Cutter Fir (WAGL-212). With the onset of World War II Fir was assigned to the U.S. Department of the Navy and painted battleship grey. The following armament was installed for war service: M2 Browning machine guns, a 3-inch gun, and depth charges. Her wartime duties included picket duty, towing gunnery targets, and patrolling the Washington and Oregon coasts. In 1965, Fir was reclassified as a USCG coastal buoy tender (WLM). On 27 May 1988, after the decommissioning of , Fir gained the distinction as the U.S. Coast Guard's oldest commissioned cutter. In accordance with a Coast Guard custom, she displayed gold hull numbers on her bow and was designated as \\"Queen of the Fleet\\" on 30 May 1988. On 1 October 1990, the 200th anniversary year of the U.S. Coast Guard, Fir was honored again with the celebration on her 50th birthday. One year later, on 1 October 1991 Fir was decommissioned, and; on 27 April 1992 was designated a National Historic Landmark by the United States Secretary of the Interior. During her career, Fir was a multi-mission ship whose accomplishments mirrored the changing American maritime scene, and the needs of the U.S. Coast Guard for more than half a century. Firs primary duties included resupplying coal, potable water, food, and other vital provisions; icebreaking, aids to navigation (ATON) maintenance, delivery and pick-up of U.S. Mail for lightships and lighthouses on the Washington and Oregon coasts. Fir tended the lightships at Umatilla Reef off La Push, Washington and Swiftsure Bank at the entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca Washington. In addition to servicing aids to navigation (ATON), Fir stood war duties during World War II, performed search and rescue missions, marine environmental protection, and law enforcement. For her last project, Fir was tasked to do what she was originally built for in 1939. In July 1991, Fir renovated and restored the Cape Flattery Lighthouse on Tatoosh Island at the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. There is successor cutter also named Fir, , currently in active use by the Coast Guard, which is a cutter. She was launched in 2003 and is based in Astoria, Oregon. History Fir was launched in the United States Lighthouse Service, but completed under the U.S. Coast Guard, making her the last United States Lighthouse Service tender constructed. Sea trials were held on San Francisco Bay on 17 August 1939. The Trial Board consisted of R. R. Tinkham, Chief Lighthouse Engineer, Portland, Oregon; W. C. Dibrell, Superintendent of Lighthouses, Ketchikan, Alaska with F. C. Hingsburg, Superintendent of Lighthouses, Portland, Oregon, acting as his alternate; and F. H. Conant, Assistant Lighthouse Engineer, San Francisco, California. On 18 August 1939, Fir departed for Portland, Oregon. On 30 December 1939, she received orders to proceed to Lake Union, Seattle, Washington. She was commissioned as the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Fir (WAGL-212) on 1 October 1940. On 4 November 1949 Fir rescued 19 persons from MV Andalucia off Neah Bay, Washington. In 1954 Fir assisted the distressed SS Beloit Victory near Destruction Island, Washington. In early June 1958 was taken in tow at Tacoma, Washington, by the U.S. Navy Military Sea Transportation Service's tugboat , destined for San Diego. California. While very near the Swiftsure Bank lightship at the entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Yuma developed engine troubles. Yuma's distress call brought Fir to her rescue. The crew of the Swiftsure lightship went to general quarters, ready to assist. Fir then escorted Yuma and Tinian to safety. On 9 June 1958, Yuma and Tinian arrived at San Diego, California. On 10 August 1958 Bill Muncey crashed his boat Miss Thriftway at the Seattle Seafair unlimited hydroplane races on Lake Washington. Muncey lost rudder control and collided with a USCG 40 foot patrol boat CG-40575. Both boats sunk within minutes, however all personnel involved were rescued and survived with relatively minor injuries. Assisting in the immediate rescue were: CG-40378, USCG Auxiliary Plumb Crazy and a Coast Guard Sikorsky HO4S 2G (or3G) HH-19G helicopter. On 11 August 1958 Fir recovered both boats. CG-40575 was a total loss. In 1959 Fir was engaged in a major search operation for a downed U.S. Navy plane in her operations area. Brief video footage of Fir can seen in a 1961 season episode of Sea Hunt titled \\"Skipper\\". The tender is raising what appears to be a damaged Coast Guard patrol boat. In 1962 Fir salvaged a submerged U.S. Coast Guard HO4S helicopter which had crashed in her operations area. In 1968 Fir assisted in firefighting operations at Todd Shipyards in Seattle, Washington. On 5 July 1990 Fir extinguished a rapidly burning fire in a personal craft at Shilshole Bay, Washington. An entrapped mariner was rescued and his boat was saved. Before decommissioning in 1991, Fir was responsible for 138 lighted and unlighted buoys in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Puget Sound areas. Fir was decommissioned on 1 October 1991, one year after her 50th birthday. Over 600 attendees were on hand to honor the last surviving lighthouse tender in US Coast Guard service. The oldest commissioned cutter award was presented to CDR Philip E. Sherer, USCG, commanding officer of the , by Firs commanding officer LCDR Nutting, USCG. After decommissioning, Fir remained in Seattle, Washington for many years while efforts were made to turn her into a floating museum. When these efforts failed, she was transferred to the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) facility, Suisun Bay, California, in 1997. Her shafts and rudder locked, she was towed 930 miles by to San Francisco's Golden Gate where she was met by a commercial tug that towed her the rest of the way to Suisun Bay. Significant objects were removed from the vessel and stored at a U.S. Coast Guard facility in Forestville, Maryland. On 27 April 1992 Fir was placed on the U.S. National Register of Historical Places and designated a US National Historic Landmark. She was transferred to the Liberty Maritime Museum, Sacramento, California on 30 September 2002. In 2002, she was transferred to the Liberty Maritime Museum, and towed to the Port of Sacramento. In 2003, Fir was towed to Rio Vista, California, where she was moored on the Sacramento River on the eastern or Sacramento County side of the river across from Rio Vista. In November 2007, Fir was put up for sale at an asking price $95,000. The mailing address for the museum is in Sacramento, but the ship was physically located across the river from Rio Vista at . In May 2008, the webpage reports \\"Fir is sold!\\". In June 2010, Fir was moored at Pier 38, San Francisco. In 2012, Fir was owned by Curt Lind and was undergoing restoration by Thomas Young. As of 26 May 2014, Fir is listed for sale at 360,000. The Fir was moved again due to a dispute at Pier 38. The Fir was listed for sale in 2016, with its location is simply listed as the \\"San Francisco Bay Delta, CA\\". That location has been confirmed to be on the Little Potato Slough at the end of Eight Mile Road near Stockton, CA. Fir was purchased by The Lighthouse Project LLC, a Virginia group dedicated to the restoration and repurposing of aids to navigation, in spring 2017. Restoration has commenced.

He was noted for being a radical rock 'n' roll performer. He died on January 29, 1999 due to liver failure caused by Hepatitis C at age 39. He performed his final concert in Atlanta, Georgia on New Year's Eve, 1998. Biography Benjamin lived for many years in Cabbagetown, an \\"unsafe\\" neighborhood in Atlanta, peopled with hustlers and eccentrics. There, he occasionally dressed up as a drag queen from a young age. When he was nine years old, he would appear in public wearing women’s clothing, \\"with a towel on my head like Whoopi (Goldberg), going to the Waffle House in a dress.\\" In New York City, he found work at the famed club CBGB's, which he described as \\"the filthiest place I ever was.\\" He earned $20 a day, his duties consisted of sweeping up broken glass left by performers and audiences the evening prior. Benjamin was a known character in the underground scene in 1980s Atlanta and participated in a number of Atlanta music experiments such as Easturn Stars, Monroe is Naked Again, Freedom Puff, Blade Emotion, and the Opal Foxx Quartet (which often had up to 12 members). His bands played in such venues as 688, Celebrity Club, Pillowtex, Destroy All Music Festival, among others. For the band, Benjamin donned the stage name \\"Miss Opal Foxx.\\" During this time his vocals received media attention and Tom Waits comparisons arose. His voice has since been described as \\"resembling the roar of a wounded lion\\". Benjamin also had a notable stage presence and charisma. As described in the Brooklyn Academy of Music blog:\\"Donning a frayed, cotton dress and a shabby beehive wig, she drags on her cigarette and teases the audience with intermittent flashes of skin, if only they will pay for a glimpse. Ms. Opal Foxx, né Robert Dickerson, queen of a thriving, close- knit music scene in Cabbagetown, a former mill town in Atlanta, Georgia...\\" In a review of the Benjamin Smoke documentary, A.O. Scott of the New York Times wrote, \\"...a wispy, sensitive, self-destructive soul full of sweet beatnik romanticism, pop poetry and entertaining nonsense... Mr. Dickerson, bone thin, his voice ravaged by ill health and cigarettes, has a hustler's easy charm.\\" After some of the musicians of the group died, the band Smoke was conceived in 1992 with members Bill Taft, Brian Halloran, and Todd Butler. Coleman Lewis and Tim Campion later joined the band, followed by Will Fratesi. Smoke was renowned for his on-stage banter, never shying away from provoking his viewers, \\"for a faggot, do I have a rockin' band or what?\\" Shortly before he died, Benjamin opened for a Patti Smith concert in 1997. Benjamin was an amphetamine addict and he also had AIDS, though he claimed \\"HIV is not a death sentence\\". AIDS brought him closer to his mother, though he eventually lost his life due to liver failure, caused by Hepatitis C.

Fortean Times. June 2007. At times, multiple animals are said to have been encased in the same place. Benjamin Franklin wrote an account of four live toads claimed to have been found enclosed in quarried limestone.Benjamin Franklin. \\"An Account of Toads Found Enclosed in Solid Stone.\\" In The Works of Benjamin Franklin, ed. Jared Sparks. Volume VI. 1882. 441–442. In a letter to Julian Huxley, one Eric G. Mackley claimed to have freed 23 frogs from a single piece of concrete while widening a road in Devonshire.

Explanations Though reports of entombed animals have occurred as recently as the 1980s, scientists have paid little serious attention to the phenomenon since the nineteenth century. During the 1820s, English geologist William Buckland conducted an experiment to see how long a toad could remain alive while encased in stone. He placed toads of different sizes and ages into carved chambers within limestone and sandstone blocks, then buried the blocks in his garden. A year later, he dug up the blocks and found that most of the toads were dead and decayed. A few toads that had been in the limestone (which did contain small pores) were still living. However, Buckland found them all dead after reburying them in the limestone for another year. Buckland concluded that toads could not survive inside rock for extreme lengths of time, and determined that reports of the entombed animal phenomenon were mistaken. Most scientists agreed.\\"Curiosities of Natural History\\". Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. March 1858. 360. A writer from the journal Nature wrote in 1910, \\"The true interpretation of these alleged occurrences appears to be simply this - a frog or toad is hopping about while a stone is being broken, and the non-scientific observer immediately rushes to the conclusion that he has seen the creature dropping out of the stone itself. One thing is certainly remarkable, that although numbers of field geologists and collectors of specimens of rocks, fossils, and minerals are hammering away all over the world, not one of these investigators has ever come upon a specimen of a live frog or toad imbedded in stone or in coal.\\"\\"Notes\\". Nature 83 (1910): 406-407. Some of the stories may be based on outright fabrications. Charles Dawson, quite probably the perpetrator of the Piltdown Man hoax, had some years earlier presented the Brighton \\"Toad in the Hole\\" (a toad entombed within a flint nodule), likely another forgery. Dawson presented the toad to the Brighton and Hove Natural History and Philosophical Society on 18 April 1901, claiming that two workmen had found the flint nodule in a quarry north-east of Lewes a couple of years earlier, which revealed a toad inside when they broke it open. The toad was eventually passed on to the Booth Museum of Natural History in Brighton via Henry Willett. However, the toad has since shrunk, suggesting that it cannot have been very old at the time of its discovery. In fiction Perhaps the most famous example of a fictional entombed animal is Merrie Melodies character Michigan J.

It is still available for use in Japan however. It is taken by mouth. Side effects of mestanolone include symptoms of masculinization like acne, increased hair growth, voice changes, and increased sexual desire. It can also cause liver damage. The drug is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It has strong androgenic effects and weak anabolic effects, which make it useful for producing masculine psychological and behavioral effects. The drug has no estrogenic effects. Mestanolone was discovered in 1935 and was introduced for medical use in the 1950s. In addition to its medical use, mestanolone has been used to improve physique and performance. It was used in East Germany in Olympic athletes as part of a state-sponsored doping program in the 1970s and 1980s. The drug is a controlled substance in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit. Medical uses Available forms Mestanolone was available in the form of 25 mg sublingual tablets (brand name Ermalone). Pharmacology Pharmacodynamics Mestanolone is an AAS, with both androgenic and anabolic effects. It is very similar in its effects to androstanolone (dihydrotestosterone; DHT), and can be thought of as an orally active version of this AAS. Due to inactivation by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) in skeletal muscle, mestanolone is described as a very poor anabolic agent, similarly to androstanolone and mesterolone. As mestanolone is 5α-reduced, it cannot be aromatized and hence has no propensity for estrogenic side effects such as gynecomastia. The drug also has no progestogenic activity. Like other 17α-alkylated AAS, mestanolone is hepatotoxic. Pharmacokinetics Due to its C17α methyl group, unlike androstanolone, mestanolone is orally active. Chemistry Mestanolone, also known as 17α-methyl-4,5α-dihydrotestosterone (17α-methyl-DHT) or as 17α-methyl-5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic androstane steroid and a 17α-alkylated derivative of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It differs from DHT only by the presence of the methyl group at the C17α position. Close synthetic relatives of mestanolone include oxandrolone (2-oxa-17α-methyl-DHT), oxymetholone (2-hydroxymethylene-17α-methyl-DHT), and stanozolol (a derivative of 17α-methyl-DHT (mestanolone) with a pyrazole ring fused to the A ring). Side effects Side effects of mestanolone include virilization and hepatotoxicity among others. History Mestanolone was first synthesized in 1935 along with methyltestosterone and methandriol. It was developed by Roussel in the 1950s and was introduced for medical use, under the brand names Androstalone and Ermalone, by at least 1960. It was marketed in Germany. The drug was originally thought to be a potent anabolic agent, but subsequent research showed that it actually has relatively weak anabolic effects and is mostly an androgen. Mestanolone was used as a doping agent in athletes competing in the Olympics from East Germany due to a state- sponsored doping program in the 1970s and 1980s. Its value is said to have been less as a muscle-builder and more as an androgen in the central nervous system and neuromuscular interaction, improving speed, strength, aggression, focus, endurance, and stress resilience. Today, mestanolone has mostly been discontinued in medicine, though it is still available in Japan.

The state highway runs from U.S. Route 40 (US 40) in Clear Spring east to US 40 Alternate in Boonsboro. MD 68 crosses central Washington County to the south of Hagerstown, connecting Clear Spring and Boonsboro with Williamsport, where the highway runs concurrently with MD 63. A small segment of MD 68 west of Boonsboro was constructed around 1920, using as part of the route two early 19th-century stone bridges. The remainder of the highway between Boonsboro and Williamsport was constructed in the second half of the 1920s. MD 68 was extended west from Williamsport to Clear Spring in the mid-1950s. The state highway was relocated south of Williamsport for the construction of Interstate 81 (I-81) in the mid-1960s. Since the early 1990s, I-68 has also existed in Washington County; signs on I-70 aim to avoid confusion between I-68 and MD 68. Route description MD 68 begins at an intersection with US 40 (Cumberland Street) in the town of Clear Spring. The state highway heads south as four-lane undivided Mill Street through a commercial area. MD 68's name changes to Clear Spring Road after leaving the town limits. The state highway meets I-70 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway) at a diamond interchange, then heads southeast through farmland as a two-lane undivided road, where the highway crosses Little Conococheague Creek. MD 68 intersects the eastern end of MD 56 (Big Pool Road) shortly before passing through the village of Pinesburg. The state highway intersects CSX's Lurgan Subdivision rail line and passes between industrial properties, then crosses Conococheague Creek and enters the town of Williamsport. MD 68 is municipally maintained within the town, where the highway follows Conococheague Street south through an intersection with US 11 (Potomac Street). At this intersection, MD 63 joins MD 68 in a concurrency to continue through the Williamsport Historic District. The two highways leave the town limits at their diamond interchange with I-81 (Maryland Veterans Memorial Highway), through which the roadway temporarily expands to a four- lane divided highway. A park and ride lot is located within the northwest quadrant of this interchange. MD 68 westbound at Mill Point Road in Millpoint MD 68's name changes to Lappans Road south of Williamsport. MD 63 (Spielman Road) splits south from MD 68 at the same intersection as Governor Lane Boulevard, which serves an industrial park. MD 68 crosses over a Winchester and Western Railroad line and curves to the east, then resumes heading southeast after intersecting the eastern end of Kendle Road. The state highway heads southeast through farmland and intersects MD 632 (Downsville Pike). The road intersects Norfolk Southern Railway's Hagerstown District at-grade and crosses St. James Run in the hamlet of St. James. MD 68 intersects MD 65 (Sharpsburg Pike) in the hamlet of Lappans, where the highway passes St. Mark's Episcopal Church. The state highway passes through the hamlet of Brethedsville and passes Devils Backbone County Park as the highway follows Antietam Creek for a short distance. MD 68 crosses over the creek on a narrow stone bridge, then makes a sharp turn to the south to continue following the forested valley of the creek. The state highway crosses over Beaver Creek on a one-lane stone bridge before leaving the creek valley. MD 68 continues southeast through farmland and the hamlet of Millpoint before reaching its eastern terminus at US 40 Alternate (Main Street) on the northern edge of the town of Boonsboro. History Disambiguation sign posted in advance of the MD 68 interchange on westbound I-70 near Clear Spring The first section of MD 68, from Lappans to Millpoint near Boonsboro, was constructed in 1920. This segment made use of a pair of stone arch bridges over Antietam Creek and Beaver Creek constructed in 1833 and 1824, respectively. These bridges remain open to traffic as part of MD 68. MD 68 was extended east from Millpoint to Boonsboro in 1925. Construction of MD 68 from Williamsport to Lappans began in 1926, with a section complete from Williamsport to the Cumberland Valley Railroad (now Winchester and Western Railroad) by 1927. The last section of the Williamsport-Lappans Road was completed in 1930. The state highway's western terminus was originally US 11 in Williamsport, within which MD 68 followed Artizan Street south to Sunset Avenue at the southern town limit. Artizan Street continued south as MD 63 and MD 68 followed Sunset Avenue southeast toward Lappans. Clear Spring Road remained a county highway until MD 68 was extended west to Clear Spring in 1956. MD 68 was relocated south of Williamsport, replacing Sunset Avenue and what is now Kendle Road, in 1965. The state highway was relocated for a grade separation of the Cumberland Valley Railroad and to tie into an interchange with I-81 and the south end of Conococheague Street. MD 63 joined MD 68 in a concurrency along Conococheague Street north to US 11. The new alignment of MD 68 and MD 63 was built as a four-lane divided highway around the interchange with I-81, which originally only contained ramps to and from the direction of West Virginia when the interchange opened with the completion of I-81 in 1966. That interchange was completed with ramps to and from Hagerstown between 1981 and 1989. Since the completion of I-68 in 1991, the Interstate and state-numbered highways with the same number have co-existed separated by on I-70. Multiple signs on westbound I-70 in advance of the Interstate's interchange with MD 68 advise motorists that I-68 and MD 68 are not the same highway and remind them to remain on I-70 to access I-68.

The term dates back to at least the early 20th century, emerging from earlier idioms about snakes and other creatures. An alcoholic character in Jack London's 1913 novel John Barleycorn is said to hallucinate \\"blue mice and pink elephants\\". History of the euphemism For many decades before \\"pink elephant\\" became the standard drunken hallucination, people were known to \\"see snakes\\" or \\"see snakes in their boots.\\" Beginning in about 1889, and throughout the 1890s, writers made increasingly elaborate modifications to the standard \\"snakes\\" idiom. They changed the animal to rats, monkeys, giraffes, hippopotamuses or elephants – or combinations thereof; and added color – blue, red, green, pink – and many combinations thereof. In 1896, for example, in what may be the earliest recorded example of a (partially) pink elephant, one of Henry Wallace Phillips' \\"Fables of our Times\\" referred to a drunken man seeing a \\"pink and green elephant and the feathered hippopotamus.\\" In 1897, a humorous notice about a play entitled \\"The Blue Monkey,\\" noted that, \\"We have seen it. Also the pink elephant with the orange trunk and the yellow giraffe with green trimmings. Also other things.\\" An early literary use of the term is by Jack London in 1913, who describes one kind of alcoholic, in the autobiographical John Barleycorn: > There are, broadly speaking, two types of drinkers. There is the man whom we > all know, stupid, unimaginative, whose brain is bitten numbly by numb > maggots; who walks generously with wide-spread, tentative legs, falls > frequently in the gutter, and who sees, in the extremity of his ecstasy, > blue mice and pink elephants. He is the type that gives rise to the jokes in > the funny papers.John Barleycorn Chapter II, at Wikisource \\"Pink elephants\\" became the dominant animal of drunken-hallucination choice by about 1905, although other animals and other colors were still regularly invoked. \\"Seeing snakes\\" or \\"seeing snakes in one's boots\\" was in regular use into the 1920s. A well-known reference to pink elephants occurs in the 1941 Disney animated film Dumbo. After taking a drink of water from a bucket spiked with champagne, Dumbo and Timothy begin to hallucinate singing and dancing elephants in a segment known as \\"Pink Elephants on Parade\\". Pink elephants actually do exist in nature. Although they are extremely rare, albino elephants can appear to be pink as well as white. Product references The association between pink elephants and alcohol is reflected in the name of various alcoholic drinks. There are various cocktails called \\"Pink Elephant\\", and The Huyghe Brewery put a pink elephant on the label of its Delirium Tremens beer. Other meanings In 2008, Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin used the phrase \\"pink elephants\\" to refer to conservative women such as herself, Carly Fiorina, Sue Lowden and Jane Norton (referencing the elephant being the symbol of the Republican Party and pink being a stereotypical feminine color).

The AHC is one of the largest, most diverse and most complete collection of materials of this kind in the world boasting some 13,518 books, 18,674 photographs, and other various materials. The AHC is the primary resource in Manila for official documents and reports from 1898 to 1946, such as the Reports of the US-Philippine Commission (1900-1915), Reports of the Governors-General of the Philippine Islands (1916-1935), Reports of the High Commissioner, the Executive Orders and Proclamations (1901-1933), Reports of the War Department and of the Secretary of War (1898-1924), and other insular government reports. Equally valuable to the researcher or historian, are the thousands of miscellaneous documents – pamphlets, reports, articles, and other items that had been collected – as well as the AHC’s unparalleled files of photographs. These go back to before the US era and include photos of Filipino notables as well as US officials and prominent members of the Manila community in the US era. History In 1950, US Ambassador Myron Cowen, who saw the devastation wrought by the Second World War on many things, including the memory of the times preceding it, encouraged the American community to donate books and other materials pertaining to the first half of the 20th century. His initiative was responsible for the early phase of the collection. While it could easily have come under Embassy jurisdiction, Ambassador Cowen wanted the library to have a more permanent and local organization, \\"as ambassadors come and go\\". It was decided to devolve the library’s maintenance and finances upon the American Association of the Philippines (AAP) Historical Committee to take on the responsibility of overseeing the new library. The Committee had an equal number of members appointed by the ambassador and by the AAP. Acquisitions, donations, and funds were administered by the American Historical Committee. The AHC was first housed at the U.S. Embassy, then above the Thomas Jefferson Cultural Center in Makati. In 1990, a crisis in the life of the collection was overcome with providential help from the U.S. Library of Congress, which needing space for its own collections, provided financial support for the housing and operation of the library. This assistance continued through 1995, at which time U.S. government support for the AHC was terminated. With the withdrawal of this support, the American Historical Collection Foundation (AHCF) was created to subsume the American Historical Committee for the purpose of overseeing the collection and raising funds for its continuation. Under a 1995 directive of then U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte, the AHCF inherited the responsibilities of the American Historical Committee. In 1995, through an agreement by and between the AAP and the Ateneo de Manila University, the collection is assured of a permanent life in the intellectual heart of the nation that the Americans helped to create — at the Rizal Library of the Ateneo. The Rizal Library is committed to preserve the collection, following the high standards it uses when conserving its own holdings. Furthermore, it is committed to facilitate the research of scholars.

As Humphreys misrepresented his identity and intent to his subjects, and tracked their identities through license plate numbers, Tearoom Trade has been the subject of continued debate over privacy for research participants, with The New York Times noting that Tearoom Trade is \\"now taught as a primary example of unethical social research.\\" Study The book is an ethnographic study of anonymous male homosexual sexual encounters in public toilets (a practice that was known as \\"tea-rooming\\" in U.S. gay slang and \\"cottaging\\" in British English). Humphreys was able to observe and describe various social cues (body language, hand language, etc.) developed and used by participants in those places. The encounters usually involved three people: the two engaged in the sexual activity, and a look-out, called \\"watchqueen\\" in slang. By offering his services as the \\"watchqueen,\\" Humphreys was able to observe the activities of other participants. 38% of Humphreys' subjects were neither bisexual nor homosexual; 24% were clearly bisexual; 24% were single and were covert homosexuals, and only 14% corresponded to the popular stereotype of homosexuality - clear members of the gay community interested in primarily homosexual relationships.Joan Sieber, Laud Humphreys and the Tearoom Sex Study Because Humphreys was able to confirm that 54% of his subjects were outwardly heterosexual men with unsuspecting wives at home, an important thesis of Tearoom Trade is the incongruity between the private self and the social self for many of the men engaging in this form of homosexual activity. Specifically, they put on a \\"breastplate of righteousness\\" (social and political conservatism) in an effort to conceal their deviation from social norms. Humphreys also concluded that such encounters were harmless, and posed no danger of harassment to straight men. His research has convinced many police departments that such encounters resulted in victimless crime; hence they were able to focus on other problems. Criticism Humphreys revealed his role to some of those he observed, but he noted that those who tended to talk with him openly were better educated; as he continued his research, he decided to conceal his identity in order to avoid response bias. Humphreys' rationale was that because of public stigma associated with the homosexual activities in question, and his subjects' desires to keep their activities secret, many were unlikely to allow him an opportunity for observation and follow-up interview were he to reveal himself as a researcher. Humphreys' study has been criticized on ethical grounds in that he observed acts of homosexuality by masquerading as a voyeur, did not get his subjects’ consent, used their license plate numbers to track them down, and interviewed them in disguise without revealing the true intent of his studies (he claimed to be a health service interviewer, and asked them questions about their race, marital status, occupation, and so on). Tearoom Trade has been criticized for privacy violations, and deceit - both in the initial setting, and in the follow-up interviews. After the study was published, the controversy in Humphreys' own department at Washington University resulted in about half the faculty leaving the department. There was also a lively debate in the popular press; notably journalist Nicholas von Hoffman, writing for The Washington Post at that time, condemned all social scientists, accusing them of indifference.Nicholas Von Hoffman, \\"Sociological Snoopers\\", The Washington Post, January 30, 1970. Reprinted in The Tearoom Trade, enlarged edition, 1975, page 177, \\"Sociological Snoopers and Journalistic Moralizers\\".Irving Louis Horowitz, Lee Rainwater, \\"Sociological Snoopers and Journalistic Moralizers: An Exchange\\", in Norman K. Denzin (ed.), The values of social science, Transaction Publishers, 1973, , p.151-164 Nonetheless, others have defended Tearoom Trade, pointing out that participants were conducting their activities in a public place and that the deceit was harmless, since Humphreys designed the study with respect for their individual privacy, not identifying them in his published work. Additionally, the Tearoom Trade study focuses on these interactions through investigation of possible social, psychological, or physiological reasons for this behavior.Seth Vickrey As Earl R. Babbie notes, the \\"tearoom trade controversy [on whether this research was ethical or not] has never been resolved\\"; and it is likely to remain a subject of debates in the conceivable future.

Abraham, the minister’s son and two daughters had signed a contract with him to purchase of land in Munnar. In this purpose, they accepted Rs. 67 million from him.

Subsequently, party leader P J Joseph, promised to return the money to Abraham . Kuruvilla had to resign and Monce Joseph from the KC(J) became the new PWD minister. However, since there was no credible inquiry, Joseph later claimed that neither the report of the district collector nor that of the chief secretary accused Kuruvilla of any malpractices. He further said that there was a conspiracy against the party and Kuruvilla to taint them.

Mautone was initially recruited by Melbourne Victory to assume responsibility for training their goalkeepers Michael Theoklitos and Eugene Galekovic. He has been responsible for training and developing former Melbourne Victory goalkeepers Michael Petkovic, Sebastian Mattei, Michael Theoklitos, Eugene Galekovic, Glen Moss and Mitch Langerak whilst they were respectively playing at the Victory. In 2008–09 and 2009–10 season, Mautone was assistant coach with Melbourne Victory's National Youth League team, working alongside Mehmet Durakovic. Mautone has recently relinquished this position to concentrate on the Victory's senior goalkeepers and to develop his own goalkeeping academy, 1st Choice Keeper. Club career After completing a scholarship with the Australian Institute of Sport, Steve's professional career began quietly in 1989, when as an 18-year-old he made eight appearances for Blacktown City in the National Soccer League as an understudy to Bill Londos. He made the switch to Parramatta Eagles the following season, serving another apprenticeship to Alex McPherson. Mautone returned to regional Victoria in 1992, taking up a contract with Morwell Falcons, firstly in the Victorian Premier League in 1992, and ultimately securing the first team spot in the senior squad for the club's inaugural season in the National Soccer League. In two seasons with the Gippsland-based club, Mautone proved outstanding, not missing a single league game, and his performances led to a move to Victorian rivals South Melbourne. The following season Mautone signed for the newly formed Canberra Cosmos, where he played 20 of 24 league games before a move to England with London-based Premier League club West Ham United beckoned. Following a loan spell with Crewe Alexandra, he made his League debut for the Hammers in September 1996, keeping a clean sheet against Nottingham Forest. He was then loaned out to Reading, where he became a fans favourite, eventually signing for the club in March 1997 in a deal worth £250,000. He made 34 appearances in all competitions for Reading before eventually being released from his contract. Mautone spent the 1999/00 season making a handful of appearances at various clubs, including Wolverhampton Wanderers, Crystal Palace and Gillingham. He eventually moved to non-league Slough Town FC where he spent a couple of seasons and made over 50 appearances before eventually returning to Australia to pursue his coaching career. Coaching career Mautone served as goalkeeping coach of Melbourne Victory FC for 9 years, before departing on 22 May 2015 in order to spend more time with his young family.

Various other displays and artifacts are scattered around the museum, including an operational Rolls-Royce Merlin engine produced by Packard, a Link Trainer, a de Havilland Tiger Moth and the oldest known mercury barometer in Newfoundland. Lockheed Hudson Aviation has played a crucial role in the development of Gander. The original airport, then known as the Newfoundland Airport, was completed in 1938 with the first landing on January 11 of that year. It was a major refueling stop for transatlantic flights starting during the Second World War (RAF Ferry Command and later RAF Transport Command) and continuing until the increased range of commercial jetliners eliminated the need for refueling. Gander earned the nickname \\"Crossroads of the world\\" at the height of its civil aviation role. Gander was used for test flights of Concorde starting in 1974.

It is believed to be the site of a New Netherland trading post built in the mid-17th century to facilitate trade with local Native Americans, and possibly serve as a wampum factory. It was first excavated in the 1930s by a team including Ralph Solecki. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1993. History In 1656, Peter Stuyvesant, the director of the New Netherland colony (now New York City) signed an agreement with Lenape chief Tackapausha, which included a provision that the Dutch would construct \\"A howse or A forte\\" for trade with Natives residing on Long Island.Cantwell et al, p. 138 Ralph Solecki, a professional archaeologist with a long interest in this site, believes this site to be the fortified trading post that was then built. The trading post remained in operation until the Dutch turned New Netherland over to the British in 1664, and the land was sold by the Lenape to English settlers in 1694.Grumet, p. 224 The area has long been known as \\"Fort Neck\\", and many people believed the remnant fortifications to be of Native construction, and possibly the site of a conflict between the English and Natives. The area came to the attention of archaeologists in the 1930s, when the Harbor Green development began, uncovering graves of Native Americans and the site of a village, which was destroyed in the process. The fort site itself was already well known to local collectors, and was significantly compromised by their activities. Solecki participated in an early excavation of the site, which formed the basis of his eventual doctoral dissertation. The site was preserved from development and turned into what is now Sunset Park; a sign commemorating its significance stands near the junction of Fairfax and Gloucester Roads.

The family includes some of the largest sea turtles that ever existed. The largest, Archelon, had a head long. Like most sea turtles, they had flattened bodies and flippers for front appendages; protostegids had minimal shells like leatherback turtles of modern times. Anatomy Life restoration of Protostega gigas As some of the first marine turtles, the protostegids set the general body plan for future species of sea turtles. They had a generally depressed turtle body plan, complete with four limbs, a short tail, and a large head at the end of a relatively short neck. Like other sea turtles, they possessed oar-like front appendages especially evolved for swimming in the open ocean. Similar to the still-extant, possibly closely related Dermochelyidae, protostegids possessed extremely reduced carapaces. Some specimens had skeletal protrusions from their ribs almost wrapping around their bodies in place of a complete shell. Like modern sea turtles, protostegids had sharp beaks. One of the defining characteristics of the members of the family was their almost-disproportionately large heads. Specifically, some specimens of Archelon have been found with heads long. In addition, the members of the family had somewhat reduced plastrons, as well. Ecology Trophic ecology While all members of the family are extinct, palaeoecological studies on the members of the family have provided some insight into the ecological roles of the Protostegidae. Analysis of fossil organs of some protostegids has revealed entire stomachs containing fossilized shellfish. The turtles, in turn, are postulated to have been preyed upon by the major predators of the time. Fossil protostegids have been found with tooth impressions from the large lamnid sharks of the time. Two specimens of Protostega gigas have been discovered to have tooth marks from large sharks. In addition, teeth of the extinct shark Cretoxyrhina mantelli have been found embedded in at least one Protostega skeleton. Evolutionary history The family's oldest members are Desmatochelys padillai, known from the specimens recovered from the Early Cretaceous Paja Formation of Colombia and Santanachelys gaffneyi, known from a specimen excavated from Brazil in 1998. The latter species first appeared during the Early Cretaceous. As an early sea turtle, Santanachelys had several unspecialized characteristics, such as distinguishable digits in its flipper-like arms. Later relatives' flippers were completely fused together for more efficient swimming. As with most large fauna of the era, the Protostegidae died out during the events of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs. The exact phylogenetic position of protostegids among turtles is uncertain. Some phylogenetic studies determine the leatherback turtles in the family Dermochelyidae to be their closest living relatives, with both these families being monophyletic. Conversely, the phylogenetic analyses conducted by Joyce (2007) and Anquetin (2012), which included one protostegid species (Santanachelys gaffneyi), recovered the family as only distantly related to leatherback turtles. Joyce (2007) recovered Protostegidae as basal eucryptodiran turtles lying outside the crown group of Cryptodira (the least inclusive clade containing all living cryptodirans) and closely related to Solnhofia parsonsi; Santanachelys had a similar phylogenetic position in the analysis conducted by Anquetin (2012), who stressed that future studies should include more protostegids to confirm this phylogenetic placement. If confirmed, these results would prove that protostegids weren't close relatives of leatherback turtles (or in fact any living cryptodirans), but instead \\"represent an independent lineage of marine turtles that originated in the Late Jurassic\\". The analyses conducted by Sterli (2010) and Sterli & de la Fuente (2011) recovered Santanachelys (and, presumably, the entirety of Protostegidae) as even more distantly related to living cryptodirans; it was found to be basal turtle lying outside the crown group of turtles (the least inclusive clade containing cryptodirans and pleurodirans). A phylogenetic analysis conducted by Cadena and Parham (2015) recovered Protostegidae within the crown group of Cryptodira; specifically the family was recovered as belonging to Chelonioidea and more closely related to the leatherback sea turtle than cheloniids are. Taxonomic history Rhinochelys nammourensis In 1888, the Belgian zoologist George Albert Boulenger published his classification of the Testudinata within the 9th edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica. The genus Protostega was placed within the family Sphargidae under the suborder Athecae. A year or so later, the entire suborder was downgraded by Karl Alfred von Zittel into a family within the Cryptodira. In 1994, Hirayama proposed a three-family subdivision of the sea turtle superfamily based on cladistic analysis; Protostegidae was given full, formal family status in the system, containing most of the extinct genera, including Archelon, and a previously undescribed protostegid. The unidentified specimen was fully described in 1998, as the species Santanachelys gaffneyi. The genus Santanachelys was appended to the family after the new species was described. This specimen was later to be analyzed to be the family's oldest member.

Residents are seen rowing boats to move about due to the flooding. South Brisbane during the 1893 flood! Map from the Irrigation and Water Supply Commission. Indooroopilly Railway Bridge The 1893 Brisbane flood, occasionally referred to as the Great Flood of 1893 or the Black February flood, occurred in 1893 in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The Brisbane River burst its banks on three occasions in February 1893. It was the occurrence of three major floods in the same month that saw the period named \\"Black February\\". There was also a fourth flood event later in the same year in June. The river runs through the centre of Brisbane with much of the population living in areas beside the river. It was flooded in the first flood on 6 February due to a deluge associated with a tropical cyclone, called \\"Buninyong\\".Coenraads (2006), 320.Windworker (n.d.) The second cyclone struck on 11 February, causing relatively minor flooding compared to the first flood. When the third cyclone came on 19 February, it was almost as devastating as the first, and it left up to one third of Brisbane's residents homeless. This time however the flood in the Brisbane River was largely from waters from the upper reaches of Brisbane River, rather than the Stanley River. The 1893 floods caused 35 deaths. For the first flood, Crohamhurst recorded an all-time Australian record of of rain in a 24-hour period. The water surge was recorded on the Port Office gauge (now the City gauge) as being 8.35 metres (27 feet, 5 inches) above the low tide level. The February 1893 floods were the second and third highest water levels ever recorded at the City gauge, the highest being the January 1841 flood at 8.43 metres (27 feet, 8 inches).Bureau of Meteorology (n.d.). There was however some oral aboriginal history suggesting a flood level of nearly 12 m prior to the first European settlement. The 1893 events was preceded by two notable yet less severe floods in 1887 and 1890. Both were caused by high levels of summer rainfall; however the rainfall around this period (with the exception of the two summers) was described as \\"very low\\".Thompson Computing (2002). Historical context Brisbane is the capital of Queensland, which became a self-governing colony in 1859. Samuel Griffith was the Premier of Queensland during the Black February period, although in March 1893 (shortly after the events) he resigned in order to join the Supreme Court of Queensland. Thomas McIlwraith then became Premier of Queensland. In 1901 the Commonwealth of Australia was formed, at which time Queensland became a State. Brisbane in 1891 had a population of 84,000 people.Courier Mail, Saturday 13 January 1951 The area was under the jurisdiction of several local governments (the present City of Brisbane being formed by their amalgamation in 1925). John McMaster was Mayor of Brisbane Municipal Council, which contained the City Centre, and was the most important of the local government authorities. Damage The southern regions of the city were most affected by the flood. The most flooded suburb of what was to become the City of Brisbane was Rocklea. However it only housed a small village and farms at that time. Both of the bridges that crossed the river, the Victoria Bridge and the Albert railway bridge at Indooroopilly were destroyed. The Victoria Bridge, which was an iron bridge with a turning span to allow traffic to go upriver, was partially destroyed on Monday 6 February, when the northern half of the bridge was washed away. It was not replaced until 1897, with ferries used in the meantime. The total damage caused by the flooding has been estimated at A$4 million (1893 figures), although no official figures exist.Whitaker (2005), 30.Kenny (n.d.). The great advances in technology associated with photography meant that there were many photos taken of the event, some of which still exist today. A local businessman who would later become Premier, Robert Philp had a photo album (a very expensive item at the time) of the floods, which survives today.Brisbane 1893 . Queensland Flood Views. University of Queensland. Casualties The flooding was responsible for around 35 deaths.Deluge: the true story of the Great Brisbane Flood of 1893. The floods also forced the hospitalisation of 190 residents.Hunt (1914). Ipswich Coal Mine disaster Seven of the victims were workers at John Wright's Eclipse colliery in north Ipswich which was flooded on Saturday 4 February by the Bremer River, a tributary of the Brisbane River. The seven miners killed included Thomas Wright (Mine Manager) and George Wright who were both sons of the owner. The other five miners were Andrew Smart, Patrick McQuade, John McQuade (son of Patrick), Charles Walker, and Mathew Cuthbertson. The lease over the mine was nearly expired so the mine was not in operation, but the men were removing rails and other mine equipment for use elsewhere. The colliery had two tunnels, and the flood waters had already reached the works. Thomas Wright, despite his father's advice against going down into the mine, arranged for seven men to go into the main tunnel and three men to go into the minor tunnel. Without warning, the roof collapsed over part of the main tunnel with air forced out of the mine in a great rush hurling wagons out of the way and trapping all seven men who entered the main tunnel. The men signaled the engine driver on the surface to pull them out but the collapse was major enough to prevent rescue. In minutes water had flooded the works and those not killed in the collapse would have drowned. Early warning signs of the 1st and 3rd floods Henry Plantagenet Somerset (1852–1936), was a landowner in the area where the Stanley River and the Upper Brisbane River meet. He built a homestead called \\"Caboonbah\\" on the cliffs above the river, where he lived with his wife, Katherine Rose Somerset (1855–1935). Caboonbah meant \\"big rock\\" in the local indigenous language, and it was built 60 feet (18 metres) higher than the rock cliff (Weldon's Knob) which was the location of the previous highest flood mark, from the 1890 flood event.History: Billy Mateer - the man who raced the flood . In early February, after the heavy rains caused by Tropical Cyclone Buninyong, the weather had finally broken, and to his surprise, Somerset saw from his porch a great wall of water come down the Stanley River. This was especially concerning to Somerset, as the heavy rains caused by a tropical cyclone Buninyong (informally named after the ship that first sighted it) had already caused the Stanley River to exceed the 1890 flood level. Somerset, realizing that people downriver where in great danger sent one of his workers, Henry (Harry) Winwood to Esk to send a telegraph to warn them. The telegraph sent warned the Brisbane General Post Office that Brisbane, Ipswich, Goodna, Lowood and other areas were in danger. The inhabitants of Brisbane were not worried however due to the fine weather, as the days of heavy rain having ended, all threat of floods seemed to have disappeared. The Brisbane General Post Office only posted the warning on a single noticeboard, and it went almost completely unheeded. On 17 February, another cyclone crossed the Queensland coast near Bundaberg to drench the already saturated Brisbane River catchment. Somerset observed that the Brisbane River was flooded in similar levels to the first flood of the Stanley River. He knew that the telegraph lines were down between Esk and Brisbane, but he knew that there was a telegraph office at the small township of North Pine (now Petrie), although this would require crossing the D'Aguilar Range. William (Billy) Mateer, of Eidsvold (Dalgangel Station) was Somerset's most talented horseman, and he was selected to undertake this dangerous mission. Somerset and his men had to arrange for a dangerous crossing of the already flooded Brisbane River, with Mateer sent on with the only surviving horse (called Lunatic). Mateer survived the hazardous journey to North Pine, and delivered Somerset's message, which was again sadly ignored. Whilst the warnings went unheeded, as a result of these heroic efforts, Caboonbah Station was made an official flood warning station, with a telegraph line to Esk. Somerset initially manned the station in its early years, having to use morse code for 12 years prior to the introduction of the telephone. In modern times, Caboonbah Homestead was restored and used as a museum. However, on Monday 11 May 2009, the homestead caught fire and burnt to the ground.. Mitigation works Somerset Dam, 1938. Lake Somerset is a 904,000 megalitre dam located on the Stanley River (the normal water supply capacity is 380,000 megalitres, but the dam can hold another 524,000 megalitres of extra flood capacity). The site was first suggested for the location of a dam by Henry Somerset, after the 1893 floods, and he championed its construction when he was elected to parliament in 1904, where he served for 16 years as the Member for Stanley. Construction of the dam was not started until 1933, and it was finally finished in 1953. It was seen as a major job creation project when it commenced in the Great Depression, but was delayed by World War II when its workers were redeployed. The same day that the notice of Billy Mateer's death appeared in the newspaper, there was also a major announcement that the Queensland Government had approved the construction of Somerset Dam. The site had been identified in 1933, by the Bureau of Industry.A Second Look at Lake Somerset. Sweetwater Fishing.

Details The site is a Scheduled Monument, protected by law and described as Bury Hill Camp: a motte-and-bailey castle with three fishponds. The motte is notable in that it has a top platform on two levels, and the bailey is also of unusual form and is exceptionally large. The motte is an earthen mound, oval in plan, measuring 60m long by up to 40m wide at its base and between 40m long by 20m wide at the top. The higher level is at the north-eastern end and is thought to have held the stronghold. To the south of the motte is the bailey which is irregular in shape and measures 200m by 270m. Excavations in the 1970s found few remains of the Norman castle, but finds indicated that the site had been occupied in the Iron-Age, Roman and Saxon periods. It has been postulated that the motte and bailey was the easternmost of a line of defensive sites on the upper reaches of the Ouse which extends to Odell. The building of the castle has been ascribed to King Stephen (1135–54). Much of the site has been developed and the scheduled protection applies mainly to the ground underneath.

Born in the U.S. to a French family, his work depicted the culture and society around him: cafes, theatres, and in the twenties, flappers. Artistic training The Confidence Man, c. 1919, Brooklyn Museum Pène du Bois began his artistic training in 1899, when he enrolled in the New York School of Art to study under the painter William Merritt Chase. In 1902 he enrolled in a painting class with Robert Henri, whose teachings lead Pène du Bois to focus more on everyday life in his own artwork. Pène du Bois traveled to Europe in 1905 to study under Théophile Steinlen, but returned to the U.S. upon his father's death the following year. Illustrations and art criticism Beginning in 1906, Pène du Bois worked as an illustrator and cartoonist for the New York American, and he began writing art criticism for the publication two years later. He became the editor of Arts and Decoration in 1913 and also wrote for the New York Post and the magazines The Arts and Arts Weekly. He was also one of the founders of the magazine Reality: A Journal of Artists' Opinions. In 1940, he published his autobiography, Artists Say the Silliest Things. His son was the French- American author and illustrator William Pène du Bois. The American artist Jerome Myers recalled his close friendship with Pène du Bois in his 1940 autobiography Artist in Manhattan:Jerome Myers, Artist in Manhattan, New York: American Artists Group, Inc. 1940. \\"Guy Pene du Bois has long been the auditor of my thoughts on art and life. Our contacts were so pleasurable and profitable. So often in his charming home circle, over our coffee, we would spend hours together, analyzing art conditions, forecasting the careers of various artists then commanding the spotlight, as well as of others whose light shone less brightly. I regret that I made no notes of our talks, for to me they were always an inspiration. \\"Guy was then the noted art critic and painter; and even later, when he became the noted painter, he was still the art critic as well, coining his brief aphorisms with a dash of cosmopolitan cynicism, cool wisdom and dry humor.

It was listed as Harmony Mills Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. A portion of the district encompassing the industrial buildings and some of the housing built for millworkers was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1999. and The centerpiece building, Harmony Mill No. 3 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. It was the largest cotton mill complex in the world when it opened in 1872, and is one of the finest examples of a large-scale textile mill complex outside of New England. The complex went into decline after its largest tenant, Barclay Home Products, went out of business in 1988. Mill 2 burned down in 1995. Mill 1 suffered devastating damage in a second fire in 1998. Developer Uri Kaufman purchased the complex in 2000. In 2005–2006, a portion of Mill 3 was renovated and turned into high- end residential lofts. The 96 loft apartments completed in this first phase were at 100% occupancy by July, 2006. A second phase containing 135 units was completed in 2010, adding a pool and spa and other luxury amenities. This phase—98% leased as of July, 2012—was called Harmony Mills Fallsview Luxury Apartments because of the views of the Cohoes Falls. A third phase, restoring Mills 1 & 4 was commenced in early 2013. Mill 4 was completed in early December, 2013. 31 of its 33 loft apartments were pre-leased prior to receipt of the Certificate of Occupancy on December 6, 2013. In all, the Harmony Mills now contains 340 luxury loft apartments. The revival of the Mills sparked a revival of the City of Cohoes. In the 2010 census, the City gained population for the first time since 1930. According to a study by the Center for Economic Growth, Cohoes was the fastest growing city in New York State in both 2015 and 2016.http://www.ceg.org/articles/cohoes-repeats-states-fastest-growing-city/ The project has been hailed as a prime example of how adaptive re-use of historic buildings can revitalize cities, while clearing urban blight in an environmentally friendly manner. For his efforts in restoring the Harmony Mills, Uri Kaufman was awarded the New York State Preservation League Excellence Award.http://www.preservenys.org/uploads/3/1/6/2/31626961/pr- harmonymills-final.pdf The Harmony Mills is featured on the Home Page of the New York State Historic Preservation Office Website, as a leading example of historic preservation development.http://nysparks.com/shpo/  Mill No. 1  Due to the powerful Mohawk River Falls and the introduction of the Erie Canal, the location of the Harmony Mills was key to the success and vast expansion of the company. Completed in the year 1837, Mill No. 1 stood as the first textile mill to house the operations of the newly founded Harmony Manufacturing Company. Mimicking the gable-roofed like structures common to the Greek revival movement, these impressive architectural features can still be appreciated today. The construction of this mill prompted the realignment of the Erie Canal which originally sat on the east side to be shifted to the west side of the building (1837-1842). The east side was then used as a hydraulic canal for the growing company. Its location was critical since the western side of the building sat just a few yards from the Erie Canal's lock No. 16. Despite its vast potential, the original owners failed to produce profits and in 1850 the building was acquired by Thomas Garner of New York City and Alfred Wild of Kinderhook, NY. The mastermind and convincing figure behind this purchase was Robert Johnston. A skilled cotton mill worker with years of experience, Johnston was hired on as the company's new supervisor by the proprietors. Almost immediately, he proved himself worthy of the undertaking and under his leadership the company required the addition to the original Mill No.1. It consisted of an architecturally pleasing 5-story 274 foot long building and featured a large tower and arched entryway.  Picker House / Storehouse / Pump House  In the year 1853, the inclusion of the Picker House was required to increase the efficiency of the growing production. To meet these needs, the Picker House was utilized for the opening and cleaning of the imported cotton bales as well as a storage space. This building and the structural portion of the walkway to Mill No.1 still remain today.  Mill No.2  Erected in the year 1857, Mill No. 2 was a symbol of the ever growing production of cotton goods in Cohoes. This mill acted as an extension of Mill No.1 and later called for a fourth floor mansard roof addition in 1866. Unfortunately, the mill suffered severe damage from a fire in 1995 and has since been demolished.  Mill No.3  Years of continued success and an increase in production had allowed the most significant on the mills to begin construction in 1866. With the first phase completed in 1868 and the second shortly after in 1872, Mill No. 3 stood with an astonishing foot print of 1,185 feet in length and 70-76 feet wide. Standing five stories tall and featuring gorgeous Victorian styled aesthetic features such as the mansard roof and the bronze statue of Thomas Garner near the front two towers, Mill No. 3 was a symbol of tremendous success for the Harmony Factories. Housed in the basement of the mill were two 800 horsepower Boyden turbines which powered all of the machinery in that mill.  Mill No.4  In 1872 the Harmony Company acquired what used to be the Van Benthuysen Mill and converted it into another cotton mill. This mill’s main responsibility was the production cotton bags and jute.  Miscellaneous Buildings  In addition the main mills, there was the Boiler House (c. 1911), Office and Sunday School Building (c. 1853), and the Generator Plant. Today the Office and Sunday school building is utilized as a commercial building and is currently leased out by a Salon.  Tenements  The quick growth of the Harmony Mills accompanied by a large influx of immigrants, allotted the Johnston’s the opportunity to provide an easily adaptable community to entire newcomers. To do so, they constructed over 800 tenements to house these immigrants and their families at very mere costs as long as they worked in the mills. This allowed the mills to employ over five thousand operatives and assisted Cohoes in becoming the nation’s largest producers of wool knit goods in the 1860s.

It is not a castle in the conventional sense, but a manor house built of brick. It was built in 1642, at the start of the English Civil War and was captured in 1646. Attached to the house are four three-storey towers with walls 1.2 metres thick. There is a classical portico and the windows are rectangular. The house and estate were sold in the 1850s and let as a farm but it became increasingly run down and covered in ivy by the 20th century. It burnt down in 1988 but it has now been rebuilt. History The house in on a peninsula by the River Lynher, from which the name comes, Ince being a form of the Cornish enys (\\"island\\"). The first house may have been built by the Courtenays in the late 14th century. It later came into the possession of the Killigrews who remodelled the house entirely. Henry Killigrew, the Royalist MP for West Looe, who modified the first house in about 1642, kept four wives, one in each tower, each unknown to the others, according to tradition.Oman, Sir Charles (1926) Castles; \\"Cornwall and its castles\\", pp. 108-09. London: Great Western Railway From the 1840s, the tenants farming the land were all from the same family. Richard Pryn (1774 to 1846) owned and farmed Tredown close to Ince and in 1841 (according to the census) was also farming Ince. His son, Richard Pryn (1822 to 1858) was unmarried and farmed Ince with his unmarried sister Anne (1817 to 1889) from 1846 to 1858. The property was known as Ince Barton and was at this time. After Richard's death from drowning, his sister Anne was joined by another unmarried sister Mary Ann (1828 to 1910). After Anne's death in 1889, the tenancy passed to her great nephew, Hannibal Steed (1856 to ?) whose descendants continued to farm Ince until the early 20th century (1910 or later). The owner from 1922 to 1937 was H. R.\\"Bobby\\" Somerset, whose yacht, Jolie Brise, was a multiple winner of the Fastnet Race and was kept in the boathouse at Ince Castle. Ince's next occupants were Scottish yachtsman James Bryce Allan (1893-1960) and his wife, stage and silent screen actress Rita Jolivet. In 1960 the house was bought by Patricia, Viscountess Boyd, (daughter of Rupert Guinness, 2nd Earl of Iveagh), wife of the former Colonial Secretary, Alan Lennox-Boyd, 1st Viscount Boyd of Merton. About this time, the lower floor French windows were installed to bring more light into the house and the service wing was extended. A disastrous fire in 1988 was followed by rebuilding of the roof and a second kitchen was added. The present owners, the Viscount and Viscountess Boyd of Merton, moved to Ince Castle in 1994. The house and gardens are only occasionally open to the public. In October 2018 the house was sold for £7 Million (Source land Registry £7,000,030 Oct 31 2018) to a South African. Gardens In the gardens there is a paved courtyard with a Magnolia delavayi and two specimens of Magnolia grandiflora. On the south side there is a sunken garden with a great variety of plants. There are curved beds in the lawn planted with shrubs and herbaceous plants. On the northeast a cherry walk leads towards a woodland garden. By the house there are two contrasting gardens: a white garden and a garden of warm colours and contrasting grey leaves.Synge, Patrick (1977) The Gardens of Britain; Vol. 1: Devon and Cornwall.

In 1991, National Health Laboratories moved from the NASDAQ OTC exchange to the New York Stock Exchange, where it began to trade under the new ticker symbol NH. Up until that time the company had performed very well, including through the 1990-1991 recession. Its earnings peaked that year at almost US$90 million, and its stock price had risen from its low within the prior few years by several-fold. However, beginning in 1991 the company became embroiled in Operation \\"Labscam,\\" a nationwide crackdown on fraud in the health-care system, initiated by the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Diego, California. The charges were that the company and others routinely submitted false claims to the government health-care agencies Medicare and Medicaid for unnecessary tests which physicians had never ordered. In 1992, National Health Laboratories became the first of the companies to be prosecuted in the government operation.OPERATION LABSCAM, LabCorp of America, SmithKline Beecham and Corning, Inc (now Quest Diagnostics), compiled by Michael Wynne, August 2003 In 1992, the company reported revenues of over US$720 million, however with earnings of only US$40 million. The small gain that year reflected a fourth quarter charge of US$80 million, which the company paid in a settlement agreement with state and federal governments related to the LABSCAM investigation.National Health Laboratories Inc. reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31, New York Times Archives, Published: February 8, 1994 The total payments made by National Health Laboratories in the settlement came to US$111 million that year, COMPANY NEWS; Blood-Testing Concerns Plan $1.79 Billion Merger, New York Times, By MILT FREUDENHEIM, Published: December 15, 1994 and ultimately reached US$173 million. In 1993, revenues were up to US$761 million, with new peak earnings of nearly US$113 million. By that time the company had 22 major laboratories. The stock price reached a new all-time high in 1993, which became the peak for the next couple of years, and the company was added to the S&P; MidCap 400 list. National Health Laboratories Holdings On March 8, 1994 National Health Laboratories Inc. reorganized as a holding company, National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. By 1994, MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc. then owned the Revlon Holdings Group's former 24 percent of National Health Laboratories Holdings. That company was a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate, which had previously been taken over, along with Revlon, by Ronald Perelman in the 1980s. On May 4, 1994, National Health Laboratories announced that it would acquire Allied Clinical Laboratories, Inc. of Nashville, Tennessee, reducing their takeover offer to $204 million after federal officials issued new subpoenas in an investigation of Medicare billing practices at Allied Clinical Laboratories Inc. In 1993, Allied generated revenues of US$163 million. The former president and CEO of Allied Clinical, Haywood D. Cochrane, Jr., then became Vice Chairman of National Health Laboratories. In order to complete the cash transaction, the company discontinued paying its dividend at that time.National Health Laboratories Inc · 10- Q · For 3/31/94, SECInfo.com, Filed On 5/10/94, SEC File 1-10740, Accession Number 832427-94-14 By the end of 1994, the company had run into financial difficulty again, as it struggled through the economic soft landing that year.

The stock never traded that year at more than half of its 1993 peak, and at its 1994 low, it was down by nearly two-thirds from the all-time high. Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings On April 28, 1995 National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. merged with Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. and changed its name to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings. It began trading under its new ticker symbol LH.Laboratory Corp of America Holdings · 10-Q · For 3/31/95, SECInfo.com, Filed On 5/15/95, SEC File 1-11353, Accession Number 920148-95-11 Shareholders of National Health Laboratories received 0.72 shares of the new company, plus $5.60 in cash, for a 50.1 percent interest in the new company. At the time, James R. Maher was president and Chief Executive Officer of National Health Laboratories. Following the merger, Maher relinquished those positions, and instead became Chairman of the new company, succeeding the financier Ronald O. Perelman in that position. Perelman received about US$100 million from the deal, which made the new company the largest blood-testing company in the United States. The merged company created revenues of US$1.7 billion. National Health Laboratories already held long-term debt of US$351 million. Together with the Roche debt, the combined companies owed US$590 million prior to the merger. Another US$288 million was added to help finance the payout to shareholders. By year-end 1995, the new company's total debt reached US$959 million. Roche Biomedical Laboratories had been created by and was a wholly owned subsidiary of Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., the American arm of the Swiss medical conglomerate, Roche Holding, Limited. Before 1982, the core of Roche Biomedical Laboratories had been Biomedical Reference Laboratories, which dated from the late 1960s, and was located in Burlington, North Carolina. That core company had become publicly traded in 1979. Hoffman-La Roche acquired it for US$163.5 million in 1982 and then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company that year as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical had become one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with US$600 million in sales.Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc., FundingUniverse.com By 1993 Roche Biomedical Laboratories had revenues of US$712 million, with 17 major laboratories. Dr. James Powell was President of Roche Biomedical, and after the merger with National Health Laboratories he became president and CEO of the new company, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, which then relocated from La Jolla, California to the Roche Biomedical headquarters in Burlington, North Carolina. Hoffmann-La Roche also contributed US$186.7 million in cash to the deal, and retained 49.9 interest in the new merged company. By year-end 1995, the new Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings suffered a marginal loss of a few million dollars. The stock price dropped by almost half again through the year, to within 10% of its all- time low since going public a half dozen years earlier.

Background  After being serialized in Rolling Stone magazine, Wolfe's first novel, The Bonfire of the Vanities was published in 1987. Prior to the novel, Wolfe had made his career as a journalist and author of non-fiction books. Wolfe had been a pioneer of \\"New Journalism,\\" a style of non-fiction that relied heavily on novelistic techniques such as the use of scene, dialogue, first-person point of view from the subjects of the stories and recording minute details of everyday routine. In his novel, Bonfire of the Vanities, Wolfe used many of the writing techniques in his journalism, but this time to tell what Wolfe called a \\"fictional novel\\" (though novel traditionally denotes fiction and is hence redundant, Wolfe's \\"New Journalism\\" was sometimes described as non-fiction novels). In addition, Wolfe set out in Bonfire to capture the spirit of New York City in the 1980s. The book was a commercial success, becoming a New York Times Bestseller and earning critical praise.  Essay  In his Harper's essay, Wolfe (at the time a contributing editor of the magazine) argues that American authors had strayed far from the tradition of realism seen in the writing of giants of American literature like Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner and John Steinbeck. Wolfe uses his own writing to illustrate his point: when he wrote The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, he expected a novelist to write a great fictional tale about the hippie movement; after writing Radical Chic & Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers, about racial strife in cities in the '60s and '70s, he expected great novels to follow suit; after The Right Stuff, he expected a novel about astronauts and NASA. Wolfe says that, to his surprise, great novels on these cultural movements never arrived: > Publishers, \\"Had their noses pressed against their thermopane glass walls > scanning the billion-footed city for the approach of the young novelists > who, surely, would bring them the big novels of the racial clashes, the > hippie movement, the New Left, the Wall Street boom, the sexual revolution, > the war in Vietnam. But such creatures, it seemed, no longer existed. The > strange fact of the matter was that young people with serious literary > ambitions were no longer interested in the metropolis or any other big, rich > slices of contemporary life.\\" Wolfe places the split from realism at 1960; after which the literary establishment turned to absurdist novels, magical realism, minimalism, postmodernism and foreign writers, \\"the gods of the new breed.\\" Wolfe singles out Milan Kundera, Jorge Luis Borges, Samuel Beckett, Vladimir Nabokov, Harold Pinter, Italo Calvino and Gabriel Garcia Marquez as exemplars of this new obsession. Wolfe sees these trends as the novel sliding into irrelevancy. Wolfe concludes that authors must return to realism, \\"If fiction writers do not start facing the obvious, the literary history of the second half of the twentieth century will record that journalists not only took over the richness of American life as their domain but also seized the high ground of literature itself.\\" Reaction and criticism Wolfe's essay caused an uproar among writers, literary critics and journalists. Three months after the essay appeared, author Robert Towers wrote in The New York Times, \\"I cannot offhand recall an article in a small magazine making a bigger splash in the literary pool than Tom Wolfe's manifesto...\\" For months after the essay, Wolfe appeared on television and on the lecture circuit defending and debating his thesis. While some critics agreed with Wolfe, others took issue with his essay, stating that he essentially had argued that other writers need to be more like himself. Critics also noted that while many authors wrote the sorts of books Wolfe criticized, there were countless authors like Don DeLillo or John le Carré, Louise Erdrich or Toni Morrison, who wrote realism and were critically praised. The Times described the essay as \\"one part serious argument with two parts calculated provocation,\\" noting that the essay had helped continue discussion (and boost sales) of Bonfire of the Vanities. Others were outright dismissive, with author Jim Harrison opining that Wolfe's ideas were \\"the Babbitry of art in a new, white suit.\\" Wolfe wrote later works in the genre of \\"fictional novels,\\" 1998's A Man in Full and 2004's I Am Charlotte Simmons. The essay launched a feud between Wolfe and other prominent literary figures that never ended. In 2000, he called John Irving, John Updike and Norman Mailer, \\"the three stooges\\" in response to their criticisms of his novels. Irving, for example, had dismissed Wolfe's work as \\"yak\\" and \\"journalistic hyperbole.\\" Similar name-calling surrounded the release of I Am Charlotte Simmons. The essay was also cited and critiqued in Jonathan Franzen's essay \\"Perchance to Dream\\".

The campus is notable for its main building, known as a \\"Kirkbride,\\" which has been designated a National Historic Landmark due to its exemplary High Victorian Gothic architecture, the first use of that style for an American institutional building. and It is located on US 9 on the Poughkeepsie-Hyde Park town line. Frederick Clarke Withers designed the hospital's buildings in 1867. Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted designed the grounds. It was intended to be completed quickly, but went far over its original schedule and budget. The hospital opened on October 18, 1871 as the Hudson River State Hospital for the Insane and admitted its first 40 patients. Construction, however, was far from over and would continue for another 25 years. A century later, it was slowly closed down as psychiatric treatment had changed enough that large hospitals were no longer needed, and its services had been served by the nearby Hudson River Psychiatric Center until that facility's closure in January 2012. The campus was closed and abandoned in 2003 and fell into a state of disrepair. Authorities struggled with the risk of arson and vandals after suspicion of an intentionally set fire. The male bedding ward, south of the main building, was critically damaged in a 2007 fire caused by lightning. The property was sold to an unnamed buyer in November 2013. The site is currently being developed as a $300 million mixed-use project called Hudson Heritage, which will include 750 residential units, commercial space, medical office space, a hotel, and a conference center. Buildings The Cheney Building as visible from a nearby strip mall, with Ryon Hall to the right. The Hospital includes a number of unique buildings: *Main Building (the Kirkbride), a High Victorian Gothic building used for administrative purposes. This building will be preserved for future purposes. *Patient Wings, which split off the Kirkbride, housed patients. The male ward splits off to the south, and is much larger than the female wing to the north. It was struck by lightning on May 31, 2007, igniting a serious fire. These wings will be demolished sometime in the future. *Presbyterian and Roman Catholic churches were available to patients, one of which was near the male ward. One of the churches will be preserved for future use. *A morgue, with refrigerated cold chambers was located on the northeast corner of the property. This building will be demolished sometime in the future. *A power house was built, and still stands, to the northeast of the Kirkbride to provide power to the various buildings. Its smokestack is visible from Route 9 as well as nearby Marist College. This building will be demolished sometime in the future. *Ryon Hall opened in 1934 and housed violent or criminally insane patients. It was on the very southern property line, visible from Home Depot, in the shadow of the much larger Cheney Building. The building was demolished on October 14, 2019. *The Clarence O. Cheney Building, opened in 1952, is a ten-story steel structure with a brick facade. Named after Dr. Clarence O. Cheney, MD (1887-1947), the president of the American Psychiatric Association from 1935 to 1936, and hospital's superintendent from the 1920s until 1946, the building held doctor's offices and medical examination rooms. The building did provide some patient housing. This building was demolished in 2020. *The Herman B. Snow Rehabilitation Center opened in 1971 and provided recreational relief for patients, sporting two bowling alley lanes, a lunch counter, an auditorium, a basketball court, and an indoor swimming pool. The building featured a modern concrete and glass construction with angular asymmetrical wings. Skylights provided natural lighting. This building was demolished in 2019. History The entire facility was built over the last three decades of the 19th century, at great cost. Once complete, it would be used as intended for much of the first half of the next century. As psychiatry moved away from inpatient treatments, it began to decline in use until its closure at century's end. Today, it is slowly deteriorating out of public view as it awaits reuse. 19th century New York had opened what has since become Utica Psychiatric Center in 1843, the first state-run institution for the mentally ill. By the Civil War it was reaching its capacity, so in 1866 then Governor Reuben Fenton appointed a five-member state commission to look for a site for a second hospital in the Hudson Valley between New York and Albany, to serve New York City and the counties of Eastern New York., cited at Hudson River State Hospital , retrieved from historic51.org November 11, 2007. In January of the following year the members reported to the governor that they had temporarily secured a tract of land overlooking the Hudson River north of Poughkeepsie, formerly part of the estates of James Roosevelt and William A. Davis. It would cost nothing as the citizens of Dutchess County would be offering it to the state as a gift. Two months later, the state accepted. A nine-member Board of Managers was created and appointed to initiate and oversee construction of the actual building. They chose architect Frederick Clarke Withers to design a building according to the Kirkbride Plan, then a popular theory for the design of mental institutions. Withers planned a building 1,500 feet (457 m) in length and over 500,000 square feet (45,000 m2) in area, most of it two wings that would house patients. It was the first institutional building in the U.S. designed in the High Victorian Gothic style. Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted, designers of New York's Central Park, laid out the surrounding landscape. Like Withers, they had been mentored by the influential Andrew Jackson Downing in nearby Newburgh. The centerpiece of his design was the administration building, which branched off into two wings, composed of six parallel pavilions that flanked the central structure.Carla Yanni, The Architecture of Madness: Insane Asylums in the United States, Minneapolis: Minnesota University Press, 2007, 113-14 The two wings, designed to hold 300 patients of either sex, were divided by a chapel placed between them in the yard behind the administration building so that patients could not see into the rooms of the opposite sex. The building and landscape plan were meant to aid in patients' recovery, by giving them adequate space and privacy and imbuing their healing with a sense of grandeur. Construction began in 1868, with the cost estimated at $800,000. Cost-saving measures included the construction of a new dock on the Hudson so that building materials could be shipped more directly to the site, quarrying and cutting the foundation stones on site, mixing concrete from local materials and hiring local craftsmen instead of a general contractor. The board also deviated from the plan it had sent the state, in particular by building a shorter female wing when it came to believe that fewer patients of that sex would be admitted. As a result, it is one of the few Kirkbride hospitals to have been built with asymmetrical wings. Spending controversies and delays Despite the efforts to save money, the board was slightly over the $100,000 it had expected to spend that year, according to its first annual report. The main building was completed and opened, with 40 patients admitted, in October 1871. As work continued on other structures planned for the complex, so did the cost overruns. In 1873, the year county residents had been promised the hospital would be finished, the New York Times ran an editorial harshly criticizing the board for not only having gone way over budget but for lavish extravagance and waste: Some efforts were made to stop the project, but the legislature continued to appropriate funds despite further revelations like these. Construction continued until 1895, when further money could not be found. Despite this expenditure of time and money, the hospital's original plan was still not complete, and never would be. 20th century A Refrigerating Plant was built 1948 and a Tubercular Hospital was built in 1951 to the designs of Samuel Juster of DePace & Juster.American Architects Directory, First Edition (New York City: R.R. Bowker LLC, 1956), p.236 Buildings continued to be opened and reopened in the 20th century, and as late as 1952 the institution was treating as many as 6,000 patients. Changes in the treatment of mental illness, such as psychotherapy and psychotropic drugs, were making large-scale facilities relics and allowing more patients to lead more normal lives without being committed. A major fire destroyed a hospital wing in the 1960s and threatened to spread to the administration building, but was halted in a connecting hallway. The section was rebuilt, although some large roof beams still showed evidence of the earlier fire. Though 1971 saw the addition of the Snow Recreational center, by the late 1970s the hospital administration had decided to shut down the two main wings as few patients were residing in them and due to neglect some of the floors had collapsed. The hospital housed 1,780 patients by 1976. The state offices of Mental Health and Historic Preservation clashed over a plan to demolish the wings, even after the National Historic Landmark designation in 1989. In the 1990s, more and more of the hospital site would be abandoned as its services were needed less and less. It was consolidated with another Dutchess County mental hospital, Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center, in 1994 and closed in 2003. The center moved operations into a much smaller building nearby, Ross Pavilion, located on a hilltop on the east side of Rt 9G. 21st century In 2005, the state sold the property and subsequently, the Empire State Development Corporation sold including the Main Building to Hudson Heritage LLC, a subsidiary of the Chazen Companies, for $2.75 million. Hudson Heritage and Chazen had planned to thoroughly renovate the Main Building into a combination hotel/apartment complex as the centerpiece of a residential/commercial campus, Hudson Heritage Park. May 2007 fire at the Main Building Redevelopment plans hit two setbacks in the mid- to late-2000s: in 2005, the Town of Poughkeepsie imposed a moratorium on new construction to cope with its growth. Hudson Heritage had been seeking to have a \\"historic revitalization district\\" created for the property that would help spur its growth. Then, on May 31, 2007, lightning struck the sprawling south wing, which held male housing, causing one of the most serious fires in Dutchess County's history. It is unclear whether that portion of the building can be effectively restored after such severe damage. The Administration building was again hit by fire on the morning on April 27, 2018. In the meantime, the property has remained closed to the public, with signs posted at fenced-off entrances. Local firefighters have complained, after dealing with two fires in April 2010 that appeared to be deliberately set, that the property is not adequately secured against trespassing. 2010s As of May 2012, the campus is owned by CPC Resources, a subsidiary of the New York City- based Community Preservation Corporation, a non-profit mortgage lender that finances multifamily developments. CPC has placed the 162-acre parcel on the market, citing that the poor economy has hindered timely development. Walmart has shown a strong interest in the property, but Poughkeepsie Town Supervisor Todd Tancredi noted that the Town Board cannot envision such a large piece of land used for a single store. An unnamed buyer purchased the campus for an undisclosed sum in November 2013. The closing for the property occurred on November 8, 2013. The site is currently being developed as a $300 million mixed-use project called Hudson Heritage, which will include 750 residential units, commercial space, medical office space, a hotel, and a conference center. Fire An intentional fire was set on the morning of April 27, 2018 at the Hudson River Psychiatric Center, according to Fairview Fire District Chief. The fire was located in the wing of the old Main Administration building, and firefighters were dispatched around 3:45 AM; more than a dozen agencies responded with assistance. Demolition Demolition began on July 13, 2016 when smaller auxiliary buildings were torn down. The heavy vegetation that mostly hid the property from plain sight was cleared in summer 2019. The demolition of Ryon Hall, on the extreme southern end of the property, began on October 14, 2019. As part of the mixed use site, the main administration building (Kirkbride), the library, the amusement hall, the chapel, and the northernmost tower of the north wing will be preserved and put in to adaptive reuse. Also, the Great Lawn will be preserved. As of May 25, 2020, the fate of the other buildings on the North Campus is still unwritten and may be added for future use. References 19\\\\.

Minors under the age of 21 are not permitted to possess or purchase alcohol; however, consumption in a “private setting” is not prohibited by Oklahoma law. Minors may not have a blood alcohol level of more than .02%.  History  When Oklahoma became a state in 1907, the state constitution included the prohibition of alcohol. In 1933 when the Federal government repealed the 18th Amendment, Oklahoma did not ratify the new 21st Amendment and instead approved the sale of beer containing not more than 3.2 alcohol by weight with the Oklahoma Beer Act of 1933. On April 7, 1959, the legislature voted on House Bill 825, which repealed prohibition and created the Alcohol Control Board, known now as the ABLE commission (Alcohol Beverage Laws Enforcement). Alcohol stronger than 3.2% abw could only by sold by a licensed retail package store at room temperature. Any establishment with a beer license could sell 3.2% abw beer regulated by Oklahoma's ABLE commission. In 1976 Oklahoma's distribution laws, commonly known as reverse franchising or the open wholesale system, prompted a local distributor to sue a major domestic brewer for turning down an order and responded explaining that the brewing company already had a distributor in the same territory. An Oklahoma Supreme Court judge issued an opinion ruling that the brewing company violation of Oklahoma's distribution laws that prohibited franchising among distributors. In response, most major domestic brewers discontinued selling strong beer in Oklahoma in the late 1970s, only selling 3.2% abw beer since it was not regulated by ABLE. This moratorium continued until the early 2010s when some of the major domestic brewing companies returned a few of their products back to liquor store shelves due to strong demand by Oklahoma consumers. On Tuesday, September 18, 1984, Oklahoma became the 49th state to allow liquor by the drink with the passage of State Question 563 with 51% of the vote. In the 2016 November general elections, Oklahoma overwhelmingly passed State Question 792, which was the most comprehensive reform of Oklahoma's alcoholic beverage laws. The reform allowed grocery stores, convenience stores, pharmacies and other establishments to sell strong beer and wine, allows liquor stores to sell cold beverages as well as non- alcoholic items, and implemented a territorial franchise wholesale system which encouraged major domestic brewers and other craft brewers to begin selling in Oklahoma for the first time in decades. Liquor sales Under Oklahoma law, it is a felony to provide alcoholic beverages to the \\"mentally deficient,\\" the intoxicated, and persons under 21 years of age. Although low- point beer may not be sold where unclothed persons or persons with exposed private parts are present on the same premises, alcohol sales are available by the glass if permitted by the county. Conviction of this crime is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500 for each offense. Off- premises Sunday packaged liquor (off-premises) sales are legal in 7 counties: Oklahoma, Tulsa, Cleveland, Creek, Kingfisher, Muskogee and Washington.https://www.tulsaworld.com/news/tulsa-six-counties-approve-sunday- liquor-store-sales/article_2be96ec7-9d81-5ad6-8922-6ed00cd8a81c.html Counties can approve Sunday liquor sales through a special election. Sales also are prohibited on Thanksgiving Day (United States) and Christmas Day. Wine and beer for consumption off-premises may not be sold between 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. Hours of sale for off-premise beer and wine may differ in some rural counties. Liquor stores are permitted to operate between 8:00 a.m. and Midnight Monday through Saturday and from Noon to 6:00 p.m. Sundays in counties where permitted. Delivery of alcoholic beverages by licensed businesses (restaurants, grocery stores and package liquor stores) is legal. People who have been convicted of a felony or any alcohol-related crime may not obtain a license to sell packaged alcohol. On-premises Alcohol may not be sold for consumption on-premises or allowed to be consumed in places licensed to sell alcohol between 2:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. This crime is punishable by a fine of up to $500 and up to 6 months imprisonment. Licensed vendors may not advertise happy hours, serve more than two beverages at a time to a customer, give a discount to a person or group of persons, or permit the play of games that involve drinking. As of June 2018, all 77 counties allow liquor by the drink. The last 14 counties that only allowed private bottle clubs as well as beer taverns and restaurants permitted to sell only low-point beer (3.2% alcohol by weight) voted to go wet prior to new laws that went into effect on October 1 that eliminated low-point beer. Since off-premises sales are allowed in all 77 counties, no dry counties exist in Oklahoma, much like the neighboring state of Missouri, and unlike its neighboring states of Kansas, Arkansas and Texas. Open container In public It is illegal to consume or inhale intoxicating beverages in public in Oklahoma. It also is illegal to be drunk or intoxicated in any public place. These crimes are punishable by a fine of between $10 and $100 and between 5 and 30 days of imprisonment. These crimes may cost more as fines to individual cities rather than the state (e.g. StillwaterBond Schedule , Stillwater Police Department. (accessed October 9, 2013) and Oklahoma City). Driving Opened bottles or any alcoholic beverage with a broken seal may not be stored in an area of the vehicle accessible to the driver. As a result, Oklahoma meets the provisions of the federal Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century for prohibitions of open containers in vehicles. DUI Like every other state in the United States, driving under the influence is a crime in Oklahoma, and is subject to a great number of regulations. It is illegal to drive with a blood or breath alcohol content of 0.08% or more, or while under the influence of alcohol or any other intoxicating substance. For any person under 21 years of age, Oklahoma has a zero tolerance policy. The breath alcohol limit for such a person is 0.02%, and any measurable level of alcohol by a breathalyzer is an automatic DUI and driver's license revocation. This crime is punishable by a fine of up $1,000 US dollars and up to 1 year imprisonment after being evaluated by a person certified by the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse. Minors, adults under age 21, and alcohol in Oklahoma It is a misdemeanor for persons under 21 years of age to give the impression that they are older for the purpose of obtaining alcoholic beverages. Punishment for this crime is a fine of up to $300 and up to 30 days of community service. Furthermore, the driving license of the convicted individual will be revoked for 6 months for the first offense, 1 year for the second offense, and 2 years for all subsequent offenses, alternatively for any offense they can have their license revoked until they reach 21 years of age at the discretion of the judge. Landowners cannot lawfully permit a person under 21 years of age to consume alcohol on their property. Punishment for this crime is a fine between $2,500 and $5,000 and up to 5 years of imprisonment. If a minor is pulled over and charged by an officer to be in violation of any alcohol law, a copy of the violation will be mailed to the legal guardian(s) of the child within three days.

Apart from engravings, his artistic specialties included landscape painting and commemorative art (including works for the opening of the Suez Canal and the marriage of a daughter of the Czar).Arthur B. Evans: The Illustrators of Jules Verne’s Voyages Extraordinaires. In Science-Fiction Studies, XXV:2 (July 1998), p. 250. His collaboration with Jules Verne started in 1865 with the publication of Verne's novel Five Weeks in a Balloon, and continued for a run of six novels in all: *Five Weeks in a Balloon (1865): 51 illustrations by Riou (40) and Henri de Montaut (5), unsigned (6), wood-engravings by Coste, Delaville, Dumont, Fournier, Hildibrand, Pannemaker, Prunaire *The Adventures of Captain Hatteras (1866): 259 illustrations by Riou (190) and Henri de Montaut (69), wood-engravings by Barbant, Cazat, Delaville, Dumont, Hildibrand, Joliet, Linton, Pannemaker, Pierdon, Pisan, Prunaire *Journey to the Center of the Earth (1867): 56 illustrations, wood-engravings by Pannemaker, Gauchard, Charles Maurand *The Children of Captain Grant (1868): 175 illustrations, engraving by Delaville, Gauchard, Maurand, Pannemaker, Prunaire *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1871): 111 illustrations by Riou (24, the first eleven chapters) and Alphonse de Neuville (86), wood-engravings by Hildibrand *The Survivors of the Chancellor (1875): 45 illustrations by Riou (45) and Jules Férat (13), wood-engravings by Charles Barbant, Crosbie, Dumont, Hildibrand, Louis, Méaulle, Pannemaker Regarding Riou's work for Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, Verne wrote in 1868: \\"I have received the drawings from Riou. I have several suggestions to make which I’ll mention to him by return mail. I think he needs to make the people much smaller and the rooms much larger. And he needs to add much more detail... By the way, it was an excellent idea to use Colonel Charras as the model for Captain Nemo. I should’ve thought of that.\\"Charles-Noël Martin: La Vie et l’oeuvre de Jules Verne (Paris: Michel de l’Ormeraie, 1978), p. 176. The illustrator and Verne scholar Ron Miller has said: \\"I believe his work stylistically spans the transition between the illustrators of the early 19th century and those of the latter half—when the profession of professional illustrators became established. Some of the qualities that Riou carried over were the often cartoon-like depiction of characters and the use of numerous ‘spot’ illustrations.”Cited in Arthur B. Evans: The Illustrators of Jules Verne’s Voyages Extraordinaires. In Science-Fiction Studies, XXV:2 (July 1998), p. 250. Edmondo Marcucci wrote: \\"Riou’s drawings are rich with light, and the traits of his characters have a vigorous expression. Riou succeeds in adapting himself artistically to the realistic reproduction of the many fantastic locales of the Vernian fictional geography: the mists and the glacial icepacks, the shadows inside the Earth’s crust, the deserted and expansive beaches, and the many bodies of water and their movement... Everything is both ordered and evocative in Riou’s work—his style might be called 'romantic realism.'\\"Edmondo Marcucci: Les Illustrations des Voyages Extraordinaires de Jules Verne (Bordeaux: Ed. Société Jules Verne, 1956), pp. 18–19. Riou also illustrated Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe (1880) and Waverley, Victor Hugo’s Notre Dame de Paris, Louis Figuier's La terre avant le deluge (1863), Alexandre Dumas’ The Count of Monte Cristo (1887). He became a member of the Legion of Honour. Riou died in Paris in 1900.

It is located between Waters Grove, Marlborough Road and Hardy Crescent. History Established in 1993 following the amalgamation of Eastern Secondary College and Heathmont Secondary College, the college operated as a dual campus school until it was consolidated onto the Waters Grove (Junior & Middle School) campus for the start of Term 2, 2003.Student Handbook - Middle School (Consolidation Method), April 2003College Profile, accessed on 3 March 2009 Composition of school Heathmont College is organised into a House structure. Houses are overseen by a Head of House and House Leader. Houses operate on a vertical structure incorporates all students in Years 712. It is designed to ensure ongoing pastoral care throughout the student's time at the College. A new Year 9 'Life' program commenced in 2017. This focuses on four key areas - Work, Body and Mind, Community Service and Leadership. The success of the program led to an associated program called with Discover which is based within the new House structure. The school currently focuses on ensuring that Year 7 students have a smooth transition from primary school to secondary school. There is a range of programs that the school provides Year 7 students with to participate in ranging from a camp in the first week, to great leadership opportunities and student wellbeing programs. An extensive transition program has been implemented to assist students as they move into secondary education. There is also a range of opportunities for Year 8's such as becoming members of the Student Representative Council. There are pastoral care sessions to ensure Year Eights are getting the most of their schooling. In Year Nine, students are able to select from a broad range of electives. This provides students with a great range of choice and responsibility. The program goes over the course of a year and allows the students to work in a range of situations in different groups and individually. The objectives of the program are to provide students with good life skills and to have student centered learning. A significantly revised program of offerings was developed and introduced at the Years 9 and 10 allowing for significant opportunities for students to engage in extension activities. . While in the 9 'Life' program, students are provided with the opportunity to go into Melbourne City and participate in a wide range of activities based on what the students are currently learning in class as well as some fun and exciting activities. Heads of Houses The Houses are called Red,(Monash) Yellow,(Flynn) Blue (Gilmore)and Green.(Hollows): Throughout 2019 the Houses will decide on their names and mascots in addition to determining what charities they will support. A Central tour for Year 11 students and a Valedictory Ball, and a Year 12 Study Camp at the Lord Somers Camp are some of the functions available for students to participate in. om Programs and subjects German Immersion Program Heathmont College offers a comprehensive German program whereby students undertake not only a German language class but are taught two subjects in German. For example, in Year 7 students are taught Science and Humanities immersed in German. Sport The college offers various outdoor and indoor physical activities including: swimming and diving, athletics and cross-country skiing and competitions in badminton, basketball, netball, soccer, volleyball, tennis, table tennis, cricket, football, golf, and hockey. Excel program The Excel program has recently been introduced to the College to improve its academic outcomes. Students are selected on the basis of testing conducted at the College prior to the commencement of Year 7. This program supports and extends students in Mathematics and English through to Year 10. The recent, significant improvement in Naplan results are a result of the increase in academic rigour at the College. 2017 saw the introduction of the German CLIL program in which students study a rigorous language program which includes two subjects being taught in German as well as a German Language subject. The College benefitted from significant support from the Goethe Institute to develop this program. Year 7 students study Science and Humanities in the German Language. In 2016 a rigorous subject completion policy was introduced throughout the College. Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) The Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) is offered to all students in Years 11 and 12. Many VCE subjects are also offered to Year 10 students. Those Year 10 students who satisfactorily complete Units 1 and 2 in a subject are permitted to continue that study at the Unit 3 and 4 level in Year 11, alongside their Year 12 peers. This acceleration makes a significant contribution to the maximisation of their ATAR at the completion of VCE. A broad range of subjects is offered, including Chemistry, Physics, Outdoor Education, History, Global Politics, English Literature, German, Indonesian, Accounting, Methods and Specialist Mathematics, Legal Studies and Business Management. From 2014, the College saw a distinct improvement in ATAR scores obtained by students and 99% of students obtained a first round offer into such diverse fields as Law, Medicine, Environmental Engineering, Nursing, and Archaeology. The College was awarded a Premier's Award in Chemistry in 2016. In 2017, the College was once more reported as obtaining higher than expected results in the VCE in the DET generated Annual Report. Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning (VCAL) The Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning (VCAL) program is offered to students in Years 11 and 12 which is run via the atEast consortium which operates out of the College grounds. LOTE The College offers three LOTE (Languages other than English) programs, Indonesian, German and Chinese First Language - Years 11 and 12 only. Students may continue study in either language to VCE level. These studies are enhanced by the accompanying relationship with sister schools and the overseas tour program. International program Heathmont College became accredited to offer education to International students in 2016. An on site English Language Centre will commenced in 2017 where students are immersed in English for 6 months before joining mainstream classes.

(十萬個為什麼) is a 1993 Cantonese album recorded by Chinese Cantopop singer Faye Wong as 王靖雯 Wong Ching Man, when she was based in Hong Kong. It is named after a popular Chinese science book, One Hundred Thousand Whys by Ye Yonglie. The album included several hit singles: \\"Flow Not Fly\\", \\"Summer Of Love\\", \\"Like Wind\\", \\"Cold War\\", \\"Tempted Heart\\" and \\"Tempt Me\\". \\"Flow Not Fly\\", a lively pop number, became an unofficial anthem for Faye Wong, with the repeated chorus line \\"Fei Fei\\" being a pun on the singer's name. \\"Cold War\\" is a Cantonese cover of \\"Silent All These Years\\" by Tori Amos; a Mandarin version followed on Mystery. The song was a departure from mainstream C-pop, and Wong followed this markedly with further experiments in \\"alternative music\\" for her next Cantonese album, Random Thoughts. The album included four more cover songs. \\"Summer of Love\\" is the Cantonese version of Helen Hoffner's 1993 hit. \\"Like Wind\\" is a cover of the Mandarin song 猜心 (\\"Guess my Heart\\") by One-Fang. \\"Rainy Days Without You\\" covers Love Unlimited's \\"Walking in the Rain (With The One I Love)\\", and \\"Do Do Da Da\\" is The Police's \\"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da\\". \\"Do We Really Care\\" was Faye Wong's second song recorded wholly in English, after \\"Kisses in the Wind\\" on Coming Home. The Japanese version of the album released in April 1994 included three bonus tracks: another version of \\"Like Wind\\", a Mandarin version of \\"Fragile Woman\\" (from Coming Home), and \\"Forgetting You Is Like Forgetting Me\\", the theme from The Bride with White Hair 2. \\"Tempted Heart\\" was the theme for the TVB series Eternity, in which Wong also appeared. \\"Tempt Me\\" was the theme tune for Joan Chen's 1993 film Temptation of a Monk, and won a Best Movie Song award. Wong's 1994-95 series of concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum included five songs from the album: the first four, and \\"Tempt Me\\" which was extended with a prelude.

Licensed to Springfield, Missouri, United States, the station serves the Springfield MO area. The station is owned by the Radio Training Network, Inc. History KWFC began broadcasting on April 17, 1969 at 97.3-FM in Springfield. At the time, the commercial station operated for most of the day, but would shut down for the night. Those early days saw a programming mix of teaching, preaching and music. The musical format was not strictly southern gospel as it is today, primarily because the genre didn't have that designation nationally. Instead, according to a 1970 Billboard magazine article,Billboard Magazine, Jul 25, 1970, p. 29. the station aired a mix of gospel, contemporary and easy listening Christian music. That musical format would stay with the station until the 1980s when the Christian music genre diverged into better defined subgenres (southern gospel, inspirational, contemporary Christian). At that time, KWFC became primarily southern gospel. KWFC moved into the W.F. \\"Bill\\" Askew Broadcast Center in 1979. The original transmitter facility was also located on the BBC campus on a 400-foot tower. In 1985, Baptist Bible College sold the 97.3 MHz frequency to Demaree Media, which then founded KXUS. At that time, KWFC moved to 89.1-FM and began operations as a non-commercial educational station. In 1998, KWFC and BBC purchased a 1,000 foot tower (formerly used by KSPR) at Fordland, and relocated to that location. At around that same time, KWFC began expanding into another technology, the Internet. In 1998, KWFC.org was launched to meet the growing demand to get information out to the world. KWFC would begin streaming its signal over the Internet in 2006. In January 2015, Baptist Bible College, Inc., sold KWFC to the Radio Training Network. The sale closed on January 30, 2015, at a price of $1,301,000. KWFC's studios were moved to 2550 S. Campbell Ave in Springfield where they continue to operate to this date. Early leadership KWFC's beginnings spawned from radio piracy when a young Jim Price began tinkering in radio as a teenager. He built a pirate radio station in his parent's garage. Not long after that, he found legitimate work as a DJ and engineer at a station in Detroit. As he got older, he moved to Springfield, Missouri, to attend Baptist Bible College. While a student at BBC, he convinced school leaders to begin building a Christian radio station on the campus. As the project moved along, BBC administrators hired Rev. Bill Askew. Jim would become KWFC's first Program Director, a title he held until he left the station in the late 1970s. In 1979, he helped found Sterling Communications in Ringgold, Georgia. He spent the rest of his life helping others fulfill their dreams of building radio stations across the country. Jim died in 2011. Rev. Askew began his radio career in the U.S. Marine Corps where he was a radio man serving in the Pacific theater in World War II. Following the war, he began working in commercial radio. Technology at that time required the use of engineers constantly at the station or any outside broadcast. While working for a station in Florida, Bill was assigned to be the engineer for a live broadcast from a local church. At the end of one of these services, Bill went forward to accept Jesus into his life. This would forever change the course of his life. Over the years, Bill would work in radio and become a pastor in Florida. In 1968, he was hired by BBC to become KWFC's first General Manager. He and Jim Price worked together to make KWFC a reality. Bill Askew would spend two stints as the station's manager. These two terms allowed him to lead the growth in the early days of KWFC, the new beginning in 1985 when KWFC moved to 89.1-FM, and the transmitter move to Fordland in 1998. He served KWFC until his death in September 2000. Awards In September 2008, KWFC DJs Gary Longstaff and Dave Taylor won the Singing News Golden Mic award. In March 2010, Program Director Kyle Dowden won the Singing News Golden Mic award. In September 2013, KWFC was awarded Radio Station of the Year by the Southern Gospel Music Guild during the NQC Music Awards. In February 2015, Dave Taylor won the Singing News Golden Mic award for a second time.

In many maps these islands appear with the name Scott-Gansen Islands; this version of the name is inspired by the Russian spelling. The Scott-Hansen group belongs to the Krasnoyarsk Krai administrative division of Russia. It is part of the Great Arctic State Nature Reserve, the largest nature reserve of Russia. The westernmost island is larger than the other two, but even so it is only about 3 km in length. The individual islands don't have separate names in common maps and are thus named as a group. The sea surrounding these islands is covered with pack ice with some polynias in the winter and there are many ice floes even in the summer. Sigurd Scott-Hansen Lieutenant Sigurd Scott Hansen This archipelago is named after Sigurd Scott-Hansen (1868-1937), a Norwegian naval lieutenant, who was in charge of the astronomical and meteorological observations during Fridtjof Nansen's 1893 polar expedition on the Fram. Sigurd Scott-Hansen was born in Leith, Scotland where his father, Andreas Hansen, was the parish priest at the Norwegian Sailors' Church. Scott- Hansen grew up in Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway and made his career in the Royal Norwegian Navy. In 1889 he became 2nd lieutenant, in 1892 1st lieutenant, in 1898 captain and in 1910 he was appointed commander. Between 1893–1896, he joined in The First Fram Expedition under the leadership of Fridtjof Nansen. He was in charge of the meteorological, astronomical and magnetic data.

It remains the deadliest fire in New Zealand history. Background Ballantynes is a Christchurch department store that traces its origins back to a millinery and drapery business that began in the front room of a Cashel Street residence in 1854. After being named Dunstable House and going through a couple of owners and a couple of buildings as it grew, it was purchased by John Ballantyne in 1872. The business was managed as a series of partnerships involving Ballantyne family members until formed as the company J. Ballantyne & Co. in 1920. From its humble beginnings the Ballantynes business expanded until, by 1947, it occupied 80 m of street front in Cashel Street, 50 m in Colombo Street and another 21 m in Lichfield Street. This prime corner site covered about an acre that contained seven conjoined buildings, six of which had three or more hardwood floors that were interconnected on multiple levels by large passageways between the buildings to allow staff and customers to move freely about the store. Ballantynes by the time of the fire was widely known as the queen of department stores in the city. The showrooms, fitting rooms, art gallery and sumptuous tearooms catered to the elite of Canterbury. The business was owned and managed by two brothers and who were of the Ballantyne family. Yet a dignified Italianate facade concealed dangerous secrets. The store's interior partitions had untreated soft wood-fibre linings that had been permitted by the Christchurch City Council contrary to its own bylaws. Due to the quantity of clothes made on the premises, the buildings were classified as factory buildings, which helped them to pass a Labour Department inspection in 1943. Two of the buildings had been constructed before fire escapes became a mandatory requirement, and the Fire Brigade had not directed the owners to install them despite a 1930 bylaw requiring it to do so. Fire protection was provided by manual fire extinguishers, although staff were not formally trained in their use. There were manually operated fire doors that could be closed across the openings between buildings. Klaxons that had been installed during the Second World War and the Vigilant sprinkler fire alarm in one building had not been maintained and both were eventually removed. Although the store had held evacuation drills during wartime these had ended when hostilities ceased. There was no emergency evacuation plan and evacuation was left to the initiative of individual department heads. Many staff only knew the layout of their own workrooms and were unaware of alternative egress routes. At the time of the fire Ballantynes employed 458 people, over 300 of whom were women. Many of these workers worked on the upper floors in various back-office departments. The company claimed after the fire that around 250 to 300 customers were inside the building when smoke was first seen coming from a cellar, many of whom were not inside the showrooms but inside the elaborate neoclassical tearooms on an upper floor, having afternoon tea while listening to a string trio. Fire ChristChurch Cathedral It started in the basement of the furniture department, which was located at southern end of the Colombo Street frontage of the complex. The cause of the fire was never established. Although an electrical fault or a discarded cigarette butt were both suggested as possibilities, the former could not be excluded by the commission of enquiry. The latter was considered equally unlikely as Keith Smith, the employee who was last working in the cellar, had left at about 3:30pm for his afternoon tea break. He had gone across the street to smoke a cigarette with a friend, since Ballantynes had a strict no-smoking policy on its premises. Just after 3:30pm, smoke from the fire was first noticed coming up the cellar stairs. The staff had no access to a formal fire evacuation plan. Staff discovering the fire informed their floor manager upon their own initiative. Someone contacted the phone operator and stated that the fire brigade be called. The sequence of delays, errors, and fatal mistakes made by management during the next 25 minutes have been portrayed most memorably in the novel Gardens of Fire by historian and novelist Stevan Eldred-Grigg, who based the book on detailed research and interviews with survivors. Some showrooms on the ground floor were evacuated by sales employees taking their own initiative, but staff in some of the other showrooms on the ground floor were ordered by management to 'carry on' or 'stand by'. As soon as things got hot for them, they left on their own behest. Staff in other areas of the building complex were not even made aware of the fire as there was no fire alarm. Some staff returned to their work areas after their tea-break while others evacuated the building. Even the arriving fire brigade crews did not realise at once that there were still people on the upper floors of the building complex. The first telephone call to the fire brigade was logged at 3:46pm, though the phone operator simply stated that she was told to inform them there was a cellar fire at Ballantyne's. When the first fire appliance arrived about two minutes later at the Lichfield Street entrance the firefighters saw no sign of fire there. They then moved into Colombo Street where they saw smoke coming out of an enclosed alleyway. They were met by joint managing director Roger Ballantyne, who showed the fire crew a back access way to the cellar. They spent about 10 minutes searching for the seat of the fire but were unable to locate it. Two other appliances had made their way to Ballantynes via Cashel Street and set up as the search commenced. The senior fire officer ordered a Brigade Call, although that order was only received by the fire station at 4:00pm. The firefighter making the call had to first push through the crowd to get to a pharmacy and then had to wait for the overloaded telephone exchange lines to clear before he could make the call. Half an hour after the fire was approximately discovered, the heat and smoke went into flashover, erupting across the cojoined first-floors of the Congreve's, Goodman's, and Pratt's buildings. After flashover the first floor was almost instantly consumed by a wall of flame. Over time superheated gas and fire began working into the floors above. Workers on the multiple top floor attempted to denote their location to firefighters by banging at windows before being killed by heat, fire or smoke. However, the fire-brigade ladders were obstructed from reaching the top floor by the store's rigid verandahs. Two credit department employees jumped together from a top floor window of Pratt's Building on the corner of Colombo and Cashel Streets. They landed, injured but alive, on a slate verandah and were rescued by members of the public using a ladder and taken to hospital. Violet Cody, another credit worker, leapt from another window in Pratt's Building whereupon she landed on another slate verandah. She then slewed upside down and then fell head first to the pavement in Cashel Street. She and her unborn child later died in hospital. Kenneth Ballantyne had found himself trapped. Along with some of the women from the credit department and in spite of the growing signs of disaster he had kept the staff working until about 3:55pm. At this point he climbed out onto a window ledge as the fire engulfed the floor behind him and was the last person to be rescued by firefighters from Pratt's Building at 4:10pm. Forty-one of his staff perished. Ballantyne Memorial Rose Garden at Ruru Lawn Cemetery It has been noted that office employees were not evacuated as policy required that insured equipment be stored away in a fireproof strong room first. These consisted of 25 bins, two typewriters, several adding machines and a number of boxes of records. These survived the fire. The centre of the complex began to collapse soon after. Firefighters and Police were able to gain entry to the ground floor about 6pm, where they found a number of bodies near the exits and others hanging from beams. None of the victims were identifiable apart from Violet Cody. The fire was put out by 8pm leaving the building as a gutted shell. It took four days to dampen down hot spots, demolish unsafe walls and recover other human remains. Planned celebrations for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth that were due to be held on 20 November 1947 were cancelled and flags were instead flown at half mast throughout New Zealand, apart from a few official exemptions on Government Buildings. The ChristChurch Cathedral bell- ringers cancelled their wedding peals that were to be recorded and later broadcast on radio. A civic mass funeral was held on 23 November at Ruru Lawn Cemetery in Bromley, the largest funeral in Christchurch’s history. The Ballantyne Memorial Rose Garden was built at Ruru Lawn Cemetery. The pergola that is part of the memorial collapsed in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake but was later rebuilt. Commission of Enquiry A commission later determined that the fire response had been inadequate and the building had not met fire regulations, though it had passed its last inspection four years earlier. The commission noted that the 30 minutes between the first call to the fire brigade and point of flashover would have been enough time to evacuate everyone in the building without injury. Recommendations were made for changes in fire prevention and firefighting for all of New Zealand. Urgent changes were recommended to building regulations and fire safety requirements to prevent similar disasters. Business recovery After the fire, Ballantynes continued to trade from its undamaged building in Lichfield Street. The fire- damaged buildings were demolished and the main Ballantynes store was rebuilt on the corner of Colombo Street and Cashel Street. Legacy A dramatisation of the fire, Ablaze, was directed by Josh Frizzell and screened by TVNZ in 2019.

The Cistercian Order used the same floor plan for all its abbeys, which makes it possible to easily locate the different rooms and halls regardless of the building site. History A wooden and a stone church were both erected on the site before the abbey was built. The stone church was erected in the 1040s at the latest, and is the oldest known stone church in Sweden (excluding Skåne). According to radiocarbon dating, the oldest Christian man buried there died in the period 780-970. From other radiocarbon evidence, the Christian burials seem to have begun during the 10th century. A rich lady named Sigrid, probably a widow, donated the property to the cistercian monks, but the queen tried to revoke the donation and instead seize the property herself. The queen's attempts failed and the monks established the abbey in 1150.Varnhem - Klosterstaden: Historiska personer . (Swedish). Retrieved on October 8, 2008.

Retrieved on October 8, 2008. In 1234, the abbey was ruined by fire. The catastrophe led to a period of blooming, since Birger jarl and other mediaeval financiers rebuilt the abbey, this time more beautiful and imposing. The abbey church, which at first had been built in Romanesque style, was completed in Gothic style after the fire. In 1260 there was an opening ceremony for the church, which was the largest in Sweden at the time.\\"Varnhems Klosterkyrka\\" - brochure from Varnhems församling. (2003) (Swedish). The abbey's property was confiscated in 1527 in accordance with the Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden, and the abbey buildings were burned by Danish forces 1566 during the Northern Seven Years' War. In the middle of the 17th century, Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie received the abbey as a gift from the Swedish queen Christina. De la Gardie restored the church and established a family mausoleum in it, while the remaining abbey buildings were left to decay. The church was thoroughly restored 1911–1923. Archeological excavations of the central part of the abbey were made 1921–1929, and again 1976 and 1977. In May 2002, the grave of Birger jarl was opened. The scientific analysis that followed, strengthened the belief that the three skeletons in the grave are the remains of Birger jarl, his son duke Eric Birgersson and Birger's wife Mechtild of Holstein.

There was a special transport carriage for just the gun when traveling long distances. Putting it on its turntable took even more time to assemble. The rate of fire was at best two rounds per minute.Bishop, Chris. The encyclopedia of weapons of world War II. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., 2002, p.133 Around a hundred were built between 1939 and 1943. It was not popular in service as it was regarded as too much gun for too little shell. This caused its production to be terminated in August 1943. Many were used in coastal installations.

The procedure was followed from c.1195 until 1833, and the considerable body of resulting records is now held at The National Archives, Kew, London. History In the reign of Henry II of England, the royal justices first began the practice of registering the settlement of disagreements over land by having both parties bring a suit before the royal courts. The resulting decision was thus given royal sanction. At first, two copies of the agreement (\\"fine\\") were made, created as chirographs: i.e. the text was written in duplicate on a single piece of parchment, which was then cut in half, one copy going to each of the litigants. Under Hubert Walter's justiciarship, probably about 1195, the practice was started of writing the text in triplicate, so that a third copy could be filed in the Treasury. This copy of the text was written at the foot of the piece of parchment, and so became known as the \\"foot of the fine\\", or simply \\"foot of fine\\". The first recorded foot of fine is endorsed with the statement \\"This is the first chirograph that was made in the king's court in the form of three chirographs, according to the command of his lordship of Canterbury and other barons of the king, to the end that by this form a record can be made to be passed on to the treasurer to put in the treasury.\\"Clanchy From Memory to Written Record p. 68 The agreement concerns Walter's brother Theobald, who was the plaintiff.Clanchy From Memory to Written Record pp. 68–73 Within a few years, the practice of recording feet of fines had spread widely, and even to Scotland, as in 1198 an agreement between William de Bruce of Annandale and Adam of Carlisle over eight ploughgates in Lockerbie, Scotland was filed with the English treasury, recorded with those from Northumberland. While early fines could be made in the Exchequer, after the early 14th century, fines were always made in the Court of Common Pleas. The practice survived until fines were abolished by the Fines and Recoveries Act of 1833.

Riva is a privately held company, the whole shareholders' equity being held by the Riva family.  History  Early history Riva Acciaio was founded in 1954 in Milan by Adriano and Emilio Riva as an iron scrap trading business. In 1957 the first Riva Acciaio mini-mill was built in Caronno Pertusella near Saronno. A few years later, this plant became the first steelworks in Italy to use continuous casting, in partnership with steel plant engineer Danieli. In the 1960s Riva expanded in Italy by purchasing smaller rivals.  1970s-1990s Starting from the 1970s, Riva took part in the privatization process of the ailing European steel industrySee Stephan Moinov, Privatization in the iron and steel industry, International Labour Office, Geneva 1995, pp. 33-78. by making further acquisitions in the main European countries such as Italy (the previously state-owned steelworks Acciaierie di Cornigliano in Genoa), Belgium (Charleroi-Marcinelle plant) and France (Alpa plant in Gargenville).(2) M. Affinito, M. De Cecco, A. Dringoli, Le privatizzazioni dell’industria manifatturiera italiana, Roma 2000, pp. 83-84. In 1992 it acquired directly from the German Treuhandanstalt two important plants (Brandenburger Elektrostahlwerke and Henningsdorfer Elektrostahlwerke) in the former German Democratic Republic. In 1995 Riva Acciaio purchased ILVA from the Italian government, becoming one of the main European steel producers. Due to the important role played in the privatization of the European steel industry, Emilio Riva was awarded the Grand Cross of Merit by the King of Belgium (2000), the Grand Cross of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (2002) and the French Legion of Honour (2005).http://www.rivagroup.com/en/the_group/emilio_riva Étienne Davignon, former European Commissioner and Vice-president of the European Commission, has defined Emilio Riva as “prophet of this dynamic and optimistic vision of private enterprise”, affirming that “steelmaking is not an industry like the others, and the Riva group is not an industrial group like the others”.Étienne Davignon, Foreword to Riva 1954-1994, a cura di Margherita Balconi, Milan 1995, p. 2.  Ilva scandal On February 2, 2012, a report by Istituto Superiore di Sanità revealed extreme levels of air pollution and an abnormal incidence of cancer and cardiovascular diseases around the city of Taranto, where the ILVA giant steelworks are located. Following the report, Emilio Riva and his son Nicola, along with Taranto plant top managers, were arrested for allegedly causing an environmental disaster, and the plant was seized. However, the resulting \\"Ambiente Svenduto\\" (Italian for \\"environment undersold\\") trial has been mostly inconclusive. Emilio Riva died in 2014 aged 87, while his brother Adriano Riva, that succeeded Emilio at the top of the family business after the scandal, died in 2019 aged 88, after having reached a €1.3bn settlement with the Italian state. Fabio Riva, another son of founder Emilio and ex-deputy of Riva Group, was convicted for fraud and sentenced to 6 years and 3 months in jail on 24 April, 2018. The Italian state sold the Taranto plant to ArcelorMittal in May 2018 for 1.8 billion. As of March 2020, the Ambiente Svenduto trial is still ongoing and Nicola Riva remans among the defendants.  Criticism  Taranto Plant On March 8, 2006 the Court of Cassation convicted Emilio Riva to 18 months granting conditional leniency, with regard to events occurred from December 1997 to November 1998 related to an attempted illegal coercion of some ILVA employees which Emilio Riva had been charged with others.Source: Decision n. 31413/2006 by the Court of Cassation on March 8th, 2006. On June 16, 2010 the Court of Cassation declared the extinction because of the statute of limitations of all the violations which Emilio Riva, among others, had been charged with, as to the events occurred from July 2000 to September 2002 related to the supposed violation of anti-pollution regulations in the management of the Ilva factory of Taranto.Source: Decision n. 33170/2010 by the Court of Cassation on June 16th, 2010.

Formerly called Blanco Islet, this island is named after its most famous resident, \\"Black Sam\\" Bellamy, the \\"prince of pirates\\". For much of his very short but wildly successful campaign of piracy in 1716 and 1717, Bellamy used this islet, which was named Blanco Islet at the time, as his base of operations, while crew members used the protection of Trellis Bay to maintain their fleet of ships. Bellamy soon learned that from Blanco, as well as from nearby Sprat Point, ships could be seen sailing through the Sir Francis Drake Channel. His favourite prey were Spanish Galleons laden with treasure intended for the exclusive use of the King and Queen of Spain. In the early 1950s the small island was acquired by Władysław (Wladek) Wagner, the \\"first Polish yachtsman\\", who left Poland in 1932 to sail around the world and who ended up eventually settling in Trellis Bay, Beef Island Tortola in the British Virgin Islands, where he built a boatyard and marine railway in addition to most of the buildings now standing on Bellamy Cay, where he ran a small restaurant and hotel.

Real Madrid Club de Fútbol is a professional football club based in Madrid, Spain. In addition to their domestic success, Real Madrid's reputation as a major club was established by their outstanding record in the European Cup. To date, they have been crowned champions of Europe a record thirteen times. Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás and other famous players helped the club win the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included a memorable 7–3 Hampden Park final against German side Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960. The club won the trophy for a sixth time in 1966 with a team known as the Ye-Ye that defeated Yugoslavian club Partizan 2–1 in the final while being composed entirely of Spanish-born players, a first in the competition. They were also runners-up in 1962, 1964 and 1981. Winning the competition five consecutive times saw Real permanently awarded the original cup and earning the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour. They have also won the UEFA Cup twice and were twice runners-up in the European Cup Winners' Cup. In 1996, president Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach. Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions and several important players arrived at the club, such as Roberto Carlos, Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker and Clarence Seedorf, to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid, with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997, finally ended its 32-year wait for the seventh European Cup in 1998 under manager Jupp Heynckes, defeating Juventus 1–0 in the final thanks to a goal from Mijatović. Real Madrid would go on to win again in 2000, 2002 (under manager Vicente del Bosque), 2014 (under manager Carlo Ancelotti), 2016, 2017 and 2018 (under manager Zinedine Zidane). Real Madrid is also seven-time winners of the Intercontinental Cup/FIFA Club World Cup, defeating Peñarol, Vasco da Gama, Olimpia Asunción, San Lorenzo, Kashima Antlers, Grêmio and Al Ain in 1960, 1998, 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018 respectively. Early years Real Madrid team in 1906. The club won its second Copa del Rey that year. Football was introduced to Madrid by students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza. They included several Oxbridge graduates. In 1897, they founded a club called Sky, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, they split into two different clubs: New Foot-Ball de Madrid and Madrid Football Club. On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded and won the first of four consecutive Copa del Rey titles, which was the only nationwide competition at that time. In 1912, they moved to a ground called Campo de O'Donnell, after previously moving between some minor grounds.The Stadium Guide - The Story of Real Madrid In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII, a reputed football fan, granted the title of real (\\"royal\\" in English ) to the club. When the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed in 1931, however, the club dropped both the word Real and the royal crown from the emblem, being known from then on and until the end of the Spanish Civil War as Madrid C.F. only. The addition of the purple band to the emblem dates back to the Republican period and has remained there ever since.Real Madrid and its 115 years of history, glory and honor (in Spanish) http://libero.pe In 1937, due to the stagnation of the Civil War, all activity was stopped and the club virtually ceased to exist.  The Bernabéu Yeste Era (1943–1978)  Before becoming president in 1945, Santiago Bernabéu Yeste had already carried out the functions of player, first-team captain, club maintenance, first-team manager and director in an association with the club that would last nearly 70 years. He was responsible for rebuilding the club after the Civil War and under his presidency the construction of the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and the Ciudad Deportiva. Bernabéu also reorganized the club at all levels in what would become the normal operating hierarchy of professional clubs in the future, giving every section and level of the club independent technical teams and recruiting staff, such as Raimundo Saporta. Moreover, under Bernabéu's tutelage, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or \\"cantera,\\" known today as La Fábrica. Finally, beginning in 1953, Bernabéu embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being the Argentine Alfredo di Stéfano, and built the world's first truly multinational squad. During Bernabéu's presidency, many of Real Madrid's most legendary names played for the club, including Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Francisco Gento, Héctor Rial, Raymond Kopa, José Santamaría, Miguel Muñoz, Amancio and Santillana. It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid became established as a major force in both Spanish and European football. Before passing away in 1978, Bernabéu had been the club's president for 33 years, during which Real won one Intercontinental Cup, six European Cups, 16 La Liga titles and six Spanish Cups. The De Carlos Era (1978–1985) After a brief period as interim president, Raimundo Saporta called for elections. The club's treasurer, Luis de Carlos, resigned in order to run for president. 26 July 1978 was the deadline for candidates to apply in order to run for office. De Carlos submitted 3,352 documents endorsing his candidacy, while the rest – gynaecologist Campos Gil and florist José Daguerre – did not get the minimum number required in time. This called off the election and Luis de Carlos was proclaimed president of Real Madrid. On 4 June 1980, the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium hosted the Copa del Rey final between Real Madrid and Real Madrid Castilla, the club's second team that was initially founded on 21 July 1972. Castilla managed to defeat four First Division teams – Hércules, Athletic Bilbao, Real Sociedad and Sporting de Gijón – to reach the final. Real Madrid defeated Castilla, coached by the sorely-missed Juanjo, by a score of 6–1. Later in the year, France Football magazine named Real Madrid \\"Best European Team\\" of 1980. The jury took into account the two national titles the team won that year – La Liga and the Copa del Rey – and the fact that they reached the semifinals of the European Cup that season. Despite the previous year's successes, the 1980–81 season had an unpleasant finish for Madrid. On 26 April 1981, they lost the league title when the victory chant was already being sung in Valladolid. Real Sociedad, who drew 2–2 against Sporting de Gijón in the last minute at El Molinón, claimed the title. Barely one month later, in the 1981 European Cup Final on 27 May, an Alan Kennedy goal gave Liverpool the European Cup title over Madrid. The professional Real Madrid squad was one of four teams of the Primera División to back the strike called on 11 April 1982. On that day, the Whites played at Castellón with Castilla footballers and defeated the hosts 1–2. The Final of the 1982 FIFA World Cup took place at the Santiago Bernabéu. In a thrilling match, Italy outplayed West Germany and won 3–1. What most spectators will remember most from that 11 July 1982 was the joy that overcame President of Italy Sandro Pertini each time the Italian side scored. With the presidential elections on the horizon, candidate Luis de Carlos introduced Alfredo Di Stéfano and Amancio Amaro as coaches of the first team and Castilla, respectively, on 19 May 1982. \\"The Arrow,\\" as Di Stéfano was popularly known, initially left Madrid in 1964 only to return 18 years later. In the election, de Carlos defeated Ramón Mendoza in the election and Di Stéfano, who signed on for two years, won five runner-up titles in his first year as the Madridista coach. Once the 1983–84 season had ended, Di Stéfano again said goodbye to Real Madrid. Twenty-one years later he went through the same experience. His contract ended on 30 June 1984 and Luis de Carlos decided not to re-sign him due to the failure to achieve sporting success. On 12 December 1984, Emilio Butragueño became a European household name with an unforgettable performance against Anderlecht at the Bernabéu. The Belgians were coming off a 3–0 first leg win in Brussels and had the next round of the UEFA Cup in sight, but Butragueño crushed their hopes with a three-goal performance (the others by Valdano [two] and Sanchís) and Real Madrid won convincingly 6–1, progressing on aggregate. Real Madrid's first two UEFA Cup titles were won back-to-back—the first in 1985 against Hungary's Videoton (3–0 at Sóstói Stadion and 0–1 at Chamartín) and the second over 1. FC Köln in 1986 (5–1 at the Bernabéu and losing 2–0 at the Olympiastadion in Berlin). The Mendoza Era (1985–1995) After two brief stints as a director and an election-time defeat to Luis de Carlos, Ramón Mendoza's became president of Real Madrid in 1985, ushering in the dawn of a new era in the history of the club. La Quinta del Buitre \\"La Quinta del Buitre\\" was the name given by Spanish sport journalist Julio César Iglesias to the five homegrown Real Madrid players who were at the core of the team that dominated Spanish football in the 1980s. The name, meaning \\"Vulture's Cohort\\" in English, was derived from the nickname given to its most charismatic member, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members included Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza. Sanchís and Martín Vázquez were the first to play for the first team of Real Madrid, making their debut at Murcia on 4 December 1983 under coach Alfredo Di Stéfano. Both played surprisingly well, with Sanchís scoring the game's winner. A few months later, on 5 February 1984, Butragueño debuted in an away match at Cádiz. El Buitre was an instant sensation and scored twice. Pardeza was added to the first team that same season and Míchel followed at the start of the next. With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left the club for Zaragoza in 1986), Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning, amongst others, two UEFA Cups and five Spanish championships in a row. Their record was only blemished by their failure to win the European Cup, and their continued abject defeats against the far superior Milan side of the time. Martín Vázquez went to play for Torino in 1990, later returning to Madrid in 1992 only to leave again in 1995 for Deportivo de La Coruña. Butragueño left the club in 1995 and Míchel in 1996, both joining Atlético Celaya in Mexico. Sanchís was the only member of La Quinta to play his entire career with Madrid. By winning the Champions League twice (in 1998 and 2000), he accomplish what La Quinta had failed to achieve in its glory days. He retired in 2001 as the last active member of the famous cohort at the age of 37. The Sanz era (1995–2000) After ten-and-a-half years in office, Ramón Mendoza handed in his irrevocable resignation on 20 November 1995. He was relieved by Lorenzo Sanz, who held recourse to Club by- law 49 to get elected as heir to Mendoza by the 11 directors who continued on the Board of Directors following the transfer of power. On 20 May 1996, Lorenzo Sanz presented Fabio Capello as new head coach of Real Madrid. The Italian trainer landed in Madrid borne out by his five successful seasons with Milan (with whom he won the 1994 Champions League) to replace Arsenio Iglesias, who managed the team on a temporary basis after coach Jorge Valdano resigned. Although winning the league, however, Capello left Madrid after just one season, saying years later did so because he did not settle at Madrid as well as he would have wanted; he returned to Milan. Replacing Capello was the German Jupp Heynckes, who led the team to win the much-awaited Champions League/European Cup title, the team's last having come in 1966. In the Final, held at the Amsterdam Arena on 20 May 1998, the Merengues conquered their seventh top European trophy with a goal by Pedja Mijatović against Juventus, who were the favourites on the night. Despite conquering Europe, Heynckes was fired at the end of the year and replaced by José Antonio Camacho, who himself resigned just months later in July 1998 before the actual season even began. The team then hired Guus Hiddink to take the reins of the squad, his first challenge being the 1998 Intercontinental Cup. An extraordinary goal by Raúl in Tokyo sealed a 2–1 end result for Los Blancos over Brazilian side Vasco da Gama. Hiddink, however, was fired just after less than a season, with the Welshman John Toshack replacing him in February 1999. Nine months later, during the 1999–2000 season, Toshack was also fired, the seventh coaching change in just three years. Under the guidance of new manager Vicente del Bosque, Real Madrid claimed their eighth European Cup/Champions League title. The Final, held at the newly built Stade de France in Paris, would host the competition's (including the European Cup era) first-ever Spanish final, pitting Madrid against Valencia on 24 May 2000. The game Madrid comfortably defeat Los Che 3–0, with goals coming from Fernando Morientes, Steve McManaman and Raúl. The Galactico/Pérez Era (2000–2006) 2000–2003 In July 2000, Florentino Pérez was elected club president, vowing to erase the club's debt and modernise the club's facilities, though the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of then-Barcelona star Luís Figo. During the campaign, Pérez claimed he had an agreement with the Portuguese winger that would see Figo move to the Bernabéu should Pérez be elected. On July 16, Pérez won the election and indeed, eight days later, Figo was presented with the number 10 shirt for Madrid. Days later, surrounded by controversy, Real Madrid idol Fernando Redondo, who had openly supported Pérez's opponent Lorenzo Sanz, was sold to Italian giants Milan. During the summer of 2000, Real Madrid signed Claude Makélélé, Albert Celades, Flávio Conceição, César Sánchez, Pedro Munitis and Santiago Solari, although aside from Makélélé and Conceição, the rest had been signed prior to the election of Pérez. Expectations were high as Los Blancos began the 2000–01 season with the possibility of winning five trophies. The club, however, stumbled at the first test, losing the 2000 UEFA Super Cup by a score of 1–2 to 2000 UEFA Cup champions Galatasaray. Later, an injury to Fernando Morientes left Real Madrid without a centre forward, but manager Vicente del Bosque improvised by using youth team graduate Guti in the role, with Real Madrid coping and making good start to both their domestic and European campaigns. They were, however, defeated 2–0 at the Camp Nou against rivals Barcelona and were later eliminated from the Copa del Rey by lowly Toledo, as well as losing the Intercontinental Cup final to a Boca Juniors side led by Martín Palermo and Juan Román Riquelme. Nonetheless, Real Madrid recovered form and went top of the league table in mid-January, a position they would not relinquish on their way to ultimately winning the title. Madrid also advanced from the second group stage of the Champions League to face Galatasaray in the quarter-finals. Los Merengues lost the first leg in Istanbul 3–2, but recovered to win the tie after a 3–0 victory at the Bernabéu. This would then set-up a replay of the 1999–2000 Champions League semi-final against Bayern Munich. This year, however, Real Madrid would not reach the final, losing 1–3 on aggregate to the eventual champions. Despite the setback, on 26 May, Madrid would crown themselves champions of the first division with an emphatic 5–0 win over Alavés at the Bernabéu. Two goals by Raúl and one each by Guti, Fernando Hierro and Iván Helguera would ensure victory and Real Madrid's 28th league title with two matches left to play. Zinedine Zidane (left) and David Beckham (right) were two prominent Galácticos. After reaching an agreement to re-zone and sell the Ciudad Deportiva, Pérez went on to sign Zinedine Zidane in 2001, Ronaldo in 2002 and David Beckham in 2003. The media began referring to the team as \\"Los Galácticos\\". The strategy, initially dubbed \\"Zidanes y Pavones\\", meant to integrate world stars and youth team graduates together on the squad. The combination was highly-successful, with Real winning La Liga in 2001 and 2003 and the Champions League in 2002, their centenary year. They also won the Intercontinental Cup, the European Super CupReal win Super Cup BBC Sport and the Supercopa de España in both 2001 and 2003. Off the field, the Zidanes y Pavones policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, particularly in Asia. 2003–04 season The few days after capturing the 2002–03 league title were mired with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Pérez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque after Real's sporting director claimed that Del Bosque was not the right man for the job; they wanted someone young to shake up the team. The turning atmosphere continued when Madrid legend and captain Fernando Hierro left the club after a disagreement with management, as did Steve McManaman. However, the club toured Asia in pre-season and introduced newly signed galáctico David Beckham. Pérez and his directors refused to renew Claude Makélélé's contract with an improved salary, upsetting Makélélé who asked for a transfer, eventually moving to Chelsea. In the final days of the transfer window, Fernando Morientes also left the club, joining French Ligue 1 side Monaco on loan. Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, began their domestic league slowly after a hard-fought win over Real Betis. Doubts of the team were quelled, however, when Madrid won 7–2 at home over Real Valladolid. The second half of the season then saw the team giving playing time to youngsters and academy graduates, including Borja, Álvaro Mejía, Antonio Núñez and Juanfran, as Queiroz opted to rotate his squad. Real Madrid also topped their group in the Champions League, advancing to the quarter-finals after defeating Bayern Munich in the round of 16 2–1 on aggregate. However, Madrid's on-loan striker Fernando Morientes punished his team in the quarter-finals, as Madrid saw Monaco progress 5–5 on aggregate via the away goals rule and move on to the semi-finals. Madrid nonetheless kept their Liga form high, leading the table by eight point over second-placed Valencia in February. A poor run of form would await them, however, as they were beaten for the first time at the Bernabéu that season at the hands of Osasuna, 0–3. They recovered their points lead after a win at the Vicente Calderón Stadium over city rivals Atlético Madrid, but more disappointments quickly followed; they lost their final five league games at home to Mallorca, Barcelona and Real Sociedad, and also lost away at both Real Murcia and Deportivo de La Coruña. These defeats allowed all of Valencia, Barça and Deportivo to leapfrog them in the table and end the year in up the top three, respectively, as Real ended the season in a disappointing fourth. Their poor performances continued as they lost the final of the Copa del Rey to Real Zaragoza. Shortly after the end of the season, Queiroz was sacked and replaced by ex-Real Madrid player José Antonio Camacho. 2004–05 season Camacho highlighted the team's poor defensive performances and persuaded Florentino Pérez to spend a total of €45 million on both Argentine defender Walter Samuel and English centre-back Jonathan Woodgate from Roma and Newcastle United, respectively, but failed to sign Arsenal's midfield general Patrick Vieira due to his boldness of asking for a Galáctico-like paycheck in the likeness of Luís Figo's, Zinedine Zidane's, Ronaldo's and David Beckham's. The summer of 2004 also saw the sale of Cameroonian striker Samuel Eto'o, who had been previously loaned out to Mallorca, to archrivals Barcelona. In addition to the defensive additions, English striker Michael Owen was bought from Liverpool, but the player never settled at Real Madrid. Somewhat ironically, Eto'o would go on to achieve great success with Barcelona in just his first season with the team. Camacho resigned as head coach because of his team's poor performances and was replaced by Mariano García Remón. García Remón's last game was a loss at the hand of Sevilla, where the eventual champions Barça were six points clear from their nearest rivals, and Madrid sitting in lowly fifth. Remón was replaced by Vanderlei Luxemburgo after the winter break, who then signed Thomas Gravesen from Everton to fill the hole in midfield. Madrid failed to progress to the quarter-finals of the Champions League and in the Copa del Rey, but under Luxemburgo, Madrid fought hard to earn second place with 80 points, four points behind Barcelona. 2005–06 season The 2005–06 season began with several new signings, including Júlio Baptista (€20 million), Robinho (€30 million) and Sergio Ramos (€30 million). However, Luxemburgo was not able to find the right formula on the pitch, as Real Madrid's poor form continued and hitting rock bottom after a humiliating 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Bernabéu. Luxemburgo would eventually resign and be replaced by Juan Ramón López Caro, the former the manager of Real Madrid Castilla. A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after losing the first leg of the Copa del Rey quarter-final 6–1 to Zaragoza. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time by Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned as club president.Perez resigns as Madrid president BBC Sport Real Madrid eventually managed to finish second in the league but did not pose a serious threat to defending champions Barcelona. The Calderón Era (2006–2009) 2006–07 season On July 2, 2006, Ramón Calderón was elected as club president and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new head coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. As new manager of Real Madrid, Capello signed 2006 FIFA World Cup- winning captain Fabio Cannavaro and Emerson, both from embattled Juventus, for a total sum of €23 million; Ruud van Nistelrooy from Manchester United for €15 million; Mahamadou Diarra from Lyon for €26 million; and on a last minute trade-loan José Antonio Reyes, with Júlio Baptista going the other way after a disappointing stint at Madrid. However, Calderón failed to sign Milan's Kaká, Arsenal's Cesc Fàbregas and Chelsea's Arjen Robben, as he had previously promised. Nonetheless, during the January transfer window, he did manage to sign Fluminense left back Marcelo (€6.5M), River Plate forward Gonzalo Higuaín (€13M) and Boca Juniors midfielder Fernando Gago (€18M). On 16 January 2007, Calderón made some very unfortunate comments about the behaviour of some players in the squad and the Santiago Bernabéu fans, which has put the club in a delicate situation.Yahoo! Sports - Sports News, Scores, Rumors, Fantasy Games, and more One of the players that Calderón criticised was David Beckham, who, in January 2007, agreed to a deal to play for the LA Galaxy of Major League Soccer (MLS) at the end of that season. Among others to criticise Beckham was manager Fabio Capello, who at the time vowed never to select Beckham for the team again, although he later withdrew his words. At the end of January, striker Ronaldo left the club for €7.5 million for Milan. On 9 February 2007, Capello allowed Beckham back onto Real's starting 11 in an away match against Real Sociedad. Beckham played well and scored the equalizing goal in the match, a 2–1 triumph. On 24 February 2007, the Madrid Derby between Atlético and Real at the Vicente Calderón finished in a 1–1 draw, with goals coming from Fernando Torres and Gonzalo Higuaín for Atlético and Real respectively. On 7 March 2007, Real Madrid failed to reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League, stifled by Bayern Munich's strong home performance. Despite winning the home leg 3–2, they lost 2–1 at the Allianz Arena in Munich and were eliminated on an away goals tiebreaker. Bayern also scored the fastest goal in the Champions League during that match, after Roberto Carlos lost the ball after kick-off, which led to Roy Makaay scoring in ten seconds. On 10 March 2007, Real Madrid contested the Clásico against Barcelona at the Camp Nou. Real Madrid took the lead three times after two goals from Ruud van Nistelrooy and one from Sergio Ramos, but were pegged back by a hat-trick from Lionel Messi, including an injury-time equaliser. Despite the sending off of Oleguer, the Clásico ended 3–3. Real Madrid managed to find their form consistently for the first time all season as they managed to win seven out of eight of the final twelve games, including a 2–1 home win over Valencia on 21 April 2007 and another 3–2 home win over Sevilla on 6 May 2007. Calderón then went on to say that if the team keep up their great play, he was confident Real Madrid will win the league title and end their four-year wait for a major trophy on June 17. On 12 May 2007, despite not having Robinho and Beckham on the pitch (due to separate yellow cards given in the previous match against Sevilla), Real Madrid took over first place in the La Liga for the first time all season by defeating Espanyol 4–3, coming back from 1–3 first half deficit. Los Blancos were able to avoid a 3–3 draw thanks to an 89th-minute goal by Gonzalo Higuaín. The Sunday after, Barça dropped points with a 1–1 draw to struggling Real Betis. By virtue of their superior head-to-head record, Real Madrid sat at the top of the Liga table with four crucial matches left to play. The following Sunday, Real managed to beat Recreativo de Huelva 2–3 at the Nuevo Colombino. With the score tied at 2–2, Real Madrid looked set return the lead back to rivals Barcelona until Roberto Carlos scored at the end of the match from a Fernando Gago assist and the squad left Huelva with just three games left to play against, in order, Deportivo, Zaragoza and Mallorca. On 26 May 2007, Real Madrid put in another excellent performance to defeat Deportivo 3–1 at the Bernabéu. This victory made it six wins in a row for Real Madrid, with goals from Sergio Ramos, Raúl and Ruud van Nistelrooy securing the win. On 9 June, Real played their penultimate league fixture against Zaragoza at La Romareda. The match began badly when Real Madrid were forced to change their starting lineup mere minutes before the start of the match when young defender Miguel Torres suffered an injury during warm-up, tearing his hamstring. In the game, Zaragoza led Real 2–1 near the end of the match, while Barcelona were also winning against Espanyol 2–1. Real's title challenge looked to be over. A late Van Nistelrooy equalizer, however, followed by a last minute Raúl Tamudo goal for Espanyol, sprang Real Madrid's title hopes back into their favour. Sevilla were also held 0–0 away against Mallorca, which meant that a win at home against Mallorca would effectively secure Los Merengues their 30th Spanish league title. The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu, while Barcelona and Sevilla faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona; however, three goals in the last half-an-hour secured Real Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003. The first goal came from José Antonio Reyes, who scored after a good work from Higuaín. An own goal followed by another delightful goal from Reyes allowed Real to begin celebrating the title. Thousands of Real Madrid fans began going to Plaza de Cibeles to celebrate the title. 2007–08 and 2008–09 seasons Real Madrid's players celebrate their 2008 Supercopa de España win. On 25 August, Real Madrid kicked off the season in a derby against city rivals Atlético Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu. It was a highly entertaining display from both sides but Real managed to win 2–1, with goals from Raúl and Wesley Sneijder for Real, while Sergio Agüero scored for Atlético. It was a great start for Real as they showed skill and that they were adapting to the new style of play new manager Bernd Schuster had brought in. On 28 August, Sevilla's Antonio Puerta died after three days in the hospital. The Santiago Bernabéu Trophy, which Real Madrid was about contend for against Sporting CP, was cancelled in honour of Puerta. On 2 September, Real Madrid managed to win 5–0 against Villarreal at El Madrigal, with two goals from Sneijder, one from Raúl, one from Ruud van Nistelrooy and one from Guti. Real extended their winning streak to three after they beat Almería at home before earning a well-deserved 1–1 draw against Real Valladolid, with Javier Saviola scoring the equalizer three minutes from final time. Four days later, Real remained unbeaten as they beat Real Betis 2–0 at the Bernabéu, with goals from Raúl and an amazing bicycle kick from Júlio Baptista. Real continued their unbeaten run under Schuster by beating Getafe 0–1 away to ensure Los Blancos remain at the summit of La Liga. Real began their European campaign well, defeating German side Werder Bremen 2–1 at home thanks to goals from Raúl and Van Nistelrooy and topping their group over Olympiacos, Werder Bremen and Lazio, respectively. However, they lost in the first knockout round against Roma, 4–2 on aggregate. On 9 December 2008, it was announced Bernd Schuster had been sacked as manager, and that ex- Tottenham Hotspur manager Juande Ramos would replace him.Ramos replaces Schuster at Real The next year, Real Madrid also were dumped from the Champions League in the last 16 stage, for the fourth time in a row, after a humiliating 5–0 aggregate defeat against Liverpool. The Era of Cristiano Ronaldo/the return of Perez (2009–present) 2009–10 season Cristiano Ronaldo was the club's most expensive signing when he joined in 2009, costing €94 million. After no one of the 2009 presidency election was able to get the necessary funds (€56 million), on 1 June, Florentino Pérez was officially announced as Real Madrid's new president. His first move was to sign Brazilian superstar Kaká from Milan for an undisclosed fee, though believed to be £56 million (€68M). On 11 June 2009, Real Madrid officially announced on their website that an £80 million (€94M) offer for Portuguese Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo had been accepted by his club, Manchester United, after the player had expressed his desire to leave the club for Los Merengues. On 25 June, Raúl Albiol joined Real Madrid from Valencia on a fee thought to be in the region of €15 million. On 26 June, the deal for Ronaldo was finalized, with the player becoming officially a Real Madrid player on 1 July. On 1 July 2009, it was also announced that Lyon had reached an agreement with Madrid for the transfer of French striker Karim Benzema. The transfer fee was priced at €35 million with the fee rising to as much as €41 million based on incentives. Madrid continued their spending on 29 July, reaching an agreement with Liverpool for the transfer of Álvaro Arbeloa for a fee of €4 million, the same Liverpool paid for the player in January 2007 from Real. Arbeloa signed a five-year contract with Los Blancos. Xabi Alonso, also from Liverpool, was announced as Real Madrid's latest signing on 5 August, with Liverpool receiving around £30 million for the transfer of the Spanish midfielder. Real Madrid opened the 2009–10 season with a 3–2 home win over Deportivo de La Coruña with goals scored by Raúl, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lassana Diarra. On 15 September, Real Madrid achieved their first Champions League win in the group stage against Zürich, winning 5–2 in Zürich. On 4 October, after seven consecutive wins in all the competitions, Real Madrid lost for the first time of the season at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán 2–1 to Sevilla. On 27 October, Real Madrid were defeated 4–0 by third tier team Alcorcón in the round of 32 first leg of the Copa del Rey. In spite of the record investment, Real Madrid overall failed to deliver in the 2009–10 season; there was no progress in the Champions League, as they were eliminated once again in the round of 16, this time to Lyon. There was, however, an improvement in Liga performance, and the club forced the title race to go down to go the last game. Nevertheless, Real Madrid finished second again, and once again they lost at home and away to title rivals Barcelona. The club turned to José Mourinho, who had just ended Internazionale's 45-year title-drought in the European competition, eliminating Barcelona in the process and achieving the treble. 2010–11 season José Mourinho with Real Madrid in August 2010. Despite the departure of club legends Raúl and Guti, Madrid saw seven new names join their squad list for the upcoming season: Sergio Canales (Racing de Santander), Ángel Di María (Benfica), Pedro León (Getafe), Ricardo Carvalho (Chelsea), Sami Khedira (VfB Stuttgart) and Mesut Özil (Werder Bremen). Striker Emmanuel Adebayor would later join on loan from Manchester City during the winter transfer window. The 2010–11 campaign started out slowly, with a 0–0 draw to Mallorca, but they soon picked up momentum, despite a draw at Levante in the fifth week of the season. The first defeat in all competitions came in a humiliating 5–0 loss at the Camp Nou to rivals Barcelona on 29 November 2010. In European competition, Real Madrid came in first in their group, ahead of Milan, Ajax and Auxerre. They eased through the round of 16 against Lyon, and the quarter- finals against Champions League newcomers Tottenham Hotspur, reaching the semi-finals for the first time in eight years. In April 2011, a strange occurrence happened; for the first time ever, four Clásicos were to be played in a span of 18 days. The first fixture was for the Liga campaign on 17 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the Copa del Rey final (which ended 1–0 to Madrid), and the controversial two-legged Champions League semi-final on 27 April and 2 May (3–1 loss on aggregate) to Madrid. The first Clásico saw Cristiano Ronaldo score his first goal against Barça, with both and him and Messi converting penalties in a 1–1 draw. The Copa del Rey final gave Real Madrid its first title under Mourinho with a header from Ronaldo in extra time. The Champions League semi-final was perhaps the most controversial of the four, with the expulsion of Pepe in the first leg at the Santiago Bernabéu, after an alleged \\"dangerous challenge\\" to Barça defender Dani Alves. Alves was carried out in a stretcher \\"unable to walk\\", but after Pepe was shown red, Alves came running back into the field within seconds. After Pepe's sending off, coach José Mourinho was also sent off, receiving a fine and a five-match ban. This same match was also controversial in that Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets being captured on video saying what seemed like a supposed racial slur to Madrid left-back Marcelo. The second leg was not as controversial as the first, with perhaps the exception of an annulled goal to Gonzalo Higuaín after Cristiano Ronaldo had \\"fouled\\" Javier Mascherano as a result of a foul to Ronaldo by Gerard Piqué. Real Madrid ended the season with a bang, scoring 21 goals in their last four league matches for a grand total of 102 goals, higher than any other side, despite being known as a \\"defensive\\" team. Cristiano Ronaldo also became the all-time highest goalscorer in a single La Liga season with 40 goals, ahead of Liga legends Telmo Zarra and Hugo Sánchez. For the 2010–11 campaign, Real Madrid ended as Copa champions, Liga runners-up and Champions League semi-finalists. 2011–12 season During the summer market for the 2011–12 season, five new players joined the team: Nuri Şahin (Borussia Dortmund), former Real Madrid canterano José Callejón (Espanyol), Hamit Altıntop (Bayern Munich), Fábio Coentrão (Benfica) and French teenager Raphaël Varane (Lens). Real Madrid also disputed the very first Clásicos of the season during the Supercopa de España, where they were runners-up after a 5–4 aggregate loss; Mourinho poked Barcelona assistant Tito Vilanova in the eye during a brawl in the closing stages of this match. Along with five Clásicos in the past campaign, Real Madrid clashed with rivals Barcelona for a record seven times in nine months. The beginning of the Liga season started out with a 6–0 and 4–2 thrashings of Real Zaragoza and Getafe, respectively. After a rough patch which included a surprising loss to Levante and a mediocre draw at Racing de Santander, Madrid came back, scoring 14 goals and conceding only three in three games.http://soccernet.espn.go.com/team/fixtures/_/league/esp.1/id/86/real- madrid?cc=5901 2012–13 season Real Madrid began the season by winning the Supercopa de España against Barcelona 4–4 on aggregate, winning on away goals. New signing Luka Modrić from Tottenham debuted in the second leg. In the Champions League, they were drawn into the \\"group of death\\" with Borussia Dortmund, Manchester City and Ajax who were all title holders in their domestic league. They finished second behind the German champions. They then went on to defeat Manchester United and Galatasaray respectively to reach the semi-finals, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 4–3 on aggregate. After a poor start to their La Liga campaign with a home draw with Valencia and defeats at Getafe and Sevilla, they finished second and a total of 15 points behind winners Barcelona. After a disappointing extra time loss to rivals Atlético Madrid on home turf in the Copa del Rey final, club president Florentino Pérez announced the departure of manager José Mourinho at the end of the season via \\"mutual agreement\\". 2013–14 and 2014–2015 seasons A deadline day transfer saw the departure to Arsenal of one of the most influential midfielders over the past few years for Madrid, Mesut Özil. Earlier in that summer, Carlo Ancelotti was named the new coach of Madrid to replace the departing José Mourinho, who had joined his former club Chelsea. Ancelotti's first new signings were the two young talented players: Isco from Málaga and Asier Illarramendi from Real Sociedad. The signing of Gareth Bale from Tottenham for a world record €105 million came later in the summer, making the team the most expensive in the world that year.Goal.com Real Madrid completed the League Cup/European double by winning the Copa del Rey and the Champions League. In mid-season, Cristiano Ronaldo won the FIFA Ballon d'Or for being crowned the world's best player. Madrid finished third in the league after Atlético Madrid and Barcelona.

On 12 August, the club won its 79th official trophy, winning the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla with two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo. After early defeats in the 2014–15 La Liga season to Real Sociedad and rivals Atlético Madrid, the team went on a record-breaking winning run which included a win over Barcelona in a home Clásico match. In December 2014, the team won the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup final 2–0 against San Lorenzo and ended the calendar year with four trophies. Their winning streak ended in their first match of 2015 against Valencia in the La Liga.

The word \\"Eustatia”Eustatia is a Greek derived word meaning, “good place to stay.” The entire island, and a small neighboring island, Saba Rock, are under the same long term lease. The island is regularly featured and photographed for several publications and was listed as one of the top 20 most beautiful islands in the world in the December 2004 issue of Islands magazine. Location and ownership Eustatia Island is located at latitude 18.51 north and longitude 64.36 west in the eastern section of the British Virgin Islands slightly to the north of Virgin Gorda and Prickly Pear and to the south of Necker Island. The BVI are a group of islands located approximately 1,100 miles southeast of Miami, Florida, 60 miles due east of Puerto Rico and about 120 miles northwest of St. Barts. The island was purchased in 2000 by Mike Hahn, a financier and avid sailor who grew up on Lake Erie. The island is leased by the British Crown to a company registered in the BVI named Eustatia Corporation (company # 1512465) and is entered into the Land Registry as Block 5547A. The head lease granted by the Crown also includes a lease that includes neighboring Saba Rock, a popular restaurant/bar/boutique hotel frequented by sailors, kiteboarders, musicians/actors and creative types. The underlying shareholders of companies in the BVI are not required to register with the Company Registry therefore no definitive information is available on who the underlying owner is. Although the following statement cannot be corroborated by any authentic or reliable information source, it is widely thought among local BVI residents that the island is owned by Larry Page (Page was married on nearby Necker Island). Climate Similar to neighboring islands, Eustatia has fresh trade winds, warm year round ambient and water temperatures, and over 300 days of sunshine per year. Trade winds tend to average 10-15 knots from the east northeast. Ambient temperatures range from average day time highs of 85F-90F in the summer to 80F-85F in the winter. Lows average 80F to 75F respectively. Water temperatures are warm year round with the coolest being 77F in the winter to a high 85F in the summer.Diving British Virgin Islands, 1997, Jim and Odile Scheiner, p. 15, 25-26, 103-105 While the months of September–November tend to receive the greatest accumulations of rain, there is no official “rainy season”. Squalls tend to be intermittent, short lasting, but fairly intense. Relative humidity typically ranges from 60-80%. Hurricane season is from June 1 through November 30 with the statistical peak in mid September.The Concise Guide to Caribbean Weather, 1997, David Jones, p. 24 The last hurricane to hit Eustatia was Hurricane Irma on September 11, 2017. The island was also hit on August 30, 2010, when Hurricane Earl brushed the area as a Category 4 hurricane. Geography Eustatia Island is approximately in size, 1,870 feet (0.35 miles) in length, 1,020 feet (0.2 miles) in width and is 210 feet in elevation. The terrain is hilly, but not as rugged as some of the BVI’s other islands with most of Eustatia being accessible by foot. Three white sand beaches are located on the island, with the main beach on the south, a smaller beach on the north side, and another beach on the southwest side of the island. Surrounding area The North Sound area is considered to be the prime resort and yachting location in the BVI where mega yachts, celebrities and high-net-worth individuals come to enjoy the protected waters, water sports and access to a range of islands and resorts.Diving British Virgin Islands, 1997, Jim and Odile Scheiner, p.92 The protected waters and anchorages combined with proximity to luxury resorts and services, as well as neighboring islands provide privacy and convenience. The island overlooks Eustatia Sound, a body of water protected by the extensive Eustatia reef and separated from the North Sound area by a narrow gap within which lies Saba Rock. Eustatia Sound is generally off limits to charter boats and provides some of the best water sports activities in the islands. The steady trade winds blowing across the protected waters make Eustatia Sound a windsurfing and kite surfing mecca, while the surrounding reefs provide plenty of opportunities for safe snorkeling and diving. On Virgin Gorda, the Bitter End Yacht Club offers open air dining through three distinct venues, a 25 slip marina and one of the best known water sports centers in the Caribbean. Saba Rock Island Resort features a 10 deep water slip marina, rooms and suites, a restaurant and bar, nautical museum and salt water tank with sea life. The 140 acre Biras Creek Resort has 31 suites, a marina, a restaurant and 5 star rated services. The Leverick Bay Resort and Marina is situated in the western end of North Sound and offers rooms and suites, full service dock, a 15 slip marina, restaurant, bar and grill, fishing and dive tours, gift shop and nautical gallery. Prickly Pear Island, a designated National Park, features a number of beaches and hiking trails. Necker Island, a world-famous Virgin Limited Edition luxury retreat, and Mosquito Island, are both owned by British billionaire, Sir Richard Branson. Plants, wildlife, sea life A variety of tropical flora and fauna including, jasmine, hibiscus, bougainvillea, tamarind, frangipani, allemande, honey suckle, cacti and succulents are found throughout the island. One of the largest mature coconut palm plantations in the BVI is located on the main beach of Eustatia Island. Bird species include sea gulls, pelicans, frigates, boobies, hummingbirds, and doves. Several species of lizards including wood slave, ground, saddleback, and man lizards are also regularly seen throughout the island. Commonly seen in the surrounding water are a wide variety of reef fish including, grunts, parrotfish, trumpet, trigger, snapper, grouper, wrasse, damsel, porcupine and dozens of other species. Green, Loggerhead, and Hawksbill sea turtles are routinely spotted as are southern and spotted stingrays.Reef Fish Identification, 1994, Paul Humann, p. 87-90, 113-119, 139-149, 175-181, 193-207, 325, 331, 337-339, 390-395 Conch, lobster, crabs and other invertebrates are abundant. Island features Within the owner’s estate there is a three bedroom hilltop villa with pool and hot tub and sunrise and sunset views, a two bedroom villa on the beach nestled in a palm grove, and a three bedroom cottage. The estate has three white sand beaches, hiking trails, a mountain top pavilion and viewing decks, beach pavilion, and lounging pavilion. There are two additional houses on the southwest tip of the island. The island was carefully developed to keep it in a natural state. Sustainability All of the homes on the island utilize an extensive solar system which provides the island with 100 percent of its electrical requirements through solar conversion. Water requirements are fully sustainable. Water is collected through rainfall, filtered and used for drinking and bathing requirements. An organic sewage treatment process recycles gray water into landscaping. Most furnishings were selected from recycled or sustainable wood species. Light fixtures were salvaged from old naval vessels. History During the Golden Age of Piracy the island has been rumored to have been the haunt of pirates. North Sound served as an anchorage for pirates who would have used an “s” route through Eustatia Sound to gain access to the open waters of the Caribbean Sea to escape British ships blocking the entrance and exit to North Sound. This route required superior steering and intimate knowledge of the many shoals and cuts through the reefs in order to not run aground.

Although presently uninhabited, it was formerly occupied, and boasted a customs house and mail exchange where the mail would be delivered from Charlotte Amalie by skiff after the packet ships had called there. The island was the site of significant act of civil disobedience in 1856, three years' after the British community of the British Virgin Islands had largely fled during the insurrection of 1853. On 24 November 1856 the sub-Treasurer of Tortola sought to seize a boat belonging to an inhabitant of Thatch Island, as it was then known, for trading without a licence. He was assaulted and his crew badly beaten. Two days later a force of four constables was dispatched to arrest the offenders, but upon their landing they were obstructed by a crowd of 40 to 50 people. They persisted in making the arrest, and were also severely beaten. The following day, a force of some 30 men, principally rural constables, 12 of whom were armed, landed on the island to quell the insubordination and apprehend the perpetrators of the violence. In the event, it was only the intervention of Wesleyan missionaries who were influential amongst the inhabitants which enabled arrests to be made without further violence.

One of the few remaining privately owned islands in its part of the world, Guana has seven white powder-sand beaches and of tropical forest, mountains, hills, and valleys.

History In the 18th century, two Quaker families came to Guana as part of what was called \\"the Quaker Experiment\\" which lasted for about forty-five years in the BVI. They used African slaves and cultivated sugar cane. When they were recalled to the United States and England, they left behind two cannons still on Guana today. Archaeologists have extensively studied the Quaker ruins and have also unearthed older artifacts that give insight into Guana's earlier Amerindian history. Beth and Louis Bigelow of Massachusetts purchased Guana in 1934. With the help of local men they built six stone cottages and developed a reputation as creative pioneers.

Flora and fauna Scientists say that Guana has more flora and fauna than any island of its size yet studied in the Caribbean and possibly the world.Guana Island Nature Flora & Fauna The island provides habitat for the Puerto Rican racer (Alsophis portoricensis), the common Puerto Rican ameiva (Ameiva exsul), the crested anole (Anolis cristatellus wileyae), the sharp-mouthed lizard (Anolis pulchellus), barred anole (Anolis stratulus), green iguana (Iguana iguana), big-scaled least gecko (Sphaerodactylus macrolepis macrolepis), and the Richard's worm snake (Typhlops richardi). The restoration program has brought extirpated species back to Guana and other Virgin Islands. The stout iguana had survived only on Anegada but now flourishes on Guana and lives on other islands as well. Other plant and animal species that have been restored and protected include the red-legged tortoise, the bridled quail-dove, the Caribbean flamingo, the white-crowned pigeon, Eggers' mallow tree, the Virgin Islands euphorb, Hohenberg's ground bromeliad, and a unique bromeliad found nowhere else. Guana also has three reef areas. White Bay is a set of parallel patch reefs in shallow water, where there are no strong waves or currents. The reefs are home to about 100 tropical reef fishes, waving gorgonians called fan corals, and the various species of hard corals. Muskmelon Bay is a deep bay with reefs at 60 to . Large, oceanic fishes like tuna and king mackerel may be seen there. North Bay is a windward, rough-water bay with deep reefs and wrecks.

The island was uninhabited until 1937, when author Robb White and newly married wife Rosalie “Rodie” Mason settled on the island. Originally having settled on the nearby island of Tortola, White had found the insect problem to be unbearable, and spent weeks sailing during the day searching for a new island home. The Whites spent three years on Marina, hacking a cistern out of the rough, rocky land and shipping in enough concrete to build a small, sturdy house. These adventurous years – during which the couple weathered a hurricane, fended off a Nazi skipper, aided Jewish refugees, and survived a surprise visit from White's mother-in-law – are detailed in his memoirs In Privateer’s Bay (1939), Our Virgin Island (1953), and Two on the Isle (1985). White was recalled to military duty when World War II broke out. At the same time, he and Rodie lost Marina Cay; the British government had never issued them a license to hold the land and now formally refused, stating that White's published writings had misrepresented conditions in the British Virgin Islands. Eugene Tonkonogy took ownership of the island after he persuaded the British colonial governor to grant him a license. He used the island as a private retreat and also operated it as a tourist resort. Tonkonogy died in 2001. In the early 2000s Jose Cuervo Tequila leased the island, referring to it as Cuervo Nation. The island was used as a promotional tool, hosting promotional events at the island, and using it as a location to host contest winners. Cuervo Nation and Cuervo Man were featured a John Hodgman-narrated segment of This American Life, episode 205 \\"Plan B\\".TAL Plan B Cuervo Nation and the aforementioned This American Life segment are referenced in Burn Down the Ground: A Memoir by Kambri Crews, who served as a brand ambassador for Jose Cuervo and was on the island when she got news of her father's arrest for attempted murder.Burn Down the Ground: A Memoir (Penguin Random House) Today, Marina Cay is home to Pusser's Restaurant and Villa Rentals; the house Robb and Rodie built serves as a reading lounge for the modest tourist complex.

For many years the island was the location of a sail-in dive resort named Drake's Anchorage. Sir Richard Branson purchased the island in 2007 for £10 million. Branson announced in 2014 that he planned to relocate ring-tailed lemurs from some zoos in Canada, Sweden, and South Africa to the island. Later relocations of red ruffed lemurs and possibly sifakas might follow. The announced plans were met with some criticism. The island is located on the west side of Gorda Sound adjacent to Virgin Gorda and near Necker Island, which is also owned by Branson. Barack Obama visited the island in February 2017, and learned how to kiteboard there, shortly after his retirement as President of the United States. Name On old nautical charts of the British Virgin Islands, the island's name is often spelled \\"Moskito\\" (possibly as an older spelling of \\"mosquito\\" - older versions of the English language did make greater use of etymological spelling). Although modern charts usually spell the island \\"Mosquito\\" Island, and the Land Registry of the British Virgin Islands titles the island as \\"Mosquito\\" Island, Richard Branson has expressed a preference for \\"Moskito\\" Island, and most of the publicity material relating to his development has used that spelling. Bert Kilbride, owner of Moskito Island 1960 - 1970 and the original builder/operator of Drakes Anchorage, always said it was spelled MOSKITO after the Miskito Indians that traveled through the Caribbean Islands from South or Central America, although their name is spelled Miskito.

In 1997, he made his NPB debut and hit .179/.203/.209 in 74 plate appearances; he did steal 12 bases in 16 tries to lead his team. Araki was used as a defensive substitute in the outfield and at shortstop. In 1998, the 20-year-old played 7 games for Chunichi but had just one at-bat, appearing as a pinch-runner and defensive sub. The next year, he went 1 for 4 in 16 games in a similar role; in four steal attempts, he was only successful once. In 2000, Araki remained a substitute, playing 40 games but only getting 12 plate appearances (2 for 10, 2 sacrifice flies, 3 SB in 3 tries). He spent 34 games in the outfield.

The town has over 10,700 inhabitants and is the biggest town in the municipality Oude IJsselstreek. Until 1 January 2005, Ulft was part of the municipality Gendringen. At the municipal re-ordering in the Achterhoek, the municipalities Gendringen and Wisch joined together to form the Oude IJsselstreek. Ulft consists out of three hamlets: Ulft, Oer and De Pol. Oer is the northern part of Ulft and is called Oer because of the iron in the earth, which is called IJzeroer in Dutch. In Ulft the DRU was stationed, an iron foundry. DRU has moved some years ago to Duiven and now has a location at the Rijksweg A12. The old DRU-building now is the DRU 'Culture Factory' and holds a library, a theatre, a restaurant and an Iron museum. Geography Coat of Arms of the lords of Ulft Ulft lies in the southern part of the Achterhoek, at a distance of 15 km from Doetinchem. In the northern part of Ulft, the Industry Grounds \\"De Rieze\\" are located. Which have been expanded lately, some farms have been demolished to make this happen. Industry Grounds \\"De Pol\\" were finished anno 2007. There will be built new residents. Between Ulft and the bordering Gendringen the Industry Grounds \\" De IJsselweide are located. In 2001 de mainstreet of Ulft has been rebuilt thoroughly. The point of this was to avoid the heavy trucks in the centre of Ulft and lead them around downtown Ulft. This has been done by building traffic thresholds. Also some trees have been planted next to the road. Bus company \\"Syntus\\" said they wouldn't drive their buses through the centre any longer because of the thresholds, which could damage their buses. History Castle of Ulft The history of Ulft began in 1236 with a citadel: Slot Ulft that doesn’t exist anymore. The water citadel was located at the “Oude IJssel” and the “AA- strang”. The citadel had a watermill, which was used as cornmill. At the end of the 16th century Ulft began to develop as a town, and began its expansion to its current size. Important for the development of Ulft was the presence of the river “Oude IJssel” and the deposits of iron ore (IJzeroer), that were easy to dig. The ore had an adverse effect on the plant growth in the region, which was a major problem for the farming based community at the time. However, in 1753 Mr. Bogel, Mr. Henning, Earl Van Den Bergh and his counselor Roukens signed an agreement to begin an iron forge in the old water tower. With the foundation of the \\"Ironhut\\" in 1754, they laid the foundations for one of the first iron plants in the Netherlands, long before the regional arrival of the industrial revolution.Vuurvast en Energiek, 250 jaar DRU, Arnhem - 2004, published by Coers en Roest BV Because of the money that was made out of the ore, the village flourished and the farmers where freed of their iron-problem. In 1885 “Bellaard, Becking and Bongers” started a second iron forge. This forge was called “The new hut” by the locals. The increasing production of the iron forges also attracted more entrepreneurs, mainly from the metal industry. Although all of the iron factories eventually left the town or went bankrupt, the \\"ironhut\\" (better known as DRU) only moved out in 1999. In the village there are still numerous references to the company, among which is the cultural heritage that is still largely intact. Village Fair On the second Sunday of July the Village fair of Ulft is celebrated. The Village fair is organized by 3 associations. “De Eendracht”, “St. Hubertus” and “St. Joris”. De Eendracht organises the Village fair in Oer, St. Hubertus in Ulft (centre) and St. Joris in the Pol. Sports In Ulft there are 2 football clubs. These are “Ulftse Boys”, which is situated in the old part of Ulft (called “Oer” bij the locals), and “SDOUC” (which stands for Teamwork leads to victory), which is located in the southern part of Ulft. “Ulftse Boys” has degraded to the 4th class, their big rival has degraded to the second class in 2007. Ulft also has a swimming pool called “The Blenk” with a swimming association “De Gendten”. Handball, Volleyball, Korfball, Tennis, Badminton and athletics can be found at sporting park “IJsselweide”. This park is being shared by Ulft and Gendringen. Also the football clubs SDOUC and V.V. Gendringen can be found there. Atletico ’73 is well-known of the athletes Bram Som and Arnoud Okken.

It had a mid-engine configuration using a transverse mounting of its V8 engine. Zora Arkus- Duntov's engineers originally built two XP-882 prototypes during 1969, but John DeLorean, Chevrolet's general manager, canceled the program believing it to be impractical and costly. However, when Ford announced plans to sell the DeTomaso Pantera through Lincoln-Mercury dealers, DeLorean ordered that one XP-882 prototype be cleaned up for display at the 1970 New York Auto Show. In 1972, DeLorean authorized further work on the XP-882 chassis and gave it a new project code, XP-895. A near-identical body in aluminum alloy that resembled the XP-895 was constructed, and became the \\"Reynolds Aluminum Car.\\" Two of the Chevrolet Vega 2-rotor engines were joined together as a 4-rotor, engine, which was used to power XP-895. The XP-895 was first shown in late 1973. Another Corvette concept, XP-897GT, also appeared in 1973, which used a 2-rotor engine. However, with the energy crisis of the time, GM scrapped its rotary development work and all plans for a Wankel-powered car. The XP-897GT 2-rotor Concept was sold to Tom Falconer and fitted with a Mazda 13B rotary engine in 1997. In 1976, the 4-rotor engine was replaced by a Chevrolet V8, and the concept car was named Aerovette and approved for production for 1980. The Aerovette featured double folding gullwing doors. The production car would use a V8, and be priced between $15,000-$18,000. However, after chief supporters Duntov, Bill Mitchell, and Ed Cole had retired from General Motors, David R. McLellan decided that a front/mid-engine car would be more economical to build and would have better performance, and canceled the Aerovette program entirely. Contemporary imported rear mid-engine cars had poor sales in the United States compared to the front-engined Datsun 240Z, which ultimately determined the Aerovette's fate, further contributing to termination of production plans.

The founder members were Tony Duhig (guitar) (born Anthony Christopher Duhig, 18 September 1941, Acton, west London; died 11 November 1990, Somerset, England), Jon Field (flute, percussion, keyboards) (born John Frederick Field, 5 July 1940, Harrow, Middlesex) and Glyn Havard (vocals, bass) (born 15 February 1947, Nantyglo, South Wales). History Jon Field and Tony Duhig met in the early 1960s when working in a factory (both driving forklifts). Soon they found common musical interests (jazz, African and Japanese music), started playing instruments (Jon a set of congas, Tony a guitar, which he tuned unconventionally to open C), bought a four-track tape recorder each and started experimenting with multi-layered overdubs. According to Field, the process was not unlike \\"...trying to build a cathedral with the sort of things you'd find in your back yard,\\" but still, as it turned out, formed a blueprint for Jade Warrior's music throughout their career. In 1965, the two formed a rhythm & blues outfit called Second Thoughts with Patrick Lyons on vocals, which released one four-song EP. Meanwhile, in a parallel line of development, Tom Newman (later the engineer for Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells), Alan James, Pete Cook and Chris Jackson had formed the Tomcats.One of several bands known to have used this name. In 1965, both bands split up, Lyons joining Alex Spyropoulos in a (then) duo Nirvana, which released five LPs (with Jade Warrior members guesting on 1972's Local Anaesthetic). Reformed with a new line-up – Newman, James, Jackson, Jon Field and Tony Duhig – Tomcats spent 1965–1966 in Spain where they released four EPs to much local acclaim (later Acme Records released them as a single LP, having included The Second Thoughts' EP). In 1966, Tomcats returned to England, changed their name to July, and released their one only (eponymous) album, a psychedelic pop-rock collection. (Later it was re-issued as Second of July with some alternate versions and outtakes, and then as Dandelion Seeds with yet a different track list).  Jade Warrior  July disbanded in 1968, and Tony got a gig as guitarist in Unit 4 + 2, who, some years earlier had a UK number one with \\"Concrete and Clay\\". Already in the line-up were Glyn Havard, bass, and Allan Price, drums. The outfit was basically a pick-up band designed to tour the Northern British clubs and capitalise on the success of the aforementioned hit record. A month or two later, Duhig, Havard and Price travelled to Persia (later to become Iran) and worked in various nightclubs for three months, only to return to England practically destitute after a series of management mishaps. Before this, however, Duhig had introduced Havard to Jon Field, suggesting that he make a vocal contribution to Duhig and Field's own musical project. When Havard and Duhig returned from Persia, they and Field set about recording a series of demos that laid the foundation for the initial Jade Warrior albums. In the words of David Duhig, Tony's brother (and later a band member), \\"Tony met Glyn Havard and Allan Price,Not to be confused with Alan Price of The Animals. and they formed a band, which nobody really mentions because they went off to Persia to do some sort of money gig. I suppose the most notable thing about that is that Tony caught some sort of disease he called 'Persian Leg,' (Phlebitis!) which plagued him from there on in. That was around the end of '69.\\" Field, Duhig, and Havard stuck together, and soon named themselves Jade Warrior after a certain dance drama ('The Phoenix and the Dove') Tony and Jon had composed for a London drama school. According to Havard, though, – Later a Red Hot Records press release stated that, \\"Jade Warrior was a Japanese term for a samurai warrior who was also a poet and scholar\\", but Havard expressed doubts as for the literal truth of this interpretation.  Vertigo years. 1970–1973  In 1970, Jade Warrior signed a deal with Vertigo (their old band-mate Patrick Lyons, now Patrick Campbell-Lyons, had become a producer and a scout for this label), according to Havard, 'in a package' with Assagai, an Afro-rock band, with whom they shared the same management. Havard said, \\"They didn't want us, but they wanted Assagai because Afro-Rock, courtesy of Osibisa, was perceived to be the next best thing. Our production company, Mother Mistro, basically told them that if they wanted Assagai, then they'd have to take Jade Warrior as well\\". This (according to an official biography), \\"left Jade Warrior a contract with a record company, which had little actual interest in the band, and very little willingness to support or promote them.\\" Their debut album, Jade Warrior, released in 1971, established their trademark sound of soft/loud contrasts, with Field's multi-layered flutes and percussion vying with Duhig's cutting guitar, and which incidentally outsold Assagai's offering (which featured a Jade Warrior track called \\"Telephone Girl\\"). This was followed in the same year by Released with appearances from Allan Price on drums, and guest saxophonist Dave Conners. Here Jade Warrior sharpened their rock edge (\\"Three Horned Dragon King\\", \\"Minnamato's Dream\\", the fifteen-minute rock jam \\"Barazinbar\\"), their quieter side represented by pieces like \\"Yellow Eyes\\" and \\"Bride of Summer\\". According to critic Peter Thelen, \\"where the first album featured an array of sonic possibilities, this is an album that highlighted the contrasts within that sound\\". \\"If Jade Warrior's second album has any overwhelming flaw, it is that its predecessor traveled so far off the conventional beaten tracks of early-'70s prog that anything less than absolute reinvention could only be regarded as a rerun of past glories\\", AllMusic argued years later. \\"…There is little here that Jade Warrior itself did not predict, but the unerring delivery of those predictions is a marvel in itself\\", critic Dave Thompson concluded. In 1972, Last Autumn's Dream followed, both Price and David Duhig taking part in the procedures. The album, taking a step back to revisit \\"the wall-of-all-colors approach of their debut with a more surefooted and substantive instrumental approach,\\" featured mysterious-sounding, introspective instrumental tunes (\\"Dark River\\", \\"Obedience\\", \\"Borne on the Solar Wind\\") juxtaposed with melodic pieces like \\"A Winter's Tale\\" and \\"May Queen\\" and harsh rockers (\\"Snake\\", \\"The Demon Trucker\\", \\"Joanne\\"). \\"One might sense in the overview that the band lost their way on the second album, and tried to put themselves back on track with the third\\", Peter Thelen argued. Nevertheless, as Dave Thompson put it, \\"For anybody just discovering Jade Warrior, Last Autumn's Dream is certainly the last of its truly essential albums\\". Taken as a whole, the first three albums saw the band creating and perfecting an innovative style, which (according to Dave Platt and Charles Wilkinson's biography) \\"had its base in rock music… with a Jethro Tull flavour, and significant admixtures of what we'd probably call 'world music' influence today\\". The band toured the US at the time (as the opening band for Dave Mason, Long John Baldry, and Earth Quake, and on one memorable occasion shared a two band bill with an unsigned REO Speedwagon. Around this time the band were filmed at the Marquee Club in London as part of a visual showcase for several acts represented by Gaff Masters management, including Rod Stewart and Long John Baldry. With enough material for another two albums, the band recorded all the tracks for Eclipse and Fifth Element during 1973. Vertigo, sensing an imminent change in an ever-fickle market decided against a release and cancelled the band's contract. This decision was partly influenced by the band having already parted company with their management. Despite this, Vertigo did release some of the tracks on various samplers. It was about this time, after an abortive tour of the Netherlands, that the band split up, and Glyn, Dave Duhig and Allan Price toyed with the idea of putting their own band together while Tony and Jon retreated to write.  Island years. 1974–1978  In 1974, Steve Winwood (of Traffic) urged Chris Blackwell of Island Records to listen to Jade Warrior. He did so, and decided to sign Duhig and Field (who also provided flute on Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells)Mike Oldfield. Tubular Bells. Credits. – AllMusic] as an instrumental act, which given the current success of Mike Oldfield's, \\"Tubular Bells\\" was seen by many people as a shrewd move. Duhig and Field were to create four albums on Island Records, with their sound expanded to include choirs, harp, and a string quartet. Guest musicians on these albums included Steve Winwood (keyboards), Fred Frith of Henry Cow (violin) and Dave Duhig. First came Floating World (1974), a complex concept set themed around the Japanese philosophy of Ukiyo, with the songs revolving around two interrelated and interlaced series of compositions. According to AllMusic, \\"[The] sheer diversity of sounds and moods, the constant clash or gentle intermingling of Eastern and Western styles, and the set's glittering atmospheres made Floating World an undeniable masterpiece\\". The band's foray into what would later be labelled world and ambient music came parallel to that of Brian Eno, who described Floating World as an \\"important album\\". It was followed by Waves (1975), another concept album dedicated to \\"...the last whale\\" and featuring Steve Winwood as a guest on piano and moog. The album consisted of a single composition, divided into two parts (each taking up an LP side); this, according to AllMusic, proved \\"a nightmare for radio programmers who might have provided Waves with the airplay it desperately needed to push Jade Warrior beyond cult status\\". 1976's Kites recorded with guest musicians, Fred Frith among them, presented the band at their most musically abstract and progressive, each side being essentially a long concept piece, inspired by Paul Klee's painting \\"The Kingdom of the Air\\" and 9th century China's wandering Zen master Teh Ch'eng. The last of the four Island albums, Way of the Sun, represented a spatial, cinematic sound journey to Latin America, described by AllMusic as an \\"incredibly vibrant set that quivers with emotion and life itself\\".  1980–2007 Personal issues, illness, and Duhig moving house to set up a recording studio, meant that the next album to be released was the 1979 compilation, Reflections, taken from their Vertigo years and containing some (at the time) unreleased tracks. It was not until 1984 that any new material emerged with the release of Horizen on Pulse Records, described as definitely a \\"Tony Duhig project\\": he wrote all of the music, while Field performed on only a few of the tracks. In 1989, At Peace was released by Earthsounds label. This album, recorded at Tony Duhig's studio in only four days and performed solely by the duo, has been seen as the least typical of the Jade Warrior albums, close to ambient and even new-age music. Glyn Havard commented, \\"It was basically a cynical attempt to generate some cash in the \\"ambient\\" sector, as far as I can see, the album had no artistic value whatsoever ....\\" This was followed by another long hiatus until Jade Warrior started their next project with new band members Colin Henson (guitar) and Dave Sturt (fretless bass). However, they were dealt a blow by the sudden death of Tony Duhig in 1990, before he could contribute to the album. The band decided to continue on with the album, which became the 1992 release Breathing the Storm on the Red Hot Records (re-released on CD by Voiceprint in 2001). This trio then released a follow-up album Distant Echoes in 1993, with guest appearances from Theo Travis of Gong (saxophone), David Cross of King Crimson (violin) and Tom Newman. It seemed for a while that Jade Warrior may have disbanded, as their only output was the previously mentioned Eclipse and Fifth Element, but these were then joined by the re-issue of all four Island albums in 2006. In 2000, Glyn Havard and Allan Price joined David Duhig in a band named Dogstar Poets to release the Off-Planet (2002) In the summer of 2005, Havard officially rejoined Jade Warrior as a fourth member (alongside Field, Sturt and Henson). After about a year, Colin Henson withdrew from Jade Warrior, citing severe creative differences with the other band members.  2008 – present  On 30 June 2008, Jade Warrior as a trio released their fourteenth studio album NOW on the Repertoire label. It's been described as \\"a top-flight album boasting cinematic dynamics, thoughtful instrumentation, and the strategically astute placement of a roster of guest artists\\" (Record Collector), \\"as challenging as it is atmospheric\\" (Classic Rock), \\"the most mature and most deeply human album Jade Warrior has ever created\\" (FOJW) and \\"uber-cool, very well-produced, & well-executed album & one that... Tony Duhig would be very proud of\\" (Amazon review).Reviews and comments. A selection of press reviews. In May 2010, news came that Jade Warrior was working on an instrumental album Haiku and the as yet untitled 'song album'. According for the April 2011 Official website News entry, Haiku was \\"inching its way towards a conclusion\\", albeit slowly. It is expected to be released later in 2011.New releases. – www.progressiveears.com.

While initially cultural in nature, it was later developed further into a political ideology which culminated in the establishment of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918.Najafov, Etibar: The evolution of Azerbaijani nationalism: Enlightenment, ADR, and Azerbaijanism, Azerbaijan in the world. ADA Biweekly Newsletter, vol. 1, no. 12, July 2008. Compared to Armenian and Georgian nationalism, a specifically ethnic nationalism was rather slow to develop among Azerbaijanis, partly due to their self-identification as part of the larger Muslim world rather than as a singular ethnocultural nation.The Forsaken People: Case Studies of the Internally Displaced - Page 257 by Roberta Cohen, Francis Mading Deng Following the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and its declaration of independence in 1991, however, Azerbaijan has witnessed the ascent of a particularly strong Azerbaijani nationalism, including various types of Pan- nationalism and irredentism.Hirose, Yoko: The Complexity of Nationalism in Azerbaijan, International Journal of Social Science Studies, vol. 4, no. 5, p. 136-149, May 2016. Territory Irredentist claims by Azerbaijani nationalists would mainly seek to incorporate large sections of Iran as well as parts of Armenia, Russia, Georgia and Turkey within a proposed enlarged territory known as Whole Azerbaijan. Iran hosts a larger number of ethnic Azerbaijanis than the independent nation of Azerbaijan, and prior to the establishment of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918 the name of \\"Azerbaijan\\" was exclusively used to identify the adjacent region of contemporary northwestern Iran. Azerbaijani consciousness is also central to wider cooperation with ethnically affiliated populations through Pan-Turkism.  Nagorno-Karabakh War  During the Soviet era, Armenians and Azerbaijanis coexisted peacefully. When the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh broke out, however, this changed radically. The initial Armenian claims to Nagorno- Karabakh, in Azerbaijan, yielding from Armenian nationalism, were laid in late 1987. From 1998, Armenia began accusing Azerbaijan of embarking on a campaign of destroying a cemetery of finely carved Armenian khachkars in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.World Watches In Silence As Azerbaijan Wipes Out Armenian Culture. On May 30, 2006, Azerbaijan barred the European Parliament from inspecting and examining the ancient burial site. Charles Tannock, British Conservative Party foreign affairs spokesman in the European Parliament, stated, \\"This is very similar to the Buddha statues destroyed by the Taliban. They have concreted the area over and turned it into a military camp. If they have nothing to hide then we should be allowed to inspect the terrain.\\" Hannes Swoboda, an Austrian Socialist MEP and member of the committee barred from examining the site, said he hoped a visit could be arranged in the autumn. He stated that \\"if they do not allow us to go, we have a clear hint that something bad has happened. If something is hidden we want to ask why. It can only be because some of the allegations are true.\\" He also warned: \\"One of the major elements of any country that wants to come close to Europe is that the cultural heritage of neighbors is respected.\\" PanArmenian. A key advocate of Azerbaijani nationalism is Farida Mammadova, who has made anti-Armenian statements. In response to desecration of Azerbaijani holy sanctuary Agadede south of Yerevan in 2005, Mammadova said that \\"it is known, that on whole planet exactly the Armenian people is distinguished by the absence of spiritual and other human values. And it is them who are used to appropriate the cultures of other nations while living in another state\\". According to Thomas de Waal, Mammadova has grasped the Albanian theory after studying the history of Caucasian Albania and used it to push the Armenians out of Caucasus altogether. She has placed Caucasian Albania on the territory of modern Armenia: all the territories, churches, and monasteries in Armenia have appeared Albanian. Mammadova had visited the Gandzasar monastery in 1975 and read the inscription on facade \\"I Hasan-Jalal, built this church for my people of Aghvank...\\" referring to an ancient name of Albania.

In classical antiquity the cave was used as a shrine dedicated to Apollo, Pan and the Nymphs. The cave was occupied from the sixth to second century BC. The cave then fell into disuse until it was occupied again in the fourth century AD. It was finally abandoned in approximately the sixth century. The cave was excavated in 1901. It lies near the top of one of the southern spurs of Mount Hymettus at an altitude of almost 300 meters. From Vari, it can be reached on foot in one hour. The cave is unique in Greece because of its rock-cut sculptures. The marble votive tablets from the cave are now exhibited at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. Because of its use for the veneration of Pan the cave is also called the Cave of Pan. It was one of the five caves of Pan in the vicinity of ancient Athens. History According to inscriptions found in the cave, the sanctuary was built by Archedemus of Thera. He identified himself as a nympholept and states that he built the sanctuary \\"at the Nymph's counsel\\". Archedemus has a cross on his right shoulder that has as yet found no explanation. Unlike many other caves, prehistoric remains were not found. The earliest inscription found in the cave was dated to approximately the beginning of the sixth century BC. A relief depicting Archedemus is dated to approximately 400 BC, most likely during the apex of the sanctuary's popularity. A second-century coin from Athens found in the cave provides evidence that it was continuously occupied from about 600 BC to 150 BC. For the next four or five centuries the cave apparently fell into disuse because material dated to this period was not found. Coins found in the cave suggest that a new period of occupation began in the time of the Roman Empire, approximately during the reign of Constantine the Great (307–337 AD). Based on the number of coins found, the sanctuary became even more popular during the reign of his successor, Constantius II (337–361 AD). Coins indicate the sanctuary was still visited during the time of Arcadius (395–408 AD). Because no remains of later dates were found the cave was abandoned after this time. The absence of remains of offerings with significant value means the cave had probably always been a sanctuary for poor people. A large number of Roman oil lamps with Christian designs were found in the cave. The excavators dated these to the same period as the coins, the fourth and early fifth century. Many remains of the first period of occupation, especially the reliefs, were found destroyed. The oil lamps and deliberate destruction of pagan sculptures led the excavators to the conclusion that the cave became a Christian shrine in the second period of occupation. The site is not mentioned by any ancient writer. However, there is inconclusive evidence that Claudius Aelianus and Olympiodorus the Younger describe the cave. They write that the infant Plato was taken to a spot on Mount Hymettus by his parents Ariston and Perictione. His parents performed sacrifices on his behalf to Pan, Apollo, the Muses and the Nymphs. Even though the reliability of both late authors is questionable, the list of deities is nearly identical with those known to be honored in the cave. More recent research disputes the interpretation of the cave as a Christian site. According to the latest evidence there were no Attic oil lamps with Christian designs until the fifth century. The small number of more sophisticated Christian oil lamps probably date to the sixth century. More importantly, the presence of Christian oil lamps does not imply the site was Christian. Elsewhere in the Roman Empire pagans used Christian oil lamps when non-Christian ones were not available. A remote cave like the one near Vari would have made a suitable location for continuing ethnic religious practice in secret after the Empire started persecuting pagans. If Christians smashed the sculptures, it most likely happened at the end of the reoccupation rather than its beginning. Instead, it was possible that the pagan Platonists of late Roman Athens would have frequented the site due to its association with Plato. Layout The opening of the cave descends vertically. From the opening approximately a dozen steps are cut in the ridge at the western end, which are now broken. After these steps comes a landing from which the two rooms of the cave are visible, separated by a large rock partition. From the landing another set of ancient stairs take the visitor to a position at the upper side of the larger room. The largest shrine of the cave is found here. The shrine is dedicated to Pan and looks a like a rough imitation of the facade of a temple. A headless seated figure and an object with a shape resembling an omphalos are hewn from the rock in this room, but they are too damaged to be identified. After descending more steps a rock-cut shrine to Apollo Hersus is found towards the bottom of the cave. Next to this shrine is the rock-cut image of Archemus who is crudely depicted as a stonecutter with his tools. Excavations Richard Chandler was the first scientist to visit and report on the cave in 1765. Through the 19th century the cave was visited by more scholars, but it was not until 1901 that it was excavated. The excavation was led by Charles Heald Weller of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens.

It lies on the plateau to the southeast of St Emilion village. In 2012 it was classified in the first rank of the Classification of Saint-Émilion wine, as a Premier Grand Cru Classé (A), after having previously been a Premier Grand Cru Classé (B) since 1954. History Like other vineyards in Saint-Émilion such as Château Ausone, the Pavie vineyard dates back to Roman times. It takes its name from the orchards of peaches (\\"pavies\\") that used to stand there. The modern estate was assembled by Ferdinand Bouffard in the late 19th century by buying plots from several families. The plots were still managed separately, and the 9 hectares bought from the Pigasse family retained a separate identity as Château Pavie-Decesse. However Bouffard struggled with phylloxera, and at the end of World War I he sold it to Albert Porte, who sold it to Alexandre Valette in 1943. His grandson Jean-Paul Valette sold it to Gérard Perse in 1998 for $31 million. Perse is a Parisian millionaire and former cyclist who sold two supermarket chains to fund his entry into the wine business. He bought Château Monbousquet in 1993, Château Pavie-Decesse in 1997, and Pavie in 1998. He ripped out most of the old equipment, building new temperature- controlled wooden fermentation vats, a new cellar, and a new irrigation system in the vineyard. He brought in the controversial wine consultant Michel Rolland, who has seen yields cut from 55 hl/ha to 30 hl/ha with severe pruning and green-harvesting and encouraged malolactic fermentation in the wine. The result has seen the wine become much more concentrated and intense. In 2012, Pavie was elevated to Premier Grand Cru Classé (A) status, which made it one of four such Saint-Émilion producers. 2003 vintage controversy The 2003 vintage of Pavie was a flashpoint in the debate about the \\"Parkerization of wine\\". This drought year was always going to exacerbate the Perse style of concentrated, alcoholic wines. Jancis Robinson reviewed it thus: > \\"Completely unappetising overripe aromas. Why? Porty sweet. Port is best > from the Douro not St.Emilion. Ridiculous wine more reminiscent of a late- > harvest Zinfandel than a red Bordeaux with its unappetising green > notes...12/20\\" Yet the trade weren't too bothered since the wine was in a style that they knew American critic, Robert Parker would like. Parker accused Robinson of lying in her tasting notes. The media coverage frequently described a \\"war of words\\" between the two critics. Less dramatic than the predominant press view, Robinson and Parker currently have a cordial relationship.

As with the novel Night Without End, it depicts adventure, sabotage and murder in the unforgiving Arctic environment. It is laid in the oilfields and oil sands fields of Alaska and Canada and includes a considerable amount of technical detail on the operations. Plot introduction When the operations manager of an oil company operating in Prudhoe Bay in Alaska receives a mysterious anonymous threat of sabotage, his superiors call in Jim Brady Enterprises, a firm of oilfield specialists. Dermott and Mackenzie, tough ex- field managers and now anti-sabotage specialists, arrive, but initial investigations get them nowhere. Then the operations manager is murdered and one of the pump stations in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline is damaged, with further loss of life. Jim Brady himself arrives to direct operations but to no avail. Then the company's operations at the Athabasca Oil Sands in Canada are disrupted and Dermott is nearly killed. Despite assistance by the Canadian police and FBI, suspicions fall on many employees, but nothing can be proved. As bodies and equipment damage mount up, Brady and his two investigators play a hunch and finally expose the men they believe to be responsible. But even they are not the main instigators of the events, as the final chapter of the novel reveals.

It opened in 1848 and initially acted a terminus for both lines, as the continuation towards Bradford Exchange was not yet complete (the tunnels north of the station and at Bowling were still under construction at this point). Through running to Bradford eventually began in 1850, to Manchester Victoria in January 1852 and to Leeds via (over the Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway) in 1854. Low Moor quickly became an important interchange station, as there was initially no direct route between Bradford Exchange and the LB&HJR; route to Leeds and so many trains to/from Halifax and Manchester carried portions for both cities that were attached or joined here (a practice that continued even after Exchange was expanded and linked to the Leeds route in 1867). A connection to was later built by the GNR in 1892 and facilities extended accordingly - by the turn of the century there were four platforms in use, along with a large goods yard and loco depot. The introduction of DMUs over the Calder Valley route in January 1962 saw the loss of much of its interchange traffic and in June 1965, it was closed to passenger traffic under the Beeching axe along with the Spen Valley Line. Goods traffic ceased two years later and the station was then demolished. The station site was later used for the Transperience museum which was open for a brief period in the 1990s. The Spen Valley Greenway was built on the route of the Mirfield line after its closure to freight in 1981. Present station Class 142 at the station shortly after opening Metro planned to build a new station at Low Moor by 2011/2012. A lack of capacity on the line meant that development was put on hold through 2008–09, until track improvement work at Mill Lane Junction in Bradford was completed and a new timetable introduced. In June 2009, £5.5 million funding was allocated for the station and it was announced that a detailed design plan and business case would be developed. These were completed in May 2010, confirming the station's location on New Works Road. After the 2010 general election and subsequent Spending Review, a further assessment of the West Yorkshire Strategic Programme of Schemes confirmed that the new station at Low Moor remained a key priority within the transport aspirations of West Yorkshire. The public consultation for the scheme was held in November 2011. Estimated completion was delayed into 2015, as the curvature of the track led to complications meeting engineering safety requirements for the new platforms. West Yorkshire Integrated Transport Authority (WYITA) released funding for the station in March 2014 and submitted a planning application to Bradford Council. There were further delays during construction of the car park over suspected disused mine workings. Exhaustive surveys initially could not verify their precise locations, but two were eventually discovered under the station site. Opening was delayed to summer 2016, and then to May 2017. This date was revised again, and the station opened to passenger trains on Sunday, 2 April 2017. The total cost of the project was £10.8 million. Service pattern Currently, Low Moor has the following service pattern: *One train per hour to *One train per hour to via *Four trains per day to only *Four direct trains per day to London Kings Cross via From the winter 2019 timetable change, the Huddersfield service will start/terminate at Bradford rather than running through to Leeds on weekdays and Saturdays, but to compensate for this the hourly Leeds - Manchester Victoria - Chester service will start calling throughout the day. This improves the overall service pattern at the station to two departures per hour to both Halifax and Bradford, with hourly through trains to Leeds and Manchester.Northern Timetable 45: Leeds to Hebden Bridge and Huddersfield 15 December 2019 - 16 May 2020 Northern; Retrieved 29 November 2019 Sunday services remain unchanged.

In 1879, he moved to Detroit, Michigan, to work for Berry Brothers. In 1884, he began studying law under the employ of Adolph Sloman and was admitted to the Bar in 1885. The next year, he married Mary A. Horton of Fenton, Michigan. In 1894, he partnered with John W. Anderson to open a law firm. The partnership was very successful, counting among their clients Alexander Y. Malcomson, a Detroit coal dealer. Shareholder of Ford In 1903, at Malcomson's advice, Henry Ford hired Rackham and Anderson to draw up papers incorporating the Ford Motor Company.Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies , Horace and Mary Rackham Ford (and Malcomson) also convinced the partners to buy stock in the company. Rackham scraped together $5,000 by borrowing some money and selling some real estate parcels.Merz, Charles, And Then Came Ford, READ BOOKS, 2007, , p.74 With great uncertainty and against the advice of others, (the president of the Michigan Savings Bank infamously told Rackham, \\"The horse is here to stay, but the automobile is only a novelty – a fad,\\"The City of Huntington Woods, Historic District Study Committee,Preliminary Report , Rackham Golf Course Historic District Proposal \\"Rackham Historic District\\", presented July 18, 2006, pp. 3-7) Rackham bought 50 shares of Ford stock (from a total of 890 shares);The Rise of Detroit , John Chamberlain, Staten Island Auto Echoes Anderson bought another 50. In addition to Ford, Anderson, and Rackham, seven other people were awarded stock in the company, including Malcomson, James J. Couzens (future mayor of Detroit and Michigan Senator) and John Francis Dodge and Horace Elgin Dodge (who later founded the Dodge Brothers Motor Vehicle Company). At the first meeting of stockholders, Rackham was elected chairman.Bryan, Ford R., \\"The Birth of Ford Motor Company\\", retrieved from The Henry Ford Historical Association website , Dec 12, 2007. Ford Motor Company was wildly successful, providing substantial dividends, and in 1913, Rackham quit his law practice. In 1919, Edsel Ford, acting for his father, Henry, purchased Rackham's stock for 12.5 million dollars. Rackham's acquired wealth had little effect on his and Mary's lifestyle. Because Rackham was always cautious with his finances and leery of speculative nature of the stock market, the Great Depression had little effect on his fortune. Rackham spent the rest of his life as a philanthropist, giving money to children's charities, the University of Michigan, and other causes. At the time of his death, Rackham's wealth was valued at an estimated $16.5 million.  Philanthropy  Horace Rackham and his wife Mary supported the University of Michigan by donating his law library, sponsoring anthropological expeditions, and underwriting creative arts fellowships. Most significantly, when he died in 1933, Rackham left $100,000 in his will expressly to support graduate student loans. The Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies at the university is named after him, as is the Rackham Building, built in 1938, in which the school is housed.Horace H.

Horace H. Rackham Memorial Fountain at the Detroit Zoo by Corrado Parducci After the death of Mary Rackham in 1947, the Horace H. and Mary A. Rackham Fund was created. The fund was to be used expressly \\"for such benevolent, charitable, educational, scientific, religious and public purposes ... will promote the health, welfare, happiness, education, training and development of men, women and children, particularly the sick, aged, young, erring, poor, crippled, helpless, handicapped, unfortunate and underprivileged, regardless of race, color, religion or station.\\"  Detroit Zoo  From 1924 to 1928, Rackham was the first president of the Detroit Zoological Commission, which negotiated with the city for support for the zoo.Detroit 1701: Rackham Fountain In 1924, Rackham purchased acres of land in what is now Huntington Woods, Michigan, near land owned by the Detroit Zoological Society.

Disaster Lofthouse Colliery was in Lofthouse Gate close to Outwood in the Stanley Urban District where many of the colliers lived. Its site is now in the City of Wakefield. (Lofthouse is further north in the City of Leeds). A new coalface was excavated too close to an abandoned, flooded 19th century mineshaft. The sudden inrush of of water trapped seven mine workers below ground. A six-day rescue operation was carried out but succeeded in recovering only one body, that of Charles Cotton. The location of the flooded shaft was known to National Coal Board (NCB) surveyors but they had not believed it to be as deep as the modern workings. British Geological Survey records indicated that the flooded shaft did descend to the same depth but the NCB neglected to check these records. Legacy The incident led to the Mines (Precautions Against Inrushes) Regulations 1979 (PAIR), requiring The response of Arthur Scargill, a compensation agent in the Yorkshire NUM, is credited with boosting his popularity with the Yorkshire miners and helping his election to the post of president of the Yorkshire Area NUM later in 1973. He accompanied the rescue teams underground and was on site for six days with the relatives of the seven deceased. At the enquiry, he used notebooks of underground working from the 19th century, retrieved from the Institute of Geological Sciences in Leeds, to argue that the National Coal Board could have prevented the disaster had they acted on the information available. Lofthouse Colliery closed in 1981, with many of the miners being transferred to the new Selby Coalfield.BBC Bradford & West Yorkshire - 'It was never the same again!'

The station broadcasts a Hot adult contemporary format on 87.6FM from low powered transmitters in Seaford, Cranbourne, Berwick and Doveton. History Surf FM first switched on its Frankston transmitter on 1 October 2001. The name Surf FM was chosen to identify as closely as possible with being located in a bayside city. It was also selected to distinguish the brand from other names used by various coastal radio stations across Australia, such as Sea FM, Bay FM, Wave FM and Coast FM. Soon after the station commenced, some live programming launched, presented by a team of young adults programming a youth-oriented dance music format. The team disbanded by mid-2003 and Surf FM experienced a quiet period when it was not always on the air. Activity was revived in 2005, when national dance network Raw FM installed a satellite dish on the roof of the Surf FM studios to coincide with a national tour of outside beach broadcasts. For a period of time Surf FM would relay Raw FM's programming to make use of the satellite feed and fill airtime. In August 2007, Cranbourne resident Ian Wood joined Frankston resident Justin Christie as a co-owner of the radio station and soon after a second licence was purchased. It took about 14 months to secure transmitter site approvals and install broadcast equipment at the new site in Cranbourne. Surf FM relaunched as a networked radio station on 16 December 2008 when it switched on its Cranbourne transmitter. In the same year, Surf FM's music format was in a \\"holding pattern\\", broadcasting only 60's and 70's music as a novelty tribute to the defunct Melbourne commercial radio brand 3TT which had first gone to air approximately 20 years earlier. During a 9-month period, Surf FM limited its music to compacts discs and music charts specifically issued by 3TT between 1988 and 1989. Within weeks of launching into Cranbourne, Surf FM changed course and adopted a more contemporary music format. Soon after a syndicated news service including hourly news bulletins was added to the format. During this period of Surf FM's life - between 2009 and 2012 - the station gained substantial experience with live outside broadcasts, making use of internet enabled technologies not as widely available as when the station first aired in 2001. On 15 December 2011 Surf FM switched on a third transmitter in Berwick to provide improved coverage within the City of Casey. Format Change  On 20 October 2012 Surf FM changed course once more. The news syndication was removed from Surf FM and adopted instead by Surf City Sound. This coincided with a change of format as Surf FM adopted a Hot AC (adult contemporary) music playlist. The first song to air on the new Surf FM was Let Me Love You (Until You Learn to Love Yourself) by Ne-Yo. Most recently, co-owner Ian Wood has involved a number of people in the station to help make Surf FM become more engaged with audiences and communities residing in the cities of Frankston and Casey. Additional Coverage Area  On 18 July 2014 Surf FM switched on its Doveton transmitter. Located on the Casey side of the border between the cities of Casey and Greater Dandenong, the station can now be received in central Dandenong and nearby suburbs. The original licence owner had the transmitter site located just east of Camberwell and for a short time operated a Christian program format between late 2008 and early 2010. After Surf FM purchased this license, the Australian Communications and Media Authority approved the relocation from Camberwell to Doveton during 2013. Radio Haanji Surf City Sound was a radio station, which broadcasts on 1674 kHz in the AM narrowband from Werribee South in Melbourne's West. Previously, the station aired between 12:00 hrs. midday Fridays and 12:00 hrs. midday Sundays, with Jewish formatted Lion 1674 broadcasting on the same frequency during the rest of the week. The station went to air on 23 December 2011, with the first song to air being On the Floor by Jennifer Lopez and featuring Pitbull. Surf Fm began a new partnership in March 2015, on the 1674AM frequency, with Hindi and Punjabi broadcaster Radio Haanji. /> References External links * Category:Hot adult contemporary radio stations in Australia Category:Radio stations in Melbourne Category:Radio stations established in 2001 ","title":"Surf FM"},{"id":"13074249","text":"Dmitri Vladimirovich Ekimov (, ; born 5 February 1971) is a Belarusian-Russian former footballer and coach.

It was the cathedral of the diocese of Aleth. Aleth was a Gallo-Roman settlement on a peninsula on one side of the Rance estuary. The diocese was established in the 9th century. The cathedral was destroyed by Norman invaders in the 10th century but later rebuilt. The site of Aleth however was not a secure one and the town of Saint-Malo had begun to grow up on a far more defensible site on a rocky islet in the estuary. In 1146 the seat of the bishopric of Aleth was moved to Saint-Malo by the then bishop, Jean de Châtillon, and established in the monastery, founded in 1108. The diocese thus became the Diocese of Saint-Malo and the abbey church Saint-Malo Cathedral, replacing the cathedral in Aleth. Competition with the new town came to a head in 1255, when resentment in Aleth at the tax demands of Saint- Malo resulted in armed conflict. Aleth lost, and the walls, fortress and church were dismantled as punishment. The former cathedral ruins are still to be seen in the commune of Saint-Servan which occupies the area of the former Aleth.

He is also a former rally driver with international recognition. He was born in the Sydney suburb of in New South Wales, Australia. He has written many articles about himself and his experiences while rally driving. His first novel, Alice to Nowhere, was produced by Brendon Lumney into a two-part mini-series in 1986 directed by John Power. The film starred John Waters as Johnny Parson, Steve Jacobs as Dave Mitchell and Rosey Jones as Barbara Dean. His other novels include: Adam's Empire, Dust and Glory, Kalinda, Bet Your life, On Borrowed Time, and Clancy's Crossing. Motor racing As a leading motoring journalist and being very well spoken, Green was a television commentator and interviewer for the Seven Network and was well known for his commentary at the Bathurst 1000 motor race from the 1960s until his last Bathurst race as commentator in 1983. Green would continue doing motor racing commentary both in Australia and New Zealand until 1987. Evan Green was also a rally driver of international fame, competing in such events as the Round Australia Trial and the London- Sydney Marathon. Supercar scare In 1972 Green was responsible for the media controversy, known as the 'Supercar scare', which ended the Ford XA Falcon GT-HO Phase IV, the Holden LJ Torana GTR XU-1 V8, and the rumored Valiant VH Charger fitted with a Chrysler V8 engine (former Chrysler Australia executives and their test driver, leading racer Leo Geoghegan, deny that the Charger was to be fitted with a high performance V8. Although, in subsequent years it was revealed that Chrysler Australia did experiment with a 340ci- powered VG Valiant coupe that \\"went like Hell\\" according to the Geoghegan brothers. A 'test mule' was fitted with both the V8 and the Hemi-6 and was tested at the Mallala raceway in South Australia, with the 6cyl proving significantly faster due to less weight at the front of the car). As a result of the Supercar scare, Green was often shunned or given short answers when he tried to do grid or pit interviews with Australian motor racing legends Harry Firth (Holden) and Allan Moffat (Ford), both of whom had been involved in the development of cars that had been killed off. For his part, Harry Firth's Holden Dealer Team had completed virtually all the testing and development of the V8 Torana (both on and off the race track, ) and years later told in an interview with Australian Muscle Car magazine that \\"Evan Green was no friend of mine\\". Despite his role in starting the Supercar scare, Green would subsequently become a director at GM-Holden. Selected works *Journeys with Gelignite Jack (1967), Angus & Robertson.

View of Cisterns looking towards Jebal Shamsan The Cisterns of Tawila, or the Tawila Tanks, are the best-known historic site in Aden, Yemen. The site consists of a series of tanks of varying shape and capacity. They are connected to one another and located in Wadi Tawila to the southwest of Aden’s oldest district, Crater. Originally there were about 53 tanks, but only 13 remain following a succession of renovations, including those done by the British in the 19th century. The existing tanks have a combined capacity of about nineteen million gallons. The tanks were designed to collect and store the rain that flows down from the Shamsan massif through Wadi Tawila, and to protect the city from periodic flooding. The largest of the tanks are the Coghlan Tank at the center of the main site and the large, circular Playfair Tank, located at the lowest point, outside the main site. History The tanks were hewn from the volcanic rocks of Wadi Tawila and then lined with a special stucco that included volcanic ash to create a strong, natural cement that rendered the tanks’ walls impermeable in order to retain water for extended periods. Visitors to the Tanks are often surprised by the words on a plaque near the Coghlan Tank: “Regarding the original construction of which nothing is accurately known…” There is indeed little hard evidence and there are few reliable sources of information about the Tanks. One favored hypothesis is that Himyar, a pre-Islamic Arabian kingdom that ruled parts of Yemen from 115 B.C. to 525 A.D., started to build water tanks in the area that eventually became the Cisterns of Tawila. The Himyarites are known to have employed water-catchment tanks in other areas under their rule. The proposed Himyaritic origins of the tanks may help explain a recessed, rectangular area in the Coghlan tank that, according to the Director of the site, could have been used in pre-Islamic times for animal sacrifice (a ritual that the Himyarites were known to perform for a variety of occasions, including drought).yeph.org . In Arabic. Retrieved on 2007-11-14. thumb The Tanks were mentioned in some manuscripts after the coming of Islam to Yemen in the 7th century A.D. “Aden has Tanks that store water when the rain falls,” wrote Al-Hamdani in the 10th century.Al-Hasan Bin Ahmed Al-Hamadani, Sefat Jazeerat Al-Arab, reviewed by Mohammed Bin Ali Al-Akwa (Beirut, 1983). Al-Makdsi, writing three centuries later, also recorded the presence of wells and cisterns in Aden.Al-Makdasi, Ahsan Altakaseem Fi Marefat Alakaleem (Leiden, 1906). By the time of the Rasulid dynasty (1229-1454 A.D.), the Tanks had fallen into disrepair. However, the Rassulids recognized the utility of the Tanks and began to restore them.yradio.gov.ye. In Arabic. Retrieved on 2007-11-14. This restoration has led some to claim that the Rassulids built the Tanks, thereby obscuring what are, in all probability, the far more ancient origins of the Tanks. After the Rassulids, the Tanks once again fell into disrepair, damaged by flooding and neglect and filled with the rubble of successive floods. By the time of the British occupation of Aden (beginning in 1839), the Tanks had been almost completely buried by debris carried down the mountains by successive floods. Sir Robert L. Playfair rediscovered the tanks and recognized their potential value. Aden had no fresh water and was often cut off from mainland water supplies by hostile tribes. Playfair hoped that the Tanks, once repaired, could provide a reliable source of water for public consumption. The British accordingly set out to restore the tanks to their original function. However, in the process, the British modified the design and layout of the Tanks significantly from their original state. With the intention of storing the greatest quantity of water possible, British engineers replaced an intricate network of numerous, small, cascading cisterns along the valley walls with a few, larger tanks. The Tanks’ ability to both control floods and store water was thus hampered, and the site that tourists visit today is very much a Victorian British creation. Further, the remodeling destroyed what archaeological evidence might have been present with regards to the original site, and this, coupled with the scarcity of documentary evidence, has made learning more about the Tanks’ origins difficult. Close-up of Cisterns Today, the cisterns are primarily a public park and a tourist attraction. They have not been filled for at least fifteen years and do not serve the city’s water needs. They may still help with flooding, although the presence of structures in the saila, or flood course, that leads from the Tanks to the sea, impedes the flow of water. No significant restoration work has been conducted on the Tanks since the British colonial era ended in 1967. Time, floods, and visitors have taken their toll on the structures. In addition, construction on the tableland above the Tanks may threaten the entire system of wadis and dams that help channel floodwaters into the Tanks. The future of the Tanks remains uncertain.

It also is known as Pfrimer's conure, Goias parakeet, and maroon-faced conure. The Pfrimer's parakeet has been qualified as endangered by the IUCN and BirdLife International since 2007. It is endemic to the Goiás and Tocantins regions of Brazil. It is mainly found within a belt of dry deciduous and semi- deciduous areas of the Caatinga forest.Handbook of the Birds of the World https://www.hbw.com/species/goias-parakeet-pyrrhura-pfrimeri It was considered a subspecies of the white-eared parakeet, as Pyrrhura leucotis pfrimeri. The split was based on range, differences in habitat and distinctive differences in plumage (it is the only member of the P. leucotis complex where the pale patch on the ear-coverts is greatly reduced). A recent study based on mtDNA has confirmed its status as a distinct species. The population of Pfrimer's parakeet is currently decreasing, with a current population of between 20,000–49,000 individuals. The main factor behind the decreasing population is deforestation for agriculture. Individuals have an average lifespan of 6–8 years. Morphology Adult and juvenile Pfrimer's parakeet look similar in plumage. They have brown and red faces and ear coverts, with a blue crown. They have white or grey eye rings surround their brown or orange eyes above their gray or black beaks. Their necks are covered in green or blue feathers. The breasts are colored blue or green with hints of white and brown, while their abdomen is brown/red. The wings have a blend of red, green, and blue. Their tails are typically seen to be maroon with a green base. World Parrot Trust Encyclopedia https://www.parrots.org/encyclopedia/maroon-faced- conure Adult Pfrimer's parakeets grow up to a size of around 22–23 cm (8.5–9 ins) including the tail. Beauty of Birds https://www.beautyofbirds.com/pfrimersconures.html Range The Pfrimer's parakeet is endemic to Caatinga forest of the Goiás and Tocantins states of Brazil. These birds are known to be found up to 600 m up in deciduous or semi- deciduous forests. According to the BirdLife International and the IUCN they have an estimated extent of occurrence up to 20,300 km2. The range of this bird is severely fragmented due to habitat loss and ecosystem degradation. This is partly why BirdLife International has listed this species as Endangered. Ecology Behavior These social birds can usually be found in flocks that can consist of up to 10 birds. These flocks are typically noisy when in flight but will be quiet when resting or feeding in the canopy. Breeding The breeding season for is thought to start in April and continue until June. Adult Pfrimer's parakeets typically have around 3–8 eggs per nest. Diet The diet of the Pfrimer's parakeet is mostly made up of fruits, berries, and seeds; though they have been known to eat certain flowers, insects, and their larvae. Conservation Threats Currently the Pfrimer's parakeet is Endangered. Since they only live within a small area human activities affecting their habitat are devastating. Currently there are anywhere from 20,000–49,000 individuals living in Brazil. This number is decreasing as deforestation and habitat degradation increase within their range. Anthropogenic activities, such as agriculture, mining, and hunting are reasons as to why the population is currently decreasing. According to the IUCN there has been a 66% decrease in its natural habitat within the last 31 years due to deforestation. This deforestation is typically through selective logging, fires, and the conversation of forested land to meadows. Use and trade The Pfrimer's parakeet is not threatened by trade of exotic species as much as other exotic species but is still captured for this purpose on occasion. Conservation actions in place Currently the only action in the conservation of this species is some protection of its native habitat. Other than this there are no major conservation plans in place are specifically for the Pfrimer's parakeet in place. Conservation/research needed More general research is needed for the Pfrimer's parakeet. Little research has been done on this species and therefore reliable information and sources are uncommon. The IUCN currently has the largest source of data on the Pfrimer's parakeet, but other sources should as the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and BirdLife International are lacking in complete information. The habitat of the Pfrimer's parakeet shrinks by 2.1% each year and is in dire need of conservation. Logging and agriculture interests are currently the main threats against this species, which it needs protection from.

It was introduced to the market on 13 October 1999. and subsequently discontinued (apparently without official notice) some time before the end of 2003. The camera used the \\"Bayonet Konica KM-mount\\", a copy of the Leica M-mount, thus sharing interchangeable lenses with those designed for Leica cameras and others compatible with them. The Hexar RF has a combined rangefinder/viewfinder modeled on that of Leica cameras, a similar body shape and size - and so is similar to Leica M-mount cameras in many aspects of operation.  Lens mount  The Konica Hexar RF accepts lenses designed for the \\"Bayonet Konica KM-mount\\" a copy of the Leica M-mount. Because of this, the Hexar RF can mount and focus lenses designed for the Leica and other compatible M-mount cameras or, when used with an adapter, the earlier Leica thread mount lenses (note that due to physical constraints there is no adapter to allow bayonet mount lenses to be fitted to a Leica screw-mount camera). When first released there was some controversy and discussion about whether the \\"Bayonet Konica KM-mount\\" of the Hexar RF was, in fact, fully compatible with the Leica M-mount. Some earlier testers reported problems using Leica lenses on Hexar RF cameras. Konica made no comment on the issue, and continued to refer to their lens mount by their own name, with no reference to Leica. Other testers found no problems, and suggested that early reports may have related problems with early-production samples or to cameras at one end of a tolerance range matched with lenses at the other, and so claimed there was no systemic problem. The latter seems to have become the consensus view. Many users report using Leica and Konica lenses and cameras interchangeably with good results, including lenses of longer focal length or wider maximum aperture where problems are more likely to be encountered.  Viewfinder/Rangefinder  Hexar RF with 35mm lens, showing viewfinder (on right) and second window for split image rangefinder. The Konica Hexar RF camera uses a viewfinder combined with a lens-coupled \\"split-image and double image rangefinder\\" with illuminated, parallax-corrected, brightline framelines. As such it is very similar to the viewfinder/rangefinder of Leica M-mount cameras (if, perhaps, not as bright). The brightline framelines that show in the viewfinder are selected from one of three frameline pairings, depending on the lens (or lens adapter) mounted on the camera: * 50 mm and 75 mm * 28 mm and 90 mm * 35 mm and 135 mm These pairings are the same as those used for later Leica M series camera viewfinders (Leica M4-P and subsequent models) and use the same frameline selection mechanism at the lens mount. A frameline preview lever on the front of the camera allows for temporary selection of a frameline pair other than the one selected by the mounted lens. The .60x magnification used in the Hexar RF viewfinder allows for all framelines to be easily seen, including by those wearing eyeglasses - even the 28 mm frameline (the largest). This also allows for generous amounts of \\"outside the frame\\" space in the viewfinder for other focal lengths, which can aid photographic composition. However, the reduced apparent size of the viewfinder image can make composing and accurate focus more difficult when using longer focal length lenses. (Note, by way of contrast, that the \\"standard\\" Leica viewfinder magnification has been .72x from the Leica M2 onwards, with .58x and .85x as options on more recent models including the current M7 and MP models.)  Camera body  The Konica Hexar RF is similar in form-factor to Leica M-mount cameras, being slightly larger than the archetypal Leica M3 design in all dimensions, and just slightly heavier when batteries are fitted. Body construction is a cast-aluminium chassis with titanium top and bottom plates, finished in flat black, with a rubberised cover and slightly raised hand-grip. The chassis of the Hexar RF appears to be identical to that used by the Contax G2, with different top and bottom plates and similar but not identical film transport and shutter mechanisms. While the Hexar RF appears in some ways similar to the earlier auto-focus Konica Hexar camera, it seems to share few if any components with that camera. Major controls, including shutter release button, surrounding off/mode switch, film- speed/exposure-compensation dial and shutter speed dial are located on the right-hand side of the top plate, as seen from the rear, as is the LCD displaying the current frame count. The viewfinder is located on the upper left-hand side of the camera. The manual rewind button, release catch for the camera back and cable release socket are on the left-hand side of the camera. The lens mount release and frameline preview lever are located on the front of the camera. The bottom plate has the cover for the batteries and a tripod socket.  Film transport  The Konica Hexar RF has a hinged, swing-open, camera back with cut-out view window to show the film loaded in the camera. Film loading, advance and rewind is motorised and automatic. A button to manually trigger film rewind is also provided. Film sensitivity can be detected via standard DX encoding or the ISO value can be selected manually. Film is automatically advanced to the next frame (and the shutter cocked) after each shutter activation. Shutter release and film advance are as described under shutter below. When the end of a film is reached (or the manual rewind button pressed), the film is wound back into the film canister, with a brief pause to allow the film to be removed \\"leader out\\" if desired. Film transport is very different from Leica M-mount film cameras, which require manual film handling through a removable bottom plate and flip-up camera back, with film advance and rewind using manual levers and rewind cranks.  Shutter  The Konica Hexar RF has a metal, vertical travel, focal plane shutter with digital electronic control of shutter speed. There is no provision for non-electronic shutter release: charged batteries are always required for shutter operation. Shutter speeds between 16 seconds and 1/4000th of a second (continuous) are supported in aperture priority auto-exposure metering mode. Shutter speeds from one second to 1/4000th of a second (in discrete steps) may be selected in manual exposure mode. A bulb (B) mode is also supported (the shutter remains open while shutter release is activated). Shutter release modes (and film advance) are controlled by a 4-position switch surrounding the top-mounted shutter release button. Positions are: * off the camera is off (the LCD frame counter remains on while batteries are present, giving an indication that batteries are charged). * single-shot the shutter is released and one frame advanced each time the shutter release is activated * continuous the shutter is released and film advanced for as long as the shutter release is activated, at approximately 2.5 frames per second * self- timer the shutter is released, and one frame advanced, 10 seconds after shutter release is activated Shutter release is activated by pressing the top- mounted shutter release button or by a cable release inserted in a standard socket located on the side of the camera.  Exposure metering  The Konica Hexar RF meters for exposure either by aperture priority auto-exposure (with AE lock and +/-2EV exposure compensation) or in metered-manual mode. Aperture priority is selected by setting the shutter speed dial to either the AE or AE lock position. Manual exposure is set by selecting a specific shutter speed on the shutter speed dial (there is a central interlock button to prevent accidentally moving the dial from the AE modes to a manually selected shutter speed). Exposure metering is through-the-lens (TTL) and thus accounts for the aperture set on the lens in use. (Unlike SLR lenses, where the diaphragm controlling lens aperture is generally closed only at the time of shutter release, rangefinder camera lenses close or open the diaphragm directly as the aperture control is applied).  Electronic flash  The Konica Hexar RF has an ISO 518-compatible hot shoe with X flash synchronisation for an electronic flash. Flash operation is manual-only: more modern TTL flash metering is not supported. Flash synchronisation speed is 1/125th of a second. The default flash is the Konica HX-18W.  Packaging  The Konica Hexar RF was sold either \\"body only\\" or as a set in a presentation box containing the Konica Hexar RF camera, an M-Hexanon 50 mm f2 lens and an HX-18 electronic flash unit (along with a manual and accessories including a camera strap, body cap and front and rear lens caps).  Konica M-Hexanon lenses  Konica 28mm, 35mm and 50mm M-Hexanon lenses The original release of the Konica Hexar RF camera was accompanied by the release of three \\"Konica KM-bayonet mount\\" lenses for use on Konica RF cameras and others, such as Leica, with compatible lens mounts. These lenses were in 50 mm, 28mm and 90 mm focal lengths. Subsequently, in 2001, an M-Hexanon 35 mm f2 lens was released, and a new-model 50 mm f1.2 lens was produced, for release only with a 2001-release limited-edition version of the Hexar RF camera. In 2002 a dual focal length lens, the \\"M-Hexanon Dual Lens 21-35mm/F3.4-4\\" was introduced. Altogether, the range of \\"Bayonet Konica KM-mount\\" lenses produced consists of: * M-Hexanon 28mm 2.8 (1999) * M-Hexanon 35mm 2 (1999) * M-Hexanon 50mm 1.2 (2001) * M-Hexanon 50mm 2 (1999) * M-Hexanon 90mm 2.8 (1999) * M-Hexanon Dual 21-35mm 3.4-4 (2002) Konica's Leica-mount Hexanon lenses (whether Leica M-mount or Leica thread mount) are considered to have optical and build qualities of a high standard: not dissimilar to those produced by Leica and Carl Zeiss. Konica's lenses were even used as a reference for the Japanese Ministry of Industry as the benchmark against other manufacturers' lenses . Production of M-Hexanon lenses seems to have ceased around the same time as Konica's Hexar RF production was terminated (2003).  Other Konica rangefinder lenses  Konica produced rangefinder lenses for the Leica mount in the 1950s and produced a series of so-called \\"L-mount\\" lenses, in limited quantities, for the same mount in the late 1990s through 2001. The range of Leica thread mount lenses produced by Konica includes: 1950s * 50/3.5 Hexar collapsible * 50 mm f/1.9 Hexanon * 60/1.2 Hexanon 1990s - 2001 * 35/2 L Hexanon (1996) * 35/2 L UC-Hexanon (2001) * 50/2.4 L Hexanon collapsible (1997) * 60/1.2 L Hexanon (1999)  2001 Limited Edition  Konica produced a chrome-finish Hexar RF Limited camera, targeted for the year 2001 (the new millennium) in a limited release of 2001 units, supplied in a boxed set including a new M-Hexanon 50 mm f1.2 lens and HX-18 flash. The lens was only manufactured for this set, so examples are unavailable except in conjunction with the limited-edition kit or the (apparently few) occasions where components of the kit have been separated. This means that most are held by collectors or those willing to pay \\"collectible\\" prices.  Hexar RF Half-Frame  At some phase of the production of the Hexar RF, Konica made 50 units of a half-frame variant of the camera named Hexar 72.  Successors  Production of the Konica Hexar RF camera was discontinued, without official announcement, some time before the end of 2003. Konica and Minolta (who had previously manufactured the Leitz/Minolta CL and Minolta CLE M-mount cameras) merged to form Konica Minolta in 2003. In 2006 Sony acquired photographic assets from Konica Minolta, with the latter company withdrawing from all photography-related activity. The targets of the acquisition by Sony were the designs and tooling for Minolta/Konica Minolta SLR cameras and accessories. It is not known whether Sony acquired other photographic assets such as rangefinder camera designs or whether those are retained by Konica Minolta. Whatever the case, none of the involved companies has expressed any interest in renewed production of rangefinder cameras or lenses. Konica Minolta has since announced \\"Konica Minolta ceased the entire customer services for Konica Minolta cameras and related products, as of 31 December 2010.\\" It appears that services such as downloads for camera manuals were withdrawn at roughly the time of this announcement.

She began work in the late 1930s and retired in the early 1970s. In 2011, she was awarded Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian award of the Republic of India. She was amongst the first women in India to join a mainstream publication when she joined The Illustrated Weekly of India. Early life and education Homai Vyarawalla was born on 9 December 1913 to a Parsi family in Navsari, Gujarat. Vyarawalla spent her childhood moving from place to place with her father's travelling theatre company. After moving to Bombay, Homai Vyarawalla studied at Bombay University and the Sir J. J. School of Art. Personal life Vyarawalla was married to Manekshaw Jamshetji Vyarawalla, an accountant and photographer for the Times of India. In 1970, a year after her husband’s death, she gave up photography as she did not wish to work with the new generation paparazzi culture. Homai Vyarawalla then moved to Pilani, Rajasthan, with her only son, Farouq who taught at BITS Pilani. She returned to Vadodara (formerly Baroda) with her son in 1982. After her son's death from cancer in 1989, she lived alone in a small apartment in Baroda and spent her time gardening. Career Vyarawalla started her career in the 1930s. At the onset of World War II, she started working on assignments for Mumbai-based The Illustrated Weekly of India magazine which published many of her most admired black-and-white images. In the early years of her career, since Vyarawalla was unknown and a woman, her photographs were published under her husband's name. Vyarawalla stated that because women were not taken seriously as journalists she was able to take high-quality, revealing photographs of her subjects without interference: Eventually her photography received notice at the national level, particularly after moving to Delhi in 1942 to join the British Information Services. As a press photographer, she recorded many political and national leaders in the period leading up to independence, including Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Indira Gandhi and the Nehru- Gandhi family. The Dalai Lama in ceremonial dress enters India through Nathu La in Sikkim on November 24, 1956, photographed by Homai Vyarawalla.

The reasons behind her choice of this name were that her birth year was 1913, she met her husband at the age of 13 and her first car's number plate read \\"DLD 13″. In 1970, shortly after her husband's death, Homai Vyarawalla decided to give up photography, lamenting \\"bad behaviour\\" of the new generation of photographers.Haresh Pandya, \\"Homai Vyarawalla, Pioneering Indian Photojournalist, Dies at 98\\", New York Times, 29 January 2012. She did not take a single photograph in the last 40-plus years of her life. When asked why she quit photography while at the peak of her profession, she said > \\"It was not worth it anymore. We had rules for photographers; we even > followed a dress code. We treated each other with respect, like colleagues. > But then, things changed for the worst. They were only interested in making > a few quick bucks; I didn't want to be part of the crowd anymore.\\" Later in life, Vyarawalla gave her collection of photographs to the Delhi- based Alkazi Foundation for the Arts and, in 2010, in collaboration with the National Gallery of Modern Art, Mumbai (NGMA), the foundation presented a retrospective of her work. In 1998, she was honoured with the Chameli Devi Jain Award for Outstanding Women Mediaperson. Google honoured Vyarawalla on the 104th anniversary of her birth with a doodle, \\"First Lady of the Lens\\". Death On January 2012, Vyarawalla fell from her bed and fractured a hip bone. Her neighbours helped her reach a hospital where she developed breathing complications. She had been suffering from interstitial lung disease which resulted in her death on 15 January 2012.

It was intended to serve industrial premises and develop local passenger and goods business. The Caledonian Railway managed the construction, but when the line was nearly complete, tramway competition had become obviously dominant for local passenger journeys, and the Caledonian decided not to start the intended passenger service. The line opened for goods trains only in 1905 and 1906, and served industrial sites on the route. Most of the line had become moribund by the 1950s, but when the Linwood motor car factory opened in 1961, a rail connection to it was provided from the line, becoming the only part of the network still in use. That link was closed in 1984. History First railways Paisley had long been an important manufacturing town, especially in the textile industries. When main line railways in the west of Scotland were being planned in the 1830s, it was natural that the town would be considered an important intermediate point, and in 1840 the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway opened; the following year the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway opened its line too. The two companies shared, and jointly operated, a route between Glasgow and Paisley, the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway. Those two railway companies were later merged with others, and became part of the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR;) and the Caledonian Railway respectively. The two larger companies were keen rivals and over time expanded their area of influence in Scotland. The Barrhead and Neilston areas were already the home to much industrial activity, especially in the valley of the Levern Water, and in 1848 the Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway opened. In 1873 that line was extended to Kilmarnock and transferred to joint control of the Caledonian and the G&SWR; companies; the extended line was called the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway (GB&KJR;). In the later decades of the nineteenth century, there was considerable further industrial development in areas not directly served by the earlier lines. This was particularly the case in Paisley, where much industry was established south of the town, and in 1885 the G&SWR; opened the Paisley Canal Line which ran from Glasgow to Elderslie on a more southerly alignment than the Joint Line. The following year it extended that line by a branch to Potterhill, and in doing so served a considerable area of industrial activity. Linking Paisley and Barrhead The Paisley and Barrhead District Railway systemThe centres of Paisley and Barrhead are about five miles (8 km) apart, and the spread of Paisley industry towards Barrhead, and the location of much of Barrhead industry on the Paisley side encouraged the idea of linking them. As well as the goods traffic that might be captured, suburban passenger business could be assumed to be attracted. Residential traffic had been increasing in other localities; moreover a circular service from Glasgow through both towns had operational benefits. In 1898 the G&SWR; obtained an Act of Parliament authorising a line from its Potterhill terminus to Barrhead, there joining the GB&KJR.; The line opened in 1902 and a circular passenger service was operated from Glasgow. Paisley and Barrhead District Railway: authorisation and construction This was preceded on 6 August 1897 when the Paisley and Barrhead District Railway was authorised. It was nominally independent, but friendly to the Caledonian, and was intended as a competitive response to the G&SWR; route. It was to be a complex system amounting to over 12 miles (20 km), making several linkages with existing lines. It was supported by the Caledonian Railway: £132,000 of the £188,000 capital was provided by the larger company. Its route was to leave the Caledonian Railway's Greenock line at Paisley St James and turn south to the foot of the Gleniffer Braes, then east, turning south again to enter the centre of Barrhead. Unlike the G&SWR; scheme, it was to continue beyond Barrhead, and was to join the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway, authorised in the same Parliamentary session, at a junction between Neilston and Cathcart. A second arm of the network was to connect with the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway by a triangular junction immediately east of Paisley Gilmour Street, running south and joining the other section at a junction at Blackbyres, a short distance north of Barrhead. This section would give access for coal traffic from the Lanarkshire pits directly to Paisley, and was to be double track to handle the heavy trains. Construction of the line started on 15 August 1898. The route had been designed to skirt existing heavily built up areas, and construction was easy except in the approaches to Barrhead and Paisley East: here the possible alignment was limited by the hilly topography, the River Levern, the existing Kilmarnock line, and the authorised G&SWR; line. Two massive stone viaducts were required in Barrhead. (The town of 9,000 inhabitants was to have four passenger stations.) An enormous stone wall was built along the length of Lacy Street in Paisley to take the line to Paisley East as can be seen in the bridge photograph on this page. Having subscribed two-thirds of the original capital of the company in 1898 the Caledonian put in a further £80,000 in 1900, and obtained Parliamentary authority for an extension of time for construction in 1901. It acquired the company outright in 1902 (by Act of 31 July), while construction was still in progress. The G&SWR; Barrhead Central station, on its line from Paisley, opened on 1 October 1902. A further extension of time for the District Railway was obtained in 1904. For some time street-running tramcars had been making heavy inroads into urban and suburban passenger railway business, and electric tramcar routes were proliferating. The frequent trams, the convenience of stopping places in town and village centres, and the cheap fares were major advantages to which local railways could not respond. In May 1905 the Caledonian opposed the Paisley tramway operation's proposed route from Paisley to Barrhead: it said that the District Railway was to open on 1 June 1905, and that the company had spent £720,000 on the Paisley lines; the Company said that it \\"made a feature of workmen's trains\\". Opening and route The tramway was authorised, and the desperate struggle to compete for local passenger business was obviously lost; the Caledonian reviewed its position, and although the passenger stations were substantially complete, it decided not to open the line for passengers. The western section, from Paisley St James to Blackbyres and Lyon Cross was opened in 1905 for goods traffic only. The eastern section suffered a similar fate; it was opened in 1906 from Paisley East station, some distance south of the Joint Line at Gallowhill, to Blackbyres. The west and east curves that would have linked to the joint line were formed, but never connected.Some contemporary street maps show the connections as made; to avoid early obsolescence the publishers showed the planned construction, which was in the public domain, and showed it as having been completed. The line of route was therefore: * Western section; single track from a triangular junction at Paisley St James; the western arm, facing Greenock, was known as the Walkinshaw Fork; from the apex at Walkinshaw South Junction, the line ran through stations at Ferguslie (in the angle between the Gilmour Street and the Canal line east of Elderslie), Stanefield and Glenfield, to Blackbyres Junction; from there the line was double track to Barrhead (New) (on Mill Road directly opposite the G&SWR; terminus), and Barrhead South. The line continued to the junction with the L&AR; line at Lyon Cross, and the line was laid out there to incorporate an extensive junction station; there was a short branch to Meikleriggs goods depot from Ferguslie, and a connection to Inkerman Brick Works north of that station. * Eastern section; double track; from a triangular junction with the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway (not actually connected), turning west towards Gilmour Street and east to Gallowhill Junction. It had stations at Paisley East and Dykebar, where there was a short goods branch line serving the Dykebar Asylum. The closed high level line along a high wall to Paisley East is on the right, low level to the goods yard on the leftPaisley East station was chiefly used as a coal depot for Paisley. 1923 map of central Barrhead showing the railway linesBarrhead South station may never have been fully formed, although the goods yard was in use; it would have been a basic conventional two platform station, located close to the present-day Deanston Avenue. Barrhead (New) was a conventional two-platform station, but Dykebar was an island platform station. Paisley South was also a two-platform station. Ferguslie, Staneley and Dykebar were to be island platform stations forming passing points on the single line, but the loop at Staneley was never connected. Lyon Cross Some sources suggest that the line was never completed to Lyon Cross (sometimes spelt Lyoncross) where it would have joined the L&AR; line. However the six-inch Ordnance Survey map of 1915 (revised 1911) clearly shows both routes as double track with a full junction connection.Ordnance Survey, Six inch plan, Renfrewshire Sheet XVI.NE, 1915 This is the route by which coal for Paisley was brought in from the Lanarkshire pits; if the line had been fed from the Walkinshaw end only, that would have been a very roundabout route. A signalbox is shown, and the junction is named Lyoncross Junction. That is repeated on the 1946 plan.Renfrewshire Sheet XVI.NE, 1911 plan with revisions of 1938 and 25-inch plans of the same period. The 1939 revision shows the Paisley and Barrhead line as being reduced to single track. According to Alisdair Wham, the section of track between Barrhead South and Lyoncross was never used. Closures; but revival at Linwood Although the envisaged passenger service never ran, the line continued for many years to serve industrial premises; at the southern end this included the Arthurlie Dyeworks and a public goods yard at Barrhead South. Beyond that point to Lyon Cross the line closed by 1952, and the Paisley arm of the line closed on 31 December 1960. Meikleriggs Goods Yard closed on 6 September 1954. The section from Ferguslie Chain Road to Barrhead South closed on 28 October 1963. When the Rootes Group constructed a motor car manufacturing plant at Linwood in 1961, a railway connection was laid in to serve it; it ran from the District Railway between Walkinshaw and Ferguslie. The Pressed Steel Company had opened a plant at the site making car bodies for Rootes, and they also produced body shells for railway passenger vehicles. The line south of the Linwood connection to Ferguslie closed on 30 September 1968. The Linwood Plant was not commercially successful, and the siding connection and therefore the whole of the Paisley and Barrhead District Railway closed on 21 October 1984. The present day The entire Paisley and Barrhead District Railway network was closed and the only remnant of its existence is the wide space between the tracks at Lyon Cross on what is now the Neilston line, intended for the junction station there. The train shed in Dykebar Hospital was still in existence in 2007, and the course of the hospital branch line can be discerned in aerial photographs. Paisley, Glenfield Road to Glenburn Road cycle trackParts of the line are now a cycle track, built along the route of the trackbed from Glenburn to Barrhead. Glenfield station was at the bottom of the hill, a short distance up Glenburn Road from where the cycle track ends. Special passenger trains Although the line was never used for ordinary passenger trains, occasional Sunday school outings started from the stations on the line to Clyde Coast destinations in the 1950s. A rail tour operated by the Stephenson Locomotive Society visited the line on 1 September 1951. The train started at Paisley East Goods at Cecil Street and made its way to Barrhead South returning through the west branch to Paisley Gilmour Street. The Dummy railway Rowand says: \\"Alas for the promoters of the railway, in the same year [as the line opened] the Paisley tramway system became electrified, offering a cheaper, more convenient mode of transport. So it was that the line became known as the 'Dummy Railway with little or no patronage'.\\" Connections to other lines * Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway at * Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway at Lyoncross Junction * Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway at Arkleston Junction - planned but never completed.

It was first published in Great Britain by Collins in 1996, and won the 1996 Smarties book prize. The book was adapted into a stage play by Daniel Buckroyd of the Mercury Theatre, Colchester, which toured the UK in 2014. Plot summary A young boy named Michael runs away from a boarding school and meets an old lady living in a big cottage. She tells him about a boy named Bertie who lived in South Africa. As a boy, Bertie had found an orphaned white lion cub, but was eventually forced to send the lion away to the circus and leave South Africa to attend boarding school in Wiltshire, England. Bertie escapes from his school and meets Millie, and the two become fast friends, flying kites together. He tells Millie all about his life in South Africa, and his white lion cub. When the pair leave school, they continue to write until war breaks out, and a letter arrives from Bertie informing Millie that he has joined the army. Later, when fighting in France in the First World War, he saves two men's lives and is given a Victoria Cross. Millie, who has become a nurse in the hopes of finding Bertie, reads about him in a newspaper and the two are reunited. Together they discover that Monsieur Merlot's circus has closed down, but that the Frenchman lives nearby with the lion. Bertie marries Millie and brings the lion back to England, where they live happily for many years. When the lion dies, Bertie and Millie carve a lion out of the chalk in the hillside in memorial, before Bertie dies himself. After being told the story, Michael returns to school. He finds a plaque commemorating Bertie's heroic acts in the war, and learns from a teacher that Millie died only a few months after Bertie. Michael goes back to the house, finding it deserted. He then hears Millie's voice asking him to look after the chalk lion on the hill.

The Greek Revival house is notable as the home of educator Nathaniel Topliff Allen (1823-1903), an innovative educator of the mid-19th century. Allen's pioneering work was influential in the development of new teaching methods taught at the state normal school (established in Newton, now Framingham State University). The house is listed in the National Register of Historic Places, at 35 Webster Street. The property is now owned by Newton Cultural Alliance.City of Newton, Mass. - Maps Description and history The Allen Homestead is located at the northeast corner of Webster and Cherry Streets, one block north of the center of West Newton village in a residential area. The homestead consists of a series of connected wood-frame structures, of which the main house is a 2-1/2 story Greek Revival house with a temple front facing Webster Street. This was built in c. 1848–1852, probably by Milo Lucas, a local builder. Behind this block (to the north) is a two-story flat-roofed structure, built in the late 19th century as a dormitory space. This is joined on the right (east) side to the schoolhouse, a 2-1/2 story gable-roofed structure. Nathaniel Topliff Allen was hired in 1847 by Horace Mann, the Massachusetts Secretary of Education, to operate a model school in Newton, at which students could be taught using methods developed at the nearby Normal School. Allen had attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and taught previously in a number of public highschools before coming to West Newton. Allen's school became an internationally renowned showcase for teaching methods, and rapidly outgrew its facilities. When the Normal School moved to Framingham (becoming the school now known as Framingham State University), Allen purchased its building to continue running his school, West Newton English and Classical School. Allen's innovations included the first-ever kindergarten, and an emphasis on physical fitness, exemplified in part by the school's large (for the period) gymnasium. Nathaniel Allen married Caroline Swift Bassett of Nantucket in 1853; their daughters also became teachers at the school.

Seyer (State of Kansas ex rel. Hermesmann v. Seyer, 847 P.2d 1273 (Kan. 1993)), was a precedent-setting Kansas, United States, case in which Colleen Hermesmann successfully argued that a woman is entitled to sue the father of her child for child support even if conception occurred as a result of a criminal act committed by the woman. The case was brought in her name by the then Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services. Background Hermesmann was a babysitter for Shane Seyer during 1987 and 1988. When Hermesmann was 16, she began a sexual relationship with Seyer when he was 12 years old. When she was 17 and he was 13, she became pregnant and their daughter was born in 1989. Criminal charges had been brought against Hermesmann by Shawnee County, Kansas, accusing her of \\"engaging in the act of sexual intercourse with a child under sixteen\\" whilst she herself was a juvenile. In the event she stipulated as a juvenile offender to \\"contributing to a child's misconduct\\" which is not a sexual offense. In 1991, the Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services, in Hermesmann's name, took Seyer to court seeking child support. Hermesmann's criminal culpability was not addressed in this trial, as this was purely a civil court case. The Department also sought and was awarded $7,000 for its own costs. However, in the later Supreme Court hearing the Department stated it never had any intention of collecting its award. Kansas Supreme Court case In 1993, the Kansas Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Seyer that he was not liable to pay for child support. The court held that the admitted facts established that, because being under 16 he had been legally unable to consent to sex, a crime against him had been committed under statutory rape law, but that Seyer had actually given consent to the acts under civil law. The court ruled that \\"at no time did Shane register any complaint to his parents about the sexual liaison with Colleen\\". The court also ruled that a mother's potential culpability under criminal statutes was of no relevance in determining the father's child support liability in a civil action. The court stated that the state's interest in ensuring that a minor receives child support outweighed its interest in potentially deterring sexual crimes against minors. Precedents set The case established a precedent which has subsequently been used in the Kansas courts. It is one of the earlier cases now cited in U.S. child-support guidelines which say that in every case that has addressed the issue the court has decided that an underage boy is liable for the support of his child even when the conception was the result of criminal conduct by the mother. In a 1997 case before the Florida District Court of Appeal, the court's decision cited Hermesmann, saying that the Kansas decision was taken even though the Kansas statute states \\"a person under 15 years of age is incapable of consent as a matter of law\\". The court also remarked that \\"the Kansas court did not address the question of whether lack of actual consent (apart from the statutory definition) could form the basis of a defense to an action to establish paternity\\". In this case also the question of whether actual non-consent might be a defense was not before the court.

It was first published in Great Britain by Kaye & Ward in 1982. The story recounts the experiences of Joey, a horse purchased by the Army for service in World War I in France and the attempts of young Albert, his previous owner, to bring him safely home. It formed the basis of both an award-winning play (2007) and an acclaimed film adaptation (2011) by Steven Spielberg. Genesis After meeting a World War I veteran, Wilfred Ellis, who drank in his local pub at Iddesleigh and who had been in the Devon Yeomanry working with horses, Morpurgo began to think of telling the story of the universal suffering of the Great War through a horse's viewpoint, but was unsure that he could do it. He also met another villager, Captain Budgett, who had been in the cavalry in the Great War, and a third villager, Albert Weeks, who remembered the Army coming to the village to buy horses. Morpurgo thanks these three men in the dedication of the book. With his wife, Morpurgo had founded Farms for City Children, a charity where inner city children live and work on rural farms for a week. \\"Undaunted Author of ‘War Horse’ Reflects on Unlikely Hit,\\" New York Times (US). 12 April 2011, retrieved 17 April 2011. Interviewed by Fi Glover on Saturday Live on BBC Radio 4 in December 2010, Morpurgo recounted the event that convinced him he could write the book: > One of the kids who came to the farm from Birmingham, a boy called Billy, > the teachers warned me that he had a stammer and told me not to ask him > direct questions because it would terrify him if he had to be made to speak > because he doesn’t speak...I came in the last evening into the yard behind > this big Victorian house where they all live, and there he was, Billy, > standing in his slippers by the stable door and the lantern above his head, > talking. Talking, talking, talking, to the horse. And the horse, Hebe, had > her head just over the top of the stable, and she was listening; that’s what > I noticed, that the ears were going, and I knew she knew that she had to > stay there whilst this went on, because this kid wanted to talk, and the > horse wanted to listen—this was a two way thing...I went and got the > teachers, and brought them up through the vegetable garden, and we stood > there in the shadows, and we listened to Billy talking, and they were > completely amazed how this child who couldn’t get a word out—the words were > simply flowing. All the fear had gone, and there was something about the > intimacy of this relationship, the trust building up between boy and horse, > that I found enormously moving, and I thought: Well yes, you could write a > story about the First World War through the eyes of a horse, and yes, the > horse didn't understand every word, but she knew it was important for her to > stand there and be there for this child.\\" Another inspiration for the book, after meeting the veterans and seeing Billy with Hebe the horse, was an old oil painting that Morpurgo's wife Clare had been left: \\"It was a very frightening and alarming painting, not the sort you'd want to hang on a wall. It showed horses during the First World War charging into barbed wire fences. It haunted me.\\" The painting was by F. W. Reed and was dated 1917, and showed a British cavalry charge on German lines, with horses entangled in barbed wire.http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23669235-morpurgo-war- horse-is-a-story-i-had-to-write.do Morpurgo wrote a fictionalised version of this painting in his \\"Author's Note\\" at the start of the book. In his version, the painting shows a red bay with a white cross on his forehead, and the painting bears the legend: \\"Joey. Painted by Captain James Nicholls, autumn 1914.\\":) Plot One day, a man named Ted Narracott buys a young horse for 30 guineas when he was supposed to buy a horse for plough at an auction. Ted's son, Albert, names the horse Joey and grows to love him and protecting the young horse from Ted when he is drunk and caring for Joey. While with the Narracotts, Joey also meets a horse named Zoey, who was a source of comfort to Joey, and whose name partially inspired his. Soon, Ted sells Joey to the army in return for money, before Albert can stop him. Albert tries to sign up for the army, but he is too young but promises to come back for Joey. Joey is trained for the army by Corporal Perkins, and Captain James Nicholls is his original rider, leading a unit of mounted infantry. Joey soon befriends Topthorn, a horse ridden by Captain Jamie Stewart. However, during a charge against a group of Germans, Nicholls is killed. Stewart assigns Trooper Warren, a nervous young man who rides heavier but is quite kind, to ride Joey. During another charge, Topthorn and Joey carry Warren and Stewart into the enemy lines, and are the only two of many, but they are captured by the Germans. They use Joey and Topthorn to pull an ambulance cart for the hospital, where the two horses are famous and respected for saving the lives of many. The Germans allow Emilie and her grandfather, who live in a farm near the front lines, to care for Joey and Topthorn. Emilie grows to love Joey and Topthorn like Albert loved Joey, caring for their every injury and feeding them every night. Soon, the Germans move their hospital somewhere else because there was a battle, and Emilie and her grandfather are allowed to keep Joey and Topthorn, who they use for their farm. Topthorn was not bred to plow, but learns quickly from Joey, who has experience from the Narracott farm. Soon, however, a group of German artillerymen pass by their farm, and they took away Joey and Topthorn to pull their artillery wagon. The two horses meet Friedrich, who befriends them and tries to care for them as much as he can, growing to love Topthorn and telling them that he didn't want to be a soldier. Joey and Topthorn are two of the last few survivors of the artillery-pulling team. One day, after drinking water with Joey, Topthorn dies from heart failure. The Allied artillery starts shelling right after the Germans and Friedrich is killed. After seeing an Allied tank for the first time, Joey runs in terror and is wounded by barbed wire before breaking free. Both the Allied soldiers and Central Power soldiers see the wounded Joey in no-man's-land, and an Allied soldier wins possession of Joey by flipping a coin with a Central Power soldier and winning. However, their few minutes of friendly peace create a bond between the two before they separate, and both wondered together what could have been if not for the war. While being cared for by the Allies' veterinary hospital, Joey happens to be cared for by Albert, who is working for the hospital and has a friend named David. Albert realizes that Joey is his old horse after seeing what he looks like and how he responds to Albert's whistle. Albert starts caring for Joey again like he used to. Near the end of the war, David and two horses from the veterinary hospital are killed by a stray shell, putting Albert in a state of depression, as David had cared for him like a father. At the end of the war, Major Martin announces that they are going to auction off all the horses, despite the protests of Sergeant Thunder and the rest of the soldiers. During the auction, Sergeant Thunder loses to a butcher for Joey, but an old man outbids the butcher and reveals that he is Emilie's grandfather, who was looking for Joey. Emilie's grandfather tells Albert about how Joey and Topthorn came to their farm, and that Emilie had lost the will to live after Joey and Topthorn were taken from their farm, with Emilie fading away and dying at just 15 years old. Emilie's grandfather sells Joey to Albert for a cheap price, in return for telling people about Emilie, or else \\"she will just be a name on a gravestone nobody will read\\". Albert and Joey return to England, where they live in peace and Joey meets Albert's girlfriend, Maisie, with whom he doesn't get along very well. Awards The book was runner-up for the Whitbread Book Award in 1982. Adaptations The book has also been made into a play adapted by Nick Stafford. The play, also called War Horse, was staged at the Olivier Theatre, National Theatre in London. The production opened on 17 October 2007 and was met with critical acclaim – its use of life-size puppets of horses from the Handspring Puppet Company won an Olivier Award, Evening Standard Theatre Award and London Critics' Circle Theatre Award for design. In February 2010 it was revealed that the play would transfer to Broadway in New York City, and has since been seen in separate and touring productions in Canada, Australia, South Africa, the Netherlands, and Japan, as well as translations into German (Gefährten) and Chinese (战马). The play continues to tour successfully around the world. In May 2010, it was announced Steven Spielberg would direct the movie adaptation with Richard Curtis and Lee Hall writing the screenplay. Jeremy Irvine was cast in the lead role. The full cast was revealed on 17 June 2010. It was released on 25 December 2011. A radio adaptation of the book was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 on 8 November 2008. It featured Timothy Spall starring as the voice of Albert, Brenda Blethyn as Mother and Bob Hoskins as Sergeant Thunder. The radio play was rebroadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra on 11 November 2011 as part of a special Remembrance sequence. A Welsh version of the novel, adapted by Casia Wiliam and titled Ceffyl Rhyfel, was published by Gasg Carreg Gwalch in 2010.Ceffyl Rhyfel, Gwasg Carreg Gwalch, Casia Wiliam, 2016, 2nd impression 2016, Further information War Horse is one of five children's books that deal with war that was featured in a special exhibition titled Once Upon a Wartime – Classic War Stories for Children at the Imperial War Museum in London, that ran from 11 February – 30 October 2011. The exhibition details the historical background to the story, and exhibits include pages from Morpurgo's original draft of the novel. On its first publication in 1982 the book was only translated into a 'handful' of languages. As a side effect of the interest in the film adaptation by Steven Spielberg, the publishers of the book have recently been \\"inundated\\" with requests for translation rights for the book to coincide with the film's release in late 2011. The painting mentioned in the preface of the book, a portrait of Joey painted by Captain Nicholls and now hanging in the Village Hall (of an unnamed village), was a fiction of Morpurgo's. However, particularly since the success of the stage version of the book, so many tourists have come to the village of Iddesleigh, where Morpurgo lives, and asked to see the painting in the village hall, that in 2011 Morpurgo commissioned an artist to paint just such an oil painting to hang there. He used equine artist Ali Bannister, who acted as the chief \\"equine hair and make-up\\" artist on the Steven Spielberg film of the book and who also drew the sketches of Joey seen in the film. An exhibition entitled War Horse: Fact & Fiction opened in October 2011 at the National Army Museum exploring the novel alongside real-life stories of horses involved in war and the men who depended on them, and also drawing on the play and film adaptations of the novel.

Summary The novel is set in the French village of Lescun during the Second World War. Jo Lalande is a young shepherd who is enjoying his childhood; but when his father goes to fight in the war, Jo has to become the man of the house. After an incident with a bear, Jo meets a mysterious man in the forest. He follows the man to his home and learns his secret - he is a Jew named Benjamin who is waiting for his daughter Anya to come find him as they were split from each other, and he is responsible for smuggling Jewish children to safety across the border into Spain, with the help of his mother-in-law, the Widow Horcada. Jo starts to help them to prove that he can be trusted. German soldiers move into town, and things become much more difficult. Although most of the town's inhabitants come to accept the German occupation, the task of getting the Jewish children across the border becomes more dangerous. Jo, his grandfather, Henri, Benjamin and the Widow Horcada devise a plan to get the children across. The plan requires the whole town to help the children escape, and relies on the German soldiers not noticing what is happening. But if they are caught, their lives will not be worth living... After the children have been taken safely across into Spain, except for Benjamin and Léah. The bear that Benjamin saved earlier on in is ends up getting him caught by the Germans. The German soldiers find them and take them to a concentration camp, where they are presumed to have been executed. Shortly thereafter the war ends and Jo's grandpere marries the Madame. One day a telegram arrives from Anya who has found her way home.

It was named after George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer by Matthew Flinders during March 1802. It has been the site of an operating navigation aid since 1950 and has been located within the Innes National Park since 1970. Description Cape Spencer is located about south west of the municipal seat of Maitland in the gazetted locality of Inneston. It is the most south westerly point of the Yorke Peninsula coast and defined by Flinders as being the eastern side of the mouth of Spencer Gulf. It is the termination for a pair of coastlines - the western coastline extending from Corny Point in the nouth and the southern coastline extending from Troubridge Point in the east. It is described as appearing ‘as a cone with a ledge of rocks at its base’ when viewed from the south. Cape Spencer is accessible via a walking trail from within the Innes National Park. Access extends to the area around the Cape Spencer Lighthouse where views of both the adjoining coastline and nearby islands are available and the presence of interpretative signage provides information about the locality’s maritime history.Cape Spencer Lighthouse - SouthAustralia.com. Retrieved 2014-01-01. Formation, geology & oceanography  Cape Spencer was formed when the sea reached its present level 7,500 years ago after sea levels started to rise at the start of the Holocene. The cliff line which includes Cape Spencer consists of base strata of both Gleesons Landing Granite and Tourneforte Metadolerite with an overlay of a Bridgewater Formation calcarenite rock. The water adjoining the wave-cut platform at the base of Cape Spencer drops to a maximum depth of . History European discovery Cape Spencer was named on 20 March 1802 by Matthew Flinders after George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer who was one of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty in office at the time of the planning of the expedition to New Holland, or Terra Australis as Flinders called the continent in his book, A Voyage to Terra Australis. The cape was subsequently also named by the Baudin expedition to Australia as Pointe Mornay or Pointe des Malfaisants (English: 'Point of Evil'). Navigation aid and allied facilities The current concrete lighthouse was built in 1975 to replace a small automatic beacon erected in 1950. The cape is also the site of a high frequency radar station which is used to collect data about wind direction and wave height. Protected area status Cape Spencer has been located within the protected area known as the Innes National Park since the park's declaration in 1970. As of 2012, the waters surrounding its shores are within the boundaries of a habitat protection zone within the Southern Spencer Gulf Marine Park.

Watery Lane Junction. Caggy's Boatyard (started in the 1960s), within the start of the derelict Toll End Communication Canal (left and centre bridges). The canals of the BCN around Tipton. Tipton Green and Toll End Branches running across the centre The Tipton Green Branch and Toll End Branch (or Toll End Communication Canal) were narrow canals comprising part of the Birmingham Canal Navigations near Tipton (formerly in Staffordshire), West Midlands, England. These canals no longer exist. History The Tipton Green Branch was completed around 1805 with 3 locks and a length of quarter of a mile. The Toll End Branch was authorised by Act of Parliament in 1783 (along with the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, Broadwaters Canal, and several other branches) to provide access to a proposed new coal mine. Work was started from the Broadwaters Canal (now part of the Walsall Canal) but halted in 1784 for eight years, being completed as a closed branch with two locks in 1801. In 1806 it was decided to extend this branch to the Tipton Green Branch with further locks, and in January 1809 the Toll End Communication Canal was completed making the length 1 3/8 miles. In 1829 Thomas Telford's BCN New Main Line (Island Line)cut across the Tipton Green Canal, forming Watery Lane Junction, and creating a de facto Tipton Green Locks Branch of three locks and a Toll End Locks Branch of seven locks. From the later 20th Century Caggy's Boatyard occupied the basin at Watery Lane Junction. The Horseley Ironworks operated their first foundry from a site between the two branches where many iron bridges, including the Engine Arm Aqueduct (1825), two roving bridges at Smethwick Junction (1828) and Galton Bridge, were cast. Having suffered from a century or more of declining traffic due to the advent of trains and then motor vehicles, the Tipton Green Branch became disused in 1960, and the Toll End Branch in 1966, after some of the locks along the canal became immovable.Historical Map of the Birmingham Canals, Richard Dean, M. & M. Baldwin, 1989, The locks and canals were infilled in 1968. The Tipton Green locks were lined with houses which were built around the mid 19th century, but these were demolished around the time of the canal's closure. The brick base of one lock on the Tipton Green canal, however, remains in existence, forming part of a public footpath that followed the course of the canal and was opened in about 1975. One part of the Toll End canal has since been occupied by the car park of a factory in Toll End Road. There is also an \\"open\\" drain along the route of the canal at the back of Tipton Cemetery, but apart from this the canal has been almost totally obliterated. Almost all of the bridges are still in existence, apart from the bridge on Bridge Road which carried the road under the Toll End Canal. This bridge was replaced with a flat road several years after the canal was filled in.

Sometimes referred to as Xenia or Ksenia, she was known for her sometimes sexually appealing image on stage. Biography Early life Pajčin was born in Belgrade to mother Ljubica and father Miloš. Her family originates from the Bosnian village of Gubin near Livno. She was the cousin of controversial Bosnian Serb singer Baja Mali Knindža (Mirko Pajčin). Nine months after her death Knindža released the song \\"Spavaj, kraljice\\" (Sleep, Queen) in her memory. Music career Pajčin started her career as a go-go dancer in discothèques. She appeared as a backup dancer in the music video for Dragana Mirkovic's song Opojni su zumbuli in 1994. During this time, she worked as an assistant to music mogul Minimaks, who had been the manager of such successful stars as Silvana Armenulić and Lepa Brena. She was offered the opportunity to join a pop duet, Duck, as a female vocal. Marija Mihajlović actually sang for their debut album, while Pajčin only lip synced. As a dancer, she became famous in Greece, where she performed in numerous night clubs. Pajčin later went on to have a solo music career, and while her vocals were not impressive, she garnered attention for her dancing and outfits. She owned a dance studio in Belgrade and worked as a model. She frequently appeared in tabloids and was known for her outrageous statements. She openly discussed her sex life and plastic surgery. One of her final musical releases was a duet with her friend Danijel Alibabić. The song entitled \\"Supica\\" was released in July 2009. The music video was filmed a few months later and was released on 9 January 2010, two months before Pajčin's death. Alibabić later wrote a song called \\"Pjesma za Kseniju\\" (Song For Ksenija) and released it in 2011 as a tribute. Death and aftermath Ksenija and her boyfriend of nearly two years Filip Kapisoda were heavily injured and nearly died in a car accident on 28 January 2010, just 47 days before they died in a murder–suicide. On 16 March 2010, the bodies of the 32-year-old singer and her boyfriend were found in her apartment in the Belgrade neighborhood of Voždovac. Both had gunshot wounds to the head. Police suspected a murder–suicide, with Kapisoda as the shooter. Police were called to the house several nights earlier as the couple were reported by neighbors because Kapisoda had broken into Pajčin's apartment, knocking down the door. Early investigation reports stated that the dead bodies were discovered by the singer's mother, and that the gun used in the homicide was found next to Kapisoda's body. It is believed that the motive for the murder–suicide was jealousy. Bojana Ranković, the main investigator for the murder of Pajčin, said that she was warned through a text message that Kapisoda would kill her. In addition, the pistol used by Kapisoda was not his own, leading investigators to believe that someone else may have been involved. Pajčin was buried in a white coffin on 20 March 2010 in the cemetery Novo groblje in Belgrade, the day after Filip's funeral (which was attended by their mutual friend, singer Goga Sekulić). Her funeral was attended by Goca Tržan, Mira Škorić, Romana Panić, Ana Nikolić, Neda Ukraden, Bora Drljača, Indira Radić, Danijel Alibabić, Darko Kostić, Vanesa Šokčić, Saša Dragić, Marina Tucaković, and Nada Topčagić, among others. Her grave has been desecrated three times since the burial. The first time was in April 2012 and again in November that same year by an unknown person. The picture on her tombstone was broken, evidently by a hammer. The grave was vandalized a third time in February 2013, when an unknown person again broke the picture on her headstone, scattered the flowers that had been placed at her grave and broke the candle holders next to her grave.
