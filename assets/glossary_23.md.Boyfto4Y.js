The show premiered in 2002 and ended in 2007. The series had three seasons, each consisting of 26 10-14 minute episodes (a total of 78 episodes). The characters were represented by puppets. The show was produced by APTN, co- produced by Treehouse TV and filmed in a dedicated studio in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Both networks aired the show simultaneously; the show was also broadcast in New Zealand and Australia. Reruns were cancelled from Treehouse TV in 2009 while APTN's reruns continued until 2013. Characters =Russell= Russell (voiced by Herbie Barnes) is four years old. He is big for his age but is a very gentle and sensitive boy. People often expect more from him because of his size. He loves to eat and is always hoping that Great- Grandmother has something cooking in the kitchen, especially cookies or pies. Russell has many fears. He tries hard to keep them to himself, but they usually surface in some type of disaster. He looks up to Junior and Elizabeth and wants to be \\"grown-up\\" just like them. Russell counts on Sam to be his accomplice. Junior is his hero and Russell takes great pride in playing drums for Junior's dancing or even being asked to play with him. He is goofy and loud and his enthusiasm for life is contagious. But his greatest gift is the joy he brings to others. =Sam= Samantha \\"Sam\\" (voiced by Jan Skene) is a three-year-old who is a mischievous, funny, free spirit living in the moment. She thinks everything is \\"the bestest!\\" She's cute and snuggly with a curly bob of black hair flopping carelessly on top of her head. Sam can get away with just about anything. Her cousins find her a little annoying but would do anything for her. Sam always pushes the limits and rarely listens to anyone. She thinks she doesn't need anyone's advice, but that usually gets her into her biggest scrapes. In a way that only a three-year-old can, Sam always tells it like it is. She's smart, quick, and has sudden bolts of great big ideas. As a result, she can persuade her cousins to do wild and crazy things. She lives with joy and abandon. =Elizabeth= Elizabeth (voiced by Rebecca Gibson) is a precocious and confident five-year-old. She is artistic, expressive, and has an opinion on everything. She sees herself as the leader of the group. She can sometimes be self-absorbed and often ends up being excluded. The \\"princess\\" of the group, Elizabeth wants things to go her way and is determined to see that happen. She has many fears but usually manages to hide them well. She fights for what she believes in (even when she is wrong) and periodically has meltdowns, but she has a good heart and loves her cousins very much. While she can be nurturing, she often plays the martyr, complete with whole body sighs. \\"I have to do everything myself I guess....\\" Elizabeth knows she is destined for greatness. Even though she drives them crazy, her cousins all look up to her. =Junior= Junior (voiced by Ryan Rajendra Black) is a five-year-old Ojibway boy who stays at his great-grandparents' house in the every week while his parents work. His real name is Eugene, which he hates, so everyone calls him Junior. Junior is traditional and proud of it. He wears long braids and loves everything about being Native. He is very spiritual. Focused and serious, his feelings often get hurt. He and Elizabeth frequently clash over leadership issues. He can be very self-righteous, even a bulldozer at times, but he has great passion for life and nature. Great-Grandfather is his hero and like him, Junior is a great dancer and loves telling traditional stories. He is sincere, loving, and hungry for life. =Great-Grandparents= The great-grandparents are wonderful caregivers. They love and support their great-grandchildren and are essential to their learning. They often open the door to new ways of thinking. They have gentle humour and great wisdom but never preach. They listen, understand and guide the children to the animal who will help them discover the best course of action. Great-Grandmother Great-Grandmother (voiced by Michelle St. John) is wise and kind, but often enigmatic. Great-Grandmother has a sense of humour and the kids make her laugh all the time. Great-Grandmother makes the best saskatoonberry pies in the world. She makes quilts and gardens with equal passion. Great- Grandfather Great-Grandfather (voiced by Jules Desjarlais) is a fairly traditional man, but is willing to accept the modern world through the children. Great-Grandfather is a dreamer and storyteller but lives the seven principles. Great-Grandfather listens well and understands. He doesn't judge. He has endless stories that enchant and inform the kids. He loves playing his drum and teaching the children to do a Native dance. His laugh is infectious and he never seems to get riled. He is tender and humble and has a wonderful sense of humour. He has a respect for the natural world and teaches the kids about the voice in the wind, the spirit of the tree and giving a gift of thanks. He knows the stars, moon, and sun personally. =Animals= When the children have a problem, the great-grandparents instruct them to speak with an animal guide to help solve the problem. They would usually sing songs with the children. Each animal represents one of the Seven Sacred Laws, or teachings: * Wolf is Humility * Sabe (Bigfoot) is Honesty * Bear is Courage * Eagle is Love * Buffalo is Respect * Turtle is Truth * Beaver is Wisdom 2000s Canadian children's television series Treehouse TV original programming Aboriginal Peoples Television Network original programming Canadian television shows featuring puppetry Television series about children Television series about bears Television series about birds Television series about turtles Television series about wolves Canadian preschool education television series ","title":"Tipi Tales"},{"id":"4032505","text":"Fiscal conservatism is a political and economic philosophy regarding fiscal policy and fiscal responsibility advocating low taxes, reduced government spending and minimal government debt. Deregulation, free trade, privatization and tax cuts are its defining qualities. Fiscal conservatism follows the same philosophical outlook of classical liberalism and economic liberalism. The term has its origins in the era of the New Deal during the 1930s as a result of the policies initiated by social liberals, when many classical liberals started calling themselves conservatives as they did not wish to be identified with what was passing for liberalism in the United States. In the United States, the term liberalism has become associated with the welfare state and expanded regulatory policies created as a result of the New Deal and its offshoots from the 1930s onwards. Fiscal conservatives form one of the three legs of the traditional conservative movement that emerged during the 1950s together with social conservatism and national defense conservatism. Many Americans who are classical liberals also tend to identify as libertarian, holding more cultural liberal views and advocating a non-interventionist foreign policy while supporting lower taxes and less government spending. As of 2020, 39% of Americans considered themselves \\"economically conservative\\". Because of its close proximity to the United States, the term has entered the lexicon in Canada. In many other countries, economic liberalism or simply liberalism is used to describe what Americans call fiscal conservatism.  Overview  = Principles = Fiscal conservatism is the economic philosophy of prudence in government spending and debt. Fiscal conservatives advocate the avoidance of deficit spending, the reduction of overall government spending and national debt whilst ensuring balanced budgets. In other words, fiscal conservatives are against the government expanding beyond its means through debt, but they will usually choose debt over tax increases. In his Reflections on the Revolution in France, Edmund Burke argued that a government does not have the right to run up large debts and then throw the burden on the taxpayer, writing \\"it is to the property of the citizen, and not to the demands of the creditor of the state, that the first and original faith of civil society is pledged. The claim of the citizen is prior in time, paramount in title, superior in equity. The fortunes of individuals, whether possessed by acquisition or by descent or in virtue of a participation in the goods of some community, were no part of the creditor's security, expressed or implied. [...] [T]he public, whether represented by a monarch or by a senate, can pledge nothing but the public estate; and it can have no public estate except in what it derives from a just and proportioned imposition upon the citizens at large\\". = Factions or subgroups = Although all fiscal conservatives agree generally on a smaller and less expensive government, there are disagreements over priorities. There are three main factions or subgroups each advocating for a particular emphasis. Deficit hawks emphasize balancing government budgets and reducing the size of government debt, viewing government debt as economically damaging and morally dubious since it passes on obligations on to future generations who have played no part in present-day tax and spending decisions. Deficit hawks are willing to consider tax increases if the additional revenue is used to reduce debt rather than increase spending. A second group put their main emphasis on tax cuts rather than spending cuts or debt reduction. Many embrace supply-side economics, arguing that as high taxes discourage economic activity and investment, tax cuts would result in economic growth leading in turn to higher government revenues. According to them, these additional government revenues would reduce the debt in the long term. They also argue for reducing taxes even if it were to lead to short term increases in the deficit. Some supply-siders have advocated that the increases in revenue through tax cuts make drastic cuts in spending unnecessary. However, the Congressional Budget Office has consistently reported that income tax cuts increase deficits and debt and do not pay for themselves. For example, the CBO estimated that the Bush tax cuts added about $1.5 trillion to deficits and debt from 2002‚Äì2011 and it would have added nearly $3 trillion to deficits and debt over the 2010‚Äì2019 decade if fully extended at all income levels. A third group makes little distinction between debt and taxes. This group emphasizes reduction in spending rather than tax policy or debt reduction. They argue that the true cost of government is the level of spending not how that spending is financed. Every dollar that the government spends is a dollar taken from American workers, regardless of whether it is from debt or taxes. Taxes simply redistribute purchasing power, doing so in a particularly inefficient manner, reducing the incentives to produce or hire and borrowing simply forces businesses and investors to anticipate higher taxes later on.  History  = Early to mid 20th century = In the early 20th century, fiscal conservatives were often at odds with progressives who desired economic reform. During the 1920s, Republican President Calvin Coolidge's pro-business economic policies were credited for the successful period of economic growth known as the Roaring Twenties. However, his actions may have been due more to a sense of federalism than fiscal conservatism as Robert Sobel notes: \\"As Governor of Massachusetts, Coolidge supported wages and hours legislation, opposed child labor, imposed economic controls during World War I, favored safety measures in factories, and even worker representation on corporate boards\\". Herbert Hoover addresses a large crowd in his 1932 presidential campaign Contrary to popular opinion, then-Republican President Herbert Hoover was not a fiscal conservative. He promoted government intervention during the early Great Depression, a policy that his successor, Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, continued and increased despite campaigning to the contrary. Coolidge's economic policies are often popularly contrasted with the New Deal deficit spending of Roosevelt and Republican Party opposition to Roosevelt's government spending was a unifying cause for a significant caucus of Republicans through even the presidencies of Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower. Barry Goldwater was a famous champion of both the socially and fiscally conservative Republicans. In 1977, Democratic President Jimmy Carter appointed Alfred E. Kahn, a professor of economics at Cornell University, to be chair of the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). He was part of a push for deregulation of the industry, supported by leading economists, leading think tanks in Washington, a civil society coalition advocating the reform (patterned on a coalition earlier developed for the truck-and-rail-reform efforts), the head of the regulatory agency, Senate leadership, the Carter administration and even some in the airline industry. This coalition swiftly gained legislative results in 1978. The Airline Deregulation Act (Pub.L. 95‚Äì504) was signed into law by President Carter on October 24, 1978. The main purpose of the act was to remove government control over fares, routes and market entry of new airlines from commercial aviation. The CAB's powers of regulation were to be phased out, eventually allowing market forces to determine routes and fares. The Act did not remove or diminish the Federal Aviation Administration's regulatory powers over all aspects of airline safety.Cannon, James R.; Richey, Franklin D. (2012). Practical Applications in Business Aviation Management. Government Institutes. . In 1979, Carter deregulated the American beer industry by making it legal to sell malt, hops and yeast to American home brewers for the first time since the effective 1920 beginning of Prohibition in the United States. This Carter deregulation led to an increase in home brewing over the 1980s and 1990s that by the 2000s had developed into a strong craft microbrew culture in the United States, with 3,418 micro breweries, brewpubs and regional craft breweries in the United States by the end of 2014.\\"Small and Independent Brewers See Sustained Growth in 2017\\".

Jimmy Carter, who reduced the debt-to-GDP ratio in the 1970s Public debt as a percentage of GDP fell rapidly in the post-World War II period and reached a low in 1974 under Richard Nixon. Debt as a share of GDP has consistently increased since then, except under Carter and Bill Clinton. The United States national debt rose during the 1980s as Ronald Reagan cut tax rates and increased military spending. The numbers of public debt as % of GDP are indicative of the process: * 1910: public debt as 7.89% of GDP * 1920: public debt as 29.1% of GDP * 1930: public debt as 17.6% of GDP * 1940: public debt as 49.3% of GDP * 1950: public debt as 85.7% of GDP * 1960: public debt as 53.6% of GDP * 1970: public debt as 35.5% of GDP * 1980: public debt as 31.9% of GDP * 1990: public debt as 53.8% of GDP * 2000: public debt as 54.9% of GDP * 2010: public debt as 90.2% of GDP * 2020: public debt as 107.6% of GDP = Reagan era = Ronald Reagan spent the most of any recent President as measured as annual average percentage of the GDP\\"CBO Historical Budget Data April 2018\\". Retrieved June 25, 2018. Fiscal conservatism was rhetorically promoted during the presidency of Republican Ronald Reagan (1981‚Äì1989). During Reagan's tenure, the top personal income tax bracket dropped from 70% to 28% while payroll taxes and the effective tax rates on the lower two income quintiles increased. Real GDP growth recovered strongly after the 1982 recession, growing at an annual rate of 3.4% for the rest of his time in office. Unemployment dropped after peaking at over 10.7% percent in 1982 and inflation decreased significantly. Federal tax receipts nearly doubled from $517 billion in 1980 to $1,032 billion in 1990. Employment grew at about the same rate as population. According to a United States Department of the Treasury nonpartisan economic study, the major tax bills enacted under Reagan caused federal revenue to fall by an amount equal to roughly 1% of GDP. Revised September 2006 edition. By the end of Reagan's second term, the national debt held by the public increased by almost 60% and the total debt equalled $2.6 trillion. In fewer than eight years, the United States went from being the world's largest creditor nation to the world's largest debtor nation. = Ross Perot = In the 1992 presidential election, Ross Perot, a successful American businessman, ran as a third-party candidate. Despite significant campaign stumbles and the uphill struggles involved in mounting a third-party candidacy, Perot received 18.9% of the popular vote (the largest percentage of any third-party candidate in modern history), largely on the basis of his central platform plank of limited-government, balanced-budget fiscal conservatism. = Clinton era = This table shows that Bill Clinton's Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 which increased the average federal tax rates for the top 1% while lowering average tax rates for the middle class was followed by President Barack Obama starting in 2013 through the partial expiration of the Bush tax cuts and that both tax increases lowered deficits relative to Congressional Budget Office policy baselines without them While the mantle of fiscal conservatism is most commonly claimed by Republicans and libertarians, it is also claimed in some ways by many centrist or moderate Democrats who often refer to themselves as New Democrats. Although not supportive of the wide range tax cut policies that were often enacted during the Reagan and Bush administrations, the New Democrat coalition's primary economic agenda differed from the traditional philosophy held by liberal Democrats and sided with the fiscal conservative belief that a balanced federal budget should take precedence over some spending programs. Former President Bill Clinton, who was a New Democrat and part of the somewhat fiscally conservative Third Way advocating Democratic Leadership Council, is a prime example of this as his administration along with the Democratic-majority congress of 1993 passed on a party-line vote the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 which cut government spending, created a 36% individual income tax bracket, raised the top tax bracket which encompassed the top 1.2% earning taxpayers from 31% to 39.6% and created a 35% income tax rate for corporations. The 1993 Budget Act also cut taxes for fifteen million low- income families and 90% of small businesses. Additionally during the Clinton years, the PAYGO (pay-as-you-go) system originally introduced with the passing of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (which required that all increases in direct spending or revenue decreases be offset by other spending decreases or revenue increases and was very popular with deficit hawks) had gone into effect and was used regularly until the system's expiration in 2002. In the 1994 midterm elections, Republicans ran on a platform that included fiscal responsibility drafted by then-Congressman Newt Gingrich called the Contract with America which advocated such things as balancing the budget, providing the President with a line-item veto and welfare reform. After the elections gave the Republicans a majority in the House of Representatives, newly minted Speaker of the House Gingrich pushed aggressively for reduced government spending which created a confrontation with the White House that climaxed in the 1995‚Äì1996 government shutdown. After Clinton's re-election in 1996, they were able to cooperate and pass the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 which lowered the top capital gains tax rate from 28% to 20% and the 15% rate to 10%. After this combination of tax hikes and spending reductions, the United States was able to create budget surpluses from fiscal years 1998‚Äì2001 (the first time since 1969) and the longest period of sustained economic growth in United States history. = Modern fiscal conservatism = Comparison of annual federal deficits (CBO 10-year forecast from prior to inauguration vs. the actual amount) during the Obama and Bush presidencies showcasing how George W. Bush added far more to the debt relative to the CBO 2001 forecast than Obama added relative to the CBO 2009 forecast American businessman, politician and former Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg considers himself a fiscal conservative and expressed his definition of the term at the 2007 British Conservative Party Conference, stating: > To me, fiscal conservatism means balancing budgets ‚Äì not running deficits > that the next generation can't afford. It means improving the efficiency of > delivering services by finding innovative ways to do more with less. It > means cutting taxes when possible and prudent to do so, raising them overall > only when necessary to balance the budget, and only in combination with > spending cuts. It means when you run a surplus, you save it; you don't > squander it. And most importantly, being a fiscal conservative means > preparing for the inevitable economic downturns ‚Äì and by all indications, > we've got one coming.  Rest of the world  As a result of the expansion of the welfare state and increased regulatory policies by the Roosevelt administration beginning in the 1930s, in the United States the term liberalism has today become associated with modern rather than classical liberalism. In Western Europe, the expanded welfare states created after World War II were created by socialist or social- democratic parties such as the British Labour Party rather than liberal parties. Many liberal parties in Western Europe tend to adhere to classical liberalism, with the Free Democratic Party in Germany being one example. The Liberal Democrats in the United Kingdom have a classical liberal and a social liberal wing of the party. In many countries, liberalism or economic liberalism is used to describe what Americans call fiscal conservatism. Fiscal conservatism in the United Kingdom was arguably most popular during the premiership of Conservative Margaret Thatcher. After a number of years of deficit spending under the previous Labour government, Thatcher advocated spending cuts and selective tax increases to balance the budget. As a result of the deterioration in the United Kingdom's public finances‚Äîaccording to fiscal conservatives caused by another spate of deficit spending under the previous Labour government, the late-2000s recession and by the European sovereign debt crisis‚Äîthe Cameron‚ÄìClegg coalition (Conservative‚ÄìLiberal Democrats) embarked on an austerity programme featuring a combination of spending cuts and tax rises in an attempt to halve the deficit and completely eliminate the structural deficit over the five-year parliament. In Canada, the rise of the socialist Co-operative Commonwealth Federation pushed the Liberal Party to create and expand the welfare state before and after World War II. Fiscal conservatism in Canada is generally referred to as blue Toryism when it is present within the Conservative Party of Canada. In Alberta, fiscal conservatism is represented by the United Conservative Party. In Ontario, fiscal conservatism is represented by the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario.

It served as the harbour of Cyrene, to the southwest. Apollonia became autonomous from Cyrene at latest by the time the area came within the power of Rome, when it was one of the five cities of the Libyan Pentapolis, growing in power until, in the 6th century A.D., it became the capital of the Roman province of Libya Superior or Libya Pentapolitana.

A ternary search is an example of a divide and conquer algorithm (see search algorithm).

They are named by pharmacological similarities, and are evolutionarily unrelated. The fungal protein ERG2, a C-8 sterol isomerase, falls into the same protein family as sigma-1. Both localize to the ER membrane, although sigma-1 is also reported to be a cell surface receptor. Sigma-2 is an EXPREA domain protein with a mostly intracellular (ER membrane) localization.  Classification  œÉ‚Äìreceptors were once thought to be a type of opioid receptor, even though such drugs had no clinically relevant affinities for Œº (mu), Œ∫ (kappa), or Œ¥ (delta) receptors. However, pharmacological testing indicated that the œÉ-receptors were activated by drugs completely unrelated to the opioids, and their function was unrelated to the function of the opioid receptors. For example, phencyclidine (PCP), and the antipsychotic haloperidol may interact with œÉ-receptors as biased agonists/antagonists at sigma 1 (versus sigma 2.) Neither phencyclidine nor haloperidol have any appreciable chemical similarity to the opioids. When the œÉ1 receptor was isolated and cloned, it was found to have no structural similarity to the opioid receptors. At this point, they were designated as a separate class of receptors.  Function  The function of these receptors is poorly understood. Activation of œÉ‚Äìreceptors by an agonist ligand may induce hallucinogenic effects and also may be responsible for the paradoxical convulsions sometimes seen in opiate overdose. Drugs known to be œÉ‚Äìagonists include cocaine, morphine/diacetylmorphine, opipramol, PCP, fluvoxamine, methamphetamine, dextromethorphan, and the herbal antidepressant berberine. However the exact role of œÉ‚Äìreceptors is difficult to establish as many œÉ‚Äìagonists also bind to other targets such as the Œ∫-opioid receptor and the NMDA glutamate receptor. In animal experiments, œÉ‚Äìantagonists such as rimcazole were able to block convulsions from cocaine overdose. œÉ‚Äìantagonists are also under investigation for use as antipsychotic medications. The abundant neurosteroid steroid hormone DHEA is an agonist at sigma receptors and along with pregnenolone could be endogenous agonist ligands; opposed by sigma antagonistic activity from progesterone. Another endogenous ligand, N,N-dimethyltryptamine, was also found to interact with œÉ1.  Physiologic effects  Physiologic effects when the œÉ‚Äìreceptor is activated include hypertonia, tachycardia, tachypnea, antitussive effects, and mydriasis. Some œÉ‚Äìreceptor agonists‚Äîsuch as cocaine, a weak œÉ‚Äìagonist‚Äîexert convulsant effects in animals. Behavioral reactions to œÉ‚Äìagonists are rather heterogeneous: some individuals find œÉ‚Äìreceptor agonists euphoric with significant anti-depressive effects. Other individuals, however, experience dysphoria and often report feelings of malaise or anxiety. In 2007 selective œÉ‚Äìreceptor agonists were shown to produce antidepressant-like effects in mice.

It was founded in 1990 by Hsing Yun, founder of the Taiwan-based Buddhist order Fo Guang Shan and Hsi Lai Temple, the North American order headquarters. The school offered its first class in spring of 1991. UWest is accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission. Founded by a Buddhist organization, UWest is described in their official documents as a \\"Buddhist-affiliated university\\" that is \\"informed by Buddhist wisdom,\\" but UWest students are not required to subscribe to the Buddhist faith or practice Buddhism in any form. Indeed, UWest's undergraduate and graduate programs in business administration garner higher enrollment numbers than its undergraduate and graduate programs in religious studies. History View of campus University of the West, originally incorporated as Hsi Lai University, () started in a small classroom in Hsi Lai Temple, the North American head branch of the Fo Guang Shan order. In its first semester (1991) the school had only four professors and a student body of around 30 students made up of monks and nuns from the temple. Early instructors were Dr. Roger Schmidt, Dr. Dan Lusthaus, Dr. Jim Santucci (now chair of the Department of Comparative Religion at California State University, Fullerton), and Dr. Lewis Lancaster, an eminent Western scholar of Buddhism, a former UWest president and now Chair Emeritus at University of California, Berkeley. Over the years, each of those original professors has returned to the UWest campus to teach or act in administrative roles (or both). In 1996, Fo Guang Shan purchased a property at 1409 Walnut Grove Ave. in Rosemead, California, a multicultural suburb of the San Gabriel Valley, approximately ten miles east of downtown Los Angeles. The campus belonged to Biola University at the time and was the site of Biola's seminary school. According to Dr. Jim Chen, a UWest professor of accounting and one of the original negotiators of the property purchase, the Christian-based Biola organization was reluctant to sell the property to a Buddhist organization. After a tussle, the property was successfully purchased. At that time, the university decided to pursue accreditation while also adding additional programs to its offerings. Undergraduate and advanced degrees in business, English, psychology, philosophy, Chinese language, Buddhist chaplaincy, and religious studies were added. An English as a Second Language program was also established, given the international character of students attracted to the school. The degree programs in history, philosophy, Chinese language, and the bachelor of arts in Buddhist studies, are no longer offered, however, they remain accredited should the university revisit them in the future. The accreditation process took approximately 10 years to complete, with former dean of academic affairs and noted Buddhist scholar Dr. Ananda Guruge steering the drive for WASC recognition. Accreditation was granted in February, 2006. Shortly thereafter a drive to attract American students to the campus was initiated. As of 2014, approximately 40% of the student body are American citizens or permanent residents. =Board of trustees= Overall governance of the university lies in the hands of its 15-member board of trustees. The trustees select the president, oversee all faculty and senior administrative appointments, monitor the budget, supervise the endowment, and protect university property. =Presidents= The current interim President of University of the West is Dr. Chiung-Sally Chou. Past presidents include: *Hsing Yun (1990‚Äì1998) *Dr. Naichen Chen (1998‚Äì2004) *Dr. Lewis Lancaster (2004‚Äì2006) *Roger Schmidt (2004‚Äì2007) *Dr. Allen Huang (2007‚Äì2009) *Chack-Fan Lee (2009‚Äì2010) *Dr. Chin- Shun Wu (2010‚Äì2013) *Dr. Stephen Morgan (2013‚Äì2018) *Dr. Otto Chang (2018-2019) Enrollment UWest enrollment stood at 383 students as of the fall 2017 semester. The campus has seen a significant growth in population since accreditation in 2006. The student body is approximately 50% international and 50% domestic. Aside from U.S. students, the student body is made up of students from more than 44 countries. Research centers *Institute for the Study of Humanistic Buddhism *Digital Sanskrit Buddhist Canon *Institute of Chinese Buddhist Studies *The Center for the Study of Minority and Small Business (CSMSB) Accreditation UWest was accredited in February 2006 by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). The university has a membership status in the WASC. This means that the degrees and courses currently supported by the university will transfer to other universities with regional or national accreditation. Facilities University of the West consists of three main buildings, two residence halls and an auditorium on an , hilltop campus. The lower floor of the administration building offers services such as financial aid, admissions, student accounts, registrar etc. The upper floor features classrooms, an investment lab for business students, and the offices of the president. The administration building underwent a major modernization from 2003 to 2012. The three-story education building houses the library, student services, Kenneth A. Locke Hall, IT services, classrooms, academic departments, professors' offices, and the Student Success Center. The building was modernized in 2003‚Äì2012. The recreation building at the top of the campus hosts the dining hall, recreation game room, and student kitchen. Other facilities include pool and spa, gym, and basketball court.

Known as \\"the great builder,\\" Chase constructed 22 new academic buildings and residential dorms on the campus of the college, tripled the number of students and faculty as well as quadrupling the financial endowment to one million dollars. Chase is notable for being the first and only alumnus of Bates to be elected its president. Life and career Chase was born on March 15, 1844 in Unity, Maine. His parents were Freewill Baptists. At age 18 Chase enrolled at the Maine State Seminary and graduated from the Seminary program in 1864. He then enrolled in the college program at Bates College, graduating in 1868. After graduation he taught at the New Hampton Literary Institute, eventually returning to teach at Bates in 1870. In the 1870s, in pursuit his life's work, he returned to Lewiston and enrolled in the theological school, which later became a part of the college's religion department. Meanwhile, the Bates offered him a professorship of Greek and he spent the next year teaching and pursuing his studies in theology. After his spell teaching Greek he moved to teaching English. In order to better prepare himself, he spent a year as a graduate student at Harvard, returning in 1872 to join the Bates faculty as Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature. Chase attended Bates' Cobb Divinity School while teaching, but eventually decided not to pursue a career in ministry. Chase then studied at Harvard University, returning to Bates in 1872 to teach Rhetoric and English. Chase taught for 22 years and during that time his administrative skills were noticed by the current Bates College president, Oren Burbank Cheney. In the 1880s Chase took on many of the president's fundraising responsibilities, and in 1894, Chase became Bates' second president, when Oren Burbank Cheney retired. As president Chase greatly expanded the college campus, student body, and the endowment. Chase served as president until his death in 1919. He died shortly after signing the diplomas for the class of 1919. His house on Frye Street is currently part of College, and Chase Hall is named after him. He has received several honorary degrees including University of New Brunswick and Bowdoin College. In 1872, he married Emma F. Millett, a former member of the Bates College's first graduating class. They had five children: George, Emma, Muriel, Elizabeth and Caroline. Chase died at his home in Lewiston, Maine on May 27, 1919 at the age of 75.  Legacy  Chase was honored by Bates with the construction of Chase Hall, which houses the Student Activities Center, the college book store, the postal center, the offices of several student organizations.

For example, it may be a local copy of data located remotely, or may be a subset of the rows and/or columns of a table or join result, or may be a summary using an aggregate function. The process of setting up a materialized view is sometimes called materialization.Compare: This is a form of caching the results of a query, similar to memoization of the value of a function in functional languages, and it is sometimes described as a form of precomputation. As with other forms of precomputation, database users typically use materialized views for performance reasons, i.e. as a form of optimization. Materialized views which store data based on remote tables were also known as snapshots , (deprecated Oracle terminology). In any database management system following the relational model, a view is a virtual table representing the result of a database query. Whenever a query or an update addresses an ordinary view's virtual table, the DBMS converts these into queries or updates against the underlying base tables. A materialized view takes a different approach: the query result is cached as a concrete (\\"materialized\\") table (rather than a view as such) that may be updated from the original base tables from time to time. This enables much more efficient access, at the cost of extra storage and of some data being potentially out- of-date. Materialized views find use especially in data warehousing scenarios, where frequent queries of the actual base tables can be expensive. In a materialized view, indexes can be built on any column. In contrast, in a normal view, it's typically only possible to exploit indexes on columns that come directly from (or have a mapping to) indexed columns in the base tables; often this functionality is not offered at all.

The Gourd Dance is a social dance. Origin legends Many Native Americans dispute the origin of the legend of the Gourd Dance. A Kiowa story recounts the tale of a young man who had been separated from the rest of the tribe. Hungry and dehydrated after many days of travel, the young man approached a hill and heard an unusual kind of singing coming from the other side. There he saw a red wolf singing and dancing on its hind legs. The man listened to the songs all afternoon and through the night and when morning came, the wolf spoke to him and told him to take the dance and songs back to the Kiowa people. The \\"howl\\" at the end of each gourd dance song is a tribute to the red wolf. The Kiowa Gourd Dance was once part of the Kiowa Sun Dance ceremony. Decline, revival, and organizations within the Kiowa Tribe Beginning in 1890 the United States government began to actively enforce bans on Kiowa cultural ceremonials and the Gourd Dance was out of normal practice by the late 1930s. In 1957 the Kiowa Director for the American Indian Exposition, Fred Tsoodle, called upon singers Bill Koomsa and William Tanedooah who remembered the Gourd Dance songs. Also called were Clyde Ahtape, Harry Hall Zotigh, Fred Botone, Oliver Tanedooah, and Abel Big Bow in Kiowa Gourd Dance dress to dance to the songs for a special tribal presentation at that year's festivities. Two years later inspired by the presentation several Kiowa men reorganized the Kiowa Gourd Dance Society and formally established the organization on January 30, 1957 and voted on the name \\"Kiowa Gourd Dance\\". Within the next decade the organization split into three unrelated branches: the establishing group (now called Kiowa Gourd Clan), Tiah-Piah Society of Oklahoma (established in 1962), and the Tia-piah Society of Carnegie (now known as the Kiowa TiaPiah Society). All three societies hold their annual ceremonials on and around July 4, due to the Gourd Dance at one time being a part of the Sun Dance ceremonials usually held in mid-summer. The variations on the word \\"Tia-Piah\\" used in the names of Kiowa Gourd Dance organizations comes from J√†i:f√®:g√†u (Tdeinpei-gah) [IPA: t√£i.peÀê.g…î] one of the eight Kiowa warrior societies. Perhaps because of the military connotations of the term the Gourd Dance has often been mistaken for a \\"veteran's dance\\". However, leaders of all three of the earliest Kiowa- established gourd dance organizations agree that this is not a requirement to become a member of the societies. Dances from two of the other presently- existing societies, P√≤l√°:hy√≤p (\\"Pah-Lye-Up\\" or \\"Rabbit Society\\") [p ∞o.laÀê.hyop] and √ìh√≤m√†:g√†u (\\"Ohomah\\" or \\"War Dance Society\\"), [o.ho.m…îÀê.g…î] are incorporated into the Kiowa summer ceremonials before and after the gourd dance sessions. Participation A Warriors (Male) Gourd Dance Eagle Fan. This Gourd Dance fan is made from immature bald eagle feathers. The handle of this fan was made from the branch of a tree struck by lightning, and the handle of the fan has been stitched, bound, and fringed with bison hide. The Gourd Dance originated with the Kiowa tribe, and is a man's dance. Women participate by dancing in place behind their male counterparts and outside the perimeter formed by the men. The dance in the Kiowa Language is called \\"Ti-ah pi-ah\\" which means \\"ready to go, ready to die\\". The Kiowa consider this dance as their dance since it was given to them by \\"Red Wolf\\". It has spread to many other tribes and societies, most of which do not have the blessing of the Kiowa Elders. Some gourd societies do not distinguish race as a criterion, and even non-Indians can and are inducted into their gourd societies, the Kiowa gourd dance society however only inducts Indians of half blood or more. Many participants may be older men, and the dance is less energetic and less physically demanding than most pow-wow dances. Some of the Gourd Dances that are held go on all afternoon and on into the evening when it finally cools off enough so that more energetic Intertribal dances can begin. Some Tribal dances feature only Gourd Dancing. Regalia Modern Gourd Dance regalia consists of a red and blue blanket draped over the shoulders. (This accessory represents night and day). Some dancers change the blanket to rest over the heart red during the day and blue after dark. A skunk berry (Ka-hole) and silver beaded bandolier fastened on the left shoulder is draped across the heart. The red skunk berry bandolier was added as a memorial tribute to a battle fought with Cheyenne warriors. The aftermath left the land covered with red blood and is represented by the red skunk berries. A handkerchief bundle of Indian perfume, gathered from the foothills, is tied to the back of the bandolier. A metal rattle to accompany the drumbeat and a feathered fan usually are held in opposite hands. Normally Kiowa Gourd Clan members do not use real gourds in this dance because they are associated with the Native American Church ceremonies. Traditionally dressed gourd dancers wear buckskin leggings and a long, red breechcloth. These are covered by a black fringed shawl wrapped above the black shawl to secure it. Today these are accompanied with a long sleeved shirt, bolo tie or tie. Head attire can include hair wrapped with otter wraps, a roach or otter cap. Following Kiowa protocol, it is considered disrespectful to wear ball caps, T-shirts, cowboy hats or boots while participating in this dance. The four Kiowa headsman of this society urge its members to dress with dignity and discretion.  Music and choreography  Like pow-wow dancing, Gourd Dancing is performed in a circular arena. The drum can be placed on the side or in the center of the arena. The dancers take their place around the perimeter of the area. During most of the song, the dancers dance in place, lifting their feet in time to the drumbeats, and shaking their rattles from side to side. At certain points in the singing, the drum beat changes to harder beats. At this point, the dancers will dance in place. when it changes to softer beats the dancers will dance a short distance from their spots. Typically, the dance begins in the afternoon, and the opening song (referred to as a \\"Calling Song\\") is sung first. The head singer will determine how many songs are sung in a set. Usually the slower paced songs are sung in the beginning and progressively faster songs are sung as the gourd dance progresses. When the gourd dance draws to a close, a fast song is usually the last to be performed, but it is not the \\"official\\" closing song. Sometimes buffalo songs will be sung after that last gourd dance song.

It is co-located with 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group at Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Edmonton. Equipped with 16 CH-146 Griffon helicopters, it rotates a high combat-readiness level with 400 Squadron (CFB Borden, Ontario) and 430 Squadron (CFB Valcartier, Quebec). Its primary role is in support of contingency operations and vanguard brigades requiring tactical helicopter resources. No. 408 Squadron's mandate also includes supporting United Nations and NATO peacekeeping operations, land force training, and support to other government departments. For example, 408 Squadron's eight Griffons were assigned to support the Canadian contingent in the Balkans in 1999. Their job was to ferry small teams of paratroopers, infantrymen, and tankers to certain areas to check out water reservoirs, power grids, suspected weapons caches, minefields, and mass grave sites.  History  Lancaster Mk II at RAF Linton- on-Ouse, England No. 408 Squadron's history dates back to 24 June 1941, when RAF Bomber Command's directive called for the formation of 408 Squadron as part of No. 5 Group RAF. It was to be the second Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) bomber squadron formed overseas. Goose Squadron, as it was to become known, was initially based at RAF Lindholme in Yorkshire, England, and equipped with Handley Page Hampdens. During the war, the Goose Squadron converted aircraft several times. No 408 would change from Hampden aircraft to the Halifax, and then to the Lancaster in August 1943 after moving to RAF Linton-on-Ouse and becoming part of No. 6 Group. It flew 4,610 sorties and dropped 11,340 tons of bombs. A total of 170 aircraft were lost and 933 personnel were killed, listed as missing in action (MIA) or prisoners of war (POW). Squadron members won two hundred decorations, and 11 battle honours for its wartime operations. On 5 September 1945 No 408 Squadron was officially disbanded. On 10 January 1949, Goose Squadron was reformed at RCAF Station Rockcliffe, Ontario. Equipped with eight Lancaster Mark X photographic aircraft, it was tasked with the mapping of Canada, specifically the far North. In 1962, the squadron formed a flight of Canadair CT-133 Silver Star aircraft and given the additional task of photo reconnaissance missions in support of Army exercises. On February 29, 1964, the Lancaster aircraft were retired and replaced with Dakotas. The Goose Squadron was moved to Rivers, Manitoba, and re-designated as a transport support and area reconnaissance squadron. On May 1, 1964, RCAF Station Rivers Transport Support Flight with its C-119 Boxcars was transferred into 408 Squadron. In 1965, the Boxcars were replaced by CC-130 Hercules aircraft. As the decade drew to a close, 408 Squadron was once again redesignated. On October 1, 1968, it started its long history with 10 Tactical Air Group as a \\"Tactical Fighter Squadron\\". During this post-war era, the squadron flew seven different aircraft: the Lancaster, Cansos, Norseman, Dakotas, Boxcars, T-33s, and Hercules aircraft. Late in 1970, the squadron was once more disbanded. On January 1, 1971, 408 Squadron was once again re-activated at Namao in Edmonton, Alberta, as a tactical helicopter squadron (THS) and equipped with CH-135 Twin Huey and CH-136 Kiowa helicopters. Its primary tasking is to provide tactical aviation to the army. The mission includes air mobile assault, air ambulance, air observation, reconnaissance insertions, troop movement, airborne command and control platform and dropping paratroopers. In September 1996, the squadron was re- equipped with CH-146 Griffon helicopters. Personnel from 408 Squadron deployed to Afghanistan nearly continually from 2006 until 2011. Initially forming a Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (TUAV) detachment using the CU-161 Sperwer. From 2008, 408 members were deployed to Kandahar airfield operating the CH-146 Griffon and CH-147D helicopters as part of the Joint Task Force Afghanistan Air Wing. The primary role of the JTF-A Air Wing was to provide transportation, reconnaissance, armed escort, and fire support to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). In July of 2018, 408 THS deployed to Mali as part of Task Force Mali on Operation Presence. In Mali, 408 THS operated the CH-146 Griffon in the armed escort role, providing support to MEDEVAC and utility missions. 408 THS completed its tour in Mali in January of 2019, having participated in 7 medical evacuation missions  Aircraft  * Handley Page Hampden * Handley Page Halifax B Mk II, III, V, VII * Avro Lancaster Mk II, X * Consolidated PBY Canso * Noorduyn Norseman * Canadair CT-133 Silver Star * Douglas Dakota * Fairchild C-119 Boxcar * Lockheed CC-130 Hercules * Bell CH-135 Twin Huey * Bell CH-136 Kiowa * Bell CH-146 Griffon Images File:408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron.jpg|408 Squadron hangar exterior, 2011 File:CH-135139TwinHuey01A.JPG|Bell CH-135 Twin Huey serving with 408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron on Exercise RV85 during 1985 File:408SqnFieldRV83.JPG|408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron Headquarters on Exercise RV83, Camp Wainwright, 1983 File:BellCH136Kiowa01.JPG|Bell CH-136 Kiowa of 408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron Camp Wainwright 1984 File:Canadair CT-133 Silver Star, older RCAF colour at the Alberta Aviation Museum.JPG|Canadair CT-133 Silver Star, older RCAF colours at the Alberta Aviation Museum Badges Image:408SqnCrest.JPG408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron official badge c. 1985 Image:408SqnBadge.JPG|408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron unofficial badge from c. 1950‚Äì85 Image:408SqnAnniversary.JPG|408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron unofficial 40th anniversary badge worn 1981‚Äì83 Image:408LOHFltBadge.JPG|408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron LOH Flight badge worn by CH-136 Kiowa crews c. 1990.

Today's name is an adaptation of the original name: Zent Maria ‚Äì Samaria ‚Äì Somoria ‚Äì ≈†amor√≠n. Geography The town is located on the Danubian Flat on ≈Ωitn√Ω ostrov island, near the Gabƒç√≠kovo dam on the Danube. It is located around southeast of Bratislava and west of Dunajsk√° Streda. Administratively, the town belongs to the Trnava Region, Dunajsk√° Streda District. History The oldest artifacts indicating the settlement of the area are dated to the Neolithic and Eneolithic Period. The settlement of the location is documented also for the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. Later archaeologic research (2008) uncovered artifacts from the Early and High Middle Ages (remnants of settlements, dwellings, farm buildings). After the Mongol invasion, the village was settled by German \\"guests\\" who had the leading role in the town administration. The German minority was given a royal privilege to apply Pressburg Law (now Bratislava) and lived in the town until the end of the Middle Ages. The presence of other ethnic groups like Pechenegs and Sz√©kelys is also documented. The settlement was a prominent port on the Danube during the Middle Ages and the market center of Rye Island. Agriculture also played a major role in the town's development. As a result of this prosperity, its citizens enjoyed a brisk trade in the new technologies and many shipyards on the Danube. However, with rise of Pressburg, the importance of the town began declining. ≈†amor√≠n eventually lost its right to the status of royal free city granted in 1405 during the reign of Hungarian King Sigismund. In the sixteenth century, the city became notable again because of the witch trials held there. After the Austro-Hungarian army disintegrated in November 1918, Czechoslovak troops occupied the area, later acknowledged internationally (contested by Hungary) by the Treaty of Trianon.

Description Close-up of head in Everglades National Park Florida panthers are spotted at birth, and typically have blue eyes. As the panther grows, the spots fade and the coat becomes completely tan, while the eyes typically take on a yellow hue. The panther's underbelly is a creamy white, and it has black tips on the tail and ears. Florida panthers lack the ability to roar, and instead make distinct sounds that include whistles, chirps, growls, hisses, and purrs. Florida panthers are average-sized for the species, being smaller than cougars from colder climates, but larger than cougars from the neotropics. Adult female Florida panthers weigh , whereas the larger males weigh . Total length is from and shoulder height is .WEC 167/UW176: Jaguar: Another Threatened Panther. Edis.ifas.ufl.edu.

Male panthers, on average, are 9.4% longer and 33.2% heavier than females because males grow at a faster rate than females and for a longer time. Taxonomic status It was described as a distinct cougar subspecies (Puma concolor coryi) in the late 19th century. The Florida panther has long been considered a unique cougar subspecies, with the scientific name Felis concolor coryi proposed by Outram Bangs in 1899. A genetic study of cougar mitochondrial DNA showed that many of the purported cougar subspecies described in the 19th century are too similar to be recognized as distinct. It was reclassified and subsumed to the North American cougar (P. c. couguar) in 2005. Despite these findings, it was still referred to as a distinct subspecies P. c. coryi in 2006. In 2017, the Cat Classification Taskforce of the Cat Specialist Group revised the taxonomy of Felidae, and now recognises all cougar populations in North America as P. c. couguar. Diet The Florida panther is a large carnivore whose diet consists both of small animals, such as hares, mice, and waterfowl, and larger prey such as storks, white-tailed deer, feral pigs, and American alligators. The Florida panther is an opportunistic hunter, and has been known to prey on livestock and domesticated animals, including cattle, goats, horses, pigs, sheep, dogs, and cats.. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Last Retrieved 2017-07-14 When hunting, panthers shift their hunting environment based on where the prey base is. Female panthers frequently shift both their home range and movement behavior due to their reproductive rates. Early life A collared juvenile cubs Panther kittens are born in dens created by their mothers, often in dense scrub. The dens are chosen based on a variety of factors, including prey availability, and have been observed in a range of habitats. Kittens will spend the first 6‚Äì8 weeks of life in those dens, dependent on their mother. In the first 2‚Äì3 weeks, the mother spends most of her time nursing the kittens; after this period, she spends more time away from the den, to wean the kittens and to hunt prey to bring to the den. Once they are old enough to leave the den, they hunt in the company of their mother. Male panthers are not encountered frequently during this time, as female and male panthers generally avoid each other outside of breeding. Kittens are usually 2 months old when they begin hunting with their mothers, and 2 years old when they begin to hunt and live on their own. Threats The Florida panther has a natural predator, the American alligator. Humans also threaten it through poaching and wildlife control measures. Besides predation, the biggest threat to their survival is human encroachment. Historical persecution reduced this wide-ranging, large carnivore to a small area of south Florida. This created a tiny, isolated population that became inbred (revealed by kinked tails and heart and sperm problems). Two young panthers at White Oak in Nassau County, Florida The two highest causes of mortality for individual Florida panthers are automobile collisions and territorial aggression between panthers. When these incidents injure the panthers, federal and Florida wildlife officials take them to White Oak Conservation in Yulee, Florida, for recovery and rehabilitation until they are well enough to be reintroduced. Additionally, White Oak raises orphaned kittens and has done so for 12 individuals. Most recently, an orphaned brother and sister were brought to the center at 5 months old in 2011 after their mother was found dead in Collier County, Florida. After being raised, the male and female were released in early 2013 to the Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area and Collier County, respectively. Primary threats to the population as a whole include habitat loss, habitat degradation, and habitat fragmentation. Southern Florida is a fast-developing area, and certain developments such as Ave Maria near Naples, are controversial for their location in prime panther habitat. Fragmentation by major roads has severely segmented the sexes of the Florida panther, as well. In a study done between 1981 and 2004, most panthers involved in car collisions were found to be male. However, females are much more reluctant to cross roads. Therefore, roads separate habitat, and adult panthers. Development, as well as the Caloosahatchee River are major barriers to natural population expansion. While young males wander over extremely large areas in search of an available territory, females occupy home ranges close to their mothers. For this reason, panthers are poor colonizers and expand their range slowly despite occurrences of males far away from the core population. =Disease= Antigen analysis on select Florida panther populations has shown evidence of feline immunodeficiency virus and puma lentivirus among certain individuals. The presence of these viruses is likely related to mating behaviors and territory sympatry. Although, since Florida panthers have lower levels of the antibodies produced in response to FIV, consistently positive results for the presence of infection is difficult to find. In the 2002‚Äì2003 capture season, feline leukemia virus was first observed in two panthers. Further analysis determined an increase in FeLV-positive panthers from January 1990 to April 2007. The virus is lethal, and its presence has resulted in efforts to inoculate the population. While no new cases have been reported since July 2004, the virus does have potential for reintroduction. In August 2019, Florida's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission identified, through the use of game cameras, eight endangered panthers affected by an apparent neurological disorder, but were unable to identify any potential infectious diseases that can affect felines and other species. =Chemicals= Exposure to a variety of chemical compounds in the environment has caused reproductive impairment to Florida panthers. Tests show that the differences between males and females in estradiol levels are insignificant, which suggests that males have been feminized due to chemical exposure. Feminized males are much less likely to reproduce, which represents a significant threat to a subspecies that already has a low population count and a high level of inbreeding. Chemical compounds that have created abnormalities in Florida panther reproduction include herbicides, pesticides, and fungicides such as benomyl, carbendazim, chlordecone, methoxychlor, methylmercury, fenarimol, and TCDD. =Genetic depletion= The Florida panther has low genetic diversity due to a variety of environmental and genetic factors. Factors that include habitat destruction contributed to the formation of a distinct and isolated subspecies of puma in the Florida panther. Isolation was followed by a gradual decline in the population size that increased the likelihood of inbreeding depression. The lower genetic diversity and higher rates of inbreeding led to the increased expression of deleterious traits in the populations, resulting in lower overall fitness of the Florida panther population. This also lowers the adaptive capacity of the population and increases the likelihood of genetic defects such as cryptorchidism and other complications to the heart and immune system. Specifically concerning the Florida panther, one of the morphological consequences of inbreeding was a high frequency of cowlicks and kinked tails. The frequency of exhibiting a cowlick in a Florida panther population was 94% compared to other pumas at 9%, while the frequency of a kinked tail was 88% as opposed to 27% for other puma subspecies. To increase genetic diversity of the Florida panther, eight Texas pumas were introduced to the Florida population to hopefully promote the survival of the native population. The results indicated that the survival rates of hybrid kittens were three times higher than those of purebred pumas. Due to the successes of this restoration effort, the genetic depletion of the Florida panther population is now not as much of a problem as it used to be, but ought to be monitored since the population is still in a fragile state. =Vehicular collisions= A roadside traffic sign on Daniels Parkway in Fort Myers, Florida warning drivers to keep alert for any panthers that may be crossing the road. Florida panthers live in home ranges between 190 and 500 km2. Within these ranges are many roads and human constructions, which are regularly traveled on by Florida panthers and can result in their death by vehicular collision. Efforts to reduce collisions with the Florida panther include nighttime speed reduction zones, special roadsides, headlight reflectors, and rumble strips. Another method of reducing collisions is the creation of wildlife corridors. Because wildlife corridors emulate the natural environment, animals are more likely to cross through a corridor rather than a road because a corridor provides more cover for prey and predators, and is safer to cross than a road. Conservation status Panther at Audubon's Possum Long Nature Center, Stuart, Florida, September, 1992 It was formerly considered critically endangered by the IUCN, but it has not been listed since 2008. Recovery efforts are currently underway in Florida to conserve the state's remaining population of native panthers. This is a difficult task, as the panther requires contiguous areas of habitat ‚Äì each breeding unit, consisting of one male and two to five females, requires about of habitat.Florida Panther Recovery Plan . The Florida Panther Recovery Team, South Florida Ecological Services Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Published 1995-03-13. Retrieved 2007-01-30. This animal is considered to be a conservational flagship because it is a major contributor to the keystone ecological and evolutionary processes in their environment. A population of 240 panthers would require of habitat and sufficient genetic diversity to avoid inbreeding as a result of small population size. However, a study in 2006 estimated that about were free for the panthers. The introduction of eight female cougars from a closely related Texas population has apparently been successful in mitigating inbreeding problems.Florida panther Section : Historic Range . . . U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceThe genetic rescue of the Florida panther, 2005 pdf, George Washington University One objective to panther recovery is establishing two additional populations within historic range, a goal that has been politically difficult. =Habitat Conservation= Habitat The conservation of Florida panther habitats is especially important because they rely on the protection of the forest, specifically hardwood hammock, cypress swamp, pineland, and hardwood swamp, for their survival. Conservations strategies for Florida panthers tend to focus on their preferred morning habitats. However, GPS tracking has determined that habitat selection for panthers varies by time of day for all observed individuals, regardless of size or gender. They move from wetlands during the daytime, to prairie grasslands at night. The implications of these findings suggest that conservation efforts be focused on the full range of habitats used by Florida panther populations. Female panthers with cubs build dens for their litters in an equally wide variety of habitats, favoring dense scrub, but also using grassland and marshland. =Management controversy= The Florida panther has been at the center of a controversy over the science used to manage the species. Strong disagreement has occurred between scientists about the location and nature of critical habitat. This, in turn, is linked to a dispute over management which involves property developers and environmental organizations. Recovery agencies appointed a panel of four experts, the Florida Panther Scientific Review Team (SRT), to evaluate the soundness of the body of work used to guide panther recovery. The SRT identified serious problems in panther literature, including poor citations and misrepresentation of data to support unsound conclusions.Beier, P; Vaughan, MR; Conroy, MJ and Quigley, H. 2003, An analysis of scientific literature related to the Florida panther: Submitted as final report for Project NG01-105 , Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Tallahassee, FL. A Data Quality Act (DQA) complaint brought by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility and Andrew Eller, a biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), was successful in demonstrating that agencies continued to use incorrect information after it had been clearly identified as such.Information Quality Guidelines: Your Questions and Our Responses. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Published 2005-03-21. Retrieved 2007-01-30. As a result of the DQA ruling, USFWS admitted errors in the science the agency was using and subsequently reinstated Eller, who had been fired by USFWS after filing the DQA complaint. In two white papers, environmental groups contended that habitat development was permitted that should not have been, and documented the link between incorrect data and financial conflicts of interest.Kostyack, J and Hill, K.

Today, Cain is mainly remembered for his very conservative and often highly-controversial views as a member of the Senate, and as a friend and supporter of Senator Joseph McCarthy, but that picture is incomplete. Prior to his term in the Senate, he had served as the progressive, even liberal, Mayor of Tacoma, Pierce County, Washington. Following his Senate term he was widely recognized as a defender of the civil liberties of individuals accused of being security risks during the Eisenhower Administration and as a community activist and moderate Republican until his death in 1979. Cain was an orator and a writer of exceptional ability noted for his colorful, if often convoluted, style of speaking. In a 1972 interview Cain described himself as being, \\"... basically a political pragmatist ‚Äì from time to time and for different reasons a conservative, militant, liberal, moderate, purist, radical and now and again what some call a populist.\\" Acknowledging that his career had been known for its inconsistencies, he said, \\"The record consists of doing the best I could when confronted by any situation demanding action.\\" Early life Harry Pulliam Cain and his twin brother were born in Nashville, Tennessee. Both parents were of Scots-Irish descent who had moved from Virginia, Alabama, and Kentucky. Their boys were taught a strong appreciation for their southern heritage and family history. The family moved to Tacoma in 1911. Both parents were accomplished writers. His mother suffered from depression and committed suicide in 1917. Shortly after her death, Cain suffered an attack of Bell's palsy crippling his ability to speak. Through great effort he re-trained himself to speak, gaining self- confidence in the process. Cain attended the Tacoma public schools and then, in 1920, enrolled at Hill Military Academy in Portland, Oregon, where he was a star athlete and edited the school newspaper. He spent 1924‚Äì1925 working as a reporter for the now-defunct Portland News-Telegram. For college, he decided to return to his southern roots, attending the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, graduating in 1929. At Sewanee, Cain was an honor student who studied modern and classical languages, literature, lettered in four sports, a varsity debater, and editor of the school's newspaper. His intellectual hero was the eighteenth-century British philosopher and statesman, Edmund Burke. Upon graduation he received an offer of work from The New York Times.Smith, Raising Cain, p. 21.  Career  Before moving to New York City, Cain visited his father in Tacoma but finding him in ill health, decided to remain. He was employed by the Tacoma branch of The Bank of California, N.A. (now Union Bank, N.A.) where he remained until 1939. When Tacoma was selected to host the 1939 Golden Jubilee Celebration, celebrating fifty years of Washington statehood, Cain was selected as its festival director. The success of the event led Cain to run for the non-partisan position of Mayor of Tacoma in a special election to complete the two-year term of the interim mayor who decided not to run again. A conservative Democrat, Cain voted twice for President Franklin Roosevelt but became disenchanted with the New Deal after 1936. Cain placed third in the primary election. Four days before the general election, the leading candidate died of a stroke and Cain's name was added to the ballot. The dead candidate's supporters backed Cain and he was elected mayor at the age of 34.Smith, \\"Hurry\\" Cain, p. 6. =Mayor of Tacoma= Cain's terms as mayor were characterized by his enthusiasm and very public approach to governing, including a weekly radio program that was uncommon for the time. His first term was also characterized by the build-up for World War II at the shipyards and military bases around Tacoma, and for the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. Following the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, Cain was one of only two elected officials on the West Coast to publicly oppose the government's internment of 110,000 Japanese. In 1942, Cain was re-elected mayor by the largest plurality in Tacoma's history. His second term was characterized by his aggressive efforts to clean up long-existing vice, to obtain funding for wartime housing, to institute a long-range planning process for the city, to reform the outdated City Commission form of government, and opposition from his fellow city commissioners to each of the above.Smith, Raising Cain, pp. 61‚Äì67. =World War II= He took a leave of absence in May 1943 to enter the United States Army as a Major. Following training at the Army's School of Military Government, Cain was assigned to Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories (AMGOT) in Algiers, Algeria. After field training in Sicily, Cain participated in the invasion of Italy, landing on the beachhead at Salerno, Italy attached to a glider regiment of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division on September 15, 1943. Cain was placed in charge of 29 towns and villages near Naples, Italy trying to meet the needs of starving displaced civilians caught between the two armies. Cain later served in various staff positions on the staff of the newly formed Allied Control Commission (ACC) and the Rome Area Command of the U.S. Fifth Army. He was present during the fighting for Monte Cassino and the invasion of Anzio, two of the bloodiest battles of the Italian campaign.Smith, The Contrarian, pp. 21‚Äì22.Smith, Raising Cain, pp. 75‚Äì85. In March 1944, Cain was assigned to SHAEF headquarters in London, England where he directed the psychological warfare and public relations division of the G-5 Civil Affairs staff. Promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, he worked with many famous writers and journalists including Archibald MacLeish and Edward R. Murrow. In April 1944, Cain was approached by political supporters in Washington state to run as a Republican for the open U.S. Senate seat in the 1944 election. Although Cain was unable to campaign actively, he won the Republican primary and faced popular Democratic Representative Warren G. Magnuson in the general election. Cain ran a respectable campaign, but fell behind in the final weeks of the campaign, losing to Magnuson by 88,000 votes.Smith, Raising Cain, pp. 88‚Äì103. While he was running for the Senate and carrying out his staff duties in London, the Invasion of Normandy and Operation Market Garden had taken place and Cain had missed both of them. He longed for an assignment in the field with a combat unit. In September, he was assigned to the XVIII Airborne Corps, commanded by Major General Matthew Ridgway, as Assistant Chief of Staff for Civil Affairs (G-5). During the Battle of the Bulge in December, Ridgway's Corps was instrumental in plugging the gap and Cain was in the thick of the fighting. Responsible for trying to protect and feed the civilians caught in the middle, Cain received a battlefield promotion to Colonel.Smith, Raising Cain, pp. 105‚Äì109. Cain participated in the planning for Operation Varsity, the elimination of the Ruhr Pocket, and the Allied push into Northern Germany. He was slightly wounded 24 hours before the end of hostilities on May 7, 1945. A day later, Cain delivered a speech at the burial of approximately 200 concentration camp victims near the town of Hagenow, Germany. General Ridgway remembered the speech in his memoirs as \\"one of the most effective I have ever heard.\\" Cain's last military assignment was inspecting General George S. Patton's controversial military government procedures during the military occupation of Bavaria.Smith, Raising Cain, pp. 110‚Äì116. =U.S. Senate= After the war, Cain resumed his duties as mayor of Tacoma, but resigned on June 15, 1946, to run again for the Senate. He was elected to the Senate on November 5, 1946, defeating Democrat Hugh B. Mitchell, an affable, competent, and decidedly uncharismatic campaigner who had recently been appointed to the position, by more than 60,000 votes. In this campaign Cain first began to raise the allegations of ties to Communist front organizations against Mitchell and other state Democrats. Cain served in the Senate from December 26, 1946, to January 3, 1953. He became associated with the midwestern, conservative bloc of the Republican Party led by Robert A. Taft and Arthur H. Vandenberg. His term was controversial and marked by often inflammatory rhetoric and positions on issues that were sometimes seen as being at odds with the best interests of his constituents. Cain later discussed his approach to serving in the Senate in a 1949 interview. \\"I had decided to listen only to my conscience and my instinct and do what seemed right at the time. Why not? A man in public office might as well play it the way he thinks he should. There is no sure way to stay in public office.\\" He voted for the Taft-Hartley Act, against a 70-group Air Force, against an expansion in Social Security benefits and generally against public power. He was generally considered to be the real estate industry's strongest supporter in Congress and once made an extended speech attacking Time Magazine for including him on a list of the \\"Senate's Most Expendable\\" members.Smith, Raising Cain, pp. 166‚Äì168. He engaged in two notable filibusters; the first a 6 ¬æ hour successful effort to block the nomination of former Washington Governor and Senator Mon C. Wallgren to be director of the National Security Resources Board,\\"Wallgren Unfit, Senator Declares,\\" New York Times, February 18, 1949. and a longer 12 ¬Ω hour unsuccessful effort to block an extension of federal rent controls.\\"12 Hours, 8 Minutes,\\" Time Magazine, June 19, 1950, 20. While in the Senate, he generally supported the efforts of Senator Joseph McCarthy and others to identify and dismiss government employees who were alleged to be Communist security risks. During the Korean War, he opposed the firing of General Douglas MacArthur and supported extending the war to the Chinese mainland.Smith, Raising Cain, pp. 178‚Äì185. As Cain's term in the Senate wound down, he was targeted by the National Democratic Party for defeat in what otherwise looked like a very promising Republican year. With Hugh Mitchell running for Governor, Cain's opponent would be the popular six-term Congressman, Henry M. Jackson. The two fought a tough, bruising campaign, based largely on Cain's record in the Senate. Jackson overcame a national Republican landslide to beat Cain by more than 130,000 votes. Cain once responded to a comment that he had been a 'reactionary' in the U.S. Senate. \\"... as a reactionary I reacted strongly against measures believed to be adverse to the public interest. It seldom bothered me that a number of my positions were supported only by a small minority. Had I been concerned with self rather than country I would have acted much differently. I was often angry and too impatient for my own good.\\"Harry P. Cain, letter to C. J. Skreen, December 9, 1971, C.M. Smith collection. =Subversive Activities Control Board= At the urging of some of his former Senate colleagues, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Cain to the Subversive Activities Control Board, where he served from 1953‚Äì1956. Cain went about his new duties, generally supporting the recommendations brought to the board by Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr.. Cain soon became aware of numerous cases in which the government's internal security program, while legal, often violated the civil liberties of the accused and sometimes denied them due process under the law. He began to speak out against what he believed to be the excesses of the program in a series of speeches to national civil liberties groups, to the point that Sherman Adams, White House Chief of Staff and members of the Justice Department considered him disloyal.L. Edgar Prina, \\"The Harry Cain \\"Mutiny\\", Collier's, September 2, 1955, 32‚Äì34. The Eisenhower Administration, under pressure from the right wing of their party, saw their internal security program as a means of eliminating security risks from government; Cain saw the program as often trampling on the civil rights of the accused. The confrontation came to a head in a contentious meeting between Cain and the President in the White House on June 7, 1955.Berman, Daniel N. \\"Cain and the President,\\" New Republic, June 25, 1956, 10‚Äì15. Cain determined that he would not to be re-appointed to the position and resigned on June 17, 1955. On October 23, 1956, a banquet in Cain's honor was held at the National Press Club and attended by more than 350 civil liberties advocates, labor leaders and political admirers, including many of the individuals who Cain had helped. A plaque was presented to Cain with the following inscription: \\"In Tribute to Harry P. Cain / Champion of Human Dignity, Defender of Constitutional Rights in the Search For National Security / From Those Whose Loyalty to Country He Vindicated, and Those Whose Faith in Freedom He Strengthened / Presented at Testimonial Dinner / National Press Club, Washington, D.C. / 23 October 1956.\\"\\"In Tribute to Harry P. Cain,\\" collection of messages of support presented at testimonial dinner, National Press Club, Washington, D.C., October 23, 1956, Candy Cain Tingstad collection. =Later career= Never wealthy, Cain returned to Tacoma with limited prospects and even less money. Both major parties found him unpredictable. To make matters worse, his marriage was unraveling. He lectured briefly at Yale University and looked for a job. He found it in Miami, Florida where old friends hired him to manage the public relations and, later, the community relations of a large Miami-based savings and loan association. In May 1957, he was called to testify at Arthur Miller's trial for contempt of Congress. He was Miller's \\"expert witness on communism\\" and he testified that he \\"did not believe\\" that Miller had written his plays \\"under the discipline of the Communist Party\\".\\"Miller Told Truth, Says Cain at Trial\\", Tacoma News Tribune, May 23, 1957. His testimony was unusual in that normally only the government produced 'expert testimony' to demonstrate that the defendant was a Communist. In January 1964 he testified in a libel trial brought on behalf of John Goldmark, a Washington state legislator who had been defeated partially on the basis of allegations that his membership in the ACLU was tantamount to being a member of a Communist- front organization. Cain testified that the ACLU had never been on the Attorney General's list of such organizations and Goldmark won a sizable award from the defendants. Cain became a familiar face on Miami television, hosting and interviewing national political personalities on a weekly public affairs program that the bank sponsored. He also became active in numerous community and civic activities. The Cains divorced in 1958. Later that year he married LaVonne Kneisley, a family friend since the mid-1930s.Smith, Raising Cain, pp. 261‚Äì265. He remained active in Republican politics and worked to liberalize and broaden the face of the party in Dade County and throughout the state. In 1962 he managed the congressional campaign of Republican newcomer Robert A. Peterson against Claude Pepper. Peterson lost, but Cain established himself as a viable political force in Florida. He considered running for the U.S. Senate in 1964 and again in 1968, but his moderate positions on social issues were in variance with the state party. He chaired the Florida Citizens for Johnson- Humphrey, the Democratic Party ticket, in 1964, but supported Nelson Rockefeller and then Richard Nixon in 1968 based on his opposition to the Vietnam War. In 1972, he supported his old opponent, Henry Jackson, for the Democratic presidential nomination and campaigned with him in Florida.Smith, Raising Cain, pp. 269‚Äì272. In 1972, Cain was appointed to the Metropolitan Miami-Dade County Commission. He championed one of the first indoor smoking bans in the country and other measures ensuring equal rights in jobs, housing and public accommodation. In failing health, he was defeated for re-election in 1976.  Personal life  He married Marjorie Dils of Seattle, Washington, in 1934. They had two children: Harry Jr. (Buzzy) and Candy. In 1935‚Äì1936, the couple took an extended trip to England and Germany, where they immersed themselves in theater and he studied British banking methods and listened to the colorful orators in London's Hyde Park. While in Germany, Cain attended several mass rallies where Adolf Hitler and other top Nazi leaders spoke and returned home convinced that Germany presented a major world threat, making more than 150 speeches to local and statewide groups about what he had seen.Smith, Raising Cain, pp. 28‚Äì37. = Death = He died of complications from emphysema at his home in Miami Lakes, Florida, on March 3, 1979. He was cremated and his ashes scattered on his favorite golf course in Bethesda, Maryland.Smith, Raising Cain, pp. 277‚Äì282.

Bonda culture The Bonda people are a tribal people who currently live in the hills of Odisha‚Äôs Malkangiri district in India. There are two different Bonda tribes: the Upper Bondas with a population of 6,700 who are the most isolated from mainstream Indian society, and the Lower Bonda with a population of 17,000. Upper Bondas have almost no connection to the outside world. Dambaru Sisha took the oath of office to become the first MLA{Member of legislative assembly} to the Bonda tribe, to which he traces his ancestry. Sisha attempts to protect the traditions and culture of the people while providing them with educational opportunities. Only 6% of Bondas are literate. The life expectancy of the tribe is so low they are nearly extinct.Ranjan Sahu, Priya. \\"Bondas, a Primitive Tribe in Odisha Hills, Get Their First MLA.\\" Points of View Reference Center. Hindustan Times, 24 May 2014. Web. 22 Oct. 2014. The unfree labour or Goti system in India is known as Gufam by the Bonda people. According to Pati, a male bonded labour is called Gufam-Rem whereas a female laborer is a Gufam-Boy. Bonda people are often led to bonded labour through marriage, also known as . A form of dowry (known as Gining) is paid for brides. In Gining items are used to determine how many arranged marriages will take place. For instance, the number of cows relies upon the social status of the girl. Bonda boys are expected to marry between the ages of 10 and 12. Although a man may pay the price of a bride for his brother, the brother must always return the amount owed.Pati, Rabindra Nath., and Jagannatha Dash. Tribal and Indigenous People of India: Problems and Prospects. New Delhi: A.P.H. Pub., 2002. Print. Divorce, also known as ‚ÄúLung Sisi‚Äù is also an issue within the Bonda people. In some extreme circumstances, such as if a Bonda woman is divorced for adultery, the former husband demands double the price that was paid for their marriage. The village council determines the severity of the case arrives at a decision based upon the number of cows given back. However, if a man is the one who caused the wrong which resulted in divorce, he can no longer get married through an arranged marriage system. When a death or mora occurs, it is custom to sacrifice a cow on the tenth day, a practice also known as ‚ÄúGaitang.‚Äù Population growth in the Bonda Hills in India led to forest habitat decrease although there existed a well-balanced ecosystem. Poverty, however, became a fundamental issue among the Bonda people due to social customs regarding obligatory marriages and deaths, along with myriad other socio-religious practices. These customs did not improve health condition nor economic status, which has created much poverty for them. For instance, crop production is hardly able to feed the population. In order to overcome starvation, the Bonda people, or Ku duburu Remo, often take out loans ( Kalantar or Badi) in order to eat. The loans are usually in cash and are taken from a community member or a figure that serves as a landlord Sakar Remo. Roughly 62 out of 245 households in the Bonda hills are in debt. Loans taken even in cash are charged interest rates, and these funds often provide payments for: bride prices, fines, and the performance of socio-religious rites. As a result, debt payment becomes difficult, with constant fines and interest rates being increased. Very often the Bonda people are led to debt bondage and are forced to liquidate assets such as: land, trees, animals, etc.  Remo, the Bonda language  The Bonda are a scheduled tribe of India and are also known as the Remo (meaning \\"people\\" in the Bonda language). The tribe is one of the oldest and most primitive in mainland India; their culture has changed little for more than a thousand years. They are one of the 75 Primitive Tribal Groups identified by the Government of India. Their isolation and known aggressiveness continue to preserve their culture despite the pressures of an expanding Indian population. Their language belongs to the Munda branch of the Austroasiatic language family. It is most closely related to the Gutob language.Ethnologue report on the Bonda language Realizing that the Bonda people were in a cultural decline, the Government of Orissa brought to life the Bonda Development Agency (BDA) in 1977. Despite the initiatives taken by the Bonda Development Agency since then, the literacy rates of the Bonda tribes remain one of the lowest, as low as 14 percent.Bonda Population on the Decline Two of the most important phonetic features that characterize the Bonda language are the glottal stop, which is a glottal plosive produced by the release of the breath behind the vocal chords, and checked consonants. Those sounds are also featured in Munda languages as a whole. It is the checked consonants k‚Äô and p‚Äô that occur in Bonda, found mostly in the final position of native words. The glottal stop, however, may occur initially in native words. In fact, the checked consonants k‚Äô and p‚Äô are pre-glottalized. The checked consonants behave differently in Bonda depending on whether they are followed by a vowel or another consonant. It has been found that when k‚Äô and p‚Äô are followed by a vowel their glottal stop remains, but they become the sounds g and b. It currently appears as though the Bonda k' is being fully replaced by the g sound. This may be a product of recent Bonda assimilation into contemporary Indian culture. It is resulting in the loss of one of the original Bonda sounds. Attire A semi clothed Bonda woman. The Bonda are generally semi-clothed, the women wear thick silver neck bands. The Bonda attire is explained in a legend relating to the Ramayana. According to it, some Bonda women chanced upon Sita who was bathing at a pond in the Bonda hills and, seeing her naked, they sniggered. Enraged, Sita cursed them to a life where they would be condemned to remaining naked and having their heads shaven. When the Bonda women pleaded forgiveness, Sita gave them a piece of cloth she tore off her sari. This explains, according to the legend, why Bonda women have shorn heads and wear only a , a length of cloth that covers the waist. Their torsos are covered in strings of colourful beads. Bonda women also wear metal rings that cover their necks and bangles on their arms. Since Bonda women hunt and forage for food in the forest it is thought that these ornaments have a function of protecting them from injuries and attacks by wild animals. Bonda women have their heads shaved and adorned with two types of headbands, called and . The is made of grass and the made of beads. Worn together the secures the by preventing the beaded headband from slipping off the woman's head. Bonda women wear metal bands adorning their necks, which are called and are made from aluminum. Including the bands around their neck, necklaces made of beads are also worn, these are called Mali. Due to the culture surrounding their cloth which covers the waist down, the and Mali act as a sort of clothing for the upper body of the women. Both men and women of the tribe wear earrings called made of brass, and rings on their fingers called made of aluminum. For bachelors or newly married men, it is customary to wear their own set of ornaments. Beginning at the ages of eight or nine, males will adorn their bodies with headbands called , bangles called , necklaces called , earrings called , and rings called . Once married, men typically do not continue to adorn their bodies with more ornaments.Kanungo, A. (2000). Bondo Costume Ornaments. Ornament, 23(4), 20. Gender roles A Bonda tribeswoman drinking rice wine. In Bonda society, the women enjoy a privileged position. They are the primary workers and providers of food for the community. This matriarchal dominance is also seen in the marital norms of the community. Bonda girls largely marry boys who are at least five to ten years younger than them. Thus the girl looks after her husband as he grows up and in turn he cares for his older wife. In contrast with many other populations in India, the number of women among the Bonda greatly exceeds the number of men. Among the men alcoholism is a major issue. They spend much time brewing and consuming liquor from rice, palm and the mahua flower. The Bondas are trained in using arms at a young age. This, coupled with rampant alcoholism and their reputation for a quick temper, has contributed to high rates of fratricide among them. The Bondas still use binnimaya pratha, or barter, and they customarily go to a market every Sunday. They like to put castor oil on their heads. The women make worli paintings in their homes Threats to Bonda culture The Government of Odisha has over the years tried to bring the Bonda into the mainstream and set up the Bonda Development Agency (BDA) in 1977 with this aim. Outside influences resulted in the Bondas being given new gods. The curriculum in the government school also seeks to inject this process through prayers and songs.Pati, Biswamoy. (1990). Koraput: Perceptions in a Changing Society. Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 25, No. 18/19 (May 5‚Äì12, 1990), pp. 986-988. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/4396254 The Bonda have begun to take up non traditional occupations as migrant labourers and as peons and clerks in government offices. This process of mainstreaming has however also had its fallout. Remo or Bonda has approximately 2,500 speakers in the Jayapur hills of Koraput. Despite the large number of speakers of a few Munda languages, bilingualism is widespread. At the present break-neck speed of assimilation, most Munda languages will not survive to the end of this century. All Munda language communities are under heavy demographic and socio-economic pressure to assimilate linguistically to the local Indo-Aryan majority language.van Driem, G. (2007). Endangered Languages of South Asia. Language Diversity Endangered, B. Matthias, ed. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter, 303-341. The Remo language is now an endangered tongue as more Bondas have taken to Odia as their primary language of communication. The absence of a script or text for Remo adds to the threat of its extinction. It is also feared that other indigenous knowledge of the Bondas will also become casualty to this emphasis on integrating them with Odia society. In response to threat of a cyclone on 12 October 2014, roughly 1,300 members of Bonda and Didai tribes living \\"in different villages under Mudulipada and Andrahal gram panchayats\\" have been moved to the Tribal Welfare Department which is managed by the Mudulipada Boys High School on Saturday. About 3,000 more would be moved to other schools and buildings near Bonda Hill if necessary. For those tribes staying in \\"thatched and kutcha houses\\" are being moved to cyclone shelters.

The film was directed by John Duigan and written by Dick Christie of Small Wonder-fame, and stars Elisabeth Shue as the title character, Aaron Eckhart as her older brother, and Jill Hennessy.  Plot  A 28-year-old autistic woman named Molly McKay has lived in an institution from a young age following her parents' death in a car accident. When the institution must close due to budget cuts, Molly is left in the care of her non-autistic older brother, Buck McKay, an advertising executive and perennial bachelor. Molly, who verbalizes very little and is obsessed with lining up her shoes in neat rows, throws Buck's life into a tailspin as she runs off her nurses and barges into a meeting at Buck's agency naked. Molly's neurologist, Susan Brookes, suggests an experimental surgery in which genetically modified brain cells are implanted into Molly's brain. While Buck initially balks at the suggestion, he finally consents to the surgery and Molly makes a gradual but miraculous \\"recovery\\", speaking fluidly and interacting with others in a normal way. Buck begins taking Molly to social events, like a production of Romeo and Juliet, a baseball game, and expensive dinners. However, after a few months, Molly's brain begins to reject the transplanted cells and she begins to regress into her former state. Both Molly and Buck must accept the eventual loss of Molly's \\"cure\\" and her regression to her previous state. In the final scene of the film, Buck accepts Molly's autism and vows to remain in Molly's life by creating a room for her at his home that looks just like the room she had at the institution. Cast Release The film earned US$17,650 during its theatrical run, on a budget of $21 million, making it a box office bomb. Believing the film was unlikely to be a success, the distributors Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer chose to cut their losses and eliminate the film's marketing budget. It was only released on a single weekend in twelve cinemas, in order to meet legal obligations. =Critical reception= Molly received mostly negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 14% \\"Rotten\\" approval from film critics, with a rating average of 3.4 out of 10. The consensus says, \\"Molly never really elevates above uninspired, cliche- ridden moments.\\" At Metacritic, Molly received a weighted mean rating of 21 out of 100 from film critics, consistently indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\", classified as a generally unfavorably reviewed film.

He was originally the noble lover of Brunhilda, the grandmother of and regent for King Theuderic II. She, however, desired to raise him to status in the kingdom and had him given the patricianship over the lands east of the Jura, whose duke, Wandalmar, had died in 604. She then conspired to do away with Berthoald, mayor of the palace, by sending him with only 300 men to the region of the Seine. Attacked by Clotaire II of Neustria's son, Merovech, and his mayor, Landric, Berthoald died in the ensuing battle when he realised that he had nothing to lose, for he was no longer safe at court. Protadius was appointed to succeed Berthoald, though the Chronicle of Fredegar remarks that he had the capabilities of his predecessor, but not his virtues. Perhaps frightened by the same schemes which had ensured his elevation, he undermined the nobility to secure his position and was an exceedingly cruel extortionist. His paramour Brunhilda pressured her grandson to go to war against her other grandson, Theudebert II of Austrasia, and Protadius was put in charge of the army. At the palace of Quierzy, Theuderic assembled the army, but the men did not want to fight their countrymen and the Duke of Alemannia, Uncelen, declared that the king ordered Protadius' death. Protadius was killed by the warriors and the king was forced to sign a treaty. Further reading *Oman, Charles. The Dark Ages 476-918. Rivingtons: London, 1914. *Selle-Hosbach, K.

Fumarase comes in two forms: mitochondrial and cytosolic. The mitochondrial isoenzyme is involved in the Krebs Cycle (also known as the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle [TCA] or the Citric Acid Cycle), and the cytosolic isoenzyme is involved in the metabolism of amino acids and fumarate. Subcellular localization is established by the presence of a signal sequence on the amino terminus in the mitochondrial form, while subcellular localization in the cytosolic form is established by the absence of the signal sequence found in the mitochondrial variety.FH (fumarate hydratase) This enzyme participates in 2 metabolic pathways: citric acid cycle, reductive citric acid cycle (CO2 fixation), and is also important in renal cell carcinoma. Mutations in this gene have been associated with the development of leiomyomas in the skin and uterus in combination with renal cell carcinoma.  Nomenclature  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon- oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-malate hydro- lyase (fumarate-forming). Other names in common use include: * fumarase * L-malate hydro-lyase * (S)-malate hydro-lyase  Structure  = Gene = The FH gene is localized to the chromosomal position 1q42.3-q43. The FH gene contains 10 exons. = Protein = Crystal structures of fumarase C from Escherichia coli have been observed to have two occupied dicarboxylate binding sites. These are known as the active site and the B site. The active site and B site are both identified as having areas unoccupied by a bound ligand. This so-called ‚Äòfree‚Äô crystal structure demonstrates conservation of the active- site water. Similar orientation has been discovered in other fumarase C crystal structures. Crystallographic research on the B site of the enzyme has observed that there is a shift on His129. This information suggests that water is a permanent component of the active site. It also suggests that the use of an imidazole-imidazolium conversion controls access to the allosteric B site. Function = Mechanism = Figure 1: Conversion of fumarate to S-malate. Figure 2: Conversion of fumarate to S-malate by fumarase through a carbanion intermediate. Figure 2 depicts the fumarase reaction mechanism. Two acid-base groups catalyze proton transfer, and the ionization state of these groups is in part defined by two forms of the enzyme E1 and E2. In E1, the groups exist in an internally neutralized A-H/B: state, while in E2, they occur in a zwitterionic A-/BH+ state. E1 binds fumarate and facilitates its transformation into malate, and E2 binds malate and facilitates its transformation into fumarate. The two forms must undergo isomerization with each catalytic turnover. Despite its biological significance, the reaction mechanism of fumarase is not completely understood. The reaction itself can be monitored in either direction; however, it is the formation of fumarate from S-malate in particular that is less understood due to the high pKa value of the HR (Fig. 1) atom that is removed without the aid of any cofactors or coenzymes. However, the reaction from fumarate to L-malate is better understood, and involves a stereospecific hydration of fumarate to produce S-malate by trans-addition of a hydroxyl group and a hydrogen atom through a trans 1,4 addition of a hydroxyl group. Early research into this reaction suggested that the formation of fumarate from S-malate involved dehydration of malate to a carbocationic intermediate, which then loses the alpha proton to form fumarate. This led to the conclusion that in the formation of S-Malate from fumarate E1 elimination, protonation of fumarate to the carbocation was followed by the additional of a hydroxyl group from H2O. However, more recent trials have provided evidence that the mechanism actually takes place through an acid-base catalyzed elimination by means of a carbanionic intermediate E1CB elimination (Figure 2). = Biochemical pathway = The function of fumarase in the citric acid cycle is to facilitate a transition step in the production of energy in the form of NADH. In the cytosol the enzyme functions to metabolize fumarate, which is a byproduct of the urea cycle as well as amino acid catabolism. Studies have revealed that the active site is composed of amino acid residues from three of the four subunits within the tetrameric enzyme. The primary binding site on fumarase is known as catalytic site A. Studies have revealed that catalytic site A is composed of amino acid residues from three of the four subunits within the tetrameric enzyme. Two potential acid-base catalytic residues in the reaction include His 188 and Lys 324. = Subtypes = There are two classes of fumarases. Classifications depend on the arrangement of their relative subunit, their metal requirement, and their thermal stability. These include class I and class II. Class I fumarases are able to change state or become inactive when subjected to heat or radiation, are sensitive to superoxide anion, are Iron II (Fe2+) dependent, and are dimeric proteins consisting of around 120 kD. Class II fumarases, found in prokaryotes as well as in eukaryotes, are tetrameric enzymes of 200,000 D that contain three distinct segments of significantly homologous amino acids. They are also iron-independent and thermal-stable. Prokaryotes are known to have three different forms of fumarase: Fumarase A, Fumarase B, and Fumarase C. Fumarase C is a part of the class II fumarases, whereas Fumarase A and Fumarase B from Escherichia coli (E. coli) are classified as class I.  Clinical significance  Fumarase deficiency is characterized by polyhydramnios and fetal brain abnormalities. In the newborn period, findings include severe neurologic abnormalities, poor feeding, failure to thrive, and hypotonia. Fumarase deficiency is suspected in infants with multiple severe neurologic abnormalities in the absence of an acute metabolic crisis. Inactivity of both cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of fumarase are potential causes. Isolated, increased concentration of fumaric acid on urine organic acid analysis is highly suggestive of fumarase deficiency. Molecular genetic testing for fumarase deficiency is currently available. Fumarase is prevalent in both fetal and adult tissues. A large percentage of the enzyme is expressed in the skin, parathyroid, lymph, and colon. Mutations in the production and development of fumarase have led to the discovery of several fumarase-related diseases in humans. These include benign mesenchymal tumors of the uterus, leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma, and fumarase deficiency. Germinal mutations in fumarase are associated with two distinct conditions. If the enzyme has missense mutation and in-frame deletions from the 3‚Äô end, fumarase deficiency results. If it contains heterozygous 5‚Äô missense mutation and deletions (ranging from one base pair to the whole gene), then leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma/Reed‚Äôs syndrome (multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis) could result.

KWDI: Korea Women's Development Institute According to a survey conducted by the Department of Urology at the Korea University College of Medicine in 2015, 23.1% of males and 2.6% of females, aged 18‚Äì69, had sexual experience with a prostitute. The sex trade involved some 94 million transactions in 2007, down from 170 million in 2002. The number of prostitutes dropped by 18% to 269,000 during the same period. The amount of money traded for prostitution was over 14 trillion won, much less than 24 trillion won in 2002. Despite legal sanctions and police crackdowns, prostitution continues to flourish in South Korea, while sex workers continue to actively resist the state's activities. History =Premodern era= Kisaeng, women from outcast or slave families who were trained to provide entertainment, conversation, and sexual services to men of the upper class. Before the modernization of Korea, there were no brothels, but a caste of the women for the elite landholding classes performed sexual labor. Modernization eliminated the Korean caste system. The first brothels in Korea began to spread after the country first opened its port in 1876 through a diplomatic pact, causing ethnic quarters for Japanese migrants to sprout up in Busan, Wonsan and Incheon. =1960s: US military= From the 1960s until today US camp town prostitution has existed outside US military bases (for example outside Camp Casey and Camp Stanley). This was the result of negotiation between the Korean government and the US military, involving prostitution for United States soldiers in camp towns surrounding the US military bases. The government registered the prostitutes, who were called Western princesses, and required them to carry medical certification. The US military police provided for the security in these US camp town prostitution sites, and detained the prostitutes who were thought to be ill, to prevent epidemics of sexually transmitted diseases. This government involvement was in the past motivated in part by fears that the American military, which protected South Korea from North Korea, would leave. Though US officials publicly condemn prostitution, they are perceived as taking little action to prevent it, and some locals suggest that US Army authorities prefer having commercial sex services available to soldiers. =2000s= In 2003, the Korean Ministry of Gender Equality announced that 260,000 women‚Äî1 of 25 of young Korean women‚Äîmay be engaged in the sex industry. However, the Korea Women's Development Institute suggested that from 514,000 to 1.2 million Korean women participate in the prostitution industry. In addition, a similar report by the Korean Institute of Criminology noted that 20% of men in their 20s pay for sex at least four times a month, with 358,000 visiting prostitutes daily. In 2004, the South Korean government passed an anti-prostitution law (Special Law on Sex Trade 2004) prohibiting the buying and selling of sex and shutting down brothels. Soon afterward, over 2,500 sex workers demonstrated in the streets to demand the repeal of the law, as they believed it threatened their livelihood. In 2006, the Ministry for Gender Equality, in an attempt to address the issue of demand for prostitutes, offered cash to companies whose male employees pledged not to pay for sex after office parties. The people responsible for this policy claimed that they want to put an end to a culture in which men get drunk at parties and go on to buy sex. In 2007 the government announced that sex tourism by Koreans would be made illegal, as well as Korean women going abroad to sell sex. The courts prosecuted 35,000 clients, 2.5 times higher than the number of those who were caught buying sex in 2003. Meanwhile, enforcement is weak and corruption problematic; there is little evidence that new legislation has made much difference, the trade simply finding other ways to carry on its business. However more men are being sent to \\"John School\\" for purchasing sex, while a 2010 investigation suggested that 20% of seniors seek out sex workers. Range of services Following the enactment of the Special Law in 2004, there was a crackdown on red-light districts; while many of the brothels in those areas were forced to close, the crackdown went as quickly as it came, with the result that prostitution was driven more underground but also became a more competitive business with lower prices and more services. Red light districts in South Korea can compare to those of Amsterdam and Germany. The four main red light districts in South Korea prior to the Special Law are Cheongnyangni 588, Yongsan Station, and Mia-ri in Seoul and Jagalmadang in Daegu. While not all of them are operating to full capacity, some still exist while being tolerated not only due to the vast amount of money that is involved in the business, but also in an attempt to control the sex industry. Other sexual services include Í∞ÄÌÉù ÎßàÏÇ¨ÏßÄ (gataek massaji), an \\"in-call\\" massage where the customer would travel or meet at the masseuse's home or quarters; ÌÇ§Ïä§Î∞© (kiss bang), rooms where customers pay to french kiss and fondle women; and Ï∂úÏû• ÎßàÏÇ¨ÏßÄ (chuljang massaji) or an \\"out-call\\" massage where the masseuse travels to the customer's place, love motel, hotel, or another disclosed location. Teen prostitution According to a 2012 study by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, 3% of runaway youths have been exposed to prostitution, either as a buyer or a prostitute. There have been reported cases of runaway girls who sell sex over internet chat, and live with \\"families\\" in jjimjilbang, or bathhouses, with fellow runaway girls. According to United Voice for Eradication of Prostitution, these teen prostitutes are exposed to such crimes as rape and diseases as syphilis. Recidivism is common, with over half of the girls counseled by the Voice returning to the sex trade, often because of blackmail from former pimps and social ostracism from future husbands and families. In contrast to teen prostitution, women in their 50s, 60s, even their 70s called Bacchus Ladies are engaged in prostitution in a park near the Jongno-3 subway station in the heart of Seoul. Sex trafficking Warning of Prostitution and Human trafficking by United States Forces Korea Though as recently as 2004 the government received low marks on the issue, in recent years the government has made significant strides in its enforcement efforts. Human trafficking was outlawed and penalties for prostitution increased; the 2004 Act on the Prevention of the Sex Trade and Protection of its Victims was passed, toughening penalties for traffickers, ending deportation of victims, and establishing a number of shelters for victims. As of 2005 there were 144 people serving jail time for human trafficking. A US Immigration official conceded in 2006 that \\"There's a highly organized logistical network between Korea and the United States with recruiters, brokers, intermediaries. A Los Angeles police spokesman said that about 90% of the department's 70‚Äì80 monthly arrests for prostitution involve Korean women and Los Angeles police estimates that there are 8,000 Korean prostitutes working in that city and its suburbs. Korean women\`s customers in foreign countries are mostly Korean men. A US State Department report titled, \\"Trafficking in person's report: June 2008\\", states that in \\"March 2008, a joint operation between the AFP and DIAC broke up a syndicate in Sydney that allegedly trafficked South Korean women to a legal brothel and was earning more than $2.3 million a year. Police allege the syndicate recruited Korean women through deception about the conditions under which they would be employed, organized their entry into Australia under false pretenses, confiscated their travel documents, and forced them to work up to 20 hours a day in a legal Sydney brothel owned by the syndicate.\\" The US State Department report also states that the South Korean government \\"fully complies with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking\\". In 2012, the government continued law enforcement efforts against sex trafficking, and signed MOUs for the Employment Placement System (EPS) with five additional countries and conducted numerous anti-trafficking awareness campaigns. The Korean National Police Agency also cooperated with foreign law enforcement agencies to crack down on human smuggling networks. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks South Korea as a 'Tier 1' country. Foreign prostitutes in South Korea South Korea is both a source and destination country for human trafficking. The agencies use high salaries to lure young girls to go to Korea and once they arrive they are forced to work as sex slaves. =China= Trafficking in Persons Report of the U.S. State Department has mentioned in many occasions that Chinese women are engaged in prostitution in South Korea. The report describes that they are issued a formal visa and are engaged in sexual services and sometimes they are sold as international marriage bribes and are now sexual workers. According to MINISTRY OF JUSTICE REPUBLIC OF KOREA as of 2016,There are 212,115 Chinese women(Han Chinese) staying in Korea. According to ‚ÄúSurvey for the migrant women employed in the entertainment business in Korea‚Äù presented by Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, it is reported that the largest number of women engaged in commercial sex for South Korean men can be found in Han Chinese women. According to MBC, the public broadcasting company of Korea, 80% of massage businesses in South Korea correspond to commercial sex establishments where Chinese women work. In 2012, 240 Chinese women were arrested for having prostituted in the massage parlors in Korea. The South Korean newspaper ‚ÄúThe Dong-a Ilbo‚Äù reveals that sex workers in the so-called ‚ÄúÌú¥Í≤åÌÖî‚Äù are all composed of Chinese women (Han Chinese and Ethnic Korean Chinese) except ‚ÄúGangnam‚Äù area. As of 2018, female students from China staying in South Korea reach 41,957 and many of them are caught by the press and reported as sexual workers. Chinese women are engaged in prostitution through the country of South Korea such as Seoul, Incheon, Suwon, Pyeongtaek, Yongin, Siheung, Bucheon, Paju, Uijeongbu, Ansan, Anyang, Cheongju, Dangjin, Cheonan, Daejeon, Asan, Daegu, Busan, Gyeongju, Ulsan, Gwangyang, Changwon, Gangwon Province, Jeolla Province and Jeju Island. Chinese women engaged in prostitution practice their commercial sex not only in the cities but also in the rural areas of which the administrative unit corresponds to town and township. =Thai= According to the Justice Ministry, increasing numbers of Thai women are drawn to illegal \\"massage work\\" in the ROK. It estimates that the number of illegal Thai residents soared from 68,449 in 2017 to 122,192 in August 2018. Of the 60,000 who are women, some 50,000 are believed to be working in massage parlors, some of them fronts for prostitution. The owner of one Thai massage parlor in Gangnam said, \\"Even if I try to run a legitimate business, I have no idea what happens in the room between a client and a masseuse who wants to make more money.\\" Massage parlors are illegal in Korea unless operated by blind people, but around 50,000 offer foot massage, sports massage, and acupressure. They employ some 300,000 workers. =Ukrainian= According to multiple reports the Ukrainian sex-workers are the second largest group of foreign women involved into prostitution outside the US military bases in Republic of Korea. =Russian= Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, young Russian girls have been commonly seen in the red-light districts of Korea. They can be found in the bars, strip clubs and coffee shops for entertaining the customers. Between January 2000 and March 2001, approximately 6,000 Russian women entered Korea through Busan port and Gimpo. In 2000, 3,064 Russians entered South Korea on E-6 visas, 2,927 of them women (Jhoty, 2001) With the collapse of the Soviet Union, thousands of Russian migrated to Korea to work as entertainers while others forced into prostitution for both American soldiers and Korean civilian men. Many Korean men actively seek out Russian women because they satisfy not only their desire for dominance over exotic females but also the latent psychological need to overcome their complex.Asian Survey, Volume 48.University of California Press, 2008 - East Asia South Korean sex tourists in foreign countries =China= During the Autumn symposium held at Sinyang Humanities Hall of Seoul National University organized by Korean Association of Women's Studies, Jung Jae-won, a senior researcher of Institute for Gender Research of Seoul National University presented the survey results regarding current state of purchase of sexual services practiced by Korean men abroad. According to the survey presentation regarding ‚Äúinternational expansion of Korean-type sex industry and commercial sex culture,‚Äù Korean men buy sex with Chinese prostitutes all over China. It is estimated that there are more than 100 brothel(KTV) exclusively for South Korean men in Qingdao of China, which is the example of this city only. The survey shows that some brothel(KTV) for Korean men has each 150-300 Chinese women engaged in commercial sex. It is reported that a brothel(KTV) of Shanghai where South Korean men are regular customers has more than 500 Chinese prostitutes. In 2007 it was reported that there were 33 online web sites linking Korean men to Chinese prostitutes. Many Korean men have used sex tour in groups with friends and co-workers. In 2013, the Korea Tourism Association filed a complaint with the police against some Internet site for arranging sex service by Chinese prostitutes for Korean men in China. According to the 'Center for Women's Human Rights' , Korean high school students have bought Chinese prostitutes for sex while on a school field trip to China. South Korean men continue to be a major source of demand for child sex tourism in China. =Southeast Asia= South Korean men continue to be a major source of demand for child sex tourism in both Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.Trafficking in Persons Report 2017 By Office of the Undersecretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Ri Child prostitutes in Southeast Asian countries were reportedly patronized mainly by South Korean men, who outstrip Japanese and Chinese as the most numerous sex tourists in the region, with the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand mainly seeing South Korean men using child prostitutes. Korean prostitutes in foreign countries The South Korean government has expressed concern over its citizens engaging in prostitution in foreign countries like Australia and the United States. =Australia= Many South Korean women are trafficked to Australia to work as prostitutes with more than a thousand Korean women in the Australian sex industry. =United States= Thousands of South Korean women are trafficked to the United States to work as prostitutes in massage parlors. American authorities arrested hundreds of Korean women for prostitution in the five years leading up to 2011, with the 2008 Korea-US Visa Waiver Program leading to an additional increase in the number of Korean prostitutes in America. translated by Heesook Choi from The number of people who operate with trafficking rackets to ship Korean women into the sex trade in America reaches into the thousands. =China and Taiwan= Korean prostitutes worked in Taiwan during the Japanese colonial period.

The algorithm was proposed by Shing-Tsaan Huang in 1989 in the Journal of Computers. Termination detection The basis of termination detection is in the concept of a distributed system process' state. At any time, a process in a distributed system is either in an active state or in an idle state. An active process may become idle at any time but an idle process may only become active again upon receiving a computational message. Termination occurs when all processes in the distributed system become idle and there are no computational messages in transit. Algorithm Huang's algorithm can be described by the following: * Initially all processes are idle. * A distributed task is started by a process sending a computational message to another process. This initial process to send the message is the \\"controlling agent\\". ** The initial weight of the controlling agent is w (usually 1). * The following rules are applied throughout the computation: ** A process sending a message splits its current weight between itself and the message. ** A process receiving a message adds the weight of the message to itself. ** Upon becoming idle, a process sends a message containing its entire weight back to the controlling agent and it goes idle. ** Termination occurs when the controlling agent has a weight of w and is in the idle state. Some weaknesses to Huang's algorithm are that it is unable to detect termination if a message is lost in transit or if a process fails while in an active state.

The 2,592 m high Pico Almanzor is its highest summit. The Central System is located just north of the 40th parallel and its ranges divide the drainage basin of the Tagus from the basin of the Douro. Description The Sistema Central is a primary feature of the Meseta Central, the inner Iberian plateau, splitting the meseta into two parts. The Sistema Central runs in an ENE - WSW direction roughly along the southern border of the Spanish autonomous community of Castile and Le√≥n and Extremadura continuing into the Guarda and Castelo Branco districts in Portugal. Unlike the neighboring Sistema Ib√©rico, the Sistema Central range is a quite homogeneous system. It consists of several ranges that formed 25 million years ago as part of the Alpine orogeny. The major mountain ranges are the Sierra de Guadarrama, which runs approximately along the border of the Madrid and Castile and Le√≥n autonomous communities, the Sierra de Gredos north of the border between Castile and Le√≥n and Castile-La Mancha stretching into Extremadura and containing the range's highest mountain, Pico Almanzor, at 2,592 m, as well as the Serra da Estrela, containing the highest point in continental Portugal, A Torre, 1,993 m. Other notably large ranges are Sierra de Gata and Sierra de Ayll√≥n. The Central System links with the Sistema Ib√©rico at its eastern end through the Sierra de Pela, the Altos de Barahona and Sierra Ministra, the latter already fully part of the Iberian System.Introducci√≥n al estudio del espacio geogr√°fico soriano \\"Sistema Central\\" is a widely known academic geographical term.

Pr√ºtzmann had become quite a radical soldier as a result of his Freikorps experiences. Since his own personal goals did not match the milder thinking found in the SA, he left the organization in 1930 and transferred to the SS; one of his first command assignments was as the F√ºhrer of the 18th SS-Standarte. As of this point in time, Pr√ºtzmann's career began a steep rise. While a member of the Reichstag, he was appointed SS-Brigadef√ºhrer in November 1933, and in February 1934 he was promoted to the rank of SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer. At the same time, Pr√ºtzmann was appointed Leader of the SS Upper Division Southwest in Stuttgart. From March 1937 until May 1941, Pr√ºtzmann led the SS Upper Division Northeast whose headquarters were in K√∂nigsberg (now Kaliningrad). World War II By April 1941, Pr√ºtzmann had been appointed Generalleutnant (Lieutenant General) of the Police. From June until October 1941, he was H√∂herer S.S. und Polizeif√ºhrer (Higher SS and Police Leader) of Russia-North, the post being responsible for internal security and combatting partisans. He held the same position in Ukraine and Russia-South until the summer of 1944. He also commanded Kampfgruppe \\"Pr√ºtzmann\\" in Ukraine during the early summer of 1944, and was awarded with the German Cross in Gold for his actions. =Role in the Latvia Holocaust= The Riga Ghetto in 1942. Pr√ºtzmann was responsible for setting up this ghetto. Most of its inhabitants were killed in the Rumbula massacre. From June to November 1941, Pr√ºtzmann held the post of Higher SS and Police Leader (HSSPF) for Latvia. Effectively this gave him control of Latvia, shared with Hinrich Lohse. In Latvia killing of Jews and other persons began almost immediately, and at first they were primarily conducted by a mobile killing group (Einsatzgruppe A). In late July 1941, Einsatzgruppe A moved out of Latvia, and primary responsibility for organizing the murder of Jews then moved to the Latvian office of the SD (Sicherheitsdienst, or Security Service.) As HSSPF Latvia, Pr√ºtzmann was in charge of the SD and the person responsible for implementing the Final Solution in Latvia.Ezergailis, Andrew, The Holocaust in Latvia 1941-1944 -- The Missing Center, pp. xix, 6, 153, 206, 208, 225, 240, 264,347, Historical Institute of Latvia (in association with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum) Riga 1996 After the departure of Einsatzgruppe A, a dispute arose among the Nazi rulers of Latvia about their so-called \\"Jewish problem\\". One group, headed by Lohse, who was backed by Alfred Rosenberg, wanted to confine the Jews to ghettos, steal all their property, and work them as slave laborers in support of Germany's war effort. Heinrich Himmler, the overall head of the SD, and Pr√ºtzmann's ultimate boss, wanted the Jews of Latvia murdered right away. Up until November, 1941, the Lohse/Rosenberg faction had somewhat prevailed, and as a result \\"only\\" about 30,000 of Latvia's approximately 70,000 Jews had been killed by then. Unhappy with pace at which the SD was murdering people in Latvia, Himmler replaced Pr√ºtzmann in mid-November 1941 with Friedrich Jeckeln, an experienced murderer who in Ukraine had developed his own \\"Jeckeln system\\" of killing 10,000 or more people in a single day. Pr√ºtzmann was assigned to Ukraine. Pr√ºtzmann's precise role as HSSPF Latvia in the murders of Jews and other war crimes in Latvia has never been fully explained. He appears to have been something of a weakling in the struggles the Nazis were having between themselves. It is known that Pr√ºtzmann was responsible for forcing the Jews of Latvia into ghettos, which allowed them to be later more readily killed by Jeckeln and others. It is also known that when Jeckeln took over as HSSPF Latvia, Pr√ºtzmann among others reported to him that large numbers of Jews had already been killed. =Later career, arrest and suicide= In early 1942, Pr√ºtzmann was put in charge of SS units working on securing forced labor for the Durchgangsstrasse IV, a large project to built a road from Lemberg to Stalino (now Donetsk). One of his last promotions came in September 1944 when Pr√ºtzmann was appointed by Heinrich Himmler as Generalinspekteur f√ºr Spezialabwehr (General Inspector of Special Defense) and assigned the task of setting up the Werwolf force's headquarters in Berlin and organizing and instructing the force. Pr√ºtzmann had studied the guerrilla tactics used by Russian partisans while stationed in the occupied territories of Ukraine and the idea was to teach these tactics to the members of Operation Werwolf. As originally conceived, the Werwolf units were intended to be legitimate uniformed military formations trained to engage in clandestine operations behind enemy lines in the same manner as Allied Special Forces such as Commandos.Reitlinger, SS - Alibi of a Nation, pp. 148n and 445. In early 1945, under orders from Himmler, he directed the assassination of the Allied- appointed mayor of Aachen, Franz Oppenhoff. Shortly before the war ended, Pr√ºtzmann was captured by the Allies. He committed suicide while in custody, on 21 May 1945. In fiction In the 1972 Frederick Forsyth novel The Odessa File the head of ODESSA is given as SS General Richard Gl√ºcks who is determined to destroy the State of Israel nearly two decades after the end of World War II, while the head of ODESSA in Germany is a former SS Officer called the \\"Werwolf\\" who is implied to be Pr√ºtzmann. (If the real Gl√ºcks had still been alive he would have been 74 years old and Pr√ºtzmann would have been 62 in 1963).

It operates with a daytime/nighttime power of 1,000 watts. WKPT is one of the oldest radio stations in East Tennessee, first taking the airwaves in 1940. Programming WKPT (AM) broadcasts an all-sports-talk format featuring programming from ESPN Radio. Local programming features \\"Sports Magazine,\\" hosted by sports director Scott Gray, on Monday evenings. \\"Sports Magazine\\" has been a fixture on the station for more than two decades. WKPT (AM) has long been the home of Dobyns-Bennett (Kingsport) High School sports, heard on the flagship frequency of 1400 kHz and its translator at 94.3 FM. In the late 1980s, coverage of Science Hill (Johnson City) High School was added on 1590 kHz (the former WJSO, which broadcasts from nearby Jonesborough TN) and its translator at 97.7 FM. These broadcasts, featuring Tim Cable on play- by-play and Scott Gray on color analysis, have won state awards from the Associated Press. And in the early 1990s, Bristol coverage of Tennessee High School Sports was added on WOPI which has broadcast since 1929 (it was the Tri-Cities' first broadcast station) and is at 1490 kHz. WOPI employs a Bristol translator at 97.9 FM. WKPT has, for decades, featured live play-by- play sports of the University Of Tennessee/Knoxville (the \\"Vols\\" or \\"Big Orange\\") from the Vol Radio Network. This included the 1999 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl in which the Vols defeated the Florida State Seminoles 23-16 for the first BCS national championship. That game was the final football broadcast for 30-year announce team John Ward and Bill Anderson (Ward would announce the 1998-99 Vol men's basketball season before retiring; he did the basketball games solo). Sister stations WKPT, WOPI-1490 Bristol, and WKTP-1590 Jonesborough/Johnson City are owned by Holston Valley Broadcasting Corporation, a subsidiary of Glenwood Communications Corporation. Each carries a substantial amount of the same programming each week but breaks away for local sports, specialized programming, and other community events. Translators Holston Valley Broadcasting also operates television stations WKPT-TV 19 (Cozi TV) and WAPK-CD 36 (MeTV). Other radio stations in the chain include WTFM-FM, WMEV-FM, WVEK-FM and WRZK-FM (95.9 The Hog). The station was assigned the WKPT call letters by the Federal Communications Commission. History From its initial sign-on, in 1940, WKPT (AM) broadcast a full- service format of music, news, and play-by-play sports. WKPT promoted itself as \\"The Nation's Model Station\\" and was an NBC Radio Network affiliate. WKPT's studios were destroyed by fire in September 1946. New, expanded studios were formally opened in April 1948. Notable on-air personalities (a * indicates the personality is deceased) were: *Paul Overbay (early Program Director and announcer, dating back to virtually the station's 1940 beginnings); *Charlie Deming (read on about \\"The Gloom Chaser\\"); *Martin Karant (perhaps the most notable voice and the personality with whom the station was most closely identified); *Bill Freehoff (who became notable for his editorials and their simple close of \\"Think about it!\\"); *Bill Trailer; George DeVault (who started as a student announcer at age 14, and has served as President and CEO of Holston Valley Broadcasting Corporation for nearly four decades); George Sells (who later worked TV news in Detroit and other markets under his real name, and for ABC Radio News as \\"George Caldwell\\"); and *John Palmer (who later worked for NBC-TV on The Today Show and for PBS). Later personalities included: Bob Morris (went on to jobs at several notable Top-40 stations); Bob Lawrence (still employed in the market as a systems specialist or \\"IT guy\\"); Carl Swann (served in many capacities for WKPT, later became half of WTFM's first \\"male/female\\" morning show, \\"Carl & Jody,\\" and is now half of a talk morning show across the market); Ted Tate (who went on to work for the Voice Of America in Washington DC); *Doug Newton (took over mornings for a time after Charlie Deming's retirement, and was an identifiable play-by-play voice for many years); *Gordon Light (who went on to jobs at high-profile 50,000-watt stations including WLAC/Nashville and \\"The Big One\\" WLW/Cincinnati); *Mike Padgett (started radio at 15, came to WKPT at 16, became the station's \\"voice of the new young generation,\\" and was associated with the station for over 30 years); and Elva Marie (who still works for sister station WTFM in the midday slot). In the latter 1970s the station leaned more in a Top-40 direction and switched network affiliations to ABC, which meant Paul Harvey began to be heard on WKPT. In January 1986, when 100,000-watt sister station WTFM switched to adult contemporary music, WKPT took over WTFM's former beautiful music format. Later, in 1993, the station switched to adult standards from ABC Radio Networks. WKPT has a colorful programming past, as it broadcast full-service programming for more than 70 years prior to the beginnings of sports-talk. The music featured during the full-service years included big-band, swing, standards, adult contemporary, Top-40, instrumental beautiful music, and finally oldies. The early-morning show on WKPT was a unique experience for the station's first three decades, as it was hosted by Charles Preston \\"Charlie\\" Deming. The story that has been handed down through the years has it that the then-manager of the station was in Asheville, North Carolina in the early 1940s, heard Deming's rich baritone voice calling out bus arrivals, and arranged on the spot to move Deming to Kingsport and hire him. For about 30 years, multiple generations of Kingsporters awoke to \\"The Gloom Chaser,\\" which was used interchangeably to refer to Deming and to his show. One of his trademarks was to ask his listeners to \\"join him for a little coffee\\" and then audibly slurp from his mug. Deming's last day on the station was in late 1973, by which time he had cut back to Saturdays only. Charlie Deming died in 1974 in a significant \\"end- of-an-era\\" moment for WKPT. Since other local AM stations signed off at sunset for many years, WKPT would appeal to younger listeners beginning in the early evening. Some of the popular shows in this vein were \\"Rock-O-Rama\\" and \\"The Midnight Sun\\" (which featured Top-40 music and were hosted by Bob Morris, Bob Lawrence and others), and \\"A New Day\\" (which offered more progressive programming and was hosted by Ted Tate, Mike Padgett and others). Mike Padgett was a very exciting personality, joined the station in 1974 while still in high school, was one of the first staffers to enthusiastically bring a new and youthful energy to WKPT, and became the popular de facto \\"voice of the new young generation\\" for the station. Mike died in October 2017 at 59. WKPT has long been famous for beginning programming which goes on to enjoy long runs. One such program was the mid-morning offering \\"Housewife Serenade\\" hosted by longtime personality Martin Karant. It was on the air for three decades and was broadcast live, daily, from the now-defunct Oakwood Supermarket on Eastman Road. After Karant left the station in the early 1970s (he would return a decade later), \\"Housewife Serenade\\" was hosted to its conclusion by Doug Newton. (Newton, in addition to serving as an on-air personality, was a pivotal part of WKPT's live play-by-play sports until the 1980s.) In 1985, an attempt was made to re-create the \\"live-midmorning-show-from-a-grocery-store\\" concept as WKPT began \\"AM Kingsport\\" from Food City on Eastman Road, coincidentally only hundreds of feet from where Oakwood (host site of \\"Housewife Serenade\\") had been. \\"AM Kingsport\\" was initially hosted by Ohio native Judy Harrison for its first 2-1/2 years. It was then taken over by native East Tennessean Janet Johnson, who served for more than two decades. The show was renamed \\"AM Tri-Cities\\" in the late 1980s to reflect the fact that WKPT had begun simulcasting its signal to Johnson City TN (Bristol TN/VA was added in the early 1990s). The show saw only its third host when Johnson retired and former City-Of-Kingsport Transportation Director Dave Light took over. When the station changed formats to sports talk, more than 25 years after \\"AM Kingsport\\" had begun, the show (by this time originating from a new Food City in virtually the same location) was re-christened \\"The Dave Light Show.\\" Another longtime fixture on the station during its full-service years was the \\"Five-O'Clock Shadow Show,\\" a program designed to ease the post-WWII working listener home from work during the 5-pm hour. \\"The Shadow Show,\\" as it came to be affectionately known by the station and by listeners as well, was begun and hosted by Martin Karant, who would frequently sit his young son Kenneth on his lap, and they would read the newspaper comics on-air together. The elder Karant notably sang both the show's opening theme, which was custom- written for the program, and the closing theme, which was the standard tune, \\"Me And My Shadow.\\" The \\"Five O'Clock Shadow Show\\" was taken over, upon Karant's early-1970s departure from the station, by afternoon host Bob Lawrence, who would host the show for its remaining years until the late 1970s. A short-lived, though popular, show in the 1980s was \\"Live At Ciatti's\\" from Ciatti's Italian Ristorante' on North Eastman Road. The show was hosted by Martin Karant (who had returned to company employment in 1982) and featured live music and singing by Johnson City musician Glen Shell. Karant and Shell would take requests from patrons in the restaurant and by phone from listeners. The show lasted about three years; the restaurant has since closed. Martin Karant had a storied career with the WKPT stations (AM, FM beginning in 1948, and TV beginning in 1969). He was hired in 1942 at about age 24, served in virtually every management position the station had, and left in the early 1970s for a national position in Chicago with Elks International. (He had turned down an offer from NBC, preferring instead to work for WKPT.) He returned to the stations in 1982 to host the morning show on sister station WTFM, moved back to WKPT in 1986 when the stations swapped formats, and remained with the station until his retirement in 1998 at the age of 80. Martin Karant died in 2003, having turned 86, and was considered the last link to the station's storied early history. WKPT also aired noted syndicated programming during its full-service years. Among these were \\"American Top 40\\" hosted by Casey Kasem, \\"Dick Clark's Rock, Roll & Remember\\" hosted by Dick Clark, and \\"Al Mitchell's Rare & Scratchy Rock & Roll\\" hosted by Allen \\"Al\\" Mitchell (whose radio resume included a stint as Program Director of legendary powerhouse Top-40 station WOWO (AM) in Fort Wayne, Indiana). These shows aired primarily in the late 70s and early-to-mid 80s.

Composed of comic-book professionals and initially formed as an honorary society focused on discussing the comic-book craft and hosting an annual awards banquet, the ACBA evolved into an advocacy organization focused on creators' rights. The ACBA award, the Shazam, was a statuette in the shape of a lightning bolt. In addition to the creative awards, the ACBA also established the Academy of Comic Book Arts Hall of Fame award, inducting Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster as its initial honorees. History Founded in 1970, the ACBA's first president was Stan Lee; its first vice-president was Dick Giordano. (Presidents initially served one-year terms.) The ACBA met monthly at the Manhattan headquarters of the Society of Illustrators. The ACBA Sketchbook (1973) The Academy's Shazam Award was a successor to the 1960s Alley Award; the ACBA held its first annual awards banquet at the Statler Hilton Hotel's Terrace Ballroom on May 12, 1971. Aside from its Shazam Awards, the ACBA also published an annual fundraiser sketchbook. Contributing to the 36-page ACBA Sketchbook 1973 were Neal Adams, Sergio Aragones, Frank Brunner, Howard Chaykin, Dave Cockrum, Reed Crandall, Frank Frazetta, Michael Kaluta, Gil Kane, Gray Morrow, John Romita Sr., Mike Royer, Syd Shores, Jim Starlin, Jim Steranko, Herb Trimpe, and Wally Wood. The 48-page ACBA Sketchbook 1975 included Adams, Aragones, Chaykin, Kaluta, Kane, Romita Sr., Steranko, Wood, and John Byrne, Russ Heath, Jeff Jones, Harvey Kurtzman, Walt Simonson, Michael Whelan, and Berni Wrightson. Wood also contributed to the 1976 and 1977 sketchbooks. Includes \\"Online checklist: Catalogues, Programs, Sketchbooks, Etc.\\" Under its later president, artist Neal Adams, the ACBA became an advocacy organization for creators' rights. The comic-book industry at that time typically did not return artists' physical artwork after shooting the requisite film for printing, and in some cases destroyed the artwork to prevent unauthorized reprints. The industry also did not then offer royalties or residuals, common in such creative fields as book publishing, film and television, and the recording industry. Historian Jon B. Cooke writes: Adams wanted to focus on creator rights and pay rates, essentially making the ACBA a labor union. In a 1998 interview, Lee said, \\"ACBA became divided into two camps, it seemed. I wasn't interested in starting a union, so I walked away from it.\\" Once the ACBA ‚Äî riding a wave begun by the mid-'70s independent startup Atlas/Seaboard Comics, which instituted royalties and the return of artwork in order to attract creators ‚Äî helped see those immediate goals achieved, it then gradually disbanded. As writer Steven Grant notes, by 1977 the ACBA had \\"... disintegrated into what became Adams' \\"First Friday\\" professional get-togethers at his studio or apartment.\\" Irene Vartanoff was the final ACBA treasurer.. In early 2005, approximately $3,000 in sketchbook sales plus general contributions to the ACBA and accumulated interest was donated from the ACBA's Bill Everett Fund ‚Äî created in 1975 to help comics professionals in financial need ‚Äî to The Hero Initiative (formerly known as A Commitment to Our Roots, or ACTOR), a federally chartered, not-for-profit corporation likewise dedicated.  Legacy  The ACBA was the first in a string of largely unsuccessful comics-industry organizations that includes the Comic Book Creators Guild (1978‚Äì1979), the Comic Book Professionals Association (CBPA, 1992‚Äì1994), and Comic Artists, Retailers and Publishers (CARP, 1998).

Grant summed up the ABCA's legacy this way: Shazam Award The Shazam Award was a series of awards given between 1970 and 1975 for outstanding achievement in the comic book field.

Scholten) is an algorithm for detecting termination in a distributed system... The algorithm was proposed by Dijkstra and Scholten in 1980.. First, consider the case of a simple process graph which is a tree. A distributed computation which is tree-structured is not uncommon. Such a process graph may arise when the computation is strictly a divide-and-conquer type. A node starts the computation and divides the problem in two (or more, usually a multiple of 2) roughly equal parts and distribute those parts to other processors. This process continues recursively until the problems are of sufficiently small size to solve in a single processor. Algorithm The Dijkstra‚ÄìScholten algorithm is a tree-based algorithm which can be described by the following: * The initiator of a computation is the root of the tree. * Upon receiving a computational message: ** If the receiving process is currently not in the computation: the process joins the tree by becoming a child of the sender of the message. (No acknowledgment message is sent at this point.) ** If the receiving process is already in the computation: the process immediately sends an acknowledgment message to the sender of the message. * When a process has no more children and has become idle, the process detaches itself from the tree by sending an acknowledgment message to its tree parent. * Termination occurs when the initiator has no children and has become idle. Dijkstra‚ÄìScholten algorithm for a tree * For a tree, it is easy to detect termination. When a leaf process determines that it has terminated, it sends a signal to its parent. In general, a process waits for all its children to send signals and then it sends a signal to its parent. * The program terminates when the root receives signals from all its children. Dijkstra‚ÄìScholten algorithm for directed acyclic graphs * The algorithm for a tree can be extended to acyclic directed graphs. We add an additional integer attribute Deficit to each edge. * On an incoming edge, Deficit will denote the difference between the number of messages received and the number of signals sent in reply. * When a node wishes to terminate, it waits until it has received signals from outgoing edges reducing their deficits to zero. * Then it sends enough signals to ensure that the deficit is zero on each incoming edge. * Since the graph is acyclic, some nodes will have no outgoing edges and these nodes will be the first to terminate after sending enough signals to their incoming edges. After that the nodes at higher levels will terminate level by level. Dijkstra‚ÄìScholten algorithm for cyclic directed graphs * If cycles are allowed, the previous algorithm does not work. This is because, there may not be any node with zero outgoing edges. So, potentially there is no node which can terminate without consulting other nodes. * The Dijkstra‚ÄìScholten algorithm solves this problem by implicitly creating a spanning tree of the graph. A spanning-tree is a tree which includes each node of the underlying graph once and the edge-set is a subset of the original set of edges. * The tree will be directed (i.e., the channels will be directed) with the source node (which initiates the computation) as the root. * The spanning-tree is created in the following way. A variable First_Edge is added to each node. When a node receives a message for the first time, it initializes First_Edge with the edge through which it received the message. First_Edge is never changed afterwards. Note that, the spanning tree is not unique and it depends on the order of messages in the system. * Termination is handled by each node in three steps : *# Send signals on all incoming edges except the first edge. (Each node will send signals which reduces the deficit on each incoming edge to zero.) *# Wait for signals from all outgoing edges. (The number of signals received on each outgoing edge should reduce each of their deficits to zero.) *# Send signals on First_Edge. (Once steps 1 and 2 are complete, a node informs its parent in the spanning tree about its intention of terminating.)

Under his tenure the debate team began to compete internationally and hosted the University of Oxford's Oxford Union's first American debate in Lewiston; Gray is known as the \\"father of the Brooks Quimby Debate Council.\\" He led the college through the Wall Street Crash of 1929 to a $2 million endowment and introduced the V-12 Naval Training Program at the college.  Life and career  Gray was born on July 27, 1874, in Boston, Massachusetts, graduating from Harvard University in 1897 and then receiving a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago. Gray then served as a Free Will Baptist pastor and editor of The Standard, a Baptist periodical. Clifton Daggett Gray became Bates' third president in 1919, serving until 1944. He continued his predecessor's expansion of the academic side of Bates, but his tenure also saw significant changes in other aspects of college life. On-campus dancing was officially sanctioned, hazing was abolished, and student orientation and socializing rules were more formally established. As president, Gray greatly expanded the college's endowment and was active in the Bates debate program. He helped to organize the first intercontinental debate: Bates debated Oxford University in 1921. During World War II, Gray was instrumental in bringing a V-12 Navy unit to train officers at the college. Gray served as president of Bates until 1944, when he retired.  Death and legacy  Gray died on February 21, 1948, in Lewiston, Maine, four years after he retired from the presidency. Source for death date (genforum.com) Bates College honored Gray by naming their main athletic gymnasium after him. The Gray Athletic Building (Gray Cage) at Bates is home to basketball games, and student and faculty activities.

A face is \\"a vertical or sloping side of a mountain or cliff.\\" They are (sorted by date of first ascent): *Matterhorn, first ascent in August 1931; *Cima Grande di Lavaredo, first ascent in 1933; *Petit Dru, first ascent in 1935; *Piz Badile, first ascent July 1937; *Eiger, first ascent in July 1938; *Grandes Jorasses, first ascent in August 1938. Making the first ascent of each of these six faces was a major preoccupation of the best European climbers in the 1930s. Gaston R√©buffat, a French alpinist and mountain guide, was the first to climb all six of them, and his 1954 work, Etoiles et Temp√™tes (Starlight and Storm), chronicles these climbs. Three of these north faces‚Äîthe Eiger, the Matterhorn and the Grandes Jorasses‚Äîare considerably harder to climb than the others. This led to their becoming known as 'the Trilogy'. The first to climb these three faces within a year was the Austrian Leo Schl√∂mmer, from the summer of 1961 to the summer of 1962. Ivano Ghirardini was the first man to climb the Trilogy in winter, solo (1977‚Äì78), and Catherine Destivelle was the first woman (1992-93-94). With the introduction of the concept of enchainment, the next challenge was to climb all three faces in one outing, a race eventually won by Christophe Profit, who achieved the feat between 11‚Äì12 March 1987 in a time of 24 hours.Mark Twight, Kiss Or Kill: Confessions of a Serial Climber, The Mountaineers Books, 2002, p. 33 From December 2014 to March 2015, during a project known as \\"Starlight and Storms\\", Tom Ballard climbed the six major alpine north faces solo, being the first person to complete this feat in a single winter season without a support team. A film chronicling this project, Tom, won several awards at international film festivals.

He is an influential conservative writer, writing columns espousing Hindu nationalism for leading English dailies. Dasgupta was awarded Padma Bhushan (the third highest civilian award in India) in 2015, for his contribution to Literature and Education.  Early life and education  He was born into a Bengali Baidya Brahmin family on 3 October 1955 in Calcutta, West Bengal. He received his early education at St. Paul's School, Darjeeling, La Martiniere Calcutta and St. Stephen's College, Delhi, graduating from the latter in 1975. He thereafter went on to earn an MA and PhD from the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, where he received an exhibitionership to fund his studies. Subsequently, he returned to India for a brief period in 1979 to take up a management position at his family‚Äôs pharmaceutical business ‚ÄòCalcutta Chemical Company‚Äô. He eventually returned to the United Kingdom as a Junior Research Fellow at Nuffield College, University of Oxford, where he taught and researched on South Asian Politics. An excerpt from his thesis concerning the intersectionality of local politics in the Midnapur district of Bengal has featured in a volume about subaltern studies, edited by Ranajit Guha. Personal life and ideologies Despite being initially attracted to Trotskyism, Dasgupta became a Thatcherite in his days at England. Since then, he has self-identified with centre-right politics and has been heavily active in the national political theater, as a member of Bharatiya Janata Party. Mushirul Hasan noted him to be the effective chief- spokesperson of BJP in the English language press during the 90s. Arvind Rajagopal saw this shift to BJP to immediately arise after the implementation of Mandal Commission recommendations along with the near-simultaneous Rathyatra by Advani, which Dasgupta held to be a potential event that can bridge the internal divide among Hindus. He is married to Reshmi Ray Dasgupta, Lifestyle Editor at The Economic Times and has a son who is a practicing lawyer in the Supreme Court of India. They reside in New Delhi. Career Dasgupta has served in editorial positions over several English dailies in India including The Indian Express, The Times of India, The Statesman, India Today et cetera. He is a frequent guest on news channels in English-language debates on Indian politics and international affairs. He wrote a foreword to an anthology titled Nirad C. Chaudhuri: The First Hundred Years: A Celebration, wherein he asserted Chaudhuri of having pro-BJP stances. In February 2015, Swapan Dasgupta was appointed on the Board of Directors of Larsen and Toubro as a nominee of the Unit Trust of India. In April, 2016, Dasgupta was nominated by the President of India Pranab Mukherjee to the Rajya Sabha. His term would continue till 2022. These appointments have though attracted criticism from other commentators as a reward for political allegiance. He stepped down from Directorship of Larsen and Toubro upon being appointed to the Rajya Sabha. In 2019, he published Awakening Bharat Mata: The Political Beliefs of the Indian Right.  Reception  Meera Nanda notes him to be one of the most prominent center-right public intellectuals in the Indian polity. Tanika Sarkar et al have located parallels between Swapan's writings and the thought-school of Hindu nationalist organisations like Vishva Hindu Parishad. Manisha Basu, writing in The Rhetoric of Hindu India, deems Dasgupta similarly and further notes of his consistent attacks upon left- liberal commentators‚Äîpeople who have supposedly leveraged their social privilege to dominate the socio-political consciousness of the \\"Anglophone national bourgeoisie\\" for long enough‚Äîin his process of becoming one of the few self-appointed interpreters of the Indian Right. Basu also notes him to be a vocal exponent of exploiting English as a tool in reaching out to the masses and substituting the appeal of prevalent ideologies of the socialist left- liberals with that of hindutva; he was one of the most fierce critics of the pro-vernacular policies followed by the communist government of West Bengal. Back in the early 2000s, Dasgupta had noted in his blog:\\\\- Arvind Tajagopal notes Dasgupta to be one of the most vocal and enthusiast columnists for Hindutva, in English language press in the 80s. Basu observes Dasgupta's ideas of a functioning democracy to heavily derive from the attacks on the inadequacies of political liberalism by Nazi jurist Carl Schmitt; it ran parallel to consensual nationalism and strove for the establishment of a cohesive nationalistic unification coupled with the throttling of any dissenting narrative, as a necessary prerequisite for any parliamentary process. Dasgupta then proceeds to draw a synonymous relation of his perspective of democracy with dharma, which he terms as the 'fundamental commonality of democratic expression'. Basu remarks of this translation to allude to his desire of homogeneity across all religious strands and observes a high degree of similarity in the intended effects of Dasgupta's and Jay Dubashi's writings. But, political ambitions had led him to pursue a less radical socio-religious path, wherein he advocated for the exclusioning of BJP from the communalism and anti-minority rhetoric typically associated with 'Hindutva' and re-branding itself as a \\"market-friendly, pro-defense, socially conservative right-of-center party\\". Dasgupta has since described of this new brand of Hindutva as an 'ideological veto' in Indian politics. Economically, Meera Nanda deems him as a proponent of a free-trade capitalistic market within a socially conservative Hindu matrix, who was steadfastly opposed to the Nehruvian thought-school of Fabian Socialism.

The territorial prelate is sometimes called a prelate nullius, from the Latin nullius di≈ìceseos, prelate \\"of no diocese,\\" meaning the territory falls directly under the 'exempt' jurisdiction of the Holy See (Pope of Rome) and is not a diocese under a residing bishop. The term is also used in a generic sense, and may then equally refer to an apostolic prefecture, an apostolic vicariate, a permanent apostolic administration (which are pre-diocesan, often missionary, or temporary), or a territorial abbacy (see there).  Status  A territorial prelate exercises quasi- episcopal jurisdiction in a territory not comprised by any diocese. The origin of such prelates must necessarily be sought in the apostolic privileges, for only he whose authority is superior to that of bishops can grant an exemption from episcopal jurisdiction. Such exemption, therefore, comes only from the pope. The rights of prelates nullius are quasi-episcopal, and these dignitaries are supposed to have any power that a bishop has, unless it is expressly denied to them by canon law. If they have not received episcopal consecration, such prelates may not confer holy orders. If not consecrated episcopally, they have not the power to exercise those functions of consecrating oils, etc., which are referred to the episcopal order only analogously. Prelates nullius may take cognizance of matrimonial causes within the same limits as a bishop. They may dispense from the proclamation of matrimonial banns, grant faculties for hearing confessions and preaching, reserve certain cases to themselves, publish indulgences and jubilees, exercise full jurisdiction over the enclosure of nuns, and invite any bishop to confirm in their quasi-diocese. They may, even if priests only, confirm themselves by papal privilege as expressed in canon 883 No. 1 CIC whenever they find it appropriate; however, even as local ordinaries they are in that case only extraordinary ministers of confirmation and should thus prefer to invite bishops if possible. These prelates may not, however, without special permission of the Holy See, convoke a synod or institute synodal examiners. Neither may they confer parochial benefices. They are not allowed to grant indulgences, or absolve from the reserved cases and secret irregularities whose absolution is restricted to the pope ordinarily, but allowed to bishops by the Council of Trent, nor promote secular clerics to orders, nor grant dimissory letters for ordination, nor exercise jurisdiction over regulars as apostolic delegates. Prelates nullius are, however, bound to residence, to preach the Word of God, to offer Mass for their people, to make the visit ad limina to the Roman Curia, and in concurrence with the neighbouring bishop to perform a visitation of their quasi-diocese. As a rule, territorial (and personal) prelates are consecrated as bishops, though not bishops of their diocese, as expressed by the title Bishop-prelate. Most were/are missionaries, outside Europe (mainly Latin America and a few Asian countries) or in countries with a crushing Protestant majority (notably Lutheran Norway).

It is also known as Edmonton Garrison or \\"Steele Barracks\\". Helipads, and airside air traffic control tower, at CFB Edmonton. History The history of CFB Edmonton begins at an old airfield called Blatchford Field (named after a former mayor of Edmonton, Kenny Blatchford), a few kilometres south from where CFB Edmonton would eventually be established. The airfield began operating after the First World War and became important to the opening up and development of the Canadian north. During the Second World War Blatchford Field became a Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) training station under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. No. 16 Elementary Flying Training School (No. 16 EFTS) and No. 2 Air Observers School (No. 2 AOS) used the aerodrome. The RCAF also ran No. 4 Initial Training School (No. 4 ITS) which was a ground school located at the University of Alberta.Wings Over Alberta - No. BCATP Site Locations Retrieved: 2010-09-22 No. 16 EFTS closed in 1942 and No. 2 AOS closed in 1944. After No. 2 AOS closed, the station formally became known as RCAF Station Edmonton. Many RCAF squadrons and units were located here, including a survival school and the RCAF Winter Experimental Establishment (WEE). A United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-29 bomber detachment also used the station.Canadian Military History Retrieved: 2010-09-22 During the war the airfield became a staging point for the U.S. defence of Alaska and was heavily used by the U.S. military. Aircraft had to be ferried and transport aircraft used the aerodrome to support the construction of the Alaska Highway. Air traffic increased significantly and flying activities were becoming hazardous. Since the old airfield could not be expanded because of its proximity to the city of Edmonton, the U.S. Government built a new air facility at Namao, about north of the city. The United States Army Corps of Engineers built two runways at the base, 03/21 and 12/30, both long and Canada's longest at the time. The Americans ran the Namao airfield until the end of the war when the Canadian Government took it over. RCAF Station Edmonton, located at the old Blatchford Field, developed some severe limitations and so all RCAF Squadrons and support units were transferred to the \\"new\\" RCAF Station Namao on 1 October 1955. Blatchford Field was turned over to the Edmonton municipal government and became the commercial Edmonton City Centre (Blatchford Field) Airport.RCAF Air Base Alberta Online Encyclopedia - Alberta's Aviation Heritage. Retrieved: 2011-03-01 During the Cold War RCAF Station Namao was used by the United States Strategic Air Command, which constructed a \\"Nose Dock\\" capable of servicing the nose and wings of heavy jet bombers and tankers on the south side of the airfield. The station also hosted the Edmonton Rescue Coordination Centre, and served as home base for United Nations Food Aid flights, delivering aid to Ethiopia, Somalia, and Bosnia. Because Namao at that time had a runway, 12/30, it was a designated an emergency Space Shuttle landing site by NASA.CFB Namao Alberta Online Encyclopedia - Alberta's Aviation Heritage. Retrieved: 2011-03-01 In 1968, when Canada's armed forces were amalgamated, RCAF Station Namao was redesignated Canadian Forces Base Edmonton (Lancaster Park) and was under command of the new Air Transport Command and later Air Command. Federal Government budget cuts forced the command of the air station to be transferred to the Canadian Forces Land Force Command in 1994. CFB Edmonton (Lancaster Park)/18 Wing Edmonton was redesignated CFB Edmonton. Although both runways are still visible they are no longer in use except for a section of 03/21 used by helicopters. In 2010‚Äì2011, Government of Canada announced the construction of new facilities for visiting Canadian Armed Forces members training at CFB Edmonton (3rd Canadian Division Support Base Edmonton (3 CDSB)) .

CFB Edmonton is the headquarters of 3rd Canadian Division, the highest army authority in western Canada, and 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (1 CMBG), the only Regular Force brigade group in the region. The base is situated at Steele Barracks (named for Sir Sam Steele) just north of the city. The area formerly known as CFB Griesbach within the city itself is no longer operational. All buildings and land having been sold and are no longer Crown assets. The final closure was announced by Minister MacKay in 2012. The base as a collective is an important part of the community surrounding Edmonton and is home to some of the most prestigious and experienced units in the Canadian Military. The 3rd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, along with elements of Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians) and 1 Combat Engineer Regiment (all part of 1 CMBG) were chosen to be a part of Canada's military response to the September 11, 2001 attacks and were deployed on combat operations to Afghanistan (including Operation Anaconda) in 2001 and 2002. Units from the base were deployed to Kandahar, Afghanistan, as part of the Canadian Forces command takeover in that area as well. Units from Edmonton were also deployed on domestic operations such as to assist with the Red River Flood in 1997 (where the entire 1 CMBG was deployed) and, more recently, as a part of Operation Peregrine in response to the forest fires in British Columbia in 2003. Units from CFB Edmonton were also deployed on numerous peacekeeping operations, including to Bosnia and Kosovo, among others. At the end of March 2010 there were 4,237 regular military, 905 reserve Class A, B, and C forces, and 665 civilian workers at CFB Edmonton. CFB Edmonton has around one-third of the Canadian army's fighting power. In February 2012, it was reported that the Alberta Government had been in contact with the federal government and military officials in Ottawa and Edmonton over the use of the runway for MEDIVAC flights with the planned closure of Edmonton City Centre Airport. Alberta Deputy Premier Doug Horner said that he had spoken with the Minister of National Defence, Peter MacKay, and the Minister of Public Works, Rona Ambrose for further discussion. It was ultimately decided to operate all medical flights out of a purpose built facility at the Edmonton International Airport. On June 7, 2013, the base hosted the raising of a rainbow flag to kick off Edmonton Pride, the first time that the flag was flown on a Canadian military base.\\"CFB Edmonton 1st base to raise gay-pride flag\\".

The AANR is the largest, longest-established organization of its kind in North America. It was founded in 1931 under its previous name American Sunbathing Association. Approximately 200 nudist resorts, clubs, and businesses choose to affiliate with AANR, and AANR serves over 30,000 members in the United States, Canada, Mexico, French West Indies, Virgin Islands, and St. Martin. The AANR promotes the benefits of wholesome nude family recreation and works to protect the rights of nudists in appropriate settings, such as sanctioned nude beaches and public lands set aside for that use; as well as homes, private backyards, plus AANR-affiliated clubs, campgrounds and resorts. The AANR uses a portion of its collected membership fees to be politically active by campaigning and lobbying governments fighting to allow nudism in the US and Canada. Purpose and activities The AANR believes that nudity in appropriate settings is an enhancing and enjoyable experience. Ultimately, the organization wishes to realize societal acceptance of nude recreation. The association lobbies various levels of government in the interest of its affiliates and of nudist recreation. The AANR's purpose includes the following elements: *To foster among the public a just and tolerant appreciation of the human person and body in all its aspects, and promote the understanding and liberty that humankind may achieve by the practice of social nudism. *To disseminate knowledge and information about the practice of social nudism. *To establish, maintain, and foster the establishment of resorts, places, parks and areas for recreation and the enjoyment of social nudism. *To lawfully, and in combination with others, seek the establishment and maintenance of such laws in any jurisdiction as will facilitate and provide for the purposes herein stated. History In 1929 Kurt Barthel started the first American nudist club known as the American League for Physical Culture (ALPC). A couple of years later after continued growth it was renamed and founded as an organization American Sunbathing Association in 1931 with Ilsley Boone being listed as president. During the World War II the nudist movement was disrupted as many went off to war resulting in the closure of several nudist resorts / clubs. After the war by 1946, Boone was seen as controlling and micro-managing the organization resulting in many dissatisfied members. Claims of controlling mailing lists in order to receive enough proxy votes to keep control of elected votes and elected officials. After several years of conflicts, finally in 1951 forced Boone to resign. Boone continued to stay active in the nudist movement by starting the magazine S.U.N. (So/air Union Naturisme). The organization changed names again in 1995 to its current name of American Association for Nude Recreation. Member Associations The AANR was a long-standing representative of INF (International Naturist Federation) until its recent withdrawal in September 2010, leaving America with no INF representatives. The AANR also belongs to several other organizations such as: The Naturist Society, FCN (Federation of Canadian Naturists), SFFB (South Florida Free Beaches), ARC (American Recreation Coalition), National Association of RV Parks and Campgrounds, and others. Membership AANR and other nudist organizations, such as The Naturist Society, discover and prevent anti-nudity legislation. They also work to increase the places where people can legally be nude through legislation and positive media coverage. These efforts are largely volunteer from the ranks of those who want to enjoy being part of nude activities. Both clubs and people support this effort. Clubs do so by becoming an AANR-chartered club, while individuals become AANR members. The AANR is run by elected board members and is divided into seven regions, devoted to promoting family nude recreation in their respective geographic areas. With the organizations headquartered in Kissimmee, FL of the Florida region, the seven regions consist of: # Eastern (AANR-East) # Florida (AANR-Florida) Separate office from the national AANR # Midwest (AANR-MW) # Northwest (AANR- NW) # Southwestern (AANR-SW) Generally covering the South Central states # Western (AANR-West) # Western Canadian (AANR-WC) Other provinces of Canada are covered by the Eastern and Midwest regions =Clubs= AANR-affiliated (chartered) clubs include both nudist resorts and naturist social clubs that agree to AANR principles and standards. There are a wide range of various types of nudist resorts and clubs affiliated with AANR that are as individual as their members and visitors. So long as they meet AANR principles and standards by endeavor to provide a friendly, stress free atmosphere where people enjoy social nude recreation with their family and friends. Ranging from clothing optional to no clothes allowed. Chartered clubs also range from land-based clubs to beach clubs and even travel clubs (not land based). Many AANR-affiliated resorts are also affiliated with The Naturist Society, and the AANR membership card usually has equal status to the TNS membership card at resorts. =People= Individuals typically become members on an annual basis usually via paid annual subscriptions at chartered clubs which includes partial fees for AANR membership, although lifetime memberships are also available. Membership in AANR includes a subscription to The Bulletin, AANR‚Äôs monthly newsletter. The Bulletin contains articles on naturist activities and issues related to naturism. The Bulletin began as an insert in the Sunshine and Health magazine, and is now a standalone newsletter.

Upon being elected the youngest president in Bates history at 34, he increased the student body to 1,004, created the college's study- abroad program, and added $5 million to the endowment, more than quadrupling it. At his death he left $9 million to the college in his will and testament. He was known for employing economic principles of competition and market share when dealing with students which ultimately lead him to be successful institutionally but unpopular with students.  Early life and career  Phillips was born in Nelson, Pennsylvania on May 25, 1910. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from Colgate University and a Ph.D. from Harvard University. Phillips then went on to teach, research, and write as an economics professor at Colgate. He served as the deputy administrator in the United States Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supplies from March 10, 1937 to July 1, 1941.

He also initiated the study abroad program, oversaw the construction of many new buildings at Bates, and had the college's observatory demolished. He is known for initiating the Bates academic program of Education, championing the most traditional strength of the Bates: the liberal arts which featured a core curriculum of liberal arts. He also championed \\"3/4 option,‚Äù permitting a three-year degree from Bates. Phillips expanded the campus with the additions of Memorial Commons (now known as Chase Hall), Health Center, Dana Chemistry Hall, Lane Hall, Page Hall, and Schaeffer Theater.  Death and legacy  Charles Franklin Phillips died on March 3, 1998 in Auburn, Maine. Upon his death, he and his wife, Evelyn, left $9,000,000 to Bates in his will and testament. This bequest was used to fund the Phillips Fellowships, which are granted to students for research abroad.

Design and development The RC-3 Seabee was designed by Percival Hopkins \\"Spence\\" Spencer, an aviation pioneer who built his first hang glider in April 1911. At the time, he was 17 years old and constructed it from plans he found in a Popular Mechanics magazine. On May 15, 1914, Spencer made his first powered flight in a Curtiss flying boat. In 1937, he joined Sikorsky engineer Vincent A. Larsen to design their first and only amphibious aircraft, the Spencer-Larsen SL-12C. Development of the plane progressed slowly and in September 1940 Spencer left the partnership to form his own company. His resulting design was the Spencer S-12 Air Car Amphibian. Construction of the S-12 began on March 1, 1941 and the small, two-seat S-12 prototype, registered NX29098, made its first flight on August 8, 1941. The S-12 was a fabric covered amphibian with a unique boxlike forward cabin; a high wing with a two-bladed propeller in pusher configuration; and a long, slender tail boom. Republic RC-3 Seabee Republic RC-3 Seabee instrument panel and cockpit Republic RC-3 Seabee with gear retracted In December 1941 Spencer put the Air Car into storage and joined the war effort as a test pilot for the Republic Aircraft Corporation. By 1943, he had flight tested 134 of the company's P-47 Thunderbolts. In April 1943 Spencer left Republic Aircraft to join the Mills Novelty Company of Chicago, Illinois who wanted to use his Air Car to promote their company. Spencer used the company's wood forming equipment to build a new egg-shaped cabin for the Air Car and began demonstrating the aircraft to his former employers, Republic Aircraft. Seeing the potential of the Air Car as the perfect sports plane for pilots returning from the war, Republic purchased the rights to the Air Car in December 1943 and immediately began development of an all-metal version designated the Model RC-1 Thunderbolt Amphibian. On November 30, 1944 the first RC-1 Thunderbolt Amphibian, registered NX41816, made its first flight with Spencer at the controls. The aircraft was displayed in St Louis, Missouri in December and by the end of 1944 Republic had received 1,972 civilian orders for the $3,500 airplane. The aircraft was also demonstrated to the U.S. Navy and Army Air Corps. Both services were impressed with the design and on February 19, 1945 the Navy granted Republic Aviation the rights to use the name Seabee for the civilian version. The Army placed a large order for the aircraft, to be used for air-sea rescue operations under the designation OA-15. In September 1945, following VJ Day, both the Army and Navy canceled their orders, which by that time totaled over $20,000,000. The OA-15 Seabee was the last United States Army Air Corps aircraft to use the OA designation, which was dropped when the US Air Force was formed as a separate military branch in 1947. Military operators included the Israeli Air Force, Paraguayan Navy, the United States Army Air Forces and Republic of Vietnam Air Force. =Production= In order to meet the anticipated postwar demand for civilian light aircraft, Republic endeavored to build the Seabee as inexpensively as possible, while still retaining reasonable performance and range. A lot of thought went into eliminating what were at the time termed as 'airplane frills,' resulting in a strong product built with as few parts as possible. For example, Seabees as built did not have ribs in the wings; instead, the heavy corrugated aluminum sheet which formed the skin provided the necessary stiffness. Republic was also willing to buy components in volume, which lowered costs further. On November 22, 1945, the prototype RC-3 (NX87451) came off the assembly line at Republic's factory in Farmingdale, New York and on December 1 made its first flight in Farmingdale with Spencer at the controls. On December 27, 1945, Republic Aviation purchased Aircooled Motors, manufacturers of the Franklin engine, to supply and build engines for the RC-3 Seabee. In March, 1946, the first production RC-3 Seabee was completed (NC87457, formerly NX87457, and on July 25, 1946 the first Seabee (NC87463, production #13) was delivered at the Republic factory to J.G. (Tex) Rankin of Rankin Aviation Industries of Tulare, California. In the late 1940s, aircraft manufacturers hoped that military pilots returning from the war would want to continue flying civilian aircraft for pleasure and sport. This never occurred to the extent the companies imagined, as most wartime pilots returned home never to fly again. As a result, many small and optimistic aircraft companies appeared, then quickly disappeared in the immediate postwar years. On October 4, 1947, Republic Aviation Corp. announced that it was discontinuing production of the RC-3 Seabee amphibian for the personal plane market. Republic President Mundy I. Peale stated: \\"Due to the need of all Republic's production facilities for the manufacture of other types of airplanes, the company has decided to discontinue production of the Seabee\\". Actually, by summer (July/August) 1947 the Seabee sales had almost stalled and since June 1947 the production had been put on hold, awaiting further sales. By the end of production a respectable 1,060 Seabees had been built. Though this was far from the 5,000 Seabees per year Republic had hoped to sell, it still represented a significant number of airplanes compared to other struggling aircraft companies of the same era. Only Piper, with their cheap, long-lived Cub and Super Cub, Beech's popular Bonanza, and Cessna's early 140 and 120 light planes would sell in numbers greater than the Seabee. This was due in no small part to the very low price of the Seabee. During production, however, the price of the Seabee would rise from its original $3,500 to $4,495 effective July 15, 1946 and to $6,000 on November 15, 1946. Republic sold its last new Seabee in 1948. By that time the demand for civilian aircraft had shown itself to be far less than anticipated and the company turned its attention back to military contracts, developing the successful F-84 Thunderjet, which was built on the same assembly lines formerly used to build the Seabee. Operational history Seabees became popular in Canada and the US and were also well- suited for operation in countries with long coastlines, many islands and lakes and large areas of wilderness. By the time production ended, 108 Seabees had been exported to several countries and dealerships were established in Brazil, Cuba, Panama, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay, Peru, Venezuela, Chile, Argentina, Fiji, New Caledona, South Africa, England, Norway and Sweden. From the late 1940s and into the 1950s, the Seabee was a popular bush plane and air ambulance in Canada, Norway, Sweden and the USA. In 2006, over 250 Seabees are still registered and flying, a number that is increasing yearly as new aircraft are assembled from parts and wrecks. A few Seabees are still operating commercially as bush planes and air taxis. =Modifications= Twenty-three Seabees were converted to a twin-engine variant known as the United Consultants Twin Bee with the fitting of two wing-mounted engines driving tractor propellers. The added thrust greatly enhanced the plane's speed, acceleration and capacity. Modifications to increase the engine size, wingspan, cargo carrying capacity, controls, trim activation, environmental systems, landing light and many others have been available since the early 1970s.

His religious titles were Tung Li Zu and Jin Gong Zu Shi (ÈáëÂÖ¨Á•ñÂ∏´; Golden Elder). Lu is, according to Yiguan Dao doctrine, the incarnation of Maitreya. He was born on the 24th day of 4th Lunar month in 1849, in Jining, Shandong province, China. He was said to be illiterate, his father died when he was young, left with his mother and sister Lu ZhongJie. He joined the army at age 22 and became an officer in the Manzhou DongBei (Manchuria) government. In 1895, at the age of 46 he was said to have a dream from God instructing him to become the student of the 16th patriarch Liu Qingxu (Wang Jueyi's successor). He became the 17th patriarch of Yiguan Dao in 1905 in Qingzhou. Yiguan Dao followers believe that he is the first leader of the \\"White Sun\\" Era, the last era of the Three Stages Final Kalpa, thus he is the incarnation of savior Maitreya or Hotei. In 1918, Lu brought I-Kuan Tao to his hometown Jining, within a few years, Lu managed to attract some 25 disciples, among them Zhang Tianran and Sun Suzhen. Lu died on the 2nd day of the 2nd lunar month in 1925. Thus, Lu's younger sister Lu Zhong Jie (also known as Lao Gu Nai Nai, Mistress of the Old Cave) who was believed to be the incarnation of bodhisattva Guan Yin, took over the leadership for six years. Zhang Tianran and Sun Suzhen became the successor through spirit writing by the Heavenly Mother. However, the other seven major disciples of Lu once refused his succession. In 1930 Zhang officially was bestowed the leadership as the 18th patriarch of Yiguan Dao in Jinan.

It goes beyond a traditional family tree by allowing the user to visualize hereditary patterns and psychological factors that punctuate relationships. It can be used to identify repetitive patterns of behavior and to recognize hereditary tendencies. Murray Bowen invented the concept of the genogram as part of his family systems model in the 1970s. Genograms were later developed and popularized in clinical settings by Monica McGoldrick and Randy Gerson through the publication of a book titled Genograms: Assessment and Intervention in 1985. Genograms are now used by various groups of people in a variety of fields such as medicine, psychiatry, psychology, social work, genetic research, education, and many more. Some practitioners in personal and family therapy use genograms for personal records and/or to explain family dynamics to the client. Few if any genealogists use them.  Symbols  A genogram is created with simple symbols representing the gender, with various lines to illustrate family relationships. Some genogram users also put circles around members who live in the same living spaces. Genograms can be prepared by using a complex word processor, or a computer drawing program. There are also computer programs that are custom designed for genograms. Basic Genogram Symbols Genogram symbols will usually have the date of birth (and date of death if applicable) above, and the name of the individual underneath. The inside of the symbol will hold the person's current age or various codes for genetic diseases or user-defined properties: abortions, still-births, SIDS, cohabitations, etc.  Content  A genogram can contain a wealth of information on the families represented. It will not only show the names of people who belong to a family lineage, but how these relatives relate to each other. For example, a genogram will not only show that a person called Paul and his wife Lily have three children, but that their eldest child was sent to boarding school; that their middle child is always in conflict with her mother; that their youngest has juvenile diabetes; that Paul suffered from depression, was an alcoholic, and a philosopher; and that Lily has not spoken to her brother for years, has breast cancer, and has a history of quitting her jobs.  Family relationships  One of the advantages of a genogram is the ability to use colour-coded lines to define different types of relationships such as family relationships, emotional relationships and social relationships. Within family relationships, you can illustrate if a couple is married, divorced, common-law, engaged, etc. Family Relationship Symbols in a Genogram  Emotional relationships  Genograms may also include emotional relationships. These provide an in-depth analysis of how individuals relate to one another. Colour-coded lines represent various emotional relationships that bond individuals together. Emotional Relationship Symbols in a Genogram  Social relationships  Another component of genograms is social relationships. These allow users to link individuals who are not related to one another, but who have a connection in society-at-large, such as neighbor, co-worker, boss-employee, pastor-church member, teacher-student, etc. Social relationships can also illustrate an individual's relation to a social entity. The use of social relationships links allows the genogram to be used in a business environment to create organizational charts or floor plan layouts of the employees. A genogram looks like a family tree, but with all the different types of relationships, it contains a significantly more detailed and complete picture of the family or group it illustrates.  Purpose  = Genealogy = In genealogy, genograms are used to record family history through the lives of each of its members. Genograms allow the genealogist to graphically portray complex family trees that show marriages and divorces, reconstituted families, adoptions, strained relationships, family cohesion, etc. Genealogists can use genograms to discover and analyze interesting facts about their family history, such as a naming pattern, sibling rivalry, or significant events like immigration. = Medicine = In medicine, medical genograms provide a quick and useful context in which to evaluate an individual's health risks. Knowledge of diseases and conditions that occur within a family can give a health care team invaluable information that may aid in a swift, accurate diagnosis and treatment of health problems. And, a knowledge of diseases and illnesses that \\"run\\" in families can give individuals an important head start in pursuing effective preventive measures. A medical genogram is helpful in determining patterns of disease or illness within a family. Medical genograms can include many generations, however four generations may prove to be enough detail. Medical Genogram Lege = Sociology = Genograms are used by sociologists to gather objective and consistent information from the clients and their family, helping them to view the client's issues in the larger context of their marital relationship, family relationships and culture of origin and underlining key issues to discuss in client counseling. Genograms portray emotional relationships, which allow Sociologists to see and evaluate possible conflicts within the family. Psychological patterns may be detected in the genogram which provide the basis for precautionary and preventive measures that otherwise might not be warranted. = Social work = In social work, genograms are used to display emotional bonds between individuals composing a family or social unit. A genogram will help social workers to make an assessment of the level of cohesiveness within a family or a group and to evaluate if proper care is available within that unit. Genograms also allow displaying social relationships that illustrate the places people attend such as schools, churches, youth facilities, associations or retirement homes. = Family therapy = In family therapy, genograms are used to study and record relationship patterns between family members and the individual characteristics that make up these patterns that occur. A genogram will help family therapists to make an appropriate assessment of the relationship patterns and where intervention may be needed to help the family reduce the dysfunction and/or problematic situation that brought them into therapy. = Religion = Genograms are used in some Christian churches and conversion therapy programs. In these instances, a person's family tree includes any sins or misfortunes, often including early deaths, divorces, domestic violence, incest, adultery, homosexuality, premarital sex, mental instability, and poverty. = Research = In research, genograms allow researchers to understand multi generational processes within various plant and animal species, such as the development of mutations. Genograms can also illustrate rates of renewal, mechanisms of survival, or processes involved in the regulation of tolerance, among other things. = Education = In education, genograms can be used by teachers and students for illustrating book reviews, or family trees of a famous politician, philosopher, scientist, musician, etc. They allow them to focus their attention on specific details and also see the big picture of the books and individuals they are studying.  Creating genograms  Genograms can be useful in almost any profession that deals with social interaction. Genograms can help to visualize complex interactions between individuals and to study patterns of behaviors or diseases. Genograms are easily created with genealogy software, as advanced software allows the user to include tremendous amounts of data. Genealogy software also allows the user to create detailed reports containing analysis of the information stored in each person's individual properties. Commercial software, such as GenoPro, Genome Analytics and iGenogram for iPad is available to produce genograms, as well as hundreds of different academic and scientific programs for specialized uses. Genograms are often drawn by hand, sketched working right with the client. It is also possible to create a Genogram in any graphics or word processing program.

In the spring of 1965 he was among those answering the call of the southern civil rights movement, going to Alabama to demonstrate against the federal government's support of Alabama's segregationist policies. Later that summer he once again answered the call, going to Jackson, Mississippi in support of people struggling against the segregationist policies of Mississippi and the federal government. He spent 10 days in the Hinds County, Mississippi jail. In October 1965 he was arrested in Ann Arbor, Michigan in the first draft board sit-in as part of one of the first acts of civil disobedience against the American government's warfare against the people of Viet Nam.

German-Soviet War On 6 November 1941, the 87th Rifle Division (Second Formation) was re-formed and placed under the command of former corps commander Alexander Rodimtsev. On 19 January 1942, the 87th Rifle Division was officially awarded Guards status and was re-designated as the 13th Guards Rifle Division. =Battle of Kharkov= In May 1942, the 13th Division was involved in the Soviet counter- offensive at Kharkov, where they fought on its northern axis, thus escaping the encirclement and destruction of a substantial portion of the Soviet forces engaged, followed by the Russian defeat. During this offensive, the division suffered more than fifty-percent casualties, most of which were sustained in the repelling of fierce German counter-attacks. It was during one of these attacks that an Artillery Captain of the 13th earned the first Order of the Great Patriotic War 1st Class to be awarded. Following his unit's success during this offensive, Colonel Rodimtsev was subsequently promoted to Major General. =The Battle of Stalingrad= First blows On 13 September of that year, German infantry divisions made their first advance into Stalingrad, marking the opening salvos of the Battle of Stalingrad. By the end of the day the German 71st Infantry Division had reached the city centre, north of the Tsaritsa Gorge. A Stavka directive ordered the 13th Guards Division (in the midst of its resupply and reinforcement) to the Volga River and Stalingrad. After being briefed by Lieutenant General Vasily Chuikov, the commander of the 62nd Army, Rodimtsev famously and determinedly declared:\\"I am a Communist! I have no intention of abandoning the city [Stalingrad]!\\" Because of the recent influx of new recruits, the division was now largely inexperienced and untrained, and lacked both maps and knowledge of Stalingrad's rubble-strewn streets, which would prove enormously difficult to overcome in the struggle ahead. However, thanks to his experience fighting in the Spanish Civil War, Major General Rodimtsev was well versed in urban warfare. At 17.00, 14 September, the forward elements of the 13th Guards swiftly crossed the river to reinforce a line that was being held by a mere 15 tanks and few hastily assembled combat groups. It is estimated that more than half of the first wave perished during the river crossing, more than 3,000 being killed in just the first 24 hours. Ultimately, after extremely heavy losses on both sides, the German advance was repelled. Rodimtsev's soldiers recaptured the Mill and secured the central river crossing for other regiments of the 13th Guards. The Railroad Station Soviet infantry in Stalingrad The following morning one of Rodimtsev's junior officers, Lieutenant Anton Kuzmich Dragan was personally ordered by Chuikov to hold a key railroad station in downtown Stalingrad against an impending German assault. Dragan proceeded to gather a platoon of less than fifty men and moved them over to the railroad station. Here, the small but determined force prepared itself for the German attack. Soon after digging in, a substantial force of German infantrymen arrived to seize control of the station. The Russians proceeded to repeatedly frustrate the Germans in an epic room-by-room struggle for control of the depot for nearly three weeks. Breaking through walls, crawling over rafters, and burrowing under the floorboards, the Russians would yield but a portion of the structure to the Germans, only to emerge elsewhere and start the struggle all over again. Exchanging gunfire down hallways, hurling grenades back and forth between rooms, Dragan's men inflicted significant casualties on the Germans. In spite of this heroic resistance, Dragan's platoon was eventually reduced to a handful of men. After running out of ammunition, and with their rations gone, one of the Soviet Guardsmen took out his bayonet and carved on a wall, :Rodimtsev's Guardsmen fought and died for their country here. Under cover of darkness, Dragan and the five remaining soldiers under his command eventually slipped out of the building, made their way through the German lines, and were reunited with the remainder of the division.  The Mamaev Kurgan  The battle at the Mamaev Kurgan began approximately three weeks after the brutal fighting between the German and Russian infantrymen had begun in the outskirts of Stalingrad, on 15 September. During this portion of the battle, the division fought several Wehrmacht divisions for control of the park's central hilltop summit, which changed hands multiple times. Meanwhile, other divisional units fought in different sectors of Stalingrad. The division was in the midst of the combat throughout the city in the remains of the bombed- out buildings and factories, on the slopes of the Mamaev Kurgan hills, in the Red October Tractor Plant and in the key strategic building known as \\"Pavlov's House\\" (Yakov Pavlov was the commanding NCO of the platoon which defended the building). Most accounts state that of the 10,000 men of the division that crossed the Volga into the Battle of Stalingrad, only between 280 and 320 of them survived the struggle. This profligacy with life seems incredible to Western eyes, but was unremarkable during the conflict on the Eastern front. =Battle of Kursk= Following the Soviet victory at Stalingrad and the destruction of the German 6th Army, the 13th Guards are again pulled from the lines for re-fit and re-supply. Alongside the 5th Guards Army (Voronezh Front), the division was held in reserve south of Kursk, in order to counter the forthcoming German offensive there ‚Äì Operation Citadel. The original intention was for these two formations to counter-attack the Germans after the German assault had been ground down by the front line Soviet units, but both formations were committed to prevent a possible breakthrough. After several days of continuous fierce fighting (including the tank battle at Prokhorovka, in which the 13th Rifles' small number of armored units participated in), they successfully ground the elite Waffen-SS formations to a standstill. Meanwhile, the rifle battalions on the 13th held the line around Oboyan, repelling attacks from trenches. Relatively few casualties were sustained because the Germans were focussing their attention on Prokhorovka by the time they had moved up from the reserve area in the rear. =Liberation of Ukraine= Shortly thereafter, the 13th Rifles advanced south-westwards, where they participated in the Red Army's assault to liberate Ukraine from German control. The division took part in the in which they gained control of the town of Poltava after extremely fierce fighting, it was liberated on 23 September 1943. This is indicated by the designation of 13th Guards Rifle Division, Poltava (given in September 1943), which shows that the division was cited for their actions in seizing Polatava. After Poltava the division took part in the battle of the Dnieper. It was assigned to accomplish a false crossing of the Dnieper River to confuse the Germans and allow for crossings further north and south. Elements of the division crossed the river on floats and rafts to reach the island of Peschanny to the north-west of Kremenchuk where German infantry had occupied the west side of the island and had to be dislodged in hand-to-hand combat. The division forces sustained heavy losses in this operation when they were pinned down by enemy fire (even the deputy commander of the division Pavel Gayev was killed in action on the battlefield when commanding the operation). After the Kremenchuk the division fought in Krivoi Rog, Kiev, Uman-Botowni, and Lvov-Sandomir.Graham H. Turbiville, 'Restructuring the Soviet Ground Forces: Reduction, Mobilization, Force Generation,' Military Review, December 1989 =Advance into Germany= During the Red Army's final drive into Germany, starting with Operation Bagration beginning on 22 June 1944, the Division was a part of the 32nd Guards Rifle Corps or was under direct command of the 5th Guards Army (2nd Ukrainian Front). This force drove the Germans back through northern Ukraine and central Poland in to the northern regions of Germany itself. By the end of January 1945, the 1st Ukrainian Front, including the 13th Rifles, had reached the southern outskirts. Here, they participated in the Battle of Berlin where they combating for both objectives: Berlin itself and the Teltov Canal. The capture of the latter objective gave the Red Army a river crossing of the Elbe River, allowing the Russians to assault the heart of the Third Reich. Later service The division became part of the Central Group of Forces after the war and by 1 November 1945 had been converted into the 13th Guards Mechanised Division. The division was stationed in Vienna until 1955, when the group was disbanded following the Soviet withdrawal from Austria. The division was disbanded and its personnel and equipment became part of the 39th Mechanised Division of the 38th Army in the Carpathian Military District on 9 September 1955. On 4 December, the 39th Mechanised was redesignated as a Guards unit and inherited the lineage of the 13th Guards. In 1956, during Operation Whirlwind, the Soviet invasion of Hungary, the 38th Army covered the Austrian and Yugolavian borders of Hungary on the right bank of the Danube. After the end of the invasion, the division became part of the Southern Group of Forces at Veszpr√©m, where it remained for much of the Cold War. In December 1956, the 39th Guards became the 21st Guards Tank Division. In January 1965, the 21st Guards was renumbered as the 13th Guards Tank Division, restoring its World War II designation. According to American military sources corroborated by Vitaly Feskov and others, in September 1989, the division was transferred to Sovietske, Crimea in the Odessa Military District. It was disbanded there in December. The division's 130th Guards Tank Regiment, 56th Separate Reconnaissance Battalion, and 77th Separate Equipment Maintenance and Recovery Battalion became part of the 19th Guards Tank Division in Belarus. The division's final honorifics in 1988 included 'Poltava', Order of Lenin, Twice Red Banner, Suvorov and Kutuzov.

The common name comes from the grey to brown coloured shell. The Chinese name for this species translates as \\"Grey Sea-horse's Nest\\". The female of the species, like all argonauts, creates a paper-thin eggcase that coils around the octopus much like the way a nautilus lives in its shell (hence the name paper nautilus). The eggcase is characterised by a wide keel that gives it a square appearance, few rounded tubercles along the keel, and less than 40 smooth ribs across the sides of the shell. The shell is usually approximately 80 mm in length, although it can exceed 120 mm in exceptional specimens; the world record size is 121.5 mm. \\"Northern\\" form of Argonauta hians, Taiwan (121.5 mm) A. hians is cosmopolitan, occurring in tropical and subtropical waters worldwide. It is an extremely variable species and there appear to exist at least two distinct forms; a \\"southern\\" form and \\"northern\\" form (see images). The former is most abundant in the Philippines and South China Sea. It is a much smaller animal, with a shell that rarely exceeds 80 mm and lacks the winged protrusions for which this species is named. The \\"northern\\" form, which is found in the waters surrounding Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan, produces a much larger, darker and more robust shell that can reach 120 mm and has the characteristic winged protrusions. It is usually less elongated than that of the \\"southern\\" form and lacks its porcelain-like shine. Further research is needed to determine whether these forms represent two separate species or not. A. hians feeds primarily on pelagic molluscs. Remains of heteropods have been reported from the stomachs of A. hians. The species is preyed on by numerous predators. It has been reported in the stomach contents of Alepisaurus ferox from the south- western Pacific. Males of this species reach sexual maturity at a mantle length (ML) of about 7 mm, presumably the maximum size attained. Females mature at about half the size of Argonauta argo. They begin to secrete an eggcase at 6.5‚Äì7 mm ML. Egg laying usually commences when females reach 14‚Äì15 mm ML; by 18‚Äì20 mm ML female A. hians have laid their eggs. However, the size at which this takes place differs across the animal's range. Females grow to 50 mm ML, while males do not exceed 20 mm ML. One of the earliest known depictions of A. hians, from Index Testarum Conchyliorum (1742) by Niccol√≤ Gualtieri A. hians is known to cling to objects floating on the surface of the sea, including other argonauts. Chains of up to 20-30 argonauts of similar size have been reported. The first female in such chains usually clings to some inanimate object, while the other females hold on to the ventral part of the shell of the preceding animal. Gilbert L. Voss and Gordon Williamson observed six freshly mated female A. hians off Hong Kong that were swimming along in a string. In the open ocean, A. hians is often observed attached to jellyfish. It has been photographed atop the jellyfish Phyllorhiza punctata in the Philippines. This behaviour has been known for a long time, although little was understood about the relationship prior to the work of Heeger et al. in 1992. Underwater photographer Mark Strickland observed and photographed a female A. hians clinging to a jellyfish in the Mergui Archipelago, Andaman Sea, Myanmar. The argonaut was observed using the jellyfish as cover, rotating the animal to hide itself from potential predators (in this case the photographer). The argonaut was also seen using the jellyfish as a 'hunting platform', as it \\"manoeuvered its host close to a smaller comb jelly, quickly grasped it with another pair of tentacles and devoured it\\". A. hians appears to be closely related to the smaller A. bottgeri from the Indian Ocean and A. cornuta from the north-east Pacific. The oldest known fossil material of A. hians originates from the middle Pliocene Sadowara Formation of southwestern Japan. Iwatani, H., K. Murai, T. Irizuki, H. Hayashi & Y. Tanaka (2009).

Retrieved on 2017-03-17. ACP was initially a two-year junior college located in the American Church in Paris. Its inaugural class consisted of 100 students, many of whom were children of American service members and expatriates living in France and Europe. Fifteen part-time professors taught courses in Economics, English, Fine Arts, Government History, French, German, Spanish, Mathematics, Philosophy, and Sociology. In 1964, the first 40 students received their diplomas for two years of study, going on to complete their degree in the United States. Another key aspect of the university‚Äôs curriculum was its Cultural Program, originally set up by Marie DeLamater, Lloyd DeLamater‚Äôs wife, and Walter J. Brennan, the first Director of the Cultural Program. The program aimed to provide students with the opportunity to visit museums, monuments, and other cities in order to contextualize theory learned in class. The Cultural Program Office is still organising study trips at AUP today. ACP's student body changed with time, in part due to the decrease of US military presence in Europe. Thirteen years after its founding, over half of the student body was non-American. In 1978, ACP became an accredited four-year, degree-granting college, which was followed by the change of its name to The American University of Paris in 1988. In the year 2006, the University expanded its course offerings to include master‚Äôs courses. Most recently, the University has consolidated its campus, acquiring several new buildings in the seventh arrondissement: the largest of which is the Quai d‚ÄôOrsay Learning Commons, on the same street as the American Church in which the University began. Accreditation The American University of Paris is accredited in the United States by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. The American University of Paris is a non-profit educational institution incorporated in the state of Delaware and licensed by the State Board of Education as a Delaware institution of higher education. The American University of Paris is registered in the United States as a 501 (c)(3) not-for-profit organization. The university confers Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Master of Arts, and Master of Science degrees accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.

Global Professional Skills Program  Undergraduate students are encouraged to take part in the Global Professional Skills (GPS) Program, which launched in spring 2017. The aim of GPS is to improve career-focused skills and help students develop a personal narrative that will benefit them after graduation. Running throughout a student‚Äôs entire time at AUP, the program ends with an opportunity to present a personal narrative to a panel of alumni, employers, and faculty. The winning submission receives an award at graduation. In addition, the GPS Program brings together students‚Äô co-curricular achievements on a personal co-curricular record (CCR). Students‚Äô activities are registered from semester to semester through attendance tracking, synced through AUP‚Äôs student-facing online campus activity platform (AUP Engage). Students who complete GPS Program requirements will also earn a GPS Certificate and a mention of GPS achievement is added to their official AUP academic transcript. The GPS program is structured around AUP‚Äôs faculty-defined four core capabilities: * Professional: Independent, Creative Thinkers * Cultural Fluency: Adaptable Communicators with a Global Perspective * Leadership: Responsible, Empowered Leaders * Personal: Engaged, Lifelong Learners The GPS Program consists of the following three program requirements plus a fourth optional Panel Presentation. # Minimum involvement requirement. This is referred to as the GPS path, which lives on AUP Engage. This involves attending a minimum number of events and activities that feed into each of the four pillars listed above. # Designing Your Narrative (DYN) Workshop. This design thinking workshop for seniors (open to all, regardless of GPS participation) helps students make explicit the connections between experiences at university and post-graduation plans. This two-hour workshop promotes strategies for how students can ‚Äúpitch‚Äù themselves to prospective employers, graduate school admissions decision-makers, investors, etc. They are given the guidelines for how to translate all of this into their Personal Narrative ‚Äì the third and final requirement for the GPS Program. # Personal Narrative Submission. Students identify a specific objective, and then construct a narrative imagining they are presenting themselves in the context of that objective ‚Äì to an employer, graduate school admissions counsellor, angel investor, etc. The format of the narrative is open, but common formats include PowerPoint/Prezi, video, website, portfolio, essay, etc. # (Optional) Panel Presentations and Coaching Sessions. In addition to the three program requirements, GPS seniors have the option to present their personal narrative to a panel of AUP alumni, employers, and faculty in April of their senior year. Participants get immediate constructive feedback on their presentations, and top presenters are invited to the GPS President‚Äôs panel, which takes place during the GPS Award Ceremony, just before commencement. To prepare for the panel presentations (and in so doing, prepare for interviews), the Careers and Internships Office organizes a large number of collective drop-in style coaching sessions.  Cultural Program  The Cultural Program provides students with the opportunity to participate in cultural excursions, faculty- led study trips, and other activities.

History The Mansion was built over a number of years. Samuel Allen Long homesteaded the property, building a small stone house on the far east side of today's mansion, which he called Rotherwood after a favorite childhood farm. John W. Springer, a wealthy man with ties to politics, banking, and law, owned the ranch from 1897-1913. He sold the Mansion to his father-in-law, Col. William Hughes, who renamed the property \\"Sunland Ranch\\". Springer's daughter, Annie Clifton Springer Hughes, inherited the home after Col. Hughes passed in July 1918. It is unknown how much of the mansion the Springer/Hughes family built, but photos from the 1920s indicate that the footprint of the current building existed by 1926. Waite Phillips purchased Sunland Ranch from Annie Springer and her husband Lafayette Hughes (no relation to Colonel William Hughes) in 1920 and used it as a breeding location for high grade horses and cattle. He consolidated the ranch with other nearby land purchases to create a prodigious spread called Phillips Highland Ranch (no S) named after the Highland Hereford cattle he raised here. Waite conducted a renovation at the former Springer/Hughes home which included the addition of a western wing. A whimsical photograph taken of Waite‚Äôs son, Elliott Waite ‚ÄúChope,‚Äù sitting atop a pony in the middle of the living room reveals a unique view into family life at Phillips Highland Ranch. Waite owned the ranch for six years before commitments in Oklahoma forced him to sell it in 1926. In 1926, Frank E. Kistler purchased the Mansion renamed it the Diamond K Ranch, and began breeding operations that specialized in dairy and Angus cattle, sheep, chickens, and hogs. The Diamond K Ranch proved to be another successful venture for Frank. He, Florence, and their four children, quickly settled into Denver‚Äôs high society scene, rubbing elbows with the influential upper class. In 1929, Kistler remarried a beautiful widow named Leanna Antonides. They transformed the exterior style from a gothic stone castle to a classic English Tudor, included a sprawling front patio, and added to the western wing. Beautiful interior additions included a breathtaking clock and personalized fireplace facade in the living room. The renovations occurred simultaneously with a troubling period in US history, the Stock Market Crash of 1929, and Frank was among the many that lost millions during this crippling era. He was forced to sell the Diamond K Ranch in 1937 to Lawrence Phipps, Jr. and moved to Glenwood Springs where he bought and operated the Hotel Colorado and adjoining hot springs. Lawrence Phipps, Jr., a son of former Colorado Senator Lawrence C. Phipps, bought the property in 1937. A keen business sense served Lawrence well in all of his varied pursuits, but his true love in life was ranching, with a special fondness for horses. In 1929, he resurrected the Arapahoe Hunt Club, a group of horse backed hunters who, aided by a band of foxhounds, pursued coyote as opposed to the English tradition of foxes. At Lawrence‚Äôs request, Frank Kistler granted permission in 1929 to the club to headquarter and hunt at the Diamond K Ranch and a few years later Lawrence was honored with the title Master of the Hunt. During his days spent chasing the wily prey, Lawrence fell in love with the ranch‚Äôs rolling hills, and when Kistler finally succumbed to his financial woes and put the ranch up for sale in 1937, Lawrence did not hesitate to snatch it up. He renamed it Highlands Ranch and happily lived the remainder of his life here. Upon Lawrence‚Äôs death in 1976, the ranch passed to his estate which handled its sale to Marvin Davis, head of the Highlands Ventures Corporation. Marvin Davis marketed the Mansion and the surrounding property. In 1978, the Mission Viejo Corporation agreed to a two-year option agreement to finally become the official owners of the Highlands Ranch lands in 1979. In 1978, the Mansion was used as the setting of the fictional Venneford Ranch in the miniseries Centennial. In 1978, Highland Ventures sold the property to Mission Viejo Company and the development of the planned community called Highlands Ranch began. Mission Viejo subsequently sold the remaining undeveloped property in Highlands Ranch to Shea Homes in 1997. During that entire 30 year time frame, the Mansion sat basically empty. Shea Homes conveyed the Mansion to the Highlands Ranch Metro District in April 2010. The renovations of the Mansion cost $6 million. The Metro District used interest earnings on developer fees, collected for the purpose of building Highlands Ranch infrastructure, to fund the renovations. With the concurrence of Shea Homes as representative of the builders within the Highlands Ranch community, the Metro District Board of Directors decided that $4 million of developer fees be set aside as an \\"endowment'\\" Interest earnings on the endowment may be used to support the operations of the Mansion. The Metro District continues to operate the Mansion without the use of tax dollars. Highlands Ranch Metro District Now Owners of Mansion The Highlands Ranch Metro District became the current owner of the Highlands Ranch Mansion in April 2010. The Metro District developed a projected timeline for the next couple years. The Metro District proceeded with the design of the building renovation and managed the site planning process and subsequent Douglas County approvals. Renovations to the Mansion commenced in 2011. The renovations of the Mansion cost $6 million, with another $4 million dedicated to an endowment fund that will use interest earned to support future operations.Tour of Mansion a Walk Through History, Colorado News On June 15, 2012, the Highlands Ranch Metro District hosted the Grand Re-Opening of the Mansion.

Biography Juliana belonged to the noble Falconieri family of Florence. Her uncle, Alexis Falconieri, was one of the seven founders of the Servite Order. Under his influence, she decided at a young age to follow the consecrated life. After her father's death, she received c. 1285 the habit of the Third Order of the Servites from Philip Benizi, then Prior General of that Order. She remained at home following the rule Benizi had given her until her mother's death, when Juliana and several companions moved into a house of their own in 1305. This became the first convent of the Sisters of the Third Order of Servites. Juliana would serve as Superior until the end of her life. Kirsch, Johann Peter. \\"St. Juliana Falconieri.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 30 Aug. 2014 The Servites' dress consisted of a black gown, secured by a leather girdle, and a white veil. Because the gown had short sleeves to facilitate work, people called the sisters of the new Order \\"Mantellate.\\" The sisters devoted themselves especially to the care of the sick and other works of mercy. It is saidFrom Laudate, gracie vargas, > she would often fall in to long moments and hours of ecstacy... She was > daily caring for the sick in the streets, homes, and in hospitals and was > known for using her own lips to suck out the infection of her patients open > sores without fear of contracting any illness. Truly a magnificent act. > Juliana directed the community of Servite Tertiaries for 35 years and was > more of a servant to her subordinates than a mistress. A putative miracle mentioned in the liturgical texts for her feast day, is said to have occurred at Juliana's death. At this time, unable to receive Holy Communion because of constant vomiting, she requested the priest to spread a corporal upon her chest and lay the Eucharistic host on it. Shortly thereafter, the host disappeared and Juliana died, on June 19, 1341.The Catholic Encyclopedia article (alone) gives June 12 as the date of her death, perhaps as a misprint. The image of a cross, just like the one on the host, was found on her breast. Immediately after her death she was honored as a saint. The Servite Order was approved by Pope Martin V in the year 1420. Pope Benedict XIII recognized the devotion long paid to her and granted the Servites permission to celebrate the feast of the Blessed Juliana. Pope Clement XII canonized her in the year 1737, and extended the celebration of her feast day (June 19) to the entire Church. Juliana is usually represented in the habit of her Order with a host upon her breast.

Real world spaceship is being constructed by robotic arms underneath the main truss, and a spaceplane is entering an enclosed hangar. Space docks, as part of a wider space logistics infrastructure, are considered a relevant part of a true space-faring society. Scientists of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics have proposed that future, near-term LEO space facilities should include \\"a large space dock making possible the on-orbit assembly and maintenance of large space facilities, space platforms, and spacecraft\\" (see image for design concept).

Science fiction Space docks in science fiction play an important role in the construction and maintenance of space vessels. They add a depth of realism to the fictional worlds they appear in and continue the nautical parallels that most space-based science fiction uses. Space docks serve the same purpose as their non-fictional terrestrial dry dock counterparts, being used for construction, repairs, refits and restorations of spacecraft. Some play significant plot roles, others hide in the background in many sci-fi media. Such science fiction settings as Star Wars, Babylon 5, the HonorverseShipyard types (forum post regarding the Honorverse space docks, alleged to be from David Weber himself) and the Foundation series mention or allude substantially to such facilities. =Star Trek= Space docks of varying styles and sizes have made a number of appearances in the Star Trek science fiction universe. Often they were shown as open, metal framed structures in which a vessel could be docked. The first such drydock was seen in Star Trek: The Motion Picture with the refit USS Enterprise (NCC-1701) contained within such an \\"orbital dockyard\\" before being sent to intercept an alien vessel on course for Earth ‚Äî \\"chronologically\\" speaking in the storyline, an earlier example (set in 2151) also housed the first Enterprise of Capt. Jonathan Archer at the start of the Star Trek: Enterprise series. A larger facility, known as Earth Spacedock was seen for the first time in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. These were huge orbital command installations incorporating internal space docks that could be completely enclosed ‚Äì starships could enter through bay doors to receive supplies or maintenance. A third type of space dock was seen occasionally in The Next Generation and following series. This type of dock had a large command pod at the top, with arms underneath that could house a starship. The Enterprise-D was refitted and repaired in such a dock following combat with the Borg in 2367. =Babylon 5= Dock facilities were occasionally seen on the Babylon 5 television series and movies. In the Babylon 5 universe, the space docks were structures deployed outside the station when larger ships were in need of repair. The Babylon-station itself effectively served as a Space dock with internal docking facilities for freighters, personal transport vessels and its own complement of fighter-craft designated to protect the station. During the events of the movie A Call to Arms, the Excalibur and the Victory were shown in the dry dock facilities in which they were constructed. The dock was destroyed by the Drakh following their attack on Earth, which would halt the construction of further Victory class destroyers until the facilities could be rebuilt. =Star Wars= Large space dock facilities were common above major shipbuilding worlds, such as Sullust and Corellia. Most notably, the massive Kuat Drive Yards corporation owned many facilities in the extensive moon system in the Kuat system and even a massive ringworld dry dock around Kuat (the planet) itself.

Named MMUnion until August 2014; Manchester Metropolitan Students' Union (MMSU) until July 2005; and Manchester Polytechnic Students' Union (MPSU) before the institution gained its university status in 1992. The union has one building on the All Saints campus in Manchester after the Crewe campus closed its doors in Cheshire in 2019. The union is affiliated to the National Union of Students (NUS). The union has an independent advice centre available for all students at the University as well as an activities centre for the sports clubs and societies at MMU. Governance The Union MMUThe union is controlled by the Union Officers Group formed of 6 current students and graduates of the university, elected by the students to control the Union on their behalf. =Structure pre 2008 Governance Review= Prior to the 2008 review of the Union's governance structures, there were 17 Executive Officers each with their own areas of responsibility in addition to acting in the interests of the Union as a whole. Seven of the officers were sabbaticals. Two sabbaticals based in MMU Cheshire and the other five in Manchester. The ten remaining officers were based across both campuses, were non-sabbaticals and studied during their term in office receiving no payment. The Union's sovereign body was Student Council, to which all committees, representatives and officers, either directly or indirectly, were answerable. The Student Council, chaired by an independent non-executive student, was composed of the Executive Committee and students elected from each faculty of the university. The Chair and Vice-Chair of the Athletic Unions, and one representative of each Societies Union were ex officio members of the council. =Structure from 2009= Board of Trustees From the start of 2009, the highest level of governance has been the Board of Trustees, composed of the sabbatical officers and up to 3 external trustees, and 1 co-opted trustee.; The Trustee Board has the ability to call binding referendums on issues and motions as it sees fit, referendums may also be called by students directly by secure petition. Union Officers Group Policy decisions are made by the Union Officers Group, which meets weekly. The Union Officers Group as of the academic year 2020/21 is structured as; * President: Evelyn Sweeney * Education Officer: Bran Catron * Sports Officer: Fabienne Robertson-Barnett * Wellbeing Officer: America Fabiana Pardo-Gomez * Societies and Development Officer: Savannah Middleton The Union Officers Group consists of five sabbatical officers, and no non-sabbaticals, as of the 2019/20 academic year. The Union Officers Group is held accountable to and must prepare a report to Student Forums.; The Union Officers Group is structured as; * President: Anna Welsh * Education Officer: Lucy Follon * Sports Officer: Ross Sharmon * Wellbeing Officer: Andy Harmon * Societies and Development Officer: Evelyn Sweeney Student Forums Student Forums are open to all students, held 5 times a year to discuss any pertinent topic relating to the student experience or Union provision in order to receive feedback and shape the Union‚Äôs work in that area. Student Forums are based around 3 Areas *Better Union - a Forum for discussion of opinions, ideas and plans based around improvements to the union *Better University - a Forum for discussion of opinions, ideas and plans around improvement to academics and university related issues *Better Manchester / Crewe - a Forum for discussion of opinions ideas and plans around improving student lives and reputations in the community. Forums will be run both in meeting form and online via Twitter and email submissions. Any student will be able to submit ideas and changes to these forums and they will then be put up for debate. If a consensus of agreement is reached then the union will pass the policy to the Trustee Board for final approval. If this motion is turned down by those present, it will be rejected and sent back to the owner. If a consensus cannot be reached the decision will be put to a whole student referenda to allow larger debate and discussion and voting on the issue. Student Groups Student Groups are to be chaired by elected Student Reps. They fill the criteria of aiding to represent hard to reach, less engaged and under represented groups of students ranging from Mature and Postgraduates, International and LGBTQ+. Sports and societies The Union supports current students to manage and run all the official sports clubs and societies at the University. There is a range of societies on offer, covering a variety of different groups including Academic, Campaigning and Liberation, Faith, Hobbies and Interests, Media, Music and Performance, Nationality and Culture and Political Perspectives. Hive Radio Student media is an expanding area of the union. Hive Radio, MMU's student radio station, is a very active society, using its resources within the university and their technical ability to help promote their own activity, as well as expand into other areas of interest, such as sports commentating, radio dramas, and online journalism through the Hive Radio website reviewing music events & performances in Manchester and surrounding areas, films, and other issues of interest. Campaigns The main campaign for the union in 2012 has been 'The Real Cost' campaign. This is based around students being given the real cost upfront of being a student at MMU and revealing everything considered a 'hidden cost' this included things such as work books, club and society memberships, printing and technical supplies. The union is currently looking at working with MMU to banish these to allow MMU students better control of their finances. In recent years the students' union have successfully campaigned against Business School exams being held in a tent, and supported Shane Ward on his way to winning The X Factor. It also started a scheme of co-operative housing for students in Manchester. The union also successfully lobbied for access privileges to be reinstated, for students of MMU, at the John Rylands University Library of the University of Manchester. In 2008, The union campaigned on the ¬£2.7 million of bursaries that the university predicted to, but hadn't, paid out to its students in the last year. This is part of a wider campaign on education funding and the union is supporting and promoting the National Union of Students' Broke & Broken campaign. The union won a campaign in 2008 to extend the library hours until midnight and is currently working on to make 24-hour computer drop-in-centre available for students. The union, together with the MMU LGBT society and the National Union of Students, are running the Please Give Blood Because I Can't campaign, lobbying and demonstrating against the National Blood Services lifetime ban on gay and bisexual men from giving blood. They are running a series of demonstrations in Manchester city centre to raise awareness and encourage people to give blood on behalf of a healthy gay man who cannot, in which the President of the union and Chair of Student Council gave blood. Debates are also being held on the issue. =Late Campaign= In autumn 2008 the union launched the Late Campaign after consultation with Course Reps, who expressed concern that students were suffering because of late and cancelled lectures that were never rearranged - The Late Campaign was organised to find out how many students across MMU were finding this to be the case. The University Student Agreement (the statement that the University agreed would be the principles of an MMU education) says that ‚Äústaff will give reasonable notice of changes to the teaching timetable and will arrange for classes to be re-scheduled or for alternative delivery of the content, or will explain why this is not possible‚Äù. The Students' Union have stated they \\"think that this is the best way to test whether that's actually happening and to help identify where there are problem areas.\\" \\"This is a variation on traditional course rep activity, collecting information in a way that is easier for modern students. We fully understand that lectures may need to be cancelled and re-arranged for legitimate reasons and believe that it is crucial to establish a means of measuring the impact of cancelled lectures. We have faith that the results will demonstrate the professional approach adopted by the majority of staff\\" Nicola Lee, President Union buildings The Union has a presence and buildings on all MMU campuses =Manchester= The Students' Union building, Oxford Road Originally occupying the Righton Building on the corner of Cavendish Street and Lower Ormond Street, the union moved in 1982 to a purpose built building at 99 Oxford Road. The new building was opened by Bobby Charlton and in 1984 it was named the Mandela Building after Winnie Mandela, during the ANC Year of the Woman. Following the death of Stompie Moeketsi in 1989, an event with which Winnie Mandela was linked, moves were made to change the name to something less controversial and for a time it was named the Bruce Forsyth building after the popular entertainer. The name was dropped shortly after. A Barclays Bank mini-branch was opened in the building shortly after the bank had cut its links with apartheid South Africa, following an NUS lead campaign. The Union's facilities were arranged over 4 floors and included; *Ground Floor; Reception, Barclays ATM, The Union Shop, Icycle and the Student Officers Office. *First Floor; \\"The met\\" union bar and club, opened in September 2009, formerly K2 nightclub. *Second Floor; Student Activities Centre, the VP Student Activities office and a campaigns, societies and students open space. *Third Floor; Student Advice Centre, accredited as a Community Legal Service. Union Administration, Finance Office, Committee Meeting Rooms and Conference Facilities. In January 2015, the union moved to a new purpose built building on the All Saints campus, directly adjacent to the University's Cambridge and Cavendish Halls of Residence, on Cambridge Street, next to the Salutation pub, which the Union now runs. The new building incorporates a dance studio, radio studio, media suite, and conferencing facilities, as well as a new large open multi purpose space which is used for club nights, fashion shows, freshers and refreshers fairs and also stalls and campaigns when required. =Crewe= The Union Building was greatly expanded in 2009 using large studio space given by the University to the Students' Union. The New union building now has a prominent position at the centre of the Crewe campus. The new Union Building has a large retail area, a new Student Advice Centre office, accredited as a Community Legal Service, Student Activities centre, Finance Office, Committee Meeting Rooms, Internet Cafe and the Offices of the Vice President (Cheshire) and Vice President (Student Activities Cheshire).

Early life Lala Jagat Narain was born at Wazirabad, Gujranwala District (now in Pakistan) in 1899.Lala Jagat Narain He graduated from D.A.V. College, Lahore in 1919, and joined the Law College, Lahore. Freedom struggle He left his studies in 1920 at the call of Mahatma Gandhi to join the Non-cooperation movement. He was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment. In jail he acted as Lala Lajpat Rai's personal secretary. In 1924 he became the editor of Bhai Parmanand's weekly Hindi language paper Akashvani. He participated in the Satyagraha movement and was in jail for about nine years on different occasions. His wife was in jail for six months and his eldest son, Ramesh Chandra, was arrested during the Quit India movement. Political life Punjab Kesari, header with the founders Lala Jagat Narain & Romesh Chander) Narain was President of the Lahore City Congress Committee for seven years, leader of the Congress Party in the Lahore Corporation, a member of the Punjab Provincial Congress Committee for more than thirty years and member of the All-India Congress Committee for about 30 years. Lala Jagat Narain was detained under MISA during the Indira Gandhi's Emergency which was later on revoked on 4 January 1977. Following this incident, he parted ways with the party. Narain had come to Jalandhar as a refugee from Lahore and started an Urdu daily, Hind Samachar in 1948. Urdu then was the language of the salaried urban men of Punjab, the people who could afford the time and money for a newspaper. But Urdu in independent India lacked government support. In the schools of Punjab, Punjabi and Hindi became the languages and Gurmukhi and Devanagari the scripts of instruction. In 1965, Jagat Narain founded Punjab Kesari, a Hindi daily. Death and legacy Jagat Narain on a 2013 stamp of India Jagat was a critic of khalistan movement , he survived an assassination attempt in January 1981. However on 9 September 1981, he was shot dead by a two-man team of assassins. Nachhatar Singh was arrested from the scene of crime. Dalbir Singh and Swaran Singh, are the other accused in the case. Dilbir Singh, a companion of Bhindranwale, said that Bhindranwale ordered the killing of Jagat Narain.Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale: Five Myths Dilbir Singh related the following account of how masterfully Bhindranwale ordered the killing of Lala Jagat Narain, proprietor-editor of the Hind Samachar group of newspapers: And in one edition Lala had written in an editorial comment that Taura [Tohra, then president of the S.G.P.C.] and Ajnoha [then jathedar of the Akal Takht] are traitors. On that day in a great fury he [Bhindranwale] called upon someone to read aloud what Lala had said. There was quiet. 'Our turban has been torn from our heads,' he proclaimed. Then one of his followers asked, 'What are your orders?' Again in anger, he said 'Orders, you need orders! What orders? Are you blind?' Now you see he did not say anything. And they said it. 'O.K.' meaning thereby, we'll finish this man. So, then, 3‚Äì4 days later, Lala was coming from Ludhiana and they fired upon him. The White Paper issued by the government of India, mentioned that Narain was assassinated because of his criticism of Bhindrawale. He was present during the clash that occurred between Nirankaris and Akhand Kirtani Jatha members, and stood witness at the Karnal trial against Bhindrawale. In 1981, Bhindranwale fortified inside Gurudwara Gurdarshan Parkash at Mehta Chowk, but was persuaded to surrender on 20 September 1981.

History When construction of the stadium started it was not yet known which football club would make it its home ground. Both Rigtersbleek, Enschedese Boys and Sportclub Enschede were interested. Enschedese Boys were champions of eastern Netherlands in 1950 and appeared to have the best claim on the stadium.

On 8 August 1956 the Diekman was opened with a match between Sportclub Enschede and Preu√üen M√ºnster from Germany attended by 22,000 spectators. Abe Lenstra scored the first goal from a penalty and the match ended in a 3‚Äì0 win for Sportclub Enschede. In 1965 Sportclub Enschede merged with Enschedese Boys to create FC Twente and on 12 August 1965 FC Twente became the occupant of the Diekman stadium in a friendly match against Aston Villa. On 3 November 1968 FC Twente won a home match against Ajax with 5-1 for a home crowd of 26,500 spectators which was the attendance record for the Diekman.

Family Rochester's family were 'minor Essex gentry' associated with the Earls of Oxford. According to Ross, Robert Rochester, esquire, was Comptroller of the Household to John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, at a fee of ¬£10 per year, from about 1495 until his death in 1508. Robert Rochester was born at Terling, Essex, the third son of John Rochester and Grisold Writtle, daughter of Walter Writtle of Bobbingworth. Grisold Writtle's sister, Eleanor, married James Walsingham, and was the mother of Edmund Walsingham, Lieutenant of the Tower of London. Rochester's younger brother, Blessed John Rochester, was a Carthusian priest and martyr who was executed in York in May 1537, and beatified in 1888. Career According to Hughes, by 1542 Rochester had been appointed receiver to John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford, and was also appointed bailiff of the Earl's manor of Lavenham in Suffolk. By 1551 Rochester had been appointed Comptroller of the Household to Mary Tudor, Henry VIII's elder daughter by Catherine of Aragon. In that year, the Privy Council ordered Rochester to stop any priest from saying mass in the Princess's household; Rochester refused, and was imprisoned in the Tower (according to the National ArchivesThe Oxfordian he was imprisoned in the Fleet), and replaced as Comptroller by Sir Anthony Wingfield. The next year, he was released to retire to the county because of his health. He was soon allowed to resume his post as Comptroller. When the Princess assumed the throne as Mary I, she rewarded Rochester for his faithful service, making him Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and appointing him to the inner circle of the Privy Council. He served as a Member of Parliament for Essex from 1553 to 1555. Rochester never married. He died on 28 November 1557. William Rochester, Sir Robert's older brother received a third of Robert's lands. Robert was buried on 4 December at the Charterhouse at Sheen, the house reconstituted by the remnant of the English Carthusians under Dom Maurice Chauncy. He was succeeded in his post as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster by his nephew, Sir Edward Waldegrave (died 1 September 1561), son of John Waldegrave (died 1543) and Rochester's sister Lora (died c. 1545).

Rizzetta discovered the hammered dulcimer while working in the repair of guitars and illustrated books in the 1960s to put himself through graduate school. His first exposure to the instrument was hearing the traditional player Chet Parker. Sam and his wife Carrie moved east around 1968, and he took a job with the Smithsonian Institution. Within a few years he transitioned to playing and building instruments on a full-time basis. In 1974, Rizzetta and Paul Reisler formed a string band called Trapezoid, along with Pete Vigour and Paul Yeaton. The group's trademark was hammered dulcimer quartets, which included soprano and bass models designed by Rizzetta. Rizzetta performed with the group until 1978, when he decided to pursue solo playing, and concentrate more on building and composing. As a performer he is best known for his hammered dulcimer playing, but his recordings often feature the Appalachian dulcimer as well. He was active in teaching the dulcimer at the Augusta Heritage Center at Davis and Elkins College for many years starting in 1981. Rizzetta has also been a regular columnist in Dulcimer Players News, writing the Technical Dulcimer column. Rizzetta is particularly noted for a number of innovations in hammered dulcimer design. These include bridge markers (a standard feature of modern instruments), chromatic designs, extra bridges, damper pedals, and many more. Rizzetta has collaborated closely with the Dusty Strings Company of Seattle, Washington; they have produced a \\"Rizzetta series\\" of chromatic models for many years.

The stadium is mostly known outside Corsica for the Furiani disaster, which took place on 5 May 1992 when one of the four terraces fell, causing the death of 18 people and injuring more than 2,300 others. =Background= When they reached the semi-final of the 1991‚Äì92 Coupe de France, the draw gave Bastia a tie against Olympique de Marseille, the Division 1 leader at the time. In order to accommodate more fans, the club board decided to create a temporary terrace instead of the old Tribune Claude Papi which could only take 750 fans. The new capacity of the terrace was 10,000. =Matchday= An hour before the start of the match, problems were already noticeable, such as the instability of the structure. At 8:20 p.m., the whole structure collapsed, with supporters and journalists in the wreckage. Every medical option on the island was exhausted. The victims were eventually evacuated to the mainland, including Marseille. Poretta Airport was quoted as resembling more of a hospital than an airport that night. =Aftermath= On 8 May, an official investigation began in order to find who was responsible. After the disaster, the FFF decided - after some hesitation - to cancel the remaining matches in the Cup. On the 12th, the investigators came to the conclusion that there had been a number of rules broken concerning the terrace. All these findings led to the investigation's conclusion \\"Le soir du 5 mai, il n'y a pas eu de fatalit√© . (There has been no fate the night of the 5th May)\\". Ultimately, at the trial a year later, the main protagonists were proved guilty but were only given prison sentences of less than two years.

It was an evolution of three earlier locomotives which had been built for Coalbrookdale, Penydarren ironworks and Wylam colliery. Demonstration runs began in July 1808, and Catch Me Who Can was the first locomotive in the world to haul fare-paying passengers. Catch Me Who Can was constructed during 1808 by the engineers John Urpeth Rastrick and John Hazledine at their foundry in Bridgnorth, England. It was demonstrated to the public at Trevithick's \\"Steam Circus\\", a circular track in Bloomsbury, just south of the present-day Euston Square tube station, in London. Members of the public could pay to ride in carriages pulled by Catch Me Who Can around this track. During these demonstration runs, the locomotive reached a reported speed of between and . The circus closed following a derailment caused by one of the rails breaking underneath the locomotive. While the advantages and applications of steam locomotives had been demonstrated, the venture was a financial failure that played a significant part in Trevithick's bankruptcy in 1809. History =Design and construction= Netherlands Railway Museum. During the late 1700s and early 1800s, the inventor and mining engineer Richard Trevithick was the primary developer of the steam locomotive.\\"Richard Trevithick and Catch Me Who Can.\\" Institute of Mechanical Engineers, 13 April 2010. He wanted to present his new invention to the general public, and he looked for a suitable site to demonstrate his invention. He chose Bloomsbury, directly south of the Euston Road, near London's Euston Square. The site is believed to be under University College London‚Äôs Chadwick Building, which now houses the Centre for Transport Studies. A circular track in diameter was built, on which a locomotive and a small number of carriages would run. Members of the public could view and ride on this train for a fare of 1 shilling. Trevithick hoped this would be a commercial venture, as well as creating publicity and hopefully demand for more locomotives. Trevithick's fourth railway locomotive was built new for the Steam Circus. It was named Catch Me Who Can by the sister of Davies Gilbert. This new locomotive differed from the previous locomotive designs: instead of a horizontal cylinder, flywheel, and geared drive, Catch Me Who Can used a vertical cylinder encased in the boiler, driving one pair of wheels directly. The cylinder was in diameter, with a stroke. The boiler was Trevithick's return-flue type, complete with an internal firebox. The locomotive was similar to an engine that Trevithick had built in 1803 to power a dredger for use on the Thames. =Operations= In spite of his goal of introducing steam locomotion to the public, Trevithick built a high wooden fence around the demonstration track, concealing it from view to all but those who paid to enter. This may have been done as a means of increasing revenue. Catch Me Who Can became the world‚Äôs first locomotive to haul fare-paying passengers. Some claimed that performance of the locomotive was inferior to that of a horse over a 24 hour endurance test. Trevithick claimed that Catch Me Who Can could travel over in that time. The locomotive was reported to have reached a top speed of on the circular track and Trevithick was of the opinion that it was capable of on straight track. Operation of Catch Me Who was hindered by the soft ground that the track was laid on. Trial runs began around 24 July 1808, but almost immediately the ground under the track sank, causing the iron rails to break as the 8-ton locomotive passed over them. Trevithick had the track taken up and timber baulks laid under it to provide a more stable footing. By 28 July, almost all the track had been relaid and the train ran again soon afterwards. Within two months of its original opening, the locomotive again derailed. By then, fewer people were paying the shilling fare. Trevithick had spent all of his savings on setting up the Steam Circus, and he could not pay to have the railway fixed, and it closed. Impact In the long term, the Steam Circus was not a fruitless venture. Trevithick had become the first person to successfully prove that a steam locomotive on iron rails was feasible. It would be another 20 years before Trevithick‚Äôs concept was fully realised at the Rainhill Trials of 1829, at which the pioneering railway engineers George Stephenson and Robert Stephenson successfully demonstrated the potential of their locomotive ‚Äô‚ÄôRocket‚Äô‚Äô.

Lawsonite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system in prismatic, often tabular crystals. Crystal twinning is common. It forms transparent to translucent colorless, white, and bluish to pinkish grey glassy to greasy crystals. Refractive indices are nŒ±=1.665, nŒ≤=1.672 - 1.676, and nŒ≥=1.684 - 1.686. It is typically almost colorless in thin section, but some lawsonite is pleochroic from colorless to pale yellow to pale blue, depending on orientation. The mineral has a Mohs hardness of 8 and a specific gravity of 3.09. It has perfect cleavage in two directions and a brittle fracture. Lawsonite is a metamorphic mineral typical of the blueschist facies. It also occurs as a secondary mineral in altered gabbro and diorite. Associate minerals include epidote, titanite, glaucophane, garnet and quartz. It is an uncommon constituent of eclogite. It was first described in 1895 for occurrences in the Tiburon peninsula, Marin County, California. It was named for geologist Andrew Lawson (1861‚Äì1952) of the University of California by two of Lawson's graduate students, Charles Palache and Frederick Leslie Ransome.Edson S. Bastin, \\"Biographical Memoir of Frederick Leslie Ransome, 1868-1935\\", National Academy of Sciences Biographic Memoirs XXII: 156 and Charles Palache with Frederick Leslie Ransome, \\"Uber Lawsonit, ein neues Gesteins-bildendes Mineral aus Californien\\" Zeits. Krist. 24 (1896): 588-592. Composition Lawsonite is a metamorphic silicate mineral related chemically and structurally to the epidote group of minerals. It is close to the ideal composition of CaAl2Si2O7(OH)2 . H2O giving it a close chemical composition with anorthite CaAl2Si2O8 (its anhydrous equivalent), yet lawsonite has greater density and a different Al coordination (Comodi et al., 1996). The substantial amount of water bound in lawsonite‚Äôs crystal structure is released during its breakdown to denser minerals during prograde metamorphism. This means lawsonite is capable of conveying appreciable water to shallow depths in subducting oceanic lithosphere (Clarke et al., 2006). Experimentation on lawsonite to vary its responses at different temperatures and different pressures is among its most studied aspects, for it is these qualities that affect its abilities to carry water down to mantle depths, similar to other OH-containing phases like antigorite, talc, phengite, staurolite, and epidote (Comodi et al., 1996). Geologic occurrence Lawsonite is a very widespread mineral and has attracted considerable interest because of its importance as a marker of moderate pressure (6-12 kb) and low temperature (300 - 400 ¬∞C) conditions in nature (Clarke et al., 2006). This mainly occurs along continental margins (subduction zones) such as those found in: the Franciscan Formation in California at Reed Station, Tiburon Peninsula of Marin County, California; the Piedmont metamorphic rocks of Italy; and schists in New Zealand, New Caledonia, China, Japan and from various points in the circum- Pacific orogenic belt. Crystal structure Though lawsonite and anorthite have similar compositions, their structures are quite different. While anorthite has a tetrahedral coordination with Al (Al substitutes for Si in feldspars), lawsonite has an octahedral coordination with Al, making it an orthorhombic sorosilicate with a space group of Cmcm which consists of Si2O7 Groups and O, OH, F, and H2O with cations in [4] and/or > [4] coordination. This is much similar to the epidote group which lawsonite is often found in conjunction with, which are also sorosilicates because their structure consists of two connected SiO4 tetrahedra plus connecting cation. The water contained in its structure is made possible by cavities formed by rings of two Al octahedral and two Si2O7 groups, each containing an isolated water molecule and calcium atom. The hydroxyl units are bound to the edge-sharing Al octahedral (Baur, 1978). Physical properties Lawsonite has crystal habits of orthorhombic prismatic, which are crystals shaped like slender prisms, or tubular figures, which are form dimensions that are thin in one direction, both with two perfect cleavages. This crystal is transparent to translucent and varies in color from white to pale blue to colorless with a white streak and a vitreous or greasy luster. It has a relatively low specific gravity of 3.1g/cm3, and a pretty high hardness of 7.5 on Mohs scale of hardness, slightly higher than quartz. Under the microscope, lawsonite can be seen as blue, yellow, or colorless under plane polarized light while the stage is rotated. Lawsonite has three refractive indices of nŒ± = 1.665 nŒ≤ = 1.672 - 1.676 nŒ≥ = 1.684 - 1.686, which produces a birefringence of Œ¥ = 0.019 - 0.021 and an optically positive biaxial interference figure. Significance of lawsonite Lawsonite is a significant metamorphic mineral as it can be used as an index mineral for high pressure conditions. Index minerals are used in geology to determine the degree of metamorphism a rock has experienced. New metamorphic minerals form through solid-state cation exchanges following changing pressure and temperature conditions imposed upon the protolith (pre- metamorphosed rock). This new mineral that is produced in the metamorphosed rock is the index mineral, which indicates the minimum pressure and temperature the protolith must have achieved in order for that mineral to form. Lawsonite is known to form in high pressure, low temperature conditions, most commonly found in subduction zones where cold oceanic crust subducts down oceanic trenches into the mantle (Comodi et al., 1996). The initially low temperature of the slab, and fluids taken down with it manage to depress isotherms and keep the slab much colder than the surrounding mantle, allowing for these unusual high pressure, low temperature conditions. Glaucophane, kyanite and zoisite are other common minerals in the blueschist facies and are commonly found to coexist (Pawley et al., 1996). This assemblage is diagnostic of this facies.

Kornbluth, originally published in Galaxy in April 1951. It was included in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume Two after being voted one of the best novellas up to 1965. The story follows John Barlow, who was put into suspended animation by a freak accident involving a dental drill and anesthesia. Barlow is revived hundreds of years in the future. The world seems mad to Barlow until he discovers the 'Problem of Population': due to a combination of intelligent people not having children and excessive breeding by less intelligent people and coupled with the development of more sophisticated machinery that makes it less important to possess intelligence in one's working life (see Fertility and intelligence), the world is full of morons, with the exception of an elite few who work slavishly to keep order. Barlow, who was a shrewd real estate con man in his day, has a solution to sell to the elite, in exchange for being made World Dictator. Background In the \\"Introduction\\" to The Best of C. M. Kornbluth, Frederik Pohl (Kornbluth's friend and collaborator) explains some of the inspiration to \\"The Marching Morons\\". The work was written after Pohl suggested that Kornbluth write a follow-up story that focuses on the future presented in the short story \\"The Little Black Bag\\". In contrast to the \\"little black bag\\" arriving in the past from the future, Kornbluth wanted to write about a man arriving in the future from the past. To explain sending a man to the future, Kornbluth borrowed from David Butler's 1930 science fiction film, Just Imagine, in which a man is struck by lightning, trapped in suspended animation, and reanimated in the future. In \\"The Marching Morons\\", after the character John Barlow is told how he had been in a state of suspended animation, Barlow mutters, \\"Like that movie.\\" Plot  The human population is now 3 million highbred elite and 5 billion morons, and the \\"average\\" IQ is 45 (whereas now an IQ score of 100 is average, by definition). Several generations before the onset of the story, the small number of remaining 100-and-higher-IQ technocrats work feverishly to keep the morons alive. The elite have had little success in solving the Problem (also called \\"Poprob\\", for 'population problem', in the story) for several reasons: * The morons must be managed or else there will be chaos, resulting in billions of deaths and \\"five hundred million tons of rotting flesh\\"; * It is not possible to sterilize all of the morons; * Propaganda against large families is insufficient, because every biological drive is towards fertility (the story predates the development of hormonal contraception). The elite have tried everything rational to solve the population problem but the problem cannot be solved rationally. The solution requires a way of thinking that no longer exists ‚Äì Barlow's \\"vicious self-interest\\" and his knowledge of ancient history. Barlow derives a solution based on his experience in scamming people into buying worthless land and knowledge of lemmings' mass migration into the sea: convince the morons to travel to Venus in spaceships that will kill their passengers out of view of land. The story predates the moon landing, and the safety of space travel is summed up in a description of a rocket that crashed on the moon. Propaganda depicts Venus as a tropical paradise, with \\"blanket trees\\", \\"ham bushes\\" and \\"soap roots\\". In a nationalistic frenzy, every country tries to send as many of their people to Venus as possible to stake their claim. Barlow's help includes using his knowledge of Nazi Propaganda tactics: postcards are sent from the supposedly happy new residents of Venus to relatives left behind, describing a wonderful, easy life, in the same way as fraudulent postcards were sent to relatives of those incinerated in the Nazi death-camps. But Barlow is duped by his erstwhile assistants. Barlow does not realize that the elite despise him as they despise all people from the past for having not solved The Problem earlier. In the end, Barlow is placed on a spaceship to Venus to share the fate of his victims, and realises that murder will out and that crime does not pay just before he dies. References in other works The 1954 novel Search the Sky, a collaboration with Frederik Pohl, uses the same plot idea in the last section; so does the 1980 novel The Restaurant at the End of the Universe with the Golgafrinchan Ark. In the short story The Little Black Bag, a highly sophisticated medical kit designed for use by a person of limited intelligence is sent back to the 20th century by mistake. It appears to have come from the future described in The Marching Morons, with the future genocide implied. The 1987 film Robocop adapts the gameshow catchphrase \\"Would you buy that for a quarter?\\" but modernises it to \\"I'd buy that for a dollar!\\" The 2006 film Idiocracy borrows the idea of the world population becoming moronic through the stupid breeding more, but it does not have genocide or a super-clever elite.

Mitchell often performed his nightclub act in and around Palm Springs, California, and anointed himself the \\"King of Palm Springs.\\" Early life and career Mitchell was born Dominic Salvatore Miceli in Farrell, Pennsylvania. In 1951, he teamed with comic Sammy Petrillo for a nightclub act. Mitchell's cabaret-style crooning and Petrillo's manic, rubber- faced clowning bore more than a passing resemblance to the popular team of Martin and Lewis (Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, whom Mitchell and Petrillo physically resembled), which led to Lewis taking legal action.Sammy Petrillo obituary, The New York Times, August 24, 2009; accessed July 2, 2017. The suit was later dismissed. Movie producer Jack Broder intended to star Mitchell and Petrillo in a feature-length comedy. Petrillo later recalled his suspicion that Broder never really intended to make the film: Broder expected Paramount Pictures to pay him off, but when Paramount dropped the lawsuit, Broder had to follow through. The resulting film was Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla, a jungle-themed comedy. Mitchell had a small appearance in the Martin and Lewis film Sailor Beware (1952). After Mitchell and Petrillo parted ways, Mitchell stayed in show business, performing at nightclubs in New York, Las Vegas, Seattle, Palm Springs, Chicago (opening for his friend Lenny Bruce), and The Cloisters, Crescendo and Coconut Grove in Los Angeles and began directing self-financed independent films such as Massacre Mafia Style (1974) and Gone with the Pope (1976), which have since developed a cult following. In 1960, Mitchell provided the singing voice of Fred Flintstone for his friends William Hanna and Joseph Barbera on The Flintstones episodes \\"Hot Lips Hannigan\\" and \\"Girls' Night Out\\". Duke was a regular on the scene in Palm Springs, California, where he started the fad and trend of \\"Sunday Brunches\\" with shows including Liza Minnelli, David Janssen, Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra, and his son, guitarist/songwriter Jeffrey Mitchell, who got his start at the Ranch Club brunches with his father, Doug McClure, James Drury, and a myriad of stars including Lucille Ball, Red Skelton, Vince Edwards, and acts from the world of show-biz.

Holland was launched by the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington on 12 April 1926, sponsored by Miss Elizabeth Saunders Chase, daughter of Admiral J. V. Chase, and commissioned on 1 June, Comdr. John B. Earle in command. Stationed at San Diego, California, tending submarine divisions there with periodic tours to Panama to service submarines based at the Canal Zone pre-World War two. Later serving in the Pacific theatre, by close of hostilities having given 55 instances of refit to submarines, provided repair and service to 20 surface craft and completed various jobs on shore installations. She shifted to San Pedro for inactivation overhaul in the Terminal Island Navy Yard, then was towed to San Diego where she was decommissioned on 21 March 1947. She was assigned to the San Diego, California, group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet until her name was struck from the Navy Register on 18 June 1952. Her hull was sold for scrapping on 3 October 1953 to the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. Service history =Pre-World War II= Holland arrived in San Francisco from Puget Sound on 24 April to become flagship of Captain J. T. Thompkins, Commander Submarine Divisions, Battle Fleet. On 24 September, she was permanently assigned to base at San Diego, California, tending submarine divisions there with periodic tours to Panama to service submarines based at the Canal Zone. On 5 November 1930, Holland became flagship of Captain Chester W. Nimitz, Commander Submarine Divisions, Battle Fleet with additional duty as Commander of Submarine Division 20. The former command was abolished as of 1 April 1931 and Captain Nimitz retained his flag in Holland as Commander, of his submarine division, now designated Submarine Division 12. He left Holland on 17 June, relieved by Captain Wilhelm L. Friedell. In addition to being the flagship of Submarine Division 12, Holland temporarily served as Submarine Force Flagship (March‚ÄìJuly 1933). In June 1935, she became joint flagship of Submarine Squadron 6 and Submarine Division 12. This duty continued until June 1941 when she became flagship of Submarine Squadron 2. =World War II= Holland in San Diego Bay in 1940 with submarines , , , , , , , , , and On 22 November 1941, Holland arrived at Cavite Naval Base, Philippines, to service submarines of the Asiatic Fleet. Due to the air raids in early December 1941, Holland was hurried out of Manila Bay under cover of night with her vital cargo of repair and replacement parts for submarines of the Asiatic Fleet. Heading south, she escaped unscathed from two air raids while at Balikpapan, Borneo, then repaired a battle-damaged submarine at Soerabaja, Java where she was joined by two destroyers that gave her escort to Port Darwin, Australia, which she reached on 2 January 1942 for round-the-clock operations which included the building of docks and floats as well as the constant repair and equipping of ships as well as submarines. On 3 February, Captain C.Q. Wright took command and she was underway for Tjilaljap, Java, to remove Rear Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, Jr., and his Asiatic Fleet Submarine Force Staff to Australia. Her outstanding service to the Fleet during the first crucial months of the war brought Holland a Navy Unit Commendation. While based in Australia, under the command of Captain C.Q. Wright, Holland serviced and overhauled several submarines before returning for overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard in late February 1943. She reached Pearl Harbor from the West Coast in June and completed 22 refits and 13 repair jobs for submarines within the next 11 months. She shifted to Midway Atoll on 1 June 1944 and sailed the following month directly to support submarines in the Mariana Islands. Holland returned to Pearl Harbor late in November 1944, to be fitted out as headquarters ship for Vice Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, Jr., Commander Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet. In January 1945, she steamed out of Pearl Harbor for Guam where she embarked Vice Admiral Lockwood. By the close of hostilities, Holland had given 55 instances of refit to submarines, provided repair and service to 20 surface craft and completed various jobs on shore installations. =Post-war= Vice Admiral Lockwood shifted his Submarine Force Flag ashore to his new quarters on Coconut Island off Guam on 30 August 1945, setting up operations and communications for the work ahead. This left Holland ready to begin a new career as an internal combustion engine repair ship ARG-18. Her value to the submarine force had diminished with the commissioning of many new and modern tenders better equipped to carry on the job of keeping submarines in condition for their assaults against the enemy. With a few alterations, she headed for Buckner Bay, Okinawa, where she embarked Rear Admiral Allen B. Smith, Commander of Service Squadron 10 and his staff before proceeding for Tokyo Bay where she dropped anchor on 29 September 1945. Holland set course 6 June 1946 by way of Pearl Harbor for San Diego where she arrived on 28 June. She shifted to San Pedro for inactivation overhaul in the Terminal Island Navy Yard, then was towed to San Diego where she was decommissioned on 21 March 1947. She was assigned to the San Diego, California, group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet until her name was struck from the Navy Register on 18 June 1952. Her hull was sold for scrapping on 3 October 1953 to the Bethlehem Steel Corporation.

He is the head of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, and since 2004, he has published the blog Syria Comment. He is married to Manar Kachour and has two sons, Kendall and Jonah Landis.  Background  Landis was born on May 14, 1957 in Manhattan, New York City, New York. When he was one year old, his family moved to Saudi Arabia, where his father was sent by Citibank to open the first branch of an American bank in the country. After staying in Saudi Arabia for three years, Landis' family moved to Beirut, Lebanon, due to his father being transferred there to work as Citibank's Vice-President for the Middle East. When Landis was ten years old, his family moved back to the United States. Landis earned a BA from Swarthmore College, majoring in European History and French Literature. He spent his college sophomore year in France. After graduating, Landis then returned to Beirut in the midst of the Lebanese Civil War to teach at the International College, Beirut. According to Landis, his experience of living in Beirut during the civil war shaped his interpretation of the Syrian Civil War later on. In 1981, Landis went to Damascus University on a Fulbright Grant. During the following year, whilst Landis was still living in Damascus, the Hama uprising of 1982 took place. Landis visited Hama a week after the uprising. Later he earned an MA from Harvard University, and his PhD from Princeton University. Fluent in Arabic and French, he has studied Turkish, Italian, and Ottoman. He has received three Fulbright grants and a Social Science Research Council award.  Academia  He taught at Sarah Lawrence College, Wake Forest University, and Princeton University before moving to the University of Oklahoma. Since May 2004, Landis has published the Syrian Comment blog, which focuses on Syrian politics, history, and religion. Landis regularly travels to Washington, D.C. to consult with government agencies. In 2008, he received the Outstanding Teaching Award at his university.

(Even though these dates have been recorded as the official period of employment, Noah Dietrich continued to oversee and make executive decisions for the Hughes industries as late as 1970.) According to his own memoirs, he left the Hughes operation over a dispute involving putting more of his income on a capital gains basis. The manuscript of his eventual memoir, Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes, may have been a key, if inadvertent, source of novelist Clifford Irving's infamous fake autobiography of Hughes. Early life Dietrich was born on February 28, 1889 in Madison, Wisconsin, the son of German-born evangelical Lutheran minister John Dietrich, and the former Sarah Peters. \\"Noah Dietrich was born February 28, 1889 in Madison, Wisconsin and was the fourth of six children born to Sarah Peters and German- born evangelical Lutheran minister John Dietrich.\\" He graduated from Janesville High School in 1906, married in 1910, and became a bank cashier in Maxwell, New Mexico for the next six months. They then moved to Los Angeles, where he became an auditor for the Los Angeles Suburban Land Co., and then the Janass Investment Co. In 1917, he became an assistant comptroller for Edward L. Doheny Oil companies in New York City. Then Noah, along with his family now consisting of his wife and two daughters, decided to move back to Los Angeles, where he worked for the CPA firm of Haskins and Sells. There he passed the California Board of Accountancy exam in 1923. Career =\\"Noah Can Do It\\"= In Nov. 1925, at the age of 36, Dietrich met 19-year-old Hughes, who had gained control of Hughes Tool Company after buying out the other family heirs. Started by his father, Howard R. Hughes, Sr., Hughes Tool Company ‚Äì or Toolco ‚Äì manufactured oil drilling equipment, especially the multiple-edge, revolving-teeth roller cutter drill bits the elder Hughes invented. Hughes, according to Dietrich, was \\"looking for someone with wide general knowledge,\\" \\"Someone who is resourceful and can solve problems.\\" Questions Hughes asked Dietrich included \\"how a battleship finds the range on its target?\\", and to \\"Explain the principles of the internal combustion engine,\\" both of which Dietrich was able to answer satisfactorily. Dietrich was hired as an executive assistant to explain the production and financial reports issued by Hughes' tool company, eventually becoming Hughes' personal delegate. In his memoir, Dietrich observed that Hughes had little interest in Toolco, other than as a source of revenue. \\"The tool company,\\" he quoted Hughes as saying, \\"was my father's success. And it always will be.\\" The company's earnings, however, allowed Hughes to pursue his interest in Hollywood movies. When still in his early twenties, Hughes told Dietrich, \\"My first objective is to become the world's number one golfer. Second, the top aviator, and third I want to become the world's most famous motion picture producer. Then, I want you to make me the richest man in the world.\\" In time, Dietrich came to serve as an executive for most of Hughes' enterprises, including Trans World Airlines (TWA), RKO Pictures and Hughes Aircraft. Dietrich became Hughes' most indispensable executive ‚Äì \\"Noah can do it\\" was, according to Dietrich's memoir, a frequent Hughes expression whenever difficult, if not impossible, wants or needs needed to be met. Some ‚Äì such as when Dietrich arranged a stock ticker to be installed in a Hughes home ‚Äì were merely difficult. Others ‚Äì such as the time Dietrich arranged the shipment of Hughes' large private liquor stock from his Texas home to his California home during Prohibition ‚Äì put him at serious risk. Dietrich guided the expansion of Hughes empire by using Hughes Tool Co. profits to purchase real estate, thus avoiding penalties for excess accumulated surplus. Hughes also limited his salary to $50,000 per year, without dividend payments, thus limiting his income tax. All of Hughes' major expenses, planes, automobiles, houses, etc., were also charged to Hughes Tool Co. as business expenses. Hughes even said of Dietrich, \\"He knows more about my business than I do,\\" referring to Noah as a \\"genius\\". Some of Dietrich's duties got him caught in the middle of disputes with members of Hughes' family. During a period when Hughes refused to talk to anyone outside a few business associates, Dietrich recalled, a Hughes' aunt Loomis accused Dietrich ‚Äì who turned out to have been kept in the dark about Hughes' exact whereabouts himself ‚Äì \\"of hiding his body and running things\\" himself. When Hughes returned, Dietrich wrote, he made a special point of calling this aunt. \\"I didn't want her to continue believing that I was running the Hughes empire while I kept her nephew in the Deep-freeze.\\" A few years later, while Hughes was recovering from injuries he sustained in the crash of his experimental XF-11 aircraft, Hughes refused a visit from his favorite aunt Annette Lummis, and her husband Dr. Fred Lummis. The uncle turned to Dietrich and said, \\"Now I can better understand your problems in dealing with Hughes. I don't understand him at all.\\" In 1946, Hughes put Dietrich in charge of Toolco. Dietrich proceeded to modernize the company, and was able to increase profits to the point that Hughes Tool Co. made $285,000,000 in profits over the next 8 years. Dietrich also discussed in considerable detail the real impetus behind the government's investigation of Hughes Aircraft following World War II. Ostensibly, the probe involved Hughes' failure to deliver the infamous flying boat, the Hercules, a military transport aircraft, to the government on time. Dietrich wrote, however, that the real purpose of the probe may have been neutralizing Hughes, owner of TWA, while rival Pan Am ‚Äì whose president, Juan Trippe, had implored Maine Senator Owen Brewster to carry it ‚Äì pushed for a federal law establishing only one official American carrier of international air traffic, and Pan Am becoming that carrier. Dietrich discussed the famous Hughes counterattack before the Senate committee investigating him ‚Äì and revealed that both his own and Hughes' hotel suites had been bugged during the hearings, allegedly at the behest of Brewster and Trippe. The hearings, and Hughes' legendary triumph over them, helped end both the legislation and Brewster's political career; On Hughes' orders, Dietrich poured money into a challenger's campaign a few years later. By 1948, Dietrich wrote that his duties were getting \\"immensely onerous\\", \\"If an executive had to be fired, 'Noah can do it.' If millions had to be raised overnight, 'Noah can do it.' If a politico or a starlet had to be paid off, 'Noah can do it.' Noah was getting tired of doing it.\\" =Falling out with Hughes= Though Dietrich was pulling in a salary of $500,000 per year, his tax burden was 70% on the first $100,000 and then 93% for the remainder. Dietrich wanted compensation based on a stock option, which was subject only to a tax of 25%. Yet, Dietrich wrote, Hughes \\"simply could not bring himself to let anyone share in his ownership.\\" In 1957, after working for Hughes for 32 years, Dietrich left the Hughes organization over a capital-gains dispute: Hughes had promised to make more of Dietrich's income on a capital gains basis. At the time of the falling-out, Hughes was trying to finance jets for TWA and decided the key was to inflate Hughes Tool profits in order to sell the company to pay for the jets, since Hughes had rejected all other financing solutions, because they threatened to dilute his TWA ownership. At the same juncture, Hughes, Dietrich recalled, also did everything in his power to stop Dietrich's long-planned African safari with his two sons, the first long vacation Dietrich had taken in decades of working for Hughes. Dietrich returned from Africa, he wrote, and finally agreed to go to Texas to implement the plan ‚Äì on condition that Hughes finally implement the capital gains agreement. When Hughes refused, Dietrich immediately quit ‚Äì stunning Hughes. (Dietrich quoted Hughes as saying, \\"Noah, I can't exist without you!\\") Hughes didn't let him go without a fight. After pleading failed, Hughes tried to strong-arm Dietrich into reconsidering, going so far, Dietrich recorded, as changing the lock on Dietrich's office‚Äì a practice Hughes had followed any time top executives were fired or otherwise departed the Hughes operation, Dietrich recalled. Hughes also sought Dietrich's interest in their oil partnerships. Dietrich wrote that he surrendered his interest just to be rid of Hughes, a move he later regretted, since the leases turned big profits eventually. Dietrich got a court order to reclaim many of his personal possessions from his old offices. =Post-Hughes career and memoirs= After parting ways with Hughes, Dietrich, as a well- respected financial and executive advisor, served on several corporate and financial boards as well as traveled to many speaking engagements. His 1971 memoir, Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes, provided many with the first genuine inside look into the world of Howard Hughes, including and especially his occasional lack of concern that things he wanted done often required breaches of ethics or even the law. Only when he was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis (the same illness that killed shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis), did Dietrich finally retire in full. Dietrich wrote of Hughes, \\"Of all his possessions, TWA held a certain mystique for him. He didn't give a damn about the tool company, except as a source of wealth. Hughes Aircraft was an avocation for him, and outlet for his tendency to tinker. RKO was a heady diversion, an opportunity to pursue his sensual enjoyments.\\" Personal life By 1936, he had divorced his first wife, and their two daughters were married. By 1945, Dietrich had three children with his second wife. By 1951, Dietrich was separated from his second wife. After leaving Hughes in 1957, Dietrich married for a third time. In his book Howard, Dietrich wrote, \\"I much preferred the more exciting life,\\" rather than the sedate life of a CPA. He wrote the book \\"to leave, for my children and grandchildren, a record of the role I played in a colorful subchapter of American history,\\" and in part, so \\"the American public should be informed on the uses and misuses of great wealth.\\" Time\\"The Fabulous Hoax of Clifford Irving\\", Time revealed in 1972 that a copy of an early draft of the manuscript for Dietrich's memoir, ghost- written by journalist James Phelan, may have fallen into Clifford Irving's hands, and identified the draft as a key element in Irving's being able to convince publishers and others that his hoax Hughes autobiography was genuine. \\"The instances of duplicated material are numerous,\\" the magazine wrote. \\"In some cases, the books are virtually identical in detail. In others, they are substantively the same, although the Irving manuscript has been reworded and otherwise disguised. One curiosity: the writing in the Irving manuscript is much better than that in the hastily drafted Phelan version. It is ironic that Irving may be more convincing as a forger than as an author in his own right ‚Äì just as Elmyr de Hory, Irving's Ibiza friend and the main character in his book Fake!, is much better at doing Picassos and Modiglianis than he is at doing De Horys.\\" When he later wrote his own memoir, The Hoax, Irving corroborated the hypothesis posited by the Time article, writing that he indeed obtained and a made a copy of a draft of Dietrich's manuscript, which he then used as source material for his fabricated Hughes autobiography. Dietrich and Phelan eventually settled for $40,000 after Dietrich became dissatisfied with Phelan's work. He then turned the project over to another journalist, Bob Thomas, who finished the Dietrich memoir within six weeks. Death Dietrich died of heart failure in hospital on February 15, 1982, in Palm Springs, California. He was just two weeks short of his ninety-third birthday. He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in Glendale, California. TV/movie adaptations Noah Dietrich has been portrayed within several adaptations: *Ed Flanders played Dietrich against Tommy Lee Jones as Hughes in the 1977 mini-series The Amazing Howard Hughes. Released one year after Hughes' death, Dietrich's role is highlighted from his commencement with Hughes as Accountant, his subsequent contribution in restructuring Hughes Empire, and his later departure. *Eli Wallach played Dietrich in the 2006 movie The Hoax, about author Clifford Irving's faked Howard Hughes autobiography. *John C. Reilly played Dietrich against Leonardo DiCaprio as Hughes within the 2004 movie The Aviator. A criticism of this adaptation was that it downplayed the role Dietrich played in helping Hughes amass his fortune. * Martin Sheen portrayed Dietrich in the 2016 film Rules Don't Apply.

Each battery had a different designation depending on which vacuum tube element it was associated with. Initially, the only such device was a diode with only a filament (cathode) and a plate (anode). Following the direction of electron flow, these electrodes were identified as \\"A\\" and \\"B\\", respectively and thus the associated batteries were referred to as the \\"A\\" battery and \\"B\\" battery, respectively. Later, when the control grid element was added to create the triode tube, it was logically assigned the letter \\"C\\" and supplied from a \\"C\\" battery. Subsequent addition of further internal elements to improve the performance of the triode did not require an extension to this series of batteries - these elements were either resistively-biased from the existing batteries, connected to ground or to the cathode. This nomenclature was used primarily within North America. Different battery names were used elsewhere in the English speaking world. A battery An A battery is any battery used to provide power to the filament of a vacuum tube. It is sometimes colloquially referred to as a \\"wet battery\\". (A dry cell could be used for the purpose, but the ampere-hour capacity of dry cells was too low at the time to be of practical use in this service.) The term comes from the days of valve (tube) radios when it was common practice to use a dry battery for the plate (anode) voltage and a rechargeable lead/acid \\"wet\\" battery for the filament voltage. (The filaments in vacuum tubes consumed much more current than the anodes, and so the \\"A\\" battery would drain much more rapidly than the \\"B\\" battery; therefore, using a rechargeable \\"A\\" battery in this role reduced the need for battery replacement. In contrast, a non- rechargeable \\"B\\" battery would need to be replaced relatively infrequently.) A batteries were initially 2 volts, being lead acid accumulators, but with the introduction of all dry battery radios, 1.4 volts became more common. Other voltages can be encountered. For example, 7.5 volt batteries were sometimes used to power a series connected set of 1.4 volt valves (tubes). In Britain and some other countries, the \\"A\\" battery was known as the \\"LT\\" (low tension) battery if dry, and simply the \\"accumulator\\" if wet. B battery A B battery is any battery used to provide the plate voltage of a vacuum tube. It is sometimes colloquially referred to as a \\"dry battery\\" (although there's no reason why a \\"wet\\" battery of suitable voltage couldn't be utilised for the purpose). The filament is primarily a heat source and therefore the A battery supplies significant current and rapidly discharges. The B battery experiences comparatively little current draw and retains its stored capacity far longer than an A battery. Early B batteries used with bright emitter tubes were 120 volts, but these quickly became obsolete as they were replaced with examples having voltages of typically 45 volts, 67¬Ω volts, or 90 volts as more efficient tubes became available. Some examples had taps every 22¬Ω volts. Even when the plate voltage rail is fed by a power supply rather than a battery, it is generally referred to as the \\"B+\\" line in American schematics. Because plate voltages can be as high as 300V DC, multiple B batteries may be connected together in series to additively provide the required operating voltages. The much higher available voltage of B batteries means that they must be handled more carefully than other battery types due to their ability to shock and/or burn the person handling them. In Britain and in some other countries, the \\"B\\" battery was known as the \\"HT\\" (high tension) battery. C battery In electronics, a C battery may refer to any battery used to provide bias to the control grid of a vacuum tube. Until the early 1930s this was common practice in valve (tube) radio sets but was largely superseded by grid leak resistors or voltage divider biasing. Because the tube grids drew no current, the C battery provided the bias voltage with no current draw. The battery's life in the radio was essentially its shelf life. Grid bias batteries are still manufactured today, but not for radio use. They are popular in schools and colleges as a convenient variable voltage source in science classes. The most popular battery is the 9 volt type with taps every 1¬Ω volts that accept banana plugs. A rare form of \\"C\\" battery was the bias cell, a button-size miniature battery designed to deliver a constant voltage with no current drain. These were briefly popular between 1936 and 1945 as the bias cell was less costly than a resistor/capacitor bias network. In Britain and in some other countries, the \\"C\\" battery was known as the \\"GB\\" (grid bias) battery.

The area was bounded by the California/Oregon to the north and Wilson Creek, north of the Klamath River (Tolowa-Chetco: T Ω√°Àët É Ω…™·µóÀë ºd…ún) in California, to the south. They lived in approximately eight permanent villages including on Crescent Bay and Lake Earl (Tolowa-Chetco: Ee-chuu-le' or Ch'uu- let - \\"large body of water\\").The most important Tolowa village is Yontocket, California (Tolowa-Chetco: Yan‚Äô-daa-k‚Äôvt). Their tribal neighbors were the Chetco (Tolowa-Chetco: Chit Dee-ni‚Äô or Chit-dv-ne' , also: Chit-dee-ni / Chit- dee-ne), Tututni (Tolowa-Chetco: T‚Äôuu-du‚Äô-dee-ni‚Äô or Ta-ÃÅa te ÃÅne, also: Tu-ÃÅtut√ªn tÃü√ªn-nƒï) to the north; Shasta Costa (Tolowa-Chetco: Shis-taa-k'wvs- sta-dv-ne or See-staa-k‚Äôwvt-sta Dee-ni‚Äô), Takelma (Tolowa-Chetco: Ghan‚Äô-ts‚Äôii- ne), Galice Creek / Taltushtuntede (Tolowa-Chetco: Talh-dash-dv-ne' ) to the NE, all of which were removed to the Siletz Reservation, and Karuk (Tolowa- Chetco: Ch'vm-ne Dee-ni' , also: Ch‚Äôvm-ne Xee-she‚Äô ) to the east; and the Yurok (Tolowa-Chetco: Dvtlh-mvsh, also: Dvtlh-mvsh Xee-she‚Äô ) to the south. The name \\"Tolowa\\" is derived from Taa-laa-welh (Taa-laa-wa), an Algic name given to them by the Yurok (Klamath River People) (meaning \\"people of Lake Earl\\"). Their autonym is Hush, Xus or Xvsh, meaning \\"person\\" or \\"human being\\".Pritzker, Barry M. A Native American Encyclopedia: History, Culture, and Peoples.

The Tolowa or Dee-ni‚Äô population exceeded 10,000. In the 19th century, epidemics of new infectious diseases, such as smallpox, broke out among the Tolowa, resulting in high mortality. These occurred before they had face-to-face encounters with non-natives because of contact through intermediaries. In 1828 the American Jedediah Smith and his exploration party were the first known non-natives to contact the Tolowa. The Tolowa embraced the Ghost Dance religion from 1872 to 1882, in hopes of getting relief from European-American encroachment. =Genocide= In 1770 the Tolowa had a population of 1,000; their population soon dropped to 150 in 1910; this was almost entirely due to deliberate mass murder in what has been called genocide which has been recognized by the state of California. In a speech before representatives of Native American peoples in June 2019, California governor Gavin Newsom apologized for the genocide. Newsom said, \\"That‚Äôs what it was, a genocide. No other way to describe it. And that‚Äôs the way it needs to be described in the history books.\\" Among these killings the Yontoket Massacre left 150 to 500 Tolowa people recorded dead. Because their homes had burned down, the place received the name \\"Burnt Ranch\\". The Yontoket massacre decimated the cultural center of the Tolowa peoples. The natives from the surrounding areas would gather there for their celebrations and discussions. The survivors of the massacre were forced to move to the village north of Smith's River called Howonquet. The slaughtering of the Tolowa people continued for some years. They were seemingly always caught at their Needash celebrations. These massacres caused some unrest which led in part to the Rogue River Indian war. Many Tolowa people were incarcerated at Battery Point in 1855 to withhold them from joining an uprising led by their chief. In 1860, after the Chetco/Rogue River War, 600 Tolowa were forcibly relocated to Indian reservations in Oregon, including what is now known as the Siletz Reservation in the Central Coastal Range. Later, some were moved to the Hoopa Valley Reservation in California. Adding to the number of dead from the Yontoket Massacre and the Battery Point Attack are many more in the following years. These massacres included the Chetko Massacre with 24 dead, the Smith creek massacre with 7 dead, the Howonquet Massacre with 70 dead, the Achulet massacre with 65 deadNorton, Jack (1979).

Language They have traditionally spoken Taa-laa-wa Dee-ni' Wee-ya' (Tolowa Dee-ni' Language), the Tolowa language, one of the Athabaskan languages. At the Siletz Reservation in central Oregon, tribes speaking 10 distinct languages were brought together in the mid-19th century. In the early 21st century, the remaining native language spoken is known as Siletz Dee-ni, related to Tolowa, although many of the original tribes spoke Salish languages. In 2007, in coordination with the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages, the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians produced a \\"talking dictionary\\" in this language to aid in preservation and teaching.\\"Guide to using the Siletz Dictionary\\" by Amy Smolek, in Anderson, Gregory D.S. and K.

Culture The Tolowa organized their subsistence around the plentiful riverine and marine resources and acorns (san-chvn). Their society was not formally stratified, but considerable emphasis was put on personal wealth. Tolowa villages were organized around a headman and usually consisted of related men, in a patrilineal kinship system, where inheritance and status passed through the male line. The men married women in neighboring tribes. The brides were usually related (sisters), in order for the wealth to remain in the paternal families. =Ethnobotany= They apply a poultice of the chewed leaves of Viola adunca to sore eyes.Baker, Marc A., 1981, The Ethnobotany of the Yurok, Tolowa and Karok Indians of Northwest California, Humboldt State University, M.A. Thesis, page 62 Population Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially.See Population of Native California Various estimates for the 1770 population of Tolowa have ranged from as low as 450 to an upper end around 2,400.Kroeber, A.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a rural town and locality in the North Burnett Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , Monto had a population of 1,189 people. Geography Monto is located on the Burnett Highway north-west of Brisbane and south of Rockhampton. History Gureng Gureng (also known as Gooreng Gooreng, Goreng Goreng, Goeng, Gurang, Goorang Goorang, Korenggoreng) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Gureng Gureng people. The Gooreng Gooreng language region includes the towns of Bundaberg, Gin Gin and Miriam Vale extending south towards Childers, inland to Monto and Mt Perry. The town takes its name from its railway station, which in turn is an Aboriginal word meaning ridgy plain. Europeans settled in the area in the late 1840s, maintaining large pastoral holdings at the northern end of the Burnett Valley. Gold unearthed along Three Moon Creek ‚Äî a tributary of the Burnett River ‚Äî in the 1870s attracted further settlers. The original site of the diggings, north of present-day Monto, has since been flooded by construction of Cania Dam. The township of Monto was not formally established until 1924 in which year the post office opened. Norton Diggings Provisional School opened circa 1881 and is believed to have been repositioned circa 1892 and renamed Norton Goldfield Provisional School. It closed circa 1903 but reopened in 1904 as Norton Provisional School, but then closed in 1907. Monto State School opened on 25 January 1926. St Therese's Catholic Primary School was opened on 5 February 1940 by the Presentation Sisters. With dwindling gold reserves, Monto turned its economy towards farming and logging, two of the region's major industries today. Deposits of thermal coal and limestone have been discovered in the shire. Monto State High School opened on 28 January 1964. At the 2006 census, Monto had a population of 1,159. The town was the administrative centre of Monto Shire until its amalgamation in 2008 into the new North Burnett Region local government area.  Amenities Memorial to Monto's most famous son, jockey Kenny Russell. Monto has a cultural and historical complex with a museum reserve, sporting facilities, swimming pool and golf club. The North Burnett Regional Council operates a public library in Monto at 50 Newton Street. The Monto-Bancroft branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association meets at 9 Rutherford Street.  Education  Monto State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 3 Leichhardt Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 110 students with 9 teachers (7 full-time equivalent) and 11 non-teaching staff (5 full-time equivalent). Monto State High School is a government secondary (7-12) school for boys and girls at Mouatt Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 159 students with 23 teachers (20 full-time equivalent) and 19 non-teaching staff (11 full-time equivalent). Monto Cluster Special Education Program is a primary and secondary (Prep-12) special education program at Monto State High School. St Therese's Catholic Primary School is a Catholic primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Rayleigh Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 88 students with 9 teachers (8 full-time equivalent) and 3 non- teaching staff (2 full-time equivalent).

The last line of the book, \\"Screams in the dark,\\" is also the first line of the book, as well as the tagline for the novel. Bec is the end of the first part of the Demonata books, where the three protagonists are introduced. Plot When a \\"simple child\\" named Bran who can run incredibly fast comes to Bec's demon-besieged rath, she and a small consignment of warriors go with him, including the chief's son, Connla, who is \\"largely untested\\" in battle; Goll, an old warrior; Lorcan and Ronan, two teenage twins; Fiachna the blacksmith; and Orna, a female warrior. During the journey, the group is attacked by demons, but luckily manage to hide near some ancient lodestones which protect them with powerful Old Magic. Eventually, Bran leads them to a crann√≥g, where everyone is dead except a druid, Drust. The druid tells them about a tunnel to the demons' world, and how he aims to destroy it. They go with him. The group finds some horses which help them reach their destination in time, but Fiachna is soon abandoned after his wound becomes life- threatening. Bec manages to force Bran through the closing tunnel at the last moment with the last of her magic, but is trapped as a result. Soon after, Lord Loss appears and tells Bec that when she appeared to absorb power from him several days earlier, Lord Loss had actually intended for that to happen so that she could close the tunnel. This is because Lord Loss is unique among demons, in that instead of wishing to slaughter all the humans in the world, he actually prefers to prolong the suffering for as long as possible. If the tunnel had remained open, countless other demons would have passed through and destroyed all of mankind within a matter of weeks, which would have ruined Lord Loss' \\"sport\\". After telling Bec this, Lord Loss reminds her of the geis that he had placed on her, and that he is bound by his word to kill her. Lord Loss sets his familiars upon Bec, and without any magic to defend herself with, she is easily overwhelmed and killed.

Saint Jarlath, also known as Iarlaithe mac Loga (fl. 6th century), was an Irish priest and scholar from Connacht, remembered as the founder of the monastic School of Tuam and of the Archdiocese of Tuam, of which he is the patron saint. No medieval Life for Jarlath is extant, but sources for his life and cult include genealogies, martyrologies, the Irish Lives of St Brendan of Clonfert, and a biography compiled by John Colgan in the 17th century. Background The Irish genealogies record the existence of two saints named Jarlath: Jarlath son of Lugh (Iarlaithe m. Loga), founder of Tuam, and Jarlath son of Trian (Iarlaithe m. Trena), bishop of Armagh.Mac Giolla Easpaig, \\"Early Ecclesiastical Settlement Names of County Galway\\" (1996), pp. 802-03. Jarlath of Tuam is said to have belonged to the Conmha√≠cne, who ruled over the greater part of what would become the parish of Tuam. The other saint is said to have belonged to the D√°l Fiatach in east Ulster. He is identified as the third Bishop of Armagh, that is after Patrick's heir Benignus and the Annals of Ulster and Innisfallen record his death in the year 481.Annals of Ulster s.a. 481, Annals of Innisfallen s.a. 481, Annals of the Four Masters s.a. 481. In the two Irish Lives of St Brendan, possibly of the 12th century, Jarlath is called a son of Lug, son of Tr√©n, son of Fiacc, son of Mochta, and the First Life in the Book of Lismore continues the pedigree by calling Mochta a son of Bresal, son of Siracht, son of Fiacha the Fair.First Irish Life of St Brendan, ed. and tr. Stokes, Lives of saints, pp. 105-06, 251.Second Irish Life of St Brendan, ed. and tr. Plummer, Bethada n√°em n√ârenn, vol. 1: 47-8, vol 2: pp. 47-8 (ix ¬ß¬ß 21-2). Both Lives substitute Imchada for Mochta and on this basis, S√©amus Mac Math√∫na argues that they go back to an original which conflates the genealogy of Iarlaithe mac Loga with that of his namesake in Armagh.Mac Math√∫na, \\"The Irish Life of Saint Brendan\\", pg. 134 note 40. D√≥nall Mac Giolla Easpaig suggests, that the saints could refer to one and the same person: > [...] both are given as the third bishop of Armagh [...] placename evidence > from the Tuam area would tend to corroborate [this] view [...] the evidence > suggests that there was a strong Patrician and, consequently, a strong > Armagh influence in the Tuam area from the earliest Christian period [...] > the fact that Iarlaithe was a bishop like Benignus of Kilbennan and Felartus > of Donaghpatrick, would further indicate that Tuam [...] would have predated > Brendan of Clonfert by almost a century. St Brendan's Irish Lives Jarlath appears briefly as a prominent figure in the medieval Irish Lives of St Brendan of Clonfert.Charles-Edwards, \\"Connacht, saints of (act. c.400‚Äìc.800).\\" Brendan is said to have visited Connacht to study under the famous Jarlath. One day, when Jarlath was in his old age, Brendan advised his mentor to leave the school and to depart in a newly built chariot until its two hind shafts broke, because there would be the place of his resurrection (ess√©irge) and that of many after him. Because Jarlath acknowledged the divinity and superior wisdom of his pupil, saying \\"take me into thy service for ever and ever\\", he gladly accepted his advice. His travel did not take him very far, as the shafts broke at Tuaim da Ghualann (\\"Mound of two shoulders\\"), that is, at Tuam. Jarlath died, \\"full of days\\", on 26 December, circa 540, aged about 90 years old. In attributing a leading role to St Brendan in the foundation of Tuam, the Lives suggest that the see of Tuam was united with but subordinate to that of Annaghdown.Mac Math√∫na. \\"The Irish Life of Saint Brendan\\", pp. 157-58. Tuam achieved the status of the principal see of Connacht only in 1152 at the Synod of Kells-Mellifont, while Annaghdown became an independent diocesan seat at the Synod of Dublin in 1192. In this light, the assertion in the Lives has been read as reflecting circumstances in the 12th century. Foundation of Tuam John Colgan drew up a memoir of the saint in his Acta Sanctorum Hiberniae (1645). Jarlath is said to have studied under St Benignus at Kilbennen, disciple of St Patrick. Afterwards, he founded his first monastery at Cluainfois (Cloonfush), near Tuam, while his principal seat came to be at Tuam. His monastic school is said to have attracted scholars from all parts of Ireland, including such students as St Brendan of Ardfert and Saint Colman of Cloyne. On the significance of the place-name Tuam, D√≥nall Mac Giolla Easpaig posits: > \\"[t]he first element in the placename Tuaim D√° Ualann/Ghualann referred to a > pagan burial-ground similar to that designated by the second element of > Cluain Fearta (see Clonfert). If so Tuam offers another example of an early > church being built on or near a pre-Christian sacred site.\\" Despite his fame, Jarlath left Cloonfush to study under Saint Enda of Aran around 495. Originally in The Catholic Encyclopedia (1910). Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company. In the 520s, he retired to Tuam. He chose Tuam because the wheel of his chariot broke there. Jarlath is included in the second order of Irish saints, which implies that he must have lived prior to the year 540. A poem ascribed to Cuimm√≠n of Coindeire, which is also cited in √ì Cl√©irigh's Martyrology of Donegal, states that Jarlath was known for his generosity and devotion to prayer (\\"three hundred genuflexions every night, and three hundred genuflexions every day\\").Martyrology of Donegal, ed. Todd and Reeves, pp. 348-49 (26 December).Stokes, \\"Cuimm√≠n's poem\\", 66-67. In the Martyrology of Donegal, he is credited with having predicted the names of his successors, including those of three 'heretical' bishops and one M√°el. Similarly, his hagiography in the \\"Great Synaxaristes of the Orthodox Church\\" records that as a result of his great asceticism and devotion to prayer he was granted the gift of prophecy. Feast-day Saint Jarlath's feast day is 6 June, which is the date of the translation of his relics to a church specially built in his honour next to the Cathedral of Tuam. His remains were encased in a silver shrine, from which the 13th-century church gained the name Teampul na scr√≠n, that is the \\"church of the shrine\\", a perpetual vicarage united to the prebend of Kilmainemore in 1415. In a note added to the F√©lire √ìengusso and in other martyrologies, Jarlath's feast-day was recorded as 25 or 26 December.F√©lire √ìengusso, ed. Stokes, pg. 262 (26 December). Jarlath in the 21st century The first St. Jarlath's Festival in Tuam, organised by the Energise Tuam community group, was organised for Saturday 7 June 2008. This included a pageant/parade from Tuam Cathedral through the streets of the town, a school's art competition to raise awareness of the saint and local cultural heritage, and street entertainment. St Jarlath's broken wheel is a heraldic symbol of Tuam, and is included on the crest of many local organisations, including Tuam Town Council. St Jarlath Road, a residential street in Cabra in Dublin 7 is named in his honour.

The celebration is normally performed by the goalscorer, and may involve their teammates, the manager or coaching staff or the supporters of the team. Whilst referring to the celebration of a goal in general, the term can also be applied to specific actions, such as a player removing their shirt or performing a somersault. Celebrations are generally more substantial in lower- scoring sports, such as association football and ice hockey, where a score has greater significance. Many goal celebrations have been immortalised, such as in a statue (Thierry Henry), advertisements (Ronaldo), postage stamps (Pel√©), magazine covers, or in video games: Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Lionel Messi among many others are featured in the FIFA series.\\"Fifa 14 celebrations: How to do Gareth Bale, Ronaldo, and Lionel Messi's signature moves\\". The Mirror. Retrieved 6 September 2014 Celebration =Goal song= Jump\\" being played, flares sometimes go off at A.C. Milan's San Siro when a goal is scored. A goal song or goal celebration music is a short piece of music that is played in sports like football or ice hockey after a goal is scored. A goal horn sometimes sounds before the song is played, especially in the National Hockey League (NHL). One such song is Bellini's \\"Samba de Janeiro\\", which is played after each Bolton Wanderers goal when they play at home and was used as the goal song in UEFA Euro 2008. Van Halen's \\"Jump\\" is played every time A.C. Milan scores a goal at the San Siro. \\"Song 2\\" by Blur is played at some German and Austrian clubs. In North America, \\"Rock and Roll (Part Two)\\" by the Glitter Band is commonly played. Donbass Arena, the home ground of Ukrainian football club Shakhtar Donetsk, has a tradition of playing music each time home players score goals, with a track corresponding to the nationality of a scorer. For example, \\"Sabre Dance\\" by the Armenian Aram Khachaturian was played whenever his compatriot Henrikh Mkhitaryan scored. Another song is when FC Bayern Munich score a goal in the Allianz Arena, the Can-can plays. In ice hockey, the use of goal songs is very common. Prior to 2012, a goal by the NHL's Montreal Canadiens, on home ice, was followed by U2's \\"Vertigo\\". The New York Rangers play the song \\"Slapshot\\", which was written by Ray Castoldi, the music director at Madison Square Garden. The Chicago Blackhawks play \\"Chelsea Dagger\\" by The Fratellis after every home goal. = Common celebrations = Nolito celebrates scoring a goal by running from teammates. Atl√©tico Madrid players celebrate a goal with a group hug. Andrew Wiedeman after ripping off his jersey Neymar, Ramires and Andr√© Santos celebrating a goal with a dance Obafemi Martins celebrating a goal with a backflip * A group hug of the players on the pitch with the scorer underneath, or the players jumping on each other's shoulders. * The scorer running to corner flag, standing with one of his hands holding the flagpole while screaming ‚Äì Gabriel Batistuta's similar celebration when he played for Fiorentina inspired the design of his life-size bronze statue. * The scorer putting an index finger to his lips, as if telling the (opposition) crowd to be quiet ‚Äì Real Madrid forward Ra√∫l memorably celebrated in this manner when scoring against fierce rivals Barcelona at the Nou Camp in 1999. * The scorer pretending to fire a machine gun, as done by Gabriel Batistuta and Edinson Cavani. * The scorer turning his wrist near his ear, this is usually done while running. It was used many times, if not at all times, by Luca Toni. * The scorer diving onto the grass with arms and legs outstretched. This was supposedly first done by J√ºrgen Klinsmann, shortly after he joined Tottenham Hotspur. Klinsmann was actually performing this goal celebration to satirise his own (in his belief unjustified) reputation for diving to win free-kicks and penalties. It became known as \\"a Klinsmann\\". * The scorer walking or running away in a nonchalant style with a \\"cocky\\" smirk as if to say, \\"I'm the best, that was easy, etc.\\" An adaptation of this involves the scorer standing still and turning or looking around with said look. This was done by Manchester United striker Eric Cantona, and later by Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá. *Ibrahimovic also popularised shaping the fingers on both hands in the shape of a heart for his goal celebrations. * The scorer kissing the ring finger ‚Äì as Ra√∫l always did. Married players are saluting to their husbands/wives with this celebration. Rivaldo also famously performed this celebration in the quarter-final match against Denmark in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. * The scorer sliding on his knees ‚Äì often done by Didier Drogba and Eden Hazard. * The scorer outstretching both arms and running around changing the angle of arms mimicking an aeroplane. This was made famous by former Brazilian striker Careca and later earned Italian forward Vincenzo Montella his nickname of \\"little aeroplane\\" (l'aeroplanino in Italian). * The scorer outstretching both arms and running straight. Brazilian striker Ronaldo often celebrated in this manner in his early career ‚Äì his goal celebration was the basis for Pirelli's 1998 commercial where he replaced the figure of Christ from the Christ the Redeemer statue while in an Inter Milan strip. Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá, whose idol was Ronaldo, often celebrates with both arms outstretched. * The scorer rocking his arms from side to side, as though rocking a baby. This usually signifies that the scorer recently became a parent, whether or not for the first time. It was brought to the world's attention by Brazilian striker Bebeto (joined by teammates Rom√°rio and Mazinho) at the 1994 FIFA World Cup after his quarter- final goal against the Netherlands, celebrating his son Mattheus, born two days before. * The scorer putting the ball underneath their shirt to indicate the pregnancy of a loved one. * The scorer sucking his thumb as a tribute to his child(ren) or to signify that scoring a goal is like child's play, over the years this has become a trademark celebration of Roma legend Francesco Totti. blessing himself, Lionel Messi often celebrates a goal by pointing a finger on each hand towards the sky in dedication to his late grandmother. Players often point towards the skies to thank God, or recognise someone who has passed. Ronaldinho celebrating scoring a goal with both arms waving Steven Gerrard celebrating by connecting with fans. Players often point, salute or wave to their own fans, while some provoke opposition fans. * The scorer pointing towards the skies, either to express gratitude to God or to reference a person who is deceased ‚Äì Kak√° invariably gave thanks. * The scorer putting his hands behind his ears as if to listen to the reaction of the crowd more. This is usually done when a player is getting booed during the game and then scores, or if a player returns to score against his former club ‚Äì as Manchester United striker Romelu Lukaku did when he cupped his ears to Everton fans after scoring (they had booed him throughout the game). Rarely, this celebration is aimed at club staff, players or officials for various internal reasons. * The scorer exhibiting some kind of dancing after the goal, usually joined in by teammates. The first player to gain worldwide fame for this was probably Cameroon veteran Roger Milla at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, who celebrated all four of his goals by dancing around the corner flag. Peter Crouch garnered attention for his robot dances after scoring goals for England. Five South Africa (Bafana Bafana) players performed a memorable Macarena-style dance after scoring the opening goal at the 2010 World Cup. Antoine Griezmann's 'Hotline Bling' goal celebration dance features in a 2016 Puma commercial. * The scorer performing some kind of acrobatic routine after the goal. Mexico striker Hugo S√°nchez was the first notable exponent of the backflip. Nigerian footballers are well known for performing backflips after they score a goal, this includes a very famous one performed by Julius Aghahowa at the 2002 FIFA World Cup after he scored a goal against Sweden. Lomana LuaLua was banned from performing backflips by his then-club Portsmouth after injuring one of his feet during a celebration. Gabonese Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is also noted for celebrating in this manner. * The scorer removing his shirt. As of 2004, this is considered Excessive Celebration per FIFA's Laws of the game, and results in a yellow card. Andr√©s Iniesta was so punished for his celebration in the 2010 World Cup Final. * A common alternative, although more common in the late 1990s and early 2000s, was for the scoring player to lift up his shirt and show the crowd a T-shirt with a message underneath. Rom√°rio was a frequent adopter of this kind of celebration, showing up with a different message every match. A.S. Roma striker Francesco Totti often celebrated goals against S.S. Lazio in the Rome derby in this way, once memorably revealing a t-shirt which sported the Italian equivalent of the phrase \\"I have done you again!\\" * The scorer picking up the ball and running to the centre circle to put the ball down on the spot. It is generally used by teams that are losing and need more goals to win/draw the game in an effort to prevent timewasting. * The scorer imitating to shoot with some kind of weapon, either aiming towards the sky or to some other virtual target. Republic of Ireland striker Robbie Keane once performed a forward roll and finished by mimicking an archer against Saudi Arabia. * Teammates congratulating the scorer by kneeling down and pretending to shine his shoe ‚Äì Ronaldo's Inter Milan teammates often congratulated him in this manner. * Laying in the prostrate position to thank God in sujud, mostly done by Muslim players ‚Äì Egyptian forward Mohamed Salah performs this after a goal. * The scorer saluting the crowd ‚Äì alternatively the scorer mocking the crowd, as Cristiano Ronaldo did twice after scoring against Barcelona at the Nou Camp, in 2012 and 2016, when he gestured to the crowd to \\"calm down\\" after he scored. * The scorer jumping and punching the air ‚Äì this celebration features in Pel√©'s 1969 Brazilian postage stamp that commemorates his 1,000th career goal. Swedish forward Tomas Brolin often celebrated with a jump-pirouette. * The scorer pulling his shirt over his face ‚Äì often done by Fabrizio Ravanelli. * The scorer jumping into the crowd. This is commonly done whenever a very significant goal, such as an injury-time winner, is scored, an example being Troy Deeney's last-minute goal for Watford against Leicester City in 2013, sending Watford to a Wembley Play-Off Final. * The scorer running the length of the field. Infamously done by then-Manchester City striker Emmanuel Adebayor against his former club Arsenal in 2009. * Some players who have tattoos on their wrists or forearms will often kiss them to show respect to whoever or whatever the tattoo symbolises. Spanish striker √Ålvaro Negredo is an example, as is the Uruguayan Luis Su√°rez. *\\"The Thierry Henry\\" or \\"Henrying\\" was made famous by striker Thierry Henry, who would celebrate by simply propping himself up against the goal post while another hand was on the hip, hinting that he's tired and/or tired of scoring goals, and has a \\"been there, done that\\"-type of reaction. This went viral in social networks, using the pose to photoshop Henry into appropriate settings, from propping up the Leaning Tower of Pisa, to helping Muhammad Ali with his punching bag. *The scorer hitting or kicking the corner flag. Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar kicked the corner flag after scoring the winning penalty against Mexico in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Australian midfielder Tim Cahill is famous for his regular celebration of shadow boxing around the corner flag. West Ham United forward Paolo Di Canio once snapped a corner flag in half after kicking it in celebration of a goal against Leicester City, which was thought at the time to have been the Italian's final goal for the club before a strongly-rumoured transfer to Manchester United; the move never materialised. *The scorer reacting with their mouth as wide open as possible ‚Äì the magnitude of Zinedine Zidane's left foot volleyed winner in the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final saw him produce one of his most emotional goal celebrations as he ran towards the touchline with mouth wide open, screaming in delight. Liberian star George Weah had a similar open mouthed expression having run almost the entire length of the field and scored for A.C. Milan in 1996. *The scorer blowing a kiss to the crowd (this can be done in a mocking gesture); alternatively, the scorer provoking the crowd by kissing his team badge, or in the case of Barcelona captain Carles Puyol in 2009, kissing his Catalan armband in front of Real Madrid fans. *The scorer pointing/waving to their own fans ‚Äì alternatively, wave in a provocative manner to opposition fans; after scoring against Manchester United at Old Trafford in 2009 Liverpool striker Fernando Torres held his hand in the air to fans of arch rivals United, with his 'five times' gesture (spread out five fingers) signifying Liverpool's five Champions League titles (to United's three).https://talksport.com/football/426223/harry-wilson- fernando-torres-five-times-manchester-united/ *The scorer swinging an arm ‚Äì Mick Channon celebrated with his trademark windmill (swinging one arm round and round); South Korea's Park Ji-sung performed a two armed windmill after scoring against Greece at the 2010 World Cup. The two-armed windmill was also a trademark celebration for Marcelinho Carioca. *The scorer kissing the club/national badge on his or her shirt, to show his or her love and loyalty for the club/country; some players have even revelled in kissing the badge of their new team when scoring against their former club, a notable example being Wayne Rooney kissing the Manchester United badge when scoring against his boyhood team Everton. Punishment Giorgos Katidis was fined ‚Ç¨50,000 and banned for life from representing Greece after he celebrated scoring a goal with a Nazi salute Paolo Di Canio was suspended and fined after celebrating a goal with a fascist salute while playing for S.S. Lazio Xherdan Shaqiri celebrated his goal at the 2018 World Cup by making an eagle gesture, a symbol of ethnic Albanians, towards Serbian fans. According to the rules of the games (Law 12): :While it is permissible for a player to demonstrate his joy when a goal has been scored, the celebration must not be excessive.Laws of the Game, 2010/2011, FIFA In recent seasons, FIFA have attempted to crack down on some of the more enthusiastic celebrations. If a player incites the crowd and/or takes his shirt off or puts the ball under his/her shirt to indicate a pregnancy after scoring a goal, he/she is likely to get booked by the referee. This can cause huge controversy if the player has already been booked, since he would then be sent off. However, some players get around this rule by pulling the hem of their shirts over the head, without taking the shirt off entirely, but this is not always overturned by the referees. Some players have received fines for dropping their shorts after scoring. Jumping into the crowd is also a bookable offence (\\"deliberately leaving the field of play without the referee's permission\\", as identified in Law 12). Players might be also fined for revealing T-shirts which contain some kind of message directed to the spectators. Notable examples include Robbie Fowler being fined for showing a T-shirt that was designed to show support for the Liverpool dockers' strike, incorporating the Calvin Klein \\"CK\\" into the word doCKer; and Thierry Henry, who was fined by UEFA after he removed his Arsenal shirt to reveal a T-shirt reading \\"For the new-born Kyd\\", which was directed to his friend, Texas lead singer Sharleen Spiteri, who had just given birth. In 1999, Robbie Fowler was also fined ¬£60,000 by his club and the Premier League for having celebrated his penalty goal against Everton by getting down on all fours and miming the snorting of cocaine off of the white touchline. Although it was seen as Fowler's response to being accused of drug abuse in the tabloid press, then- manager G√©rard Houllier famously claimed that he was merely imitating \\"a cow eating grass\\". In January 1998, Rangers midfielder Paul Gascoigne courted serious controversy during a goal celebration where he mimed playing a flute (symbolic of the flute-playing of Loyalist Orange Order marchers) during a game against Celtic at Celtic Park. The gesture infuriated Celtic fans who had been taunting him and Gascoigne was fined ¬£20,000 by Rangers after the incident. He also received a death threat from an Irish Republican Army (IRA) member following the incident.Gascoigne, Paul; Davies, Hunter (2004). Gazza: My Story. p. 234. London: Headline Publishing. Boca Juniors striker Carlos Tevez was sent off for imitating a chicken when celebrating a goal against arch-rivals River Plate during the 2004 Copa Libertadores, clearly mocking the opposition crowd, with River called 'Gallinas' ('chickens') by other fans for choking late on. Paolo Di Canio made his mark in 2005, when during his period at Lazio, he made a fascist salute to the right-wing fans. He was fined and suspended as a result. Ipswich Town player David Norris received a fine after using a handcuff gesture to celebrate scoring against Blackpool in November 2008, dedicating the goal to ex-teammate Luke McCormick, who was jailed for death by dangerous driving. Everton midfielder Tim Cahill received a similar fine for a similar gesture in a match on 2 March 2008. A similar incident took place in Chelsea against Middlesbrough, when Chelsea's Salomon Kalou scored a brace and thereafter crossed hands with Ivorian teammate Didier Drogba. It was later revealed, however, that he claimed to have wanted to try out a new celebration and was not supporting an Ivorian convictionist. In a 2009 Premier League match between Manchester City and Arsenal, Manchester City striker Emmanuel Adebayor received a yellow card for running the length of the pitch to celebrate his goal in front of the Arsenal fans. This was seen as controversial because Adebayor signed for Manchester City that summer from Arsenal. In March 2013, AEK Athens midfielder Giorgos Katidis made a Nazi salute towards the crowd after scoring the winning goal against Veria. Though he later said he did not realise the meaning of the gesture, Katidis was fined ‚Ç¨50,000, banned from playing for AEK for the remainder of the season, and given a lifetime ban from representing Greece at the international level. West Bromwich Albion striker Nicolas Anelka was banned for five games and fined for celebrating a goal scored in December 2013 with a quenelle. While there was controversy with the gesture being linked to anti-Semitism, Anelka was cleared of being anti-Semitic or endorsing anti-Semitism. At the 2018 World Cup in Russia, Xherdan Shaqiri and fellow Swiss goalscorer Granit Xhaka, who is also of Kosovar descent, celebrated their goals by making an eagle gesture, a symbol of ethnic Albanians, towards Serbian fans. FIFA fined Xhaka and Shaqiri 10,000 Swiss francs \\"for unsporting behaviour contrary to the principles of fair-play\\". Not celebrating a goal Refusing to celebrate a goal or undertaking muted goal celebrations is not unknown and not uncommon in football. In the case of the former, it is often seen when a player scores against a former club, especially one where the player began his career and/or had his greatest period of success, or where he first made his name. Non- celebration against former clubs does seem to be a fairly recent trend, however. There are several recorded examples of players celebrating against their old club prior to the 2000s, when this practice started to become regarded as disrespectful. Conversely, not celebrating a goal for your current side could be considered somewhat strange. Goalkeepers who score goals via a long kick that is perhaps taken by the wind or evades the opposition goalkeeper upon bouncing on the pitch may not celebrate, as a mark of respect to the opposition goalkeeper. Muted celebration usually occurs when scoring a consolation goal in a match that is otherwise already lost; celebration may be omitted entirely if there is not enough time left on the clock and the losing team wants the match to continue as soon as possible. It also occurs when a large number of goals have been scored by one team in a match, and the result has been put beyond doubt; for later goals, celebrations might be reduced or non-existent. Several (though not all) of Southampton midfielder Matthew Le Tissier's goal celebrations were notably understated despite the fact that he scored a number of spectacular or technically difficult goals during his career; an example of this being his lack of celebration after scoring a goal from 30 yards against Blackburn Rovers in 1994‚Äì95 season which was later voted Goal of The Season. Le Tissier has since stated that he did not celebrate out of respect for his former teammate and friend Tim Flowers, who was the Blackburn goalkeeper that he beat. In ice-hockey, it is seen as good etiquette not to celebrate a goal made on an empty net where the goaltender has been pulled, due to the vulnerability of the opposing team and the lack of challenge. =Notable non-celebrations= A club legend for Fiorentina, Gabriel Batistuta was visibly upset when he scored for Roma against his former club in 2000. Egyptian Mohamed Salah has never celebrated after scoring against former clubs, Roma and Fiorentina. He has only celebrated a goal against a former club on one occasion (vs Chelsea) after a 30-yard strike for Liverpool in the 2018‚Äì19 season Fernando Torres, after scoring against boyhood club Atl√©tico Madrid while playing for Chelsea F.C., refused to celebrate. * Gabriel Batistuta, upon scoring for Roma against Fiorentina, refused to celebrate and even broke down in tears upon doing so; Batistuta was Fiorentina's all-time leading goalscorer and a club symbol for a long time before he joined Roma. *Denis Law, upon scoring for Manchester City against his former club Manchester United on the last day of the 1973‚Äì74 Football League First Division, refused to celebrate his goal.https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jan/07/features.sport11 *A number of players have chosen not to celebrate against their former clubs, including Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink upon scoring for Charlton Athletic against Chelsea, Gary McAllister upon scoring for Liverpool against Coventry City, Fernando Torres upon scoring for Chelsea against Atl√©tico Madrid, Gareth Bale upon scoring for Tottenham Hotspur against Southampton, Romelu Lukaku upon scoring for Everton against West Bromwich Albion, Ivan Rakitiƒá upon scoring for Barcelona against Seville and Gonzalo Higua√≠n upon scoring for Juventus against Napoli. *Fabrizio Miccoli, upon scoring for Palermo against Lecce, refused to celebrate and even broke down in tears upon doing so, as Lecce was his hometown club. * In 2012, Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard scored against Bolton Wanderers from a wind-assisted, 102-yard clearance. Despite becoming just the fourth goalkeeper in Premier League history to score a goal, and despite being mobbed by teammates, Howard refused to celebrate out of respect for opposition goalkeeper √Åd√°m Bogd√°n. *In the 2012‚Äì13 UEFA Champions League knockout phase, Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice against Manchester United, once in the first leg and again in the second leg. Both times he refused to celebrate out of respect to United; he also did not celebrate scoring against Barcelona in May 2018 as former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson had recently suffered a brain haemorrhage. *In 2013, Stoke City goalkeeper Asmir Begoviƒá scored after just 13 seconds with a long clearance against Southampton. Scoring from a distance of 97.5 yards, it earned him a place in the 2015 Guinness World Records for the 'longest goal scored in football'. Despite becoming just the fifth goalkeeper in Premier League history to score a goal, Begoviƒá refused to celebrate out of respect to opposing goalkeeper Artur Boruc. *Frank Lampard, upon scoring for Manchester City against Chelsea, refused to celebrate; Lampard was Chelsea's all-time leading goalscorer. *Aaron Ramsey, upon scoring twice for Arsenal against Cardiff City in 2013, refused to celebrate against the club that developed him as a kid. He received applause from Cardiff fans, with some even joining Arsenal fans in singing Ramsey's name late on. *In the 2014 World Cup semi-final, it was noted by several commentators during the match that the German players toned down their celebrations as the goals piled up against host nations Brazil. Mats Hummels confirmed that this was deliberate on the part of the German players out of a desire not to humiliate the Brazilians unnecessarily. * In 2013, Mario G√∂tze did not celebrate after scoring for Bayern M√ºnchen against his former club Borussia Dortmund. He was even booed by Dortmund fans earlier in the match. * In the 2014‚Äì15 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, √Ålvaro Morata refused to celebrate against former club Real Madrid after scoring for Juventus in both legs. * In the 2016‚Äì17 UEFA Champions League group stage, Cristiano Ronaldo did not celebrate his free kick for Real Madrid against childhood club Sporting CP, stating \\"they made me who I am\\". * David Villa has never celebrated scoring against Sporting de Gij√≥n, where he started his career, while playing for Valencia and Barcelona. * During a Premier League match, Liverpool's Egyptian forward Mohamed Salah did not celebrate against former club Chelsea to also pay tribute to those killed and injured in the 2017 Sinai mosque attack. Salah did not celebrate scoring against another former club, Roma, after scoring twice for Liverpool in the Champions League. Salah also never celebrated scoring against former club Fiorentina while he played in Italy. * Radamel Falcao, upon scoring for AS Monaco against former club FC Porto in 2017, refused to celebrate. He was applauded by Porto fans for the gesture. * In the 2018 FIFA World Cup quarter-final, Antoine Griezmann did not celebrate his goal against Uruguay because his mentor and club teammates are Uruguayan. * In the semi-final of the 2018‚Äì19 UEFA Champions League, Luis Suarez celebrated scoring against his former side Liverpool F.C. in a 3‚Äì0 victory in the first leg at the Camp Nou. Before the second leg, he promised he would not celebrate if he scored at Anfield and stayed true to his word when his side were defeated 4‚Äì0, knocking them out of the competition. Liverpool went on to lift the trophy. * In the 2018‚Äì19 FA Cup, √Ålvaro Morata refused to celebrate after scoring 2 goals against Nottingham Forest. According to Spanish media Marca, it was aimed at Chelsea assistant manager Gianfranco Zola, who criticised Morata's performance prior to the match.https://www.marca.com/en/football/international- football/2019/01/06/5c313cf7468aeb13688b45b7.html * After scoring the go-ahead penalty that put Real Madrid ahead of Levante FC in 2019, winger Gareth Bale refused to celebrate with his teammates, which some saw as growing dissatisfaction with them as well as his role in the club. Injuries While unusual and somewhat ironic, a variety of football players have injured themselves during celebration: examples include Paulo Diogo (who severed a finger after it got caught in a fence), Thierry Henry, Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá, Fabi√°n Esp√≠ndola, (who celebrated a goal that was later disallowed due to offside) and Michy Batshuayi. An Indian footballer, Peter Biaksangzuala , died from a spine injury in 2014 following a failed somersault celebration. Nicolai Muller once injured himself while celebrating scoring a goal against FC Augsburg when he spun around repeatedly in a \\"helicopter\\" stylen which had until that point, been his trademark celebration. Medical examination confirmed that the striker had ruptured the ACL in his right knee. He was out of action for 10 months, and after his team were relegated he left the club. Managers and coaches celebrations Managers (and coaching staff) have been known for their exuberant goal celebrations. Some notable celebrations include; * On 10 April 1993, Alex Ferguson's Manchester United were losing to Sheffield Wednesday in the Premier League with four minutes of the 90 to go before Steve Bruce equalised.

In 1998, Jacor was purchased by Clear Channel Communications, now iHeartMedia, for $2.8 billion. Jacor Communications began with three religious stations and went on to acquire dozens of radio stations between 1992 and its sale to Clear Channel in 1999. It also owned a few television stations, including WKRC-TV in Cincinnati. History Jacor Communicatiosn was founded by Terry Jacobs. Jacobs incorporated Jacor Communications in 1979 and purchased three religious stations in 1981. In June 1989, Jacor purchased Telesat Cable, a Northern Kentucky cable provider, for $5 million, which it later sold in May 1994. In 1993, an investor named Sam Zell paid $80 million from the Zell Chillmark fund to purchase controlling interest in Jacor. In 1992, the Federal Communications Commission increased the number of radio stations a single company could own in one city to 3AMS and 3FMs. After this change, Jacor began purchasing stations, including WKRC Radio in Cincinnati in 1993. On February 6, 1996, Jacor announced plans to acquire Noble Broadcast Group Inc for $152 million. After the passing of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Jacor began buying more radio stations. On February 13, 1996, Jacor announced it would buy Citicasters for $770 million. As part of the merger, Jacor acquired WKRC-TV, a Cincinnati CBS-affiliate television station, and WTSP, a television station in Tampa, Florida. In September, Jacor announced WTSP would be sold to Gannett Co. in exchange for three radio stations. In May 1993, founder and CEO Terry Jacobs left Jacor. The VP of Programming and COO, Randy Michaels, was named President of the company that year, and in 1996, he was promoted to CEO. Jacor's corporate headquarters were in downtown Cincinnati from the mid-1980s through 1996 when they moved across the Ohio River to Covington, Kentucky. In 1997, Jacor acquired the assets of Nationwide Communications. In 1999, Jacor was sold to Clear Channel Communications for $3.4 billion in stock. Clear Channel also assumed approximately $1.2 billion of Jacor's debt. At the time of its acquisition, Jacor was the third-largest provider of syndicated radio programming, owning 230 radio stations and Premiere Radio networks (a radio syndication company), as well as disseminating The Rush Limbaugh Show and the Dr. Laura Schlessinger show. Clear Channel named Randy Michaels CEO and chairman of Clear Channel Radio in 2000. In 2008, private equity firms Thomas H. Lee and Bain Capital Partners completed a buyout of Clear Channel Communications.

That season, he hit .289 with four home runs in 45 at bats. Despite some success at the plate, Alc√°ntara quickly found himself deep on the Red Sox bench after irking Boston manager Jimy Williams by a perceived lack of hustle during a game against the Chicago White Sox. For a time, Williams refused to play Alc√°ntara despite general manager Dan Duquette's insistence the outfielder be put in the lineup of a team that suffered from low power numbers. In , Alc√°ntara's average declined to .263 with no home runs in 38 at bats in Boston although he continued to smash AAA pitching. Alc√°ntara is remembered for an incident while he was playing with the Pawtucket Red Sox, Boston's AAA affiliate of the International League. On July 3, 2001, after being brushed back a second time by Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons pitcher Blas Cede√±o, Alc√°ntara turned around, kicking catcher Jeremy Salazar, karate- style, in the mask before charging the mound, throwing an unsuccessful punch at Cede√±o before turning around as other players joined the fight until he was tackled by Kevin Orie.

The series stars Corey Parker and T√©a Leoni. Synopsis The series revolves around awkward post-collegian Neil Barash (Parker) who, by serendipity, meets beautiful libertine Alicia (Leoni) and begins a relationship with her. The show explores the difficulties faced by self- conscious and repressed Neil in dealing with the erotic antics of Alicia and her eccentric roommates, Jordan (Robert Bauer) and Megan (Clea Lewis). Veteran comedy actor Peter Boyle guest starred as Alicia's father, a former spy, and Charles Rocket had a recurring role as movie maker Dennis Lake. Thomas Haden Church, acting full-time on Wings, also served in a recurring role as Jonathan. In addition to Leoni, an assortment of stars had guest spots or cameos in the series before they became famous, including Diedrich Bader, Jill Hennessy, Greg Grunberg, Lisa Kudrow, Adam Ferrara, Andy Dick, Willie Garson and Noah Emmerich. Cast *Corey Parker as Neil Barash *T√©a Leoni as Alicia *Cristine Rose as Ellen Barash *Robert Bauer as Jordan *Clea Lewis as Megan *Marcus Giamatti as Ted Sharperson *Michael Tucci as Jeremy Barash Production The series was created by Richard Rosenstock, who later went on to write for Fox's Arrested Development. The theme song for the show was \\"A Million Miles Away\\", written and performed by David Byrne which appeared on his spring 1992 album release Uh-Oh. The production companies were Sweetum Productions, and Paramount Network Television in association with (eventual corporate sibling) Viacom Productions. The series later became owned by CBS Television Distribution. Episodes Reception The series got generally favourable notices upon its debut. Ken Tucker gave the show a B+ in Entertainment Weekly, \\"Flying Blind's pilot episode is so well written, so zippily sexy, that it immediately stands out among Fox's usual run of self- consciously crude comedies. But even if it soon crashes and burns, this pilot for Flying Blind is easily one of the best debut shows of the year.\\" People also graded the pilot a B+ and stated \\"The show may never again attain the sustained comic brilliance of last week's pilot. But this is a rarity for Fox: a sophisticated and clever sitcom.\\" Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times wrote \\"It's not only the episode's sharp writing but also its eroticism and its balance between the naivete and predictability of Neil and the spontaneity and instability of Alicia that give \\"Flying Blind\\" its uniqueness. What a nice beginning.\\" Mike Duffy of the Detroit Free Press wrote, \\"Rosenstock has a terrific sense of irreverent non-sexist humor, the sort of contemporary, self- deprecating wit that makes Neil and the outlandishly attractive Alicia most enjoyable. Plus, Flying Blind stars Parker and Leoni share a very nifty comic chemistry in this hip, fast-talking and contemporary romance.\\" The show only lasted one year and has never been released on DVD. Joel Keller of The Huffington Post remarked \\"I'm not sure why the show only lasted one year, given the talent both in front of and behind the camera (James Burrows directed some episodes, and Linwood Boomer was one of the writers). But when it was on the air, it was mostly an enjoyable show to watch.\\" References External links  * 1990s American sitcoms 1992 American television series debuts 1993 American television series endings Fox Broadcasting Company original programming Television series about Jews and Judaism Television series by CBS Television Studios Television shows set in New York City English-language television shows ","title":"Flying Blind (TV series)"},{"id":"4033773","text":"{class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float:right; margin-left:1em; width:280px; font- size:90%;\\" |+ style=\\"font-size: larger; margin: inherit;\\" Tony Angelo |- style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\" colspan=3 align=\\"center\\" |Tony Angelo at the autograph table during a Formula Drift event at Evergreen Speedway |- style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\" width=90Born: colspan=2 - style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\" Hometown: colspan=2 Doylestown, Pennsylvania |- style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\" Series: colspan=2 Formula D |- style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\" |} Tony Angelo (born December 24, 1978) is an American professional drift racer and stunt driver.

Any difference between the two figures needs to be examined and, if appropriate, rectified. Bank statements are commonly routinely produced by the financial institution and used by account holders to perform their bank reconciliations. To assist in reconciliations, many financial institutions now also offer direct downloads of financial transaction information into the account holders accounting software, typically using the .csv file format. Differences between an entity‚Äôs books of account and the bank‚Äôs records may arise, for example, because: * cheques issued by the entity have not been presented to the bank or the bank has dishonoured a cheque, * a banking transaction, such as a credit received, or a charge made by the bank, has not yet been recorded in the entity's books, or * either the bank or the entity itself has made an error. Sometimes it may be easy to reconcile the difference by looking at the transactions in the bank statement since the last reconciliation and the entity's own accounting records (cash book) to see if some combination of them tally with the difference to be explained. Otherwise it may be necessary to go through and match every transaction in both sets of records since the last reconciliation, and identify which transactions remain unmatched. The necessary adjustments should then be made in the cash book, or reported to the bank if necessary, or any timing differences recorded to assist with future reconciliations. For this reason, and to minimise the amount of work involved, it is good practice to carry out reconciliations at reasonably frequent intervals. Bank reconciliation statement A bank reconciliation statement is a statement prepared by the entity as part of the reconciliation process which sets out the entries which have caused the difference between the two balances. It would, for example, list outstanding cheques (ie., issued cheques that have still not been presented at the bank for payment). The entries in the entity‚Äôs books to rectify the discovered discrepancies (except for the outstanding cheques) would typically be made in a subsequent date or period, not backdated. When cheques become stale (ie., out of date), they would typically be reversed, not cancelled.

The film was released direct-to-DVD in the United States on May 2, 2006. Plot Commander Sam Keenan (Jean-Claude van Damme), a decorated US Navy SEAL, is sent to the Eastern European nation of Moldavia to become the new security attach√© at the US Embassy. When he arrives, Keenan learns that Moldavia is in the middle of a civil war. At the embassy, Keenan meets with Ambassador George Norland (Colin Stinton), who makes Keenan the deputy ambassador. Recently, the US installed a new government in Moldavia, which is led by Moldavia's newly elected president Yuri Amirev (Serban Celea). However, Amirev wants the nation to be run as a democractic republic, but under the command of Anton Tavarov (Velibor Topiƒá), communist insurgents have caused a riot at the presidential palace, threatening the fragile stability of the country. The insurgents are loyal to Alexei Kirilov (Costel Lupea), the former brutal communist dictator of Moldavia. When the palace guards start firing on the insurgents without Amirev's authorization, the insurgents storm the palace, demanding Amirev's head. Keenan volunteers to bring Amirev to the embassy. But events reach critical mass, and the insurgents open fire. Keenan barely makes it back with Amirev, but the fight isn't over yet. Fifty Americans are holed up in the embassy, and Tavarov and his massive army have arrived at the gates, with plans to crash the building and drag Amirev out by any means necessary. To add to Keenan's problems, Norland is killed by a rocket that was launched by one of Tavarov's men. To defend the embassy, Keenan has only 15 Marines, CIA bureaucrat Frank Gaines (William Tapley), limited ammunition, and his martial arts skills to hold Tavarov's army off until American reinforcements arrive. To make matters worse, Keenan's girlfriend, reporter Michelle Whitman (Julie Cox), is one of the hostages. With Tavarov's crew getting in position for attack, a power struggle takes place between Keenan and Gaines; with help hours away, it will be up to Keenan to rescue the hostages. When the supposedly loyal General Borgov (a personal CIA \\"asset\\" claimed by Gaines) arrives he turns out to side with the insurgents but Keenan rescues the surviving personnel with help from arriving American military reinforcements.

It is part of an extended performance piece called \\"Celebration of the Lizard\\" that the band played live multiple times. A 17-minute studio recording of the complete piece was attempted during the sessions for Waiting for the Sun, and the lyrics were printed in their entirety on the gatefold LP sleeve, but only the musical passage \\"Not to Touch the Earth\\" was included on the LP.

Lyrical meaning The song begins, \\"Not to touch the earth, not to see the sun...\\" These are subchapters of the 60th chapter of The Golden Bough by James Frazer. The chapter is called \\"Between Heaven and Earth\\", with subchapter 1, \\"Not to Touch the Earth\\", and subchapter 2, \\"Not to See the Sun\\". These subchapters detail taboos against certain people (generally royalty or priests) walking upon the ground or having the sun shine directly upon them. Frazer had noted that these superstitions were recurring throughout many primitive cultures, and appeared to be related to traditions and taboos concerning menarche and the following female initiation rites. Frazer's work had an influence on Morrison, according to the biography No One Here Gets Out Alive (1980).

During the 1950s he had 100,000 listeners to his 9pm-midnight slot and he received 3,000 letters a week.Cantor, Louis. Dewey and Elvis: The Life and Times of a Rock 'n' Roll Deejay. Urbana, Ill: University of Illinois Press, 2005. Phillips' on-air persona was a speed- crazed hillbilly, with a frantic delivery and entertaining sense of humor. He also had a keen ear for music the listening public would enjoy, and he aired both black and white music, which was abundant in post-World War II Memphis, a booming river city which attracted large numbers of rural blacks and whites (along with their musical traditions). Dr. W. Herbert Brewster, pastor of East Trigg Baptist Church, was a frequent guest on Dewey's program. He played a great deal of rhythm and blues, country music, boogie-woogie, and jazz as well as Sun Records artists. In 1950, Phillips and his friend Sam Phillips (no relation) decided to launch their own record label. Joe Hill Louis waxed an electric blues single, \\"Boogie in the Park\\" (recorded in July 1950 and released the following month). It was the only record released on the Phillips label before Sam founded Sun Records. On 10 July 1954, he was the first DJ to broadcast the young Elvis Presley's debut record, \\"That's All Right\\" / \\"Blue Moon Of Kentucky\\" (Sun 209), and got Presley to reveal his race in an interview by asking which high school the 19-year-old singer attended (knowing that, because of segregation, his audience would readily know what race attended which schools). Dewey Phillips was bringing Black Music to segregated Memphis before Alan Freed did the same as Moon Dog in Cleveland. Phillips briefly hosted an afternoon program on WHBQ-TV/13 in the mid-1950s, before Dick Clark took over Philadelphia Bandstand then American Bandstand on WFIL- TV. It mostly consisted of Phillips playing records while he and others clowned around in front of the camera. Though Phillips was not involved in the payola scandals of the time (as was Freed), he was fired in late 1958 when the station adopted a Top 40 format, phasing out his freeform style. He had Sam Phillips and three other friends, Wink Martindale, T.L. Meade, and Sonny Gilmore to bail him out and keep him steady as work and recognition faded. He spent the last decade of his life working at smaller radio stations, seldom lasting long. The popular musical Memphis is said to be based loosely on Dewey Phillips' life and career, although elements crucial in the career of Phillips' contemporary Alan Freed appear to be intermixed as well. Death Phillips died of heart failure at age 42. He is buried in Hardin County, Tennessee, at Crump Cemetery.Cantor (2005) p.31 References Additional sourcing * External links   One hour of airchecks, 1952-1960s.

The station is owned by iHeartMedia. WILM is known as the station where radio and television talk show Joe Pyne developed the confrontational style now standard in radio and TV talk shows. Another well-known WILM personality was Tom Mees (ESPN) who worked at the station in the 1970s. In the 1950s and 1960s WILM, under the ownership of Ewing Hawkins, experimented with various music formats, including Top-40 and MOR (middle-of-the-road). For a time, the WILM deejays were known as the \\"Flip Top Jocks.\\" One of the program directors was Dean Tyler, who would later go on to be an influential broadcaster and manager in Philadelphia radio. In the early 1970s WILM adopted an Adult contemporary music format and featured an all-night block of rhythm and blues music geared to the city's African- American community. At this time, the station was affiliated with the Mutual Broadcasting System. In January 1976, WILM switched to an all-news format, using the short-lived NIS (News and Information Service), operated by NBC. When the NIS ceased operations shortly thereafter, WILM continued on with its news format. Eventually the station modified its format and affiliated with the CBS radio network for news and features. The station also kept a secondary affiliation with the Mutual Broadcasting System, which carried The Larry King Show. By the 1990s, WILM had added syndicated talk programming throughout its lineup. The station became one of the first to add, then, the very first to drop Rush Limbaugh's daily show from its schedule. A former program director said the decision was made due to incompatibilities with sales and audience demand but has since acknowledged the station chose not to pay increased carriage fees. During this period, another Wilmington station with a stronger signal, WDEL also adopted a full-time news and talk format, beginning direct competition with WILM, including picking up Rush Limbaugh's program. By 2000, WILM began to shift toward talk radio. Mike Gallagher's syndicated show joined local host John Watson on the station's daily schedule. An evening hour featured a cavalcade of amateur talk radio hosts; most were members of the Wilmington-area community. Weekend programming was almost exclusively all satellite talk by 2004. In 2004, owner Sally V. Hawkins sold WILM to Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) for $4 million. On July 28, 2006, WILM dropped the national newscasts from CBS Radio and switched to Fox News Radio. Clear Channel moved WILM into a new broadcast facility shared with its other Delaware stations. The new facility allows automated operation and Clear Channel reduced WILM's local air staff and local programming and added syndicated talk programming including Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Michael Savage. Both Limbaugh and Hannity had been carried by WDEL during a period when it dominated local ratings in the talk format, although these programs have not received comparable ratings on WILM. In 2010, Clear Channel dropped WILM's morning news block programming and replaced it with a local talk show hosted by Bruce Elliott, who had previously done a weekend talk show at WBAL in Baltimore. In 2011, about six months after Elliott's arrival, Clear Channel dropped WILM's late morning local talk show hosted by John Watson and replaced it with a syndicated program hosted by Glenn Beck (which Clear Channel distributes). Almost all programs on WILM are simulcast on Clear Channel's WDOV in Dover. WILM, which once boasted about its large local news staff, now carries local news from WDOV. Sunday morning programs on WILM are generally public access shows which include health, real estate, gardening and Italian- American programs.

Early life Born in Salt Lake City, Cannon was the eldest child of Sarah Jenne Cannon and George Q. Cannon. His father was an apostle in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and later was a member of its First Presidency. After attending the school in Salt Lake City, Frank Cannon studied at University of Deseret, graduating at the age of 19. He married Martha Brown of Ogden in 1878. Political career In 1891 he helped to organize the Utah Republican Party. After a failed bid to become delegate from the Utah Territory, he succeeded and served from March 4, 1895, to January 4, 1896. Cannon was chosen in 1896 to serve as senator by the Utah Legislature in spite of LDS church leadership favoring his father for the job. He served in the United States Senate, initially, as a member of the Republican Party; however, he later became a member of the Silver Republican Party, founded by his successor (and future employer at The Salt Lake Tribune) Thomas Kearns. Cannon lost re- election in 1899. Utah's state legislators indicated they would not support Cannon for re-election shortly after the November 1898 elections. Cannon had voted against the Dingley Act, which would have raised tariffs on sugar and helped the Utah sugar industry.Powell, p. 70. It was strongly supported by the LDS Church hierarchy, who now opposed his re-election. Other factors were his support for Free Silver, rumors about immoral acts he may have committed while living in Washington, DC, and the fact thar the Utah legislature was controlled by Democrats. Alfred W. McCune, one of Salt Lake City's most prominent businessmen, sought and won the backing of the LDS Church in his bid for the seat.Alexander, p. 10. But the legislature quickly deadlocked over the election. One-hundred and twenty-one ballots were cast, and no winner emerged. On February 18, a state representative accused McCune of trying to buy his vote. A seven-member legislative voted 7-to-2 to absolve McCune of the charge, and although ballotting resumed on March 8 McCune still lacked enough votes to win office (he had only 25 votes). The legislature adjourned without having chosen a senator, Utah's U.S. Senate seat remained vacant until January 1901. The Republicans regained their majority in the state legislature in the election of 1900 and elected a wealthy mine owner Thomas Kearns to fill the seat. The election was still hotly disputed. Kearns received only 8 votes on the first ballot, and balloting continued for four more days. On January 22, Kearns won the election by a vote of 37-to-25 (with a unanimous block of Republican votes).Powell, p. 158. Cannon affiliated with the Democratic Party in 1900 and served as its state chairman 1902‚Äì1904. Later life After failing to be re-elected to the U.S. Senate by the Utah legislature, in part due to opposition by the Mormon hierarchy, Cannon worked as the editor of several newspapers, including The Salt Lake Tribune, the Ogden Herald (Ogden, Utah) and established the Ogden Standard in 1888. Between 1904 and 1911, Cannon consistently supported the anti-Mormon American Party in newspaper editorials. Cannon later rejected Mormonism and wrote a book, with Harvey J. O'Higgins, called Under the Prophet in Utah exposing the rigidly hierarchical nature of the Mormon organization. The book denounced what the authors described as the \\"church\\" leadership's \\"absolutism\\" and \\"interference\\" in politics: \\"[Mormons] live under an absolutism. They have no more right of judgment than a dead body. Yet the diffusion of authority is so clever that nearly every man seems to share in its operation... and feels himself in some degree a master without observing that he is also a slave\\". The book details the negotiations Cannon participated in on Utah's behalf leading to statehood in exchange for official rejection of polygamy and LDS leadership's domination of civil politics during the 1890s, and the subsequent back-sliding he observed in the years following statehood. During the last two decades of his life, he lectured against Mormonism and in support of \\"free silver\\" policies (as opposed to the Gold Standard). He died, at the age of 74, in Denver, in 1933.

Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre from the 1825 ‚Ä≥Illustrated Map of the Capital City of Saint Petersburg‚Ä≥ The Saint Petersburg Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre (The Big Stone Theatre of Saint Petersburg, ) was a theatre in Saint Petersburg. It was built in 1783 to Antonio Rinaldi's Neoclassical design as the Kamenny (i.e., Stone) Theatre; Giovanni Paisiello‚Äôs opera Il mondo della luna was performed at the opening on 24 September. It was rebuilt in 1802 according to the designs of the architect Thomas de Thomon and renamed the Bolshoi, but burned down in 1811. The building was restored in 1818, and modified between 1826 and 1836 by Alberto Cavos to accommodate more modern machinery. Until 1886, the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre was principal theatre for both the Imperial Ballet and the Imperial Russian Opera. It was there that the first Russian operas ‚Äî Glinka's A Life for the Tsar and Ruslan and Lyudmila ‚Äî were premiered. Although the theatre would include many of the great Russian operas in its repertory, many of the works of Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, and Rimsky-Korsakov received their world premieres on the stage of the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre. Many of the great 19th century ballets of Marius Petipa and Arthur Saint-L√©on were given for the first time on the stage of the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre. In 1886 the building was declared unsafe and, at the behest of the theatre director Ivan Vsevolozhsky, the ballet and opera performances moved to the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre, where they have remained ever since. The Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre was then torn down to make way for the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. The only surviving sections of the original theatre are the grand staircase and landing, preserved in the building of the conservatory.

The structure and themes of the overture follow the play very generally. The main C minor theme represents Coriolanus' resolve and war-like tendencies (he is about to invade Rome), while the more tender E-flat major theme represents the pleadings of his mother to desist. Coriolanus eventually gives in to tenderness, but since he cannot turn back having led an army of his former enemies to Rome's gates, he kills himself. (This differs from the better-known play Coriolanus by William Shakespeare, in which he is murdered. Both Shakespeare's and Collin's plays are about the same semi-legendary figure, Gaius Marcius Coriolanus, whose actual fate was not recorded.) The overture was premiered in March 1807 at a private concert in the home of Prince Franz Joseph von Lobkowitz. The Symphony No. 4 in B-flat and the Piano Concerto No. 4 in G were premiered at the same concert.Steinberg, Michael. \\"The Symphony: a listeners guide\\". pp. 19‚Äì24.

While most investors are considered risk averse, one could view casino-goers as risk-seeking. If offered either $50 or a 50% each chance of either $100 or nothing, a risk-seeking person would prefer the gamble even though the gamble and the sure thing have the same expected value. Risk-seeking behavior can be observed in the negative domain x<0 for prospect theory value functions, where the functions are convex for x<0 but concave for x > 0. Psychology =Child personality traits' effect on adulthood ‚Äì What traits contribute to risk-seeking?= In a study done by Friedman et al. (1995), they found significant evidence to support that low childhood conscientiousness contributed heavily to adulthood mortality. Those who were high in conscientiousness as a child were 30% less likely to die in their adulthood. Ultimately, their findings solidified that low levels of childhood conscientiousness predict risk seeking, and risk-seeking increases the chance of accidental death. Though risk-seeking deteriorates with age, risky exposure to abusive substances in adolescence can lead to lifetime risk factors due to addiction. Conscientious individuals are subject to greater internal impulse control which lets them think out risky decisions more carefully, while those low on conscientiousness are more likely to endanger themselves and others by risky, or sometimes even criminal behaviour.Hampson, S., (2006). Methods by which childhood personality traits influence adult well-being. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 17, 264-268. =Psychometric paradigm= The psychometric paradigm explores what stable personality traits and risk behaviours have in common with an individualistic approach. Zuckerman's (1994) sensation seeking theory is important in assessing the causative factors of certain risk-seeking behaviours. Many risk-seeking behaviours justify humans need for sensation seeking. Behaviours like adventurous sports, drug use, promiscuous sex, entrepreneurship, gambling, and dangerous driving to name a few both represent sensation seeking, as well as risk seeking. Impulsivity has been linked to risk-seeking and can be described as the desire to indulge in situations with a potential reward, and little to no planning of the potential punishments of loss or reward. Impulsivity has also been linked to sensation seeking and in recent theories have been combined to form a higher order trait called impulsive sensation seeking.Zuckerman, M., Kuhlman, D. M., Joireman, J., Teta, P., 8c Kraft, M. (1993). A comparison of three structural models for personality: The big three, the big five and the alternative five. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 65, 757-768. =Neuropsychological paradigm= The neuropsychological paradigm looks at why people make the decisions they do, as well as the neuropsychological processes that contribute to the decisions people make. This view looks less at impulsivity, puts more emphasis on cognitive dynamics and assumes people take risks because they have assessed the future outcomes. =Men vs. women seeking risks= Risk-seeking youth in Soweto (South Africa) Demographic differences also play a role in risk-seeking between individuals. Through an analysis done by scientists, they demonstrated that men typically seek risks more than women.Byrnes, P., Miller, C., Schafer, D. (1999). Gender differences in risk taking: A meta-analysis. Psychological Bulletin, 125, 367-383. There are biological differences in men and women that may lead to the drive to seek risks. For example, testosterone plays a large role in risk-seeking in people and women have significantly lower levels of this hormone. This hormone has behavioural effects on aggression, mood and sexual function, all of which can lead to risk-seeking decision making. In their study, they also found that testosterone in excess leads to increased sexual enjoyment, and therefore more of an incentive to engage in risky unprotected sex.O'connor D., Archer, J., Wu, F. (2004) Effects of testosterone on mood, aggression, and sexual behaviour in young men: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study.

The American Journal of psychology, 121, 363-376. Risk-seeking utility function Choice under uncertainty is often characterized as the maximization of expected utility. Utility is often assumed to be a function of profit or final portfolio wealth, with a positive first derivative. The utility function whose expected value is maximized is convex for a risk- seeker, concave for a risk-averse agent, and linear for a risk-neutral agent. Its convexity in the risk-seeking case has the effect of causing a mean- preserving spread of any probability distribution of wealth outcomes to be preferred over the unspread distribution.

It was manned by hundreds of officers and troops, principally from Les Compagnies Franches de la Marine.p. 18, Folwell, Elizabeth, and Amy Godine, Adirondack Odysseys, The Adirondack Museum, Blue Mountain Lake, New York, 1997, The fort gave the French control of the frontier between New France and the British colonies to the south. As the only permanent stronghold in the area until the building of Fort Carillon at Ticonderoga starting in 1755, many French raids originated there and it was a target of British operations in the French and Indian War. Constructed on the tip of a strategic peninsula at a narrows in the lake, the cannons of Fort Saint-Fr√©d√©ric and the later British Fort Crown Point were capable of halting all north-south travel on the lake. In 1759 when British forces moved against Fort Saint-Fr√©d√©ric during the war, the retreating French destroyed it.p. 19, Folwell, Elizabeth, and Amy Godine, Adirondack Odysseys, The Adirondack Museum, Blue Mountain Lake, New York, 1997, =Fort Crown Point= Rather than rehabilitate the ruins of the French fort, General Amherst embarked on the construction of an enormous earthen fort. The Crown Point fort was constructed by his following the capture of Fort Carillon, a French fort to the south (which he renamed Fort Ticonderoga), and the destruction of Fort St. Fr√©d√©ric. Amherst used the construction of the fort as a means of keeping his men working through the winter of 1759 after pushing the French into modern Canada. The Fort was never directly assaulted. Mostly built after the threat of French invasion had ended, it was used largely for staging rather than as a position in its own right. After the French and Indian War the British left only a skeletal force at the Fort, which yielded easily to Capt. Seth Warner and 100 Green Mountain Boys, an American militia, on May 12, 1775 in the battle of Crown Point at the start of the American Revolutionary War. The 111 cannons captured from the British at Crown Point proved valuable in driving the British out of Boston. The fort was used as a staging ground by Benedict Arnold during the war for his navy on Lake Champlain. After the destruction of that navy in 1776 in the Battle of Valcour Island, the fort was abandoned to the British in 1777. It was abandoned for good in 1780. The large earthen walls of the fort are still visible today. A massive, accidental fire in April 1773 entirely destroyed the log and earth fortress, leaving the empty stone ruins of two barracks buildings standing. These ruins still stand and are being carefully preserved. Today The historic site was established in 1910 to preserve the ruins of the two forts. Both fort ruins are listed as U.S. National Historic Landmarks. Fort Saint-Fr√©d√©ric was registered as a National Historic Landmark in 1962. The park's facilities and services include a picnic area, scenic views, hiking, a museum, history interpreters in replica clothing, and educational services.

Signs and symptoms Pretibial myxedema is almost always preceded by the ocular signs found in Graves' disease. It usually presents itself as a waxy, discolored induration of the skin‚Äîclassically described as having a so-called peau d'orange (orange peel) appearance‚Äîon the anterior aspect of the lower legs, spreading to the dorsum of the feet, or as a non-localised, non-pitting edema of the skin in the same areas. In advanced cases, this may extend to the upper trunk (torso), upper extremities, face, neck, back, chest and ears. The lesions are known to resolve very slowly. Application of petroleum jelly on the affected area could relieve the burning sensation and the itching. It occasionally occurs in non- thyrotoxic Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and stasis dermatitis. The serum contains circulating factors which stimulate fibroblasts to increase synthesis of glycosaminoglycans. Risk factors There are suggestions in the medical literature that treatment with radioactive iodine for Graves' hyperthyroidism may be a trigger for pretibial myxedema which would be consistent with radioiodine ablation causing or aggravating ophthalmopathy, a condition which commonly occurs with pretibial myxedema and is believed to have common underlying features. Other known triggers for ophthalmopathy include thyroid hormone imbalance, and tobacco smoking, but there has been little research attempting to confirm these are also risk factors for pretibial myxedema. Diagnosis A biopsy of the affected skin reveals mucin in the mid- to lower- dermis. There is no increase in fibroblasts. Over time, secondary hyperkeratosis may occur, which may become verruciform. Many of these patients may also have co-existing stasis dermatitis. Elastic stains will reveal a reduction in elastic tissue. Management Treating the symptoms and correction of dysthyroid state to euthyroid state.

Gilani's mother, Ummul Khair Fatima, was also a Sayyid, having been a descendant of Muhammad al-Jawad, himself descended from Husayn ibn Ali, the younger brother of Hasan. Education Gilani spent his early life in Gilan, the province of his birth. In 1095, at the age of eighteen, he went to Baghdad. There, he pursued the study of Hanbali law under Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi and ibn Aqil. He studied Hadith with Abu Muhammad Ja'far al-Sarraj. His Sufi spiritual instructor was Abu'l-Khair Hammad ibn Muslim al-Dabbas.Malise Ruthven, Islam in the World, p 243. (A detailed description of his various teachers and subjects are included below). After completing his education, Gilani left Baghdad. He spent twenty-five years wandering in the deserts of Iraq.Esposito J. L. The Oxford dictionary of Islam. p160.  School of law  'Abd al-Qadir al-Gilani belonged to the Shafi'i and Hanbali schools of law. He placed Shafi'i jurisprudence (fiqh) on an equal footing with the Hanbali school (madhhab), and used to give fatwa according to both of them simultaneously. Later life In 1127, Gilani returned to Baghdad and began to preach to the public. He joined the teaching staff of the school belonging to his own teacher, al-Mazkhzoomi, and was popular with students. In the morning he taught hadith and tafsir, and in the afternoon he held discourse on the science of the heart and the virtues of the Quran. He was said to have been a convincing preacher and converted numerous Jews and Christians. He was able to reconcile the mystical nature of Sufism with the sober demands of Islamic Law.

The project was officially abandoned in April 2005, while still in development stage and cost the federal government nearly $170 million. In 2006, the Washington Post wrote \\"In a 318-page report, completed in January 2005 and obtained by The Post under the Freedom of Information Act, [the Aerospace Corporation] said the SAIC software was incomplete, inadequate and so poorly designed that it would be essentially unusable under real-world conditions. Even in rudimentary tests, the system did not comply with basic requirements, the report said. It did not include network-management or archiving systems‚Äîa failing that would put crucial law enforcement and national security data at risk\\"  Origins  In September 2000, the FBI announced the \\"Trilogy\\" program, intended to modernize the bureau's outdated Information Technology (IT) infrastructure. The project had three parts: purchasing modern desktop computers for all FBI offices, developing secure high-performance WAN and LAN networks, and modernizing the FBI's suite of investigative software applications. The first two goals of Trilogy were generally successful, despite cost overruns. Replacing the Bureau's Automated Case Support (ACS) software system proved difficult. It had been developed in-house by the bureau and was used to manage all documents relating to cases being investigated by the FBI, enabling agents to search and analyze evidence between different cases. The project was originally scheduled to take three years and cost US$380 million. ACS was considered by 2000 a legacy system, made up of many separate stovepipe applications that were difficult and cumbersome to use. ACS was built on top of many obsolete 1970s-era software tools, including the programming language Natural, the ADABAS database management system, and IBM 3270 green screen terminals. Some IT analysts believed that ACS was already obsolete when it was first deployed in 1995.  Launch  Bob E. Dies, then the bureau's assistant director of information resources and head of the Trilogy project, prepared initial plans in 2000 for a replacement to ACS and several other outdated software applications. In June 2001, a cost-plus contract for the software aspects of the project was awarded to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), and the network aspects were contracted to DynCorp. Dies was the first of five people who would eventually be in charge of the project. The software was originally intended to be deployed in mid-2004, and was originally intended to be little more than a web front-end to the existing ACS data.  Problems and abandonment  Robert Mueller was appointed director of the FBI in September 2001, just one week before the September 11, 2001 attacks. The attacks highlighted the Bureau's information sharing problems and increased pressure for the Bureau to modernize. In December 2001, the scope of VCF was changed with the goal being complete replacement of all previous applications and migration of the existing data into an Oracle database. Additionally, the project's deadline was pushed up to December 2003. Initial development was based on meetings with users of the current ACS system. SAIC broke its programmers up into eight separate and sometimes competing teams. One SAIC security engineer, Matthew Patton, used VCF as an example in an October 24, 2002 post on the InfoSec News mailing list regarding the state of federal information system projects in response to a Senator's public statements a few days earlier about the importance of doing such projects well. His post was regarded by FBI and SAIC management as attempting to \\"blow the whistle\\" on what he saw as crippling mismanagement of a national security-critical project. Patton was quickly removed from the project and eventually left SAIC for personal reasons. In December 2002, the Bureau asked the United States Congress for increased funding, seeing it was behind schedule. Congress approved an additional $123 million for the Trilogy project. In 2003, the project saw a quick succession of three different CIO's come and go before Zal Azmi took the job, which he held until 2008. Despite development snags throughout 2003, SAIC delivered a version of VCF in December 2003. The software was quickly deemed inadequate by the Bureau, who lamented inadequacies in the software. SAIC claimed most of the FBI's complaints stemmed from specification changes they insisted upon after the fact. On March 24, 2004, Robert Mueller testified to Congress that the system would be operational by the summer, although this seemed impractical and unlikely to happen. SAIC claimed it would require over $50 million to get the system operational, which the Bureau refused to pay. Finally, in May 2004 the Bureau agreed to pay SAIC $16 million extra to attempt to salvage the system and also brought in Aerospace Corporation to review the project at a further cost of $2 million. Meanwhile, the Bureau had already begun talks for a replacement project beginning as early as 2005. Aerospace Corp.'s generally negative report was released in the fall of 2004. Development continued throughout 2004 until the project was officially scrapped in April 2005. Reasons for failure The project demonstrated a systematic failure of software engineering practices: Congressional Testimony, US DOJ Inspector General Glenn A. Fine, February 2005 * Lack of a strong technical architecture (\\"blueprint\\") from the outset led to poor architectural decisions * Repeated changes in specification * Repeated turnover of management, which contributed to the specification problem * Micromanagement of software developers * The inclusion of many FBI personnel who had little or no formal training in computer science as managers and even engineers on the project * Scope creep as requirements were continually added to the system even as it was falling behind schedule * Code bloat due to changing specifications and scope creep‚Äîat one point it was estimated the software had over 700,000 lines of code. * Planned use of a flash cutover deployment made it difficult to adopt the system until it was perfected. Implications The bureau faced a great deal of criticism following the failure of the VCF program. The program lost $104 million in taxpayer money. In addition, the bureau continued to use the antiquated ACS system, which many analysts felt was hampering the bureau's new counter-terrorism mission. In March 2005, the bureau announced it was beginning a new, more ambitious software project code- named Sentinel to replace ACS. After several delays, new leadership, a slightly bigger budget, and adoption of agile software development methodology,FBI puts Sentinel on hold it was completed under budget and was in use agency-wide on July 1, 2012.

The back is hairless and glossy. Overall colors range from black to a reddish-brown, while the hairs may range from yellow to red to black. The antennae are 11-segmented, with a club of four to eight lamellae, more than in any other group of the Scarabaeoidea. The mandibles are not functional, and the opening into the esophagus is closed off; adults do not eat. Larvae have the typical scarabaeiform characteristics, C-shaped bodies generally a creamy white. They feed on roots in the soil, often deep beneath the host plant. Details of the larval stage are only known for some species; they have nine or more instars, and may take up to 13 years to mature. After a late summer pupation, adults of both sexes dig their way to the surface, emerging around the onset of the fall/winter rainy season typical of, for instance, California's climate; some species are active as late as early spring. Females have only vestigial wings, so the males fly around (often while it is raining), homing in on pheromones released by the females. They mate on the surface or in a burrow dug out by the female, then the female lays eggs in the bottom of the burrow. The \\"triggering\\" conditions required for some species to fly are so stringent that a given population may only be active for a single day in a given year. Males are commonly attracted to bright lights. Members of Pleocoma are known from extreme southern Washington, throughout the mountains of Oregon and California, and into the extreme north of Baja California.

Jesen√≠k Vincenz Priessnitz, also written Prie√ünitz (sometimes in German Vinzenz, in English Vincent, in Czech Vincenc; 4 October 1799 ‚Äì 26 November 1851) was a peasant farmer in Gr√§fenberg, Austrian Silesia, who is generally considered the founder of modern hydrotherapy, which is used in alternative and orthodox medicine. Priessnitz stressed remedies such as vegetarian food, air, exercise, rest, water, and traditional medicine. He is thus also credited with laying the foundations of what became known as Nature Cure, although it has been noted that his main focus was on hydrotherapeutic techniques. The use of cold water as a curative is recorded in the works of Hippocrates and Galen, and techniques such as spas, bathing, and drinking were used by various physicians in Europe and the US through to the 18th century. The practice was becoming less prevalent entering the 19th century however, until Priessnitz revived the technique after having major success applying it on patients in his spa in Gr√§fenberg (now L√°znƒõ Jesen√≠k). Priessnitz's name first became widely known in the English-speaking world through the publications and lecture tours of Captain R. T. Claridge in 1842 and 1843, after he had stayed at Grafenberg in 1841. However, Priessnitz was already a household name on the European continent, where Richard Metcalfe, in his 1898 biography, stated: \\"there are hundreds of establishments where the water-cure is carried out on the principles laid down by Priessnitz\\". Indeed, Priessnitz's fame became so widespread that his death was reported as far away as New Zealand.  Biography  = Early life = Vincenz Priessnitz was born into a farmer's family in the village of Gr√§fenberg (now L√°znƒõ Jesen√≠k) near Fr√Ωvaldov (now Jesen√≠k) and baptized Vincenz Franz. His parents were among the first settlers of the village. When Vincenz was eight his father went blind and he had to help in the farm, especially after his elder brother died four years later. Once Vinzenz watched a roebuck with a wounded limb coming to a pond (or stream) to heal its wound. He healed his own finger injured during timber felling with water wraps (1814). He also relieved pain after spraining his wrist by applying wet bandages, which lessened the inflammation. In 1816 he was injured more seriously when he broke his ribs in an accident with a cart and the doctor claimed it was fatal or at least crippling. Priessnitz refused to accept the doctor's diagnosis, and over the next year, he healed after applying wet bandages to his chest and drinking large quantities of water. His recovery strengthened his conviction in the practice, and brought him local fame. Priessnitz began healing animals on his farm and in his village, and later began developing techniques and protocols for healing people. Different types of baths focused on healing different body parts and various afflictions, including paralysis, insanity and poisoning. Soon queues of people were coming to Gr√§fenberg, so in 1822 Vincenz decided to rebuild his father's house, building part of it as a sanatorium and spa for his patients. = Practice at Gr√§fenberg = As Priessnitz's experience grew, the procedures of his treatments became more precise and regular. To treat many diseases, he would wrap the patient in wet bandages and many layers of blankets to cause heavy perspiration from the heat. After several hours, the patient was then instructed to bathe in cold water, and also drink plenty of water. He believed that the rapid changes in temperature allowed the pores of the skin to open and evacuate bad substances in the blood. Another theory Priessnitz held was that the body tended towards health naturally. His treatments, which involved no drugs or herbal medicines, were designed then to help the body remove foreign matter from the body. The extreme conditions disturbs this matter, which prompts a bodily response. Priessnitz also required his patients to add strenuous exercise to their daily regimen, and sometimes required his patients to fast. The food served was bland and hard, and water was the only drink served. Cold water was sometimes added to the food to promote water intake, and patients were required to drink twelve glasses of water per day at a minimum, with some drinking as many as thirty glasses. Before Priessnitz's spa was built near his family house, Priessnitz mostly made house calls. As his popularity grew, Priessnitz limited his practice to his residence, and began expanding the Gr√§fenberg spa with lodgings, dining rooms, showers and bathhouses. Some patients lived in the spa for up to four years. He constructed several douches, which were heavy showers of cold water that flowed from nearby mountains. The water from these douches fell from up to 20 feet in the air, with a stream so strong that new patients were sometimes \\"flattened by the force of the stream.\\" Other baths were created for different body parts, such as eye baths, foot baths and head baths. In 1826 he was invited to Vienna to heal the Emperor¬¥s brother Anton Victor, Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights. This gave him a great reputation so many people from all over the country streamed into Gr√§fenberg. = Opponents and controversy = His ‚Äúsponge washing‚Äù was not accepted by local doctors who accused him of being an impostor with no medical background. These early opponents brought Priessnitz to court several times, but he was acquitted each time, and inspections of his spa confirmed that water was the sole healing agent used in the facility. In 1838 Priessnitz was granted a permit to establish the spa he founded several years earlier. These high-profile cases only served to expand his fame throughout Europe. As hydrotherapy became more widely accepted, his opponents became more concerned with his exact methods than the overall practice, finding Priessnitz's treatments far too extreme and taxing on the body. The food offered at the spa was also notoriously bad-tasting and unhealthy. One visitor complained about being served \\"veal 10 days old.\\" Dr. Robert Hay Graham, who visited the Gr√§fenberg spa in October 1842, noted that Preissnitz did not keep any records of his patients, and that his practice was based on hunch and experience over any systematic approach. Graham suggested that Preissnitz's treatment worked on one out of twenty people at best, and that a milder water-cure that was combined with other medicines would be preferable. = Success = In 1839, 1500 patients arrived (among them one monarch, a duke and duchess, 22 princes and 149 counts and countesses) and 120 doctors to study the new therapy. A visit by Arch-Duke Franz Carl in October 1845 was greeted with an address extolling the virtues of Priessnitz and his methods, signed by 124 guests, from a variety of countries. The new spa house, built that year with 30 rooms, was called Castle and the next house was called New Spa House. In 1846 Priessnitz was awarded a medal by the Emperor. Various aristocratic patients did him reverence by erecting monuments in the spa town. Among the most famous guests was Nikolai Gogol who visited the spa twice (1839 and 1846). In 1842, R. T. Claridge published The Cold Water Cure, its Principles, Theory, and Practice, which detailed Preissnitz's treatments. Claridge was himself a patient of Preissnitz, and his book's descriptions contain notes on the process of his own treatment at the spa, and the effectiveness of Preissnitz's treatments on other patients with various diseases. Preissnitz's practice spread to the U.S. soon after becoming established in Europe, and several hydropathic medical schools and medical journals were created in the U.S. Some practitioners performed scientific experiments on the effects of known water-cures, and they developed new methods and theories about the field. The usage of extreme temperature was toned down to account for differences in patients' age and condition. One notable theory that emerged was that osmosis contributed to the healing effects of water. The skin was thought to act as a membrane, and impurities in the body would flow out into pure water applied by bandages and baths. Priessnitz's English biographer, Richard Metcalfe, notes that despite the fame of the Graefenberg setting, Priessnitz believed that the water-cure treatment was what provided his patients relief, not the locale. > :That Priessnitz was of this opinion appears from the fact that after his > fame had spread throughout Europe, and people came to Graefenberg from all > quarters, he did not confine his practice of hydropathy to that healthy > region, but visited and treated patients at their own homes in towns, where > similar success attended his manipulations. :There are some who would > stultify Priessnitz by making his saying, \\"Man muss Gebirge haben\\" (One must > have mountains), to mean that he considered a mountainous region > indispensable to the successful practice of hydropathy. But, as the facts > stated above show, the whole career of Priessnitz gives the lie to such a > notion. = Death = Vincenz Priessnitz died in 1851. Newspapers of the day reported that on the morning of his death \\"Priessnitz was up, and stirring about at an early hour and complaining of the cold, and had wood brought in to make a large fire. His friends had for some time believed him to be suffering from dropsy in the chest, and at their earnest entreaty he consented to take a little medicine, exclaiming all the while, 'it is no use.' He would see no physician, but remained to the last true to his profession\\". At about four o'clock in the afternoon, \\"he asked to be carried to bed, and upon being laid down he expired. Priessnitz's wife Sofie died in 1854, and was buried in the family crypt in Gr√§fenberg, where Priessnitz also lay. They had nine children, comprising eight daughters and one son. The son, Vincent Paul Priessnitz, was born on 22 June 1847, and died on 30 June 1884, aged 37. Children and children-in-law of Vincenz Priessnitz  Legacy  The Museum of Vincenz Priessnitz is in the house which was the seat of the first hydrotherapy institute in L√°znƒõ Jesen√≠k. There is a statue of Priessnitz in Vienna (1911), in Kirchheim unter Teck and a Priessnitz fountain by Carl Konrad Albert Wolff in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland The 200th anniversary of his birth was listed among the UNESCO anniversaries in 1999. A band from Jesen√≠k named itself Priessnitz. A Czech movie based on his life was made in 1999 under the name of Vincenz Priessnitz. Knowledge of Priessnitz's work in Britain led to the foundation of twenty hydropathic establishments. Of these, two remain one in Peebles, the other Crieff Hydro, Crieff. In the Polish language, Priessnitz is the eponym for the word for shower, prysznic.  In literature  In The Confidence-Man by Herman Melville, the herb-doctor says, '\\"The water-cure? Oh, fatal delusion of the well-meaning Preisnitz!\\" Further reading * Cornell University Library. Making of America collection. *. *. Notes a. Metcalfe's earlier essay on Priessnitz, while comprising a readily digestible summary of his life and work, is best reviewed in conjunction with other works, including Metcalfe's own later book on Priessnitz. For example, in Metcalfe's 1869 essay, he describes Priessnitz's eldest son as having died at an apparently young age. However, there is no mention of this in Metcalfe's better researched 1898 book, which not only provides a picture of Priessnitz's adult son (per this article), but in which the son is stated as being born in 1847 and having died in 1884. This is also consistent with the tribute website that gives the same birth and death dates, and which states the son's age at death as being 37.

It played an important role in the culture of Italy thanks to the work of its scribe monks and in part to the sojourn at Pomposa of Peter Damian.D.

The monks of Pomposa migrated to San Benedetto, Ferrara, 1650, leaving the abbey unoccupied. In the 19th century the abbey was acquired by the Italian government. Frescoed nave of the abbey church The church of Santa Maria is an example of a triple-nave Ravennan Romanesque-style basilica with arcaded aisles and carpentry rafters, originating in the 7th-9th century, and sequentially enlarged as the abbey grew in power and prestige, attaining its present aspect, with a segmental apse, in the 11th century.

He abdicated in favour of his son Meurig (Maurice) and retired to live a hermitical life, but was recalled to lead his son's army against an intruding Saxon force. He won the battle, but was mortally wounded. The context of the battle is one of Britons versus invading Saxons, without explicit religious overtones. Since Tewdrig held to a religious lifestyle and was killed while defending a Christian kingdom against pagans, by the standards of that day Tewdrig is considered to be a martyr and a saint. The Latin form of his name is given as 'Theodoric' and his feast day is 1 April. Tewdrig's name appears in a genealogy of Jesus College MS 20, in the line of one of his descendants, -- Tewdrig's ancestry is given (at I[1]) as \\"... te6dric. M. teidfallt. M. teidtheryn. M. thathal. M. ann6n du vrenhin groec.\\" but the only substantive information about the person comes from the twelfth century Book of Llandaff. The Book of Llandaff places Tewdrig's story in the territory of the historical Kingdom of Gwent (the southeastern part of modern Monmouthshire), though it states that he was a king of Glywysing. The ancient histories of the kingdoms of Gwent and Glywysing are intertwined, and he may have ruled both kingdoms.  Life  Places related to Tewdrig mentioned in the Book of Llandaff. There are three theories about the origins of name Tewdrig: * a variant of the Germanic name Theodoric; * it may have been North British, as the name Theodric had been a royal name in Bernicia and/or; * or the Breton royal name Theuderic.Jenkins, P. (2013) Maurice, Son of Theodoric: Welsh Kings and the Mediterranean World AD550-650 North American Journal of Welsh Studies, Vol 8, pp. 4-5 Tewdrig's father, Teithfallt, had also been a king, and the Book of Llandaff notes that during his reign the Saxons had devastated the border regions, chiefly to the northwest near Hereford (i.e., in the historical Kingdom of Ergyng), and also along the River Wye. While king of Glywysing, Tewdrig ap Teithfallt had been a patron of the Church at Llandaff, with a history of success in battle. At some point in his reign, he abdicated in favour of his son Meurig in order to live a hermitical life at Tintern, a rocky place near a ford across the River Wye. When a Saxon threat to the kingdom emerged, he returned to lead a defence. He was successful, but at a battle or skirmish at or near the ford (called Rhyd Tintern), he was mortally wounded. He asked to be taken to Ynys Echni (called Flat Holm in English) for burial, but got no further than Mathern on an inlet of the Severn estuary, where he languished briefly and died. King Meurig built a church on the spot and buried his father's body there, giving the surrounding land to the Bishops of Llandaff; a bishops' palace was later built there. The place became known first as Merthyr Tewdrig (\\"Tewdrig the martyr\\"), and later as Mateyrn (\\"place of a king\\") or Mathern.E. T. Davies, A History of the Parish of Mathern, 1990 Tewdrig's defence of his homeland was said to be sufficiently decisive that the Saxons would not dare to invade again for thirty years. The Church of St. Tewdric at Mathern There is a minor hagiographic element in this story from the Book of Llandaff. On returning to secular service due to military necessity, Tewdrig is given the prophecy that he will be successful but will be mortally wounded; that a vehicle pulled by two stags, yoked, will appear and carry him towards his destination of Ynys Echni, but that he will die in peace three days after the battle. Wherever the stags halted, fountains gushed forth, but as they approached the Severn the wagon was broken, a very clear stream gushed forth and here Tewdric died.Hando, F.J., (1958) \\"Out and About in Monmouthshire\\", R. H. Johns, Newport. A number of sources, such as Ussher's Brittanicarum Ecclesiarum Antiquitates (1639), cite Bishop Godwin's 1615 account of the medieval church at Mathern. Godwin said that he discovered a stone coffin by the altar in the church, containing the saint's bones, and that the skull was badly fractured. Ussher also repeats the account of the Book of Llandaff. In 1958 Hando also recounts the story told to him by an old lady who had lived in Mathern and who claimed to have seen for herself, in 1881, the stone coffin bearing the remains of St. Tewdrig with his mortal wound (a hole in the skull made by a spear-point) still visible.  Sources of information  = The Book of Llandaff = Representation of St. Tewdrig, stained glass, Llandaff Cathedral, Cardiff, South Wales. 156 The Book of Llandaff was written c. 1125, at a time when the bishopric at Llandaff was struggling against the competing bishoprics at Saint David's and Hereford. The book was written specifically to justify the claims of Llandaff, and Tewdrig's story provides the reason why his son, Meurig ap Tewdrig, donated the lands near Mathern to the see of Llandaff. = Other sources = Tewdrig is not mentioned by Nennius in the Historia Brittonum (c. 850). Lloyd's History of Wales (1911) mentions the Book of Llandaff's account of Tewdrig's combat at the crossing of the Wye, and notes that Merthyr Tewdrig is now called Mathern, but adds nothing further. Nedelec's History of the Early Cambro-British Christians (1879) retells the story from the Book of Llandaff, adding a number of unattributed details which are colourful but inconsequential. Turner's History of the Anglo-Saxons (1799) repeats the accounts of the Book of Llandaff and Bishop Godwin (citing Ussher as the source), but then adds that the Saxons in question were those of Wessex, led by Ceolwulf. No authority is provided for this claim. =The Iolo Manuscripts= The Iolo Manuscripts are a collection of manuscripts presented in the early nineteenth century by Edward Williams, who is better known as Iolo Morganwg.

PAM students were immersed in disciplines including instrumental and voice private study, chamber music coaching, orchestra, opera, music theory and composition, jazz, accompanying, and recording techniques. PAM further enhanced curriculum with programs including the Bravo! Program (offering financial assistance and support services for children with limited financial means), the Choral Program (multiple choirs for students 5‚Äì15 years of age to enlarge their perception of music literature and performance), the Summer Music Festival (a two-week, intensive program in residence that offers coaching and performance opportunities for advanced students), the Sinfonia Orchestra (a casual orchestra for adult amateurs), and various early development programs. PAM students were mentored and guided by a faculty of internationally recognized performers and educators. The faculty shared with their students their unique talents and experiences as concert artists, symphony performers, and lecturers. In addition, these faculty members ‚Äì often accompanied by their students ‚Äì gave to the community through performances at schools and nursing homes, educational outreach, and mentoring of at-risk youth through the Satellite Schools Program. Uniting the passion of such teachers with eager students created a community for creativity and inspiration that was nurturing and supportive; it helped the community grow. Through music education, performance, and outreach, PAM was a robust source of arts in the Lancaster community. PAM expanded its commitment to musical excellence within the community by offering group music classes for after-school activities, recreational music making, and adult continuing education. The building PAM occupied on Prince Street in downtown Lancaster is now owned by Millersville University and operates as the Ware Center. Education The Pennsylvania Academy of Music was one of twelve pre-collegiate autonomous schools accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music, and was a member of the National Guild of the Community Schools of the Arts. It was one of the only schools in the United States that offers a pre-collegiate program in chamber music. In 2009, the school entered into partnerships with the China Conservatory of Music in Beijing and Lancaster Mennonite School in Lancaster. An exchange program is offered through the China Conservatory, and a high school diploma program focused in music is offered through Lancaster Mennonite High School. Bankruptcy On May 27, 2010, PAM filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Under new administration, the Bankruptcy Court supported the re-opening the school on September 1, 2010 at Liberty Place. PAM continued to work with the Court as they tried to transition out of bankruptcy and make progress toward operating as a sustainable institution.

It is situated in the western part of the county in the township of Lot 5. The population was 1,145 as of the 2016 census. Alberton is a service centre for local fishing and farming communities, and is adjacent to the community and harbour of Northport. History The area was long settled by the Mi'kmaq Nation. Europeans first ventured to the area in 1534 when French explorer Jacques Cartier recorded making landfall at nearby Cape Kildare during his journey of discovery in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and St. Lawrence River. Acadians settled on the island in small numbers through the 17th and 18th centuries but only moved in greater numbers to the western part of Ile-Saint- Jean and specifically north of present-day Alberton to the Tignish area following their expulsion by British military forces in the late 1750s. Following British victory over France, the island's sovereignty passed to Britain in 1763. In 1765, Captain Samuel Holland surveyed the island and the British government instituted a feudal system of land ownership. The township of Lot 5, which contains present-day Alberton, was granted to Edward Lewis, a British Member of Parliament in the 1767 land lottery. Northport, located near present-day Alberton began to be settled in the 1780s after Lewis made plans for a small trading town called \\"Lewis Town\\". Located at Bury Head in Northport, it was established in June 1788 and was first populated by local Acadians who had escaped expulsion three decades before British settlements. Scottish and Devonshire settlers were brought in by Lewis to settle his township. A local shipbuilding industry and lumber trade at Northport brought prosperity to the area throughout the 1800s, although this went into decline as more forested areas were lost to agriculture, on account of the excellent soils in the area. Alberton started to take shape in the 1840s and underwent several name changes, \\"Cross Roads, \\"The Cross,\\"Stump Town\\". The nearby shipbuilding, lumber and shipping industries had resulted in developing a sustainable community which was a major trade centre in western Prince County. In 1862, it was named in honour of Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales, who later became King Edward VII and who had visited Prince Edward Island in 1860. The community was named Alberton on 27 June 1862. =Railways and other constructions= In 1872, the Prince Edward Island Railway was constructed, making the port at Northport, adjacent to Alberton, its western terminus. It connected Alberton with communities to the east such as O'Leary, Summerside, Charlottetown, Georgetown and Souris. The western terminus was subsequently extended further from Alberton to Tignish in a sharp diversion just east of the Alberton passenger station, where a wye was constructed and a small railway yard, leading to the spur to Northport. Alberton went into its own terminus during this period, with various mills, manufacturing businesses, stores and services. The community became a village in 1878, and became home to a court house and justice centre for western Prince County that year. Alberton became the centre of the worldwide silver fox industry when Charles Dalton and Robert Oulton began farming the fur-bearing animals on an island in the harbour at Northport in 1894, bringing tremendous prosperity to area residents and business owners. Despite a fire that devastated part of the town the following year, Alberton quickly reflected its growing economic importance of the village. The railway constructed a new passenger station designed by architect Charles Benjamin Chappell for Alberton in the early 1900s entirely out of stone, one of only two such stations on the island (the other being in Kensington). The fox farming industry brought increased growth in the population and tax base for the community, which resulted in an upgrade from village status, becoming an incorporated town in May 1913. Silver fox farming remained profitable through the 1940s. Many distinctive houses in the community are a reminder of the fortunes that were made during this period. The Western Hospital was constructed in 1945 and was the first hospital built west of Summerside. The public library opened in 1951, followed by the federal government building in 1962 and the Jacques Cartier Arena and a community museum in 1964. The Maplewood Manor nursing home opened in 1967. Geography Alberton is roughly equidistant between Tignish and O'Leary, and is situated along the north shore of the island, fronting the open Gulf of St. Lawrence. It has a land area of approximately . *90 km : Confederation Bridge (to New Brunswick) * 120 km : Charlottetown * 66 km : Summerside *176 km : Wood Islands ferry (to Nova Scotia) =Climate= Alberton experiences a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Dfb) similar to that of coastal Hokkaido, being somewhat less extreme due to the island condition and being surrounded by the Gulf of St Lawrence. The amount of rain recorded on a single day was 102 mm on 5 August 1989 and the daily record of snowfall was 56.1 cm on 15 December 2003. Although the odors associated with fishing and shipping, according to one 2008 report air quality agrees the criteria of regulatory projects of the same. Economy The majority of the Alberton work force is employed in the service sector, serving a surrounding population of 5000 residents in western Prince County. =Fishing= The fishing industry in the adjacent community of Northport is a significant economic activity, with landings by fishing boats totalling 3 million kilograms of species such as American lobster, mussels, snow crab, soft-shell clams, cod, herring, American plaice, mackerel, sea scallop, yellowtail, eel, winter flounder, smelt, rock crab, tomcod, silversides, porbeagle, and blue shark. Source: 1996, DFO =Agriculture= The agriculture industry in areas surrounding Alberton is dominated by farmers growing potatoes that are used for table stock, French fries, potato chips or cooking, although a significant number of seed growers are in the area as well. Education In 2011 Holland College West Prince Campus opened the doors in a beautiful new facility located in the centre of Alberton. The town has private day care and publicly funded kindergarten facilities, as well as Alberton Elementary School (gr.1-6, 234 students). Students are also transported by bus to the more centrally located M.E. Callaghan School (gr. 7‚Äì9, 378 students) and Westisle Composite High School (gr. 10‚Äì12, 748 students), both being located in nearby communities. Infrastructure =Transportation= Alberton is located on Route 12, which is part of the North Cape Coastal Drive.

She is known both for her work on stage and for her television and film appearances such as Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix in which she played Amelia Bones. Her voice is known to listeners both for her poetry readings on Radio 3 and for her audiobooks. Career Thomas played a prominent role in 1993 TV film Wide- Eyed and Legless, known as The Wedding Gift outside of the UK. Based on a true story, the drama tells of the author Deric Longden's (played by Jim Broadbent) final years of marriage to his first wife Diana (Julie Walters) in the early 1980s and her fight against an illness which doctors then did not understand, later believed to be a form of chronic fatigue syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis. The film also featured Thora Hird as Deric Longden's mother Annie. Thomas played partially-sighted Aileen Armitage, the novelist who would become Longden's second wife in 1990. In 2002 she appeared in London's West End theatre production Up for Grabs with Madonna. The critic Michael Billington commented that \\"Madonna is not positively bad: just technically awkward. But, fortunately, she is buttressed by strong supporting players. Sian Thomas, who can get a laugh simply through the flick of an eyelid, is superb as a Courtauld-trained consultant longing to get her revenge on the corporate world.\\" In 2004, Thomas played the leading role of Lady Macbeth in the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Macbeth at Stratford-on-Avon. Billington wrote that \\"Sian Thomas was also born to play Lady Macbeth. She has the right mixture of attack, sexiness and emotional drive\\", adding that she gave Shakespeare's sometimes complex lines exactly the right stress to bring out the subtle antitheses. He noted, too, that she brought out the character's steadily growing \\"tactical and emotional isolation\\". In the musical Spring Awakening in London in 2009, she and Richard Cordery played \\"all the adult roles with cartoon-like aplomb\\". In 2010, Thomas played the leading role of the queen in the National Theatre Wales's production of Aeschylus's The Persians, described by The Guardian as \\"a tremendous performance as the queen, a woman of fiery splendour reduced to ululating agony as the disasters mount and she cries 'this is the peak of my misery'.\\" In 2011, she played the leading lady Martha in the Northern Stage and Sheffield theatres co-production of Edward Albee's play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. The critic Clare Brennan commented that she and the leading man Jasper Britton \\"seize the parts for their own\\", as Thomas's Martha \\"part praying mantis, part puppet, jerks around the stage as if impelled by forces trying to rip free from her control ‚Äì despair, grief and rage.\\" From 2012 she appeared as Atorloppe in the BBC's Merlin series. Thomas has read poetry for the BBC Radio 3 programme Words and Music. She has also been employed on several audiobooks including Allison Pearson's I Think I Love You and Marina Lewycka's A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian. Family Thomas spent part of her childhood living in Canada. She is the sister of the actress Sara Mair-Thomas. Her partner is the British poet Tony Harrison.

After a term sheet has been \\"executed\\", it guides legal counsel in the preparation of a proposed \\"final agreement\\". It then guides, but is not necessarily binding, as the signatories negotiate, usually with legal counsel, the final terms of their agreement. A term sheet implies the conditions of a business transaction, as proposed by a party. It may be either binding or non-binding. Term sheets are very similar to \\"letters of intent\\" (LOI) in that they are both preliminary, mostly non-binding documents meant to record two or more parties' intentions to enter into a future agreement based on specified (but incomplete or preliminary) terms. The difference between the two is slight and mostly a matter of style: an LOI is typically written in letter form and focuses on the parties' intentions; a term sheet skips most of the formalities and lists deal terms in bullet-point or similar format. There is an implication that an LOI only refers to the final form. A term sheet may be a proposal, not an agreed-to document. Within the context of venture capital financing, a term sheet typically includes conditions for financing a startup company. The key offering terms in such a term sheet include (a) amount raised, (b) price per share, (c) pre-money valuation, (d) liquidation preference, (e) voting rights, (f) anti-dilution provisions, and (g) registration rights. It is customary to begin the negotiation of a venture investment with the circulation of a term sheet, which is a summary of the terms the proposer (the issuer, the investor, or an intermediary) is prepared to accept. The term sheet is analogous to a letter of intent, a nonbinding outline of the principal points which the stock purchase agreement and related agreements will cover in detail. The advantage of the abbreviated term sheet format is, first, that it expedites the process. Experienced counsel immediately know generally what is meant when the term sheet specifies \\"one demand registration at the issuer's expense, unlimited piggybacks at the issuer's expense, weighted average antidilution\\"; it saves time not to have to spell out the long-form edition of those references. Second, since the term sheet does not propose to be an agreement of any sort, it is less likely that a court will find unexpected promissory content; a \\"letter of intent\\" can be a dangerous document unless it specifies very clearly, as it should, which portions are meant to be binding and which merely guide the discussion and drafting. Some portions of a term sheet can have binding effect, of course, if and to the extent an interlocutory memorialization is needed of some binding promises, that is, confidentiality of the disclosures made in the negotiation. The summary format of a term sheet, however, makes it less likely that any party will be misled into thinking that some form of enforceable agreement has been memorialized when it has not.Joseph W. Bartlett, \\"Background Negotiation of a Venture Investment\\". VCExperts.com. Some important terms to founders and venture capitalists: * Return - Valuation/ Dilution: One of the most important terms for founders is valuation; whether the evaluation is high or not tells the entrepreneurs whether or not the investor is credible. Also, option pools are part of the evaluation and usually founders have the power to negotiate option pool, they shouldn‚Äôt get greedy and should present a strong case. This term is important since option pool can lower the effective valuation. * Control - BOD: A very common and usual arrangement is a board of three directors, one from investor and two from founders (for motivational purposes). * Liquidation Preferences: This represents how much the founders will receive in an event of company sale etc. Thus it is very important as the ultimate goal is to make returns. Terms represented by CRV seem normal and acceptable. * Founder vesting: This plays a major role in motivating the founders * Voting rights: Voting rights are very important to the investor in this case for them to demand rights of whether to accept or reject actions taken by the founders such as sale, additional financing and other matters that should be approved by a certain percentage of Series A Preferred stockholders (the VC). * Co-Sale Terms: If one of the common shareholders were to sell his/her shares, partially or completely, they should include the investors, or drag them along with the sale and sell part of theirs. This is very crucial to the investor.

The female of the species, like all argonauts, creates a paper-thin eggcase that coils around the octopus much like the way a nautilus lives in its shell (hence the name paper nautilus). The shell is usually approximately 150 mm in length, although it can exceed 250 mm in exceptional specimens; the world record size is 292.0 mm. A. nodosa produces a very characteristic shell, which is covered in many small nodules on the ridges across the shell, hence the specific epithet nodosa and common name. These nodules are less obvious or even absent in juvenile females, especially those under 5 cm in length. All other argonaut species have smooth ridges across the shell walls. Eggcases of A. tuberculata and A. gracilis from Thomas William Kirk's description of the latter. Both taxa are now considered synonyms of A. nodosa.Sweeney, M.J. (2002). Taxa Associated with the Family Argonautidae Tryon, 1879. Tree of Life Web Project. A. nodosa has a relatively wide distribution covering the Indo-Pacific region as well as the eastern coast of South America. The species is most common in southern Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. It is only known from the Southern Hemisphere. A. nodosa is thought to feed primarily on pelagic molluscs. Captive females have been observed readily taking dead prawns and fish. The species is preyed on by numerous predators. It has been reported in the stomach contents of Alepisaurus ferox from the south-western Pacific. A. nodosa has also been found in the stomach contents of Australian fur seals, Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus, in the Bass Strait and southern Tasmania. Females grow to 100 mm ML and 300 mm total length, while males do not exceed 40 mm in length. The specialised webbed arm pair of this species is covered in numerous chromatophores. Mark Norman notes that \\"the colour of these webs can quickly change from maroon red to reflective silver\\". It has been reported that the egg clusters of A. nodosa from southern Australia can be clearly divided into three portions, each with eggs at a similar developmental stage. Similar development has been observed in the egg masses of Argonauta bottgeri. A. nodosa is occasionally involved in mass strandings along the South African and southern Australian coastlines. The strandings are seasonal and generally occur between April and August, towards the end of the animals' spawning season. The type specimen of A. nodosa was collected off the Cape of Good Hope. The type repository is unknown.Current Classification of Recent Cephalopoda File:Argonauta nodosa lithograph.jpg|Female A. nodosa with eggcase removed File:Argonauta nodosa with eggcase lithograph.jpg|Female A. nodosa with eggcase present File:Argonauta-nodosa-001.jpg|One of the earliest known depictions of A. nodosa, from Index Testarum Conchyliorum (1742) by Niccol√≤ Gualtieri References External links * Tree of Life web project: Argonauta nodosa Molluscs described in 1786 ","title":"Argonauta nodosa"},{"id":"4034249","text":"Hulda Regehr Clark (18 October 1928 in Rosthern, Saskatchewan ‚Äì 3 September 2009 in Chula Vista, California)In Memoriam Website , domain registered by Clark's publisher, New Century Press: \\"On the evening of September 3rd 2009, Dr. Hulda Clark‚Äôs celebrated life came to an end.\\" was a Canadian naturopath, author, and practitioner of alternative medicine. Clark claimed all human disease was related to parasitic infection, and also claimed to be able to cure all diseases, including cancer and HIV/AIDS, by \\"zapping\\" them with electrical devices which she marketed. Clark wrote several books describing her methods and operated clinics in the United States. Following a string of lawsuits and eventual action by the Federal Trade Commission, she relocated to Tijuana, Mexico where she ran the Century Nutrition clinic. Clark's claims and devices have been dismissed by authorities ranging from the United States Federal Trade Commission and Food and Drug Administration to CAM figures such as Dr. Andrew Weil as scientifically unfounded, \\"bizarre\\", and potentially fraudulent. Clark died 3 September 2009 from blood and bone cancer.Death Certificate showing cause of death being complications from cancer  Background  Clark began her studies in biology at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, where she was awarded Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees. After two years of study at McGill University, she attended the University of Minnesota studying biophysics and cell physiology. She received her doctorate degree in 1958 from the University of Minnesota. Her own biographical sketch states her degree was in physiology,. but the Graduate School's Register of Ph.D. Degrees conferred by the University of Minnesota, July 1956-June 1966, states she received a Ph.D. in Zoology in 1958. Her thesis was entitled A Study of the Ion Balance of Crayfish Muscle: evidence for two compartments of cellular potassium.\\"Register of Ph.D. Degrees Conferred by the University of Minnesota, July 1956 through June 1966. p. 67. University of Minnesota (PDF) In 1979, Clark left government-funded research and began private consulting and her own research. From 2002 until her death she operated the Century Nutrition health clinic in Tijuana, Mexico, where her focus was primarily on late-stage cancer patients. Clark and her son Geoff separately owned businesses her patients and others used, including a restaurant, her self-publishing company, and a \\"self-health\\" store that sold her inventions. Her son continues to operate the self-health store. She published several books, including The Cure of All Cancers, The Cure for HIV/AIDS and The Cure For All Diseases. According to civil court records, her books generated over $7 million in sales by 2002, although Clark disputed this figure. She held a naturopathy degree from the defunct Clayton College of Natural Health a school lacking accreditation from any accreditation agency recognized by the United States Department of Education. page=5  Treatment claims  According to Clark, all disease is caused by foreign organisms and pollutants that damage the immune system. She asserted that eliminating these organisms from the body using herbal or electrical means while removing pollutants from the diet would cure all diseases. In her book The Cure For All Cancers, Clark postulated all cancers and many other diseases are caused by the flatworm Fasciolopsis buski. \\"The adult [fluke], though, stays tightly stuck to our intestine or liver, causing cancer, or uterus, causing endometriosis, or thymus, causing AIDS, or kidney, causing Hodgkin's disease).\\" \\"I have found that cancer, HIV, diabetes, endometriosis, Hodgkin's disease, Alzheimer's disease, lupus, MS and \\"universal allergy syndrome\\" are examples of fluke disease.\\" However, this worm does not live in the United States or Europe, but mainly in India, parts of China, Vietnam and other east- Asian countries, and only in rural areas where people are eating unboiled food from water plants, or where pigs live close to humans. According to Clark, depression is caused by hookworms. Epilepsy and seizures are caused by swelling in the brain, attracting calcium and heavy metals, The swelling being caused by parasites of the genus Ascaris as well as by malvin, a natural dye found in strawberries, chicken, and eggs.Clark, Hulda Regehr (1995). The cure for all diseases, p.233-34. . Clark claimed she could cure all diseases, whereas, she asserted, conventional treatments for diseases, such as cancer and HIV/AIDS, often only aim to relieve symptoms.The Cure For All Diseases She was described in the book Denying AIDS as \\"perhaps the first quack AIDS curer.\\" David Amrein's website contains a disclaimer stating that her treatments are \\"not prescribed as treatment for medical or psychological conditions\\" and \\"...the treatments outlined herein are not intended to be a replacement or substitute for other forms of conventional medical treatment.\\"Disclaimer from David Amrein's website, drclark.net. Accessed 15 Feb 2007.A second disclaimer from Amrein's website, drclark.net. Accessed 15 Feb 2007. Nonetheless, Clark advocated for the use of her methods as a substitute for standard medical care: Regarding the effectiveness of her treatment, Clark wrote, \\"The method is 100% effective in stopping cancer regardless of the type of cancer or how terminal it may be. It follows that this method must work for you, too, if you are able to carry out the instructions.\\"Clark HR. The Cure for All Cancers. San Diego, CA: ProMotion Publishing, 1993, pp. 4, 120, 537.  Major themes in her books *Diet Cleanup: Clark said that most foods and supplements were sullied by contaminants such as heavy metals and mycotoxins *Homeography: According to Clark, a \\"new science ... which is the electronic analog of homeopathy.\\" She said an electronic signature of a substance can be transferred into bottles making a \\"bottle copy\\" of the original substance and that it can be done indefinitely. *Liver flush: She advocated the use of a \\"liver flush\\". She said it removes gallstones and parasites from the liver and bile ducts. This involves fasting, epsom salt laxatives and a mixture of olive oil and grapefruit juice. (the latter being known to interact with many prescription drugs) *Parasites: Clark said people have parasites that cause numerous problems. She described herbal and electronic methods to remove them, such as her Zapper device (see below). *Syncrometer: A \\"bioresonance\\" device developed by Clark and claimed to detect contaminants in substances at an accuracy of one part per quadrillion (ppq). *Zapper: A device to pulse low voltage direct current (DC) through the body at specific frequencies. Clark said this device kills viruses, bacteria and parasites. In one case, a patient with a cardiac pacemaker suffered arrhythmias as a side effect of her \\"Zapper.\\"  Sting operation, flight, arrest, and legal issues  = Indiana = In 1993, while Clark lived and practiced in Indiana, a former patient complained to the Indiana attorney general. An investigator for the Indiana Department of Health and a deputy attorney general visited her office incognito as part of a sting operation. Clark proceeded to test the investigator and \\"told him he had the HIV virus , but said that he did not have cancer.\\" She told the investigator that she could cure his HIV in 3 minutes, but that he would \\"get it back\\" unless he committed to returning for six more appointments. She then ordered blood tests from a laboratory. Unknown to the investigators, Clark learned of the undercover investigators' status. She then stated everything she had told them had been a \\"mistake\\". Two days later, before an arrest warrant could be served, she had vacated the premises and disappeared.State of Indiana vs. Hulda Clark: Probable Cause Affidavit, Filed 16 August 1993Hinnefeld, Steve, Woman who claims healing knowledge faces charges, Herald Times, 5 April 2000, Accessed 7-11-2007Hinnefeld, Steve. \\"Clark won't face charges\\". Herald-Times, 19 April 2000. Six years later, in September 1999, Clark was located and arrested in San Diego, California, based on a fugitive warrant from Indiana. According to Clark, this was the first time she learned about the charge. Her lawyer protested the long delay before her arrest, but a prosecutor implied that she fled Indiana \\"when she learned that she was being investigated by the state,\\" and the local police department had limited resources to devote to finding her. She was returned to Indiana to stand trial, where she was charged with practicing medicine without a license. The charge was later dismissed for failure to provide her with a speedy trial. The judge's verdict did not address the merits of the charges but only the issue of whether the delay had compromised Clark's ability to mount a defense and her right to a speedy trial. = Mexico = In February 2001, Mexican authorities inspected Clark's Century Nutrition clinic and ordered it shut down, as the clinic had never registered and was operating without a license. In June 2001, the Mexican authorities announced that the clinic would be permitted to reopen, but was prohibited from offering \\"alternative\\" treatments. The clinic was also fined 160,000 pesos (about $18,000), and Clark was barred from working in Mexico, even as a consultant; however, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported in 2003 that there was evidence that Clark continued to work at the clinic. = Federal Trade Commission and Food and Drug Administration action = The Federal Trade Commission brought a complaint against the Dr. Clark Research Foundation because of the foundation's claims about the effectiveness of the Syncrometer, the Super-Zapper Deluxe and \\"Dr. Clark's New 21 Day Program for Advanced Cancers.\\" In November 2004, the case reached stipulated judgment, wherein the case's judge ordered the foundation's operators to offer refunds to the purchasers of these devices and to refrain from making a number of claims about those devices.Stipulated Final Judgment and Order for Permanent Injunction and Other Equitable Relief, Civ.

The Director of Enforcement at the Food and Drug Administration has stated Clark's devices seem to be \\"fraudulent.\\"  Evaluation of claims and criticism  Hulda Clark has been criticized because her claims lack scientific validity and consist of anecdotal evidence. Joseph Pizzorno, a prominent naturopathic physician, evaluated Clark's claims and found that her books mixed patients with conventionally diagnosed cancer with those whose cancer diagnosis was based solely on her use of the \\"Syncrometer\\". The patients with medically diagnosed cancer did not respond to Clark's treatment, while those she had diagnosed using the \\"Syncrometer\\" were \\"cured\\". Pizzorno concluded that Clark's treatments were ineffective and treatments based on Clark's recommendations \\"pose a substantive public health danger\\".Western Herb and Dietary Products: Evaluation by Dr. Joseph E.

Accessed 15 Feb 2007.A cure for AIDS, Avert.org, retrieved 7 November 2007. available online The Swiss Study Group for Complementary and Alternative Methods in Cancer (SCAC) issued a strong warning to cancer patients considering Clark's methods: Prominent alternative medicine proponent Andrew Weil has written, \\"No studies have backed up [Clark's] bizarre claims, and it‚Äôs unclear whether the cancer patients she‚Äôs supposedly cured ever had cancer to begin with.\\"(subscription required) In 2002, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported Clark and her son Geoff operated a restaurant and leased housing for patients at Clark's Tijuana clinic. The article described a couple whose daughter, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, was treated for 10 months by Clark at a cost of approximately $30,000 without improvement. Despite the cost and lack of improvement, the couple stated Clark insisted she was close to curing the child, and stopping treatment might endanger her. The patient's mother commented, \\"People don‚Äôt understand why we stayed so long, but Hulda Clark did a very good job of preying on us,\\" and Clark, while stating she could not respond to the parents' allegations on grounds of patient confidentiality, denied their statements in general.  Personal life  She was married to John Burt Clark from 1956 to 1965. During that time she had three sons: Geoffrey Allen Clark, Douglas Burt Walcerz, and Robert John Clark.

A monofilament version is also made for use in ophthalmic practice. It is indicated for soft tissue approximation and ligation. The suture holds its tensile strength for approximately two to three weeks in tissue and is completely absorbed by hydrolysis within 56 to 70 days. Vicryl and other polyglycolic-acid sutures may also be treated for more rapid breakdown (\\"Vicryl Rapide\\") in rapidly healing tissues such as mucous membrane or impregnated with triclosan (\\"Vicryl Plus Antibacterial\\") to provide antimicrobial protection of the suture line. Because Vicryl is slow-absorbing and often braided, its use is contraindicated in the closure of any cutaneous wound exposed to the air, as it draws moisture from the healing tissue to the skin and allows bacteria and irritants to migrate into the wound. This inevitably leads to high reactivity to the contaminants, poor wound healing, and eventually infection. Vicryl is manufactured in Cornelia, GA. Although the name \\"Vicryl\\" is a trademark of Ethicon, the term \\"vicryl\\" has been used generically referring to any synthetic absorbable suture made primarily of polyglycolic acid. Other brands of polyglycolic acid suture include PolySyn, Surgicryl, Polysorb, and Dexon, all of which are manufactured by different companies. Vicryl is a copolymer of lactide (a cyclic diester of lactic acid) and glycolide (a cyclic diester of glycolic acid). In practice, Vicryl comes braided, dyed or undyed with the following decay schedule: 75% at two weeks, 50% at three weeks, and 25% at four weeks (i.e., the sutures retain that proportion of tensile strength at those dates).

Formed in 1949, the corps had its genesis in other services that existed within the Australian forces during World War I and World War II. It is currently made up entirely of commissioned officers and is responsible for the provision of education-related services within the Army. Its various roles include instruction, designing computer-based learning materials, instructional systems, language training, literacy, and numeracy. History The RAAEC was established in September 1949 as the Australian Army Educational Corps and was granted Royal assent in 1960.Dennis et al 1995, p. 513. Consisting of the Crown and a boomerang upon which the corps' initials are inscribed superimposed over a \\"fluted flambeau of flames\\", the current RAAEC corps badge was adopted in 1964.Jobson 2009, p. 140. It is the only corps badge in the Australian Army where the crown does not appear at the top and is based on the badge devised for the Royal Army Educational Corps by King George VI in 1949. The corps grew out of the Australian Army Education Service (AAES), which was established on 29 October 1943 during World War II, under the command of Colonel Robert Madgwick. Through the AAES, the corps draws its lineage from the Australian Army Education Scheme, which was established under Madgwick on 5 March 1941.Long 1963, p. 84. That scheme itself was based loosely upon a vocational education scheme that had been established during World War I within the Australian Imperial Force in 1918 under George Merrick Long, as part of the demobilisation and repatriation process. 6th Division, Maprik, July 1945 Throughout its history, the corps has deployed members to support Australian forces deployed on operations. Initially, they deployed to Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, where they provided education support for service personnel and their children.Directorate of Army Education 1990, p. 99. Later, members of the corps were sent to Korea during the Korean War, where they were attached at battalion level to provide soldiers with training in the field. During the Vietnam War, RAAEC personnel were deployed to support the 1st Australian Task Force at Nui Dat.Directorate of Army Education 1990, p. 121. Throughout its history, the corps has also provided short and long-term courses to enlisted soldiers. Short-term courses have been developed internally by education staff, while some long-term courses were accredited with external authorities. In Australia during the 1960s and 1970s, many education courses were provided to soldiers as aq requirement for promotion to a higher rank. At the same time, In the (former) Territory of Papua New Guinea, Australian National Servicemen in the education corps provided courses in literacy, numeracy, and citizenship to non-commissioned ranks at various army barracks.The role of conscripted education corps staff in Papua New Guinea has been published in Chalkies: Conscript Teachers in PNG (National Library of Australia ID 3084181) Armi Wantoks (National Library of Australia ID 3377828) and at www.NashosPNG.com Current role and structure The RAAEC is responsible for many educational areas of military training, including the development and implementation of technology and communications training at the Royal Military College, Duntroon and the Australian Defence Force Academy, managing and conducting long-distance education, teaching English to foreign students, analysing education proposals, developing training, and delivering literacy and numeracy and \\"train the trainer\\" programs to non-commissioned officers (NCOs) on promotion courses. Currently, the corps is made up entirely of commissioned officers in the specialist service officer/professionally qualified stream, although in the past the RAAEC has had some NCOs allocated to it.

The 14-room, Federal-style brick plantation house was possibly based on a design by Thomas Jefferson and has several Jeffersonian architectural features. History The Farmington site was part of a military land grant given to Captain James Speed in 1780. His son, John Speed, completed Farmington on a tract of land in 1816. Built in the Federal architectural style, the house is based on plans by Thomas Jefferson, which are now in the Coolidge Collection at the Massachusetts Historical Society. Speed built the house for his wife, Lucy Gilmer Fry, daughter of Joshua Fry and granddaughter of Dr. Thomas Walker, the guardian of Thomas Jefferson. Her aunt and uncle's home in Charlottesville, Virginia was called Farmington and had an addition designed by Thomas Jefferson. Their son, Joshua Fry Speed, was an intimate, lifelong friend of Abraham Lincoln. While courting Mary Todd, Lincoln spent three weeks at Farmington in 1841 while recovering from mental and physical exhaustion. John and Lucy's son, James Speed, was appointed Attorney General of the United States by Lincoln in 1863. Design plantation house Farmington consists of a single story above a raised basement. The building is roughly a square shape, measuring wide by long. There are 14 rooms of living quarters on the first floor, with servant's and children's rooms on the basement floor. The first story is about five feet above ground level, with the basement windows completely above ground. All rooms in the basement are finished. A simplified classical cornice under the hipped roof helps give the house its pleasing, proportional appearance. The front entrance is a tetrastyle portico (porch) with slender Doric columns, reached by 11 steps. The porch's gable features a semi-circular ventilation window. The front door opens into a central hall which has a door at the back leading to a rear hall. These two halls give access to all rooms on the first floor, as well as stairs to the basement and attic. The stairs are hidden, which is a common feature of homes designed by Jefferson. A notable feature of the first floor are two wide octagonal rooms, another distinctive feature of Jeffersonian architecture. One of the octagonal rooms is a dining hall, the other is a parlor. Other rooms on the first floor are two bedrooms, a study and a family sitting room. Preservation Springhouse on property Farmington has been restored as a tourist attraction and a re-creation of a 19th-century plantation. The house itself had been altered little at the time it was purchased by the Historic Homes Foundation for preservation in 1958. The only substantial change in its interior or exterior appearance since construction was the installation of a tin roof in place of the original wood shingles, which was done for fire safety reasons. As of 2011, Farmington and a small visitors center are open to the public for tours and the site is available for special events and rentals. In 2012, Farmington's owner, Historic Homes Foundation, Inc., entered into an agreement to sell 5 of the landmark's 18 acres to an adjoining landowner, Sullivan University, for use as a 300-space parking lot to be shared by both entities. Controversial questions about the proposal were raised in online media leading up to its consideration in the February 3, 2013 meeting of the Metro Louisville Landmarks Commission's Individual Landmarks Architectural Review Committee.Morrison, Curtis \\"Sullivan University moving forward with plan to use five acres at Farmington for parking lot\\" , Insider Louisville, Louisville, 20 January 2013.

Development The CJ-6 (Chu Jiao ÂàùÊïô = Chuji Jiaolianji ÂàùÁ∫ßÊïôÁªÉÊú∫ = basic trainer aircraft) is an all-original Chinese design that is commonly mistaken for a Yak 18A. Its predecessor, the Nanchang CJ-5, was a licence-built version of the Yak-18. However, advancements in pilot training brought a need for a new aircraft with improved performance and a tricycle landing gear. When the Soviet Union developed the Yak-18A, PLAAF engineers decided that its performance and design would not suit China's needs. The aircraft was designed in 1958 by the Nanchang Aircraft Factory (now Hongdu Aviation). As the Shenyang Aircraft Factory already had experience building the Shenyang JJ-1 begun technical research for the CJ-6, more than 20 Shenyang designers were transferred to Nanchang, including chief designers Tu Jida and Lin Jiahua. Xu Shunshou and Huang Zhiqian, then China's top aircraft designers, were also involved. During late 1957 Aeronautical Engineers Cheng Bushi and Lin Jiahua began work in Shenyang on a trainer design that addressed the shortcomings of the Yak-18A. The design they delivered featured an aluminum semi-monocoque fuselage, flush-riveted throughout, and introduced a modified Clark airfoil wing design with pronounced dihedral in the outer sections. The dihedral and an angular vertical tail distinguish it externally from the otherwise rather similar Yak-18A. Wind tunnel testing validated the design, and in May 1958 the program was transferred to the Nanchang Aircraft Manufacturing factory where Chief Engineer Gao Zhenning initiated production of the CJ-6. The first flight of the CJ-6 was completed on August 27, 1958 by Lu Maofan and He Yinxi. Power for the prototype was provided by a Czech-built horizontally-opposed piston engine, but flight testing revealed the need for more power, so a locally manufactured version of the Soviet AI-14P 260 hp radial, the Housai HS-6, was substituted along with a matching propeller, and with that change the CJ-6 was approved for mass production. In 1965 the HS-6 engine was upgraded to 285 hp and redesignated the HS-6A, and the aircraft equipped with the new power plant were designated the CJ-6A. A total production run estimated at more than 3,000 aircraft supplied CJ-6 aircraft for PLAAF training, as well as for export (as the PT-6) to countries including Albania, Bangladesh, Cambodia, North Korea, Tanzania, and Sri Lanka. It is expected Hongdu/Yakovlev joint developed CJ-7 Trainer (L-7) primary trainer will replace CJ-6s in PLAAF. General information One thing to note is that the Nanchang CJ-6 makes extensive use of pneumatics to control the gear and flap extension/retraction, operate the brakes and start the engine. An engine- driven air pump recharges the system; however if air pressure is too low to start the engine then the onboard air tank can be recharged by an external source. If an external source is not available then the engine can be started by hand swinging the propeller.

It lies on Pennsylvania Avenue NW between 7th Street Northwest and 9th Street Northwest, adjacent to the Archives station of the Washington Metro and the National Archives building. The National Park Service, through its National Mall and Memorial Parks administrative unit, provides technical and maintenance assistance to the foundation. Associated with the memorial is the Naval Heritage Center, which offers spaces available for rent, and is open year-round. History In the early days of U.S. independence, architect Pierre L'Enfant envisioned a memorial in the nation's capital \\"to celebrate the first rise of the Navy and consecrate its progress and achievements.\\" Excerpted from Pennsylvania Avenue, the boulevard that links the U.S. Capitol and White House, was chosen as the site for a memorial to all of the U.S. sea services. After President John F. Kennedy‚Äîhimself a World War II Navy war hero‚Äîinspired the redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue, another, Admiral Arleigh Burke, proclaimed in 1977 that \\"we have talked long enough about a navy memorial and it's time we did something about it.\\" In the spring of 1977, Burke‚Äîa former three-term Chief of Naval Operations‚Äîstarted to recruit a group to form the private, non-profit U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation. The following year, the foundation, led by Rear Admiral William Thompson, USN (Ret.), began work on the enabling legislation, design, site selection, and fund raising that would lead to the construction and subsequent of a memorial. Congress authorized the memorial in 1980, with the stipulation that funding come solely from private contributions. In March 1980, President Jimmy Carter signed the act into law. The foundation teamed up with the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation to use Market Square as the site for the memorial. The pair selected William Conklin and James Rossant of New York as architects. The Navy Memorial in 2010 By December 1985, the foundation had raised enough funds to earn a go-ahead from the Secretary of the Interior and construction got underway the following month. By August 1987, Stanley Bleifeld completed work on The Lone Sailor statue as construction of the memorial neared completion at the site. The memorial was dedicated on October 13, 1987. From late 1987 to mid-1990, two buildings were constructed on the memorial's northern perimeter. The eastern of the two buildings was selected for the memorial's visitors center. The building's shell was sufficiently completed by September 1989 to allow construction to begin for the interior of the Visitors Center. The visitors center opened in June 1991 and was formally dedicated on October 12, 1991. Some $18-million was raised by opening day of the visitors center, and fund raising continues today, to retire remaining construction debt and support educational programs undertaken by the foundation. During the summer of 2006, the water in the fountains of the Navy Memorial was colored blue due by chemicals added to fight algae growth. According to a spokesperson for the memorial, the algae has been surprisingly difficult to eliminate, and that they \\"figured it was better to have blue water than to have an algae-encrusted memorial.\\" The blue water was gone by the end of the summer. Memorial Plaza features The Lone Sailor, a statue by Stanly Bleifield and tribute to all personnel of the sea services overlooking the Granite Sea, a map depicting the world's oceans, using an azimuthal projection centered on Washington, DC. Surrounding these are two fountains honoring the personnel of the American Navy and the other navies of the world. Its southern hemisphere is surrounded by 26 bronze high reliefs commemorating events, personnel, and communities of the various sea services. Adjacent to the Memorial Plaza is the United States Navy Memorial Visitor Center, which features the Arleigh & Roberta Burke Theater, several rotating exhibits about the sea services, and several Navy Log kiosks, for easy registration on the Navy Log. The Visitor Center also features daily screenings of the films At Sea and A Day in the Life of the Blue Angels. The Media Resource Center provides a library of printed, audio and video historical documents on the Navy. The Navy Log room has touch-screen kiosks to register and search for Sea Service members and veterans. From June 2018 through June 2020, the Visitor Center featured two exhibits: The American Sailor: Agile, Capable, and Talented, and Zumwalt: The Current that Brought the Navy to the Shores of the 20th Century. The American Sailor tells the story of the birth of the United States Navy, and explores how individuals have defended the country at sea and provided U.S. military services wherever the seas extend over time. Zumwalt exhibits oral histories, personal keepsakes, family artifacts and first-hand written accounts of Zumwalt‚Äô s life as CNO, leader, father, husband, and true American that propelled the Navy into the 20th century.

In 1902 he built the first wind tunnel in Canada. During the next decade, he continued researching the stability of aircraft and investigated many forms of airfoils. During World War I Turnbull was employed by Frederick and Company aircraft builders in England, where he designed a number of propellers, the most successful being his invention of the variable-pitch propeller which was first tested in 1927. His interests extended into many fields, such as hydroplane torpedo screen bomb sights, and tidal power, but his systematic approach to aeronautical engineering remains his greatest contribution.

It is found in the mountain rainforests of Sumatra. Thus it is also known as the Sumatran pheasant. This bird was first described in 1879 by the Italian ornithologist Tommaso Salvadori. The species name inornata means \\"without ornament\\". This species is classified as \\"near threatened\\" by the IUCN because of the reduction in its population size caused by the destruction of its habitat and hunting. Description The male and female Salvadori's pheasant are quite unlike each other in appearance, and in fact the male bird is very similar to the female crestless fireback (Lophura erythrophthalma). The male Salvadori's pheasant is in length and is plain black, with a bluish fringe to the feathers of body and neck. The tail is short and rounded. The beak is whitish-green and the iris orange-red. There is a yellowish-green or grey-green ring of bare skin round the eye, and the rest of the bare facial skin is bright red. The legs are greyish-blue with a strong spur. The female is slightly shorter and has no spur. Her colour is reddish- brown, each feather having fine black speckling and a pale streak by the shaft, giving her a mottled look. The throat is paler brown and the tail is blackish-brown. Juveniles are similar to females but the feathers are edged with pale buff giving a scaled effect. The principle differences between the male Salvadori's pheasant and the female crestless fireback is that the former is longer, has a pale bill and holds the tail lowered while the latter is more robust, has a black beak and tends to keep the tail cocked. Also, Salvadori's pheasant occurs at higher altitudes in Sumatra than the crestless fireback. Distribution and habitat Salvadori's pheasant is endemic to Sumatra, Indonesia, where it is found at altitudes between about . There are two subspecies; L. i. inornata being relatively common and known from many locations in the centre and south of the Barisan Mountains, while L. i. hoogerwerfi, Hoogerwerf's pheasant, is restricted to the northern part of the mountains and has been seen infrequently. Status L. inornata is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as a \\"near-threatened species\\". This is because the total population is thought to be trending downwards, it being estimated that there are between five thousand and twenty thousand individuals in total, and the bird's habitat is being degraded by the clearing of its forest home for illegal agricultural activities. Some birds are hunted and a few have appeared on sale in local markets, the vendors admitting that they had been poached from the Gunung Leuser National Park.

These stocky, barrel-bodied animals were characterised by a massive bony skull roof and short weak snout. It is thought that, like the rest of the members of its family, the animals engaged in head-butting intraspecific behavior, possibly for territory or mates. The fossil remains (skull and postcranial elements) of Tapinocephalus are known from the Lower, Middle, and Upper part of the Tapinocephalus Assemblage Zone ( Capitanian age) of the Lower Beaufort Beds of the South African Karoo. Only the type species, T. atherstonei is now considered valid for this genus. In life, these animals were over in length and massed around , making them among the largest animals of their time. Classification Tapinocephalus atherstonei shoulder girdle and front limb, specimen 5611. Tapinocephalus atherstonei is known from a number of skulls and postcranial bones. The skull is large with a heavily pachyostotic skull roof, a massive bony frontals and a short weak Moschops-like snout. Taurops is a synonym. Phocosaurus megischion is another synonym differing only in that the transition from the frontals to the snout is not abrupt.

History The Spoilers began in Los Angeles, California in 1978. The founding members were Chris Hickey, George Padgett and Dean Stefan. Bill Hickey was also considered a semi-member of the band when he was not attending law school at Berkeley. Their first EP was released in 1978 on White Lunch Records and contained the songs \\"Has Been\\" (written by Dean Stefan), \\"Battling On\\" (Chris Hickey), \\"Boys Night Out\\" (Dean Stefan) and \\"The Ugly Nancies\\" (Chris Hickey). Hickey and Stefan were credited with guitar and Padgett with bass. Under the management of local impresario Stan Bernstein, the band moved from a punk to a new wave band, to fit their image as soft clean-cut suburbanites. Bernstein released a second Spoilers record in 1979, Balloon Water Race, that contained \\"Focus\\" (Dean Stefan), \\"Loose Words\\" (Chris Hickey), \\"Mr. X\\" (Craig Wisda) and \\"Point Blank\\" (Bruce Springsteen). A 45 single followed in 1980 on White Lunch Records, of Stefan‚Äôs \\"Greta\\", backed with Hickey‚Äôs \\"Loose Words\\". The single was played by Rodney Bingenheimer on the KROQ as well as on Dr Demento's syndicated show. The band then relocated south to Los Angeles. A five-song mini album was recorded with Paul Wexler, but was not released due to contractual disagreement with Wexler. Instead, the band left to record a 1980 single on Elton John‚Äôs record label, The Rocket Record Company. This single featured Stefan‚Äôs \\"Reckless\\" backed by a new version of \\"Battling On\\". Kessler and Wisda left the band in 1981. Hickey and Stefan then recorded a 12-song album, produced by Steve Verroca, and using studio musicians. Later solo work Chris Hickey went on to release six solo albums, co-lead the alt-folk band Show of Hands with future Beach Boy Randell Kirsch, and lead the alternative band Uma. Both bands released CDs on major labels (I.R.S. Records and MCA Universal, respectively). Dean Stefan released a solo album Trial and Error and wrote much of the soundtrack music to the children‚Äôs television series, Rainbow Fish. These songs were released as a CD on Sony Music.

These beetles are small, ranging from . Their bodies are elongate and convex, with black and brown colors including yellowish- and reddish-brown shades. As of 2012, the biology and habits of Ochodaeidae beetles is still mostly unknown. Most types have been collected in sandy areas at night, while some of their species are active during the day. Taxonomy Ochodaeidae beetles belong to the infraorder Scarabaeiformia, which contains only one superfamily, the Scarabaeoidea. The most striking feature of the Scarabaeoidea are the ends of their antennae, that are divided into several lamellae, thus resembling a fan. Another distinguishing feature are their legs, that possess teeth and are adapted for digging. Ochodaeidae is divided into two subfamilies containing five tribes and 15 genera: *Subfamily Ochodaeinae Mulsant & Rey, 1871 :*Tribe Enodognathini Scholtz, 1988 :::Enodognathus Benderitter, 1921 :::Odontochodaeus Paulian, 1976 :*Tribe Ochodaeini Mulsant & Rey, 1871 :::Codocera Eschscholtz, 1818 :::Cucochodaeus Paulsen, 2007 :::Neochodaeus Nikolayev, 1995 :::Notochodaeus Nikolajev, 2005 :::Ochodaeus Dejean, 1821 :::Parochodaeus Nikolayev, 1995 :::Xenochodaeus Paulsen, 2007 *Subfamily Chaetocanthinae Scholtz in Scholtz, D'Hotman, Evans & Nel, 1988 :*Tribe Chaetocanthini Scholtz in Scholtz, D'Hotman, Evans & Nel, 1988 :::Chaetocanthus P√©ringuey, 1901 :::Mioochodaeus Nikolajev, 1995 :::Namibiotalpa Scholtz & Evans, 1987 :*Tribe Pseudochodaeini Scholtz, 1988 :::Pseudochodaeus Carlson & Richter, 1974 :*Tribe Synochodaeini Scholtz, 1988 :::Synochodaeus Kolbe, 1907 :::Gauchodaeus Paulsen, 2012 References  Literature about Ochodaeidae  * 2006: A review of the family-group names for the superfamily Scarabaeoidea (Coleoptera) with corrections to nomenclature and a current classification.

It is also known as Albin's Hampstead eye in the United Kingdom, where it has occurred only as an accidental import. Description Dorsal view Ventral view The meadow argus has two brownish wings, each covered with two distinctive black and blue eyespots as well as white and orange marks that appear on the edge of the wings. The eyespots are a defense mechanism that are not only used to frighten predators away, but also to confuse the predators into thinking that the eyespots are the target, allowing the butterfly to escape with only a small part of the wing being lost. The underside of the wings are mainly unmarked, except the lower part of the forewing has similar markings as the upperside. The wingspan measures 4 centimetres (1.6 in) in males and 4.3 centimetres (1.7) in females. As the butterfly rests, it can sit in four different positions depending on the current situation. These positions include: * If the sun is shining, the butterfly will open and relax its wings * If danger approaches while in the sunlight the butterfly will open its wings further revealing eyespots on its hindwings * If the sun is not shining the butterfly will close its wings * If danger approaches while there is no sunlight the butterfly will raise its frontwings revealing hidden eyespots Distribution and habitat The meadow argus can be found mainly on the Australian mainland, as well as in Tasmania, Kangaroo Island, Lord Howe Island, New Zealand, Norfolk Island, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Tuvalu, Samoa and Cook Islands. They reside in urban areas, forests, woodlands, and grasslands, though they are uncommon during the winter months. Every year during October or November, the butterflies migrate from southern Australia to warmer areas in the north. Meadow argus Early stages =Eggs= Meadow argus eggs are laid on a leaf of the food plant, shaped with sturdy vertical and horizontal ribs. The eggs usually hatch within 7 to 10 days. =Larvae= Meadow argus larvae are black with short thin spines. Meadow argus caterpillars feed on various garden plants, both native and introduced. This includes Plantago, Scrophulariaceae, Convolvulaceae, Compositae, Verbenaceae, Porulacaceae, and Gentianaceae. This stage lasts from 4 to 5 weeks. =Pupae= Meadow argus pupae have various colours, though usually they are black dotted with white and reddish yellow. This stage lasts from 2 to 3 weeks.

Their wheel arrangement is described by the Whyte notation 4-6-4T. The locomotives were designed by NZR chief draughtsman S.H. Jenkinson as tank versions of the AB class 4-6-2 Pacific locomotive. Initially, the locomotives were separated into two classes, designated WAB for mainline work and WS for suburban work. The remaining locomotives were kept in service until the last days of steam, operating short-haul mainline freight services and fast suburban services, particularly in Auckland. WAB 794 was sold to the Ohai Railway Board in Southland for running heavy coal trains. The locomotives were progressively withdrawn in the 1960s.  Introduction  The first locomotives, WS 686 and WAB 687, were built from the boilers, frames and engine units initially destined for AB 666 and AB 667\\\\. These entered service in 1917, WS 686 in Wellington and WAB 687 at Taumarunui in the central North Island. Fourteen WS class locomotives were built between 1917 and 1925: one at Addington workshops (686), five at A & G Price Ltd, Thames (799-803) and eight at Hillside workshops, Dunedin (764-771). All the WS class were converted to WAB in 1932-4. Sixteen WAB class were built between 1918 and 1926: one at Addington (687), 12 at Hillside (786-795) and three at A&G; Price (796-798). Between 1947 and 1957 11 WAB class were converted to AB class.

Topography  Anthony's Nose, together with Dunderberg Mountain, comprises the South Gate of the Hudson Highlands. It forms a ridge running northeast and southwest, being separated from Canada Hill to the northeast by Copper Mine Brook and the \\"South Mountain Pass\\", and being bordered on the southwest by the Hudson. The Hudson makes a turn around the southwestern tip, so that the northwestern side also slopes down to salt marshes along the river. On the southeastern side are Mine Mountain and, across Broccy Creek, Manitou Mountain. Most of this land is part of Camp Smith, a New York National Guard reservation.New York‚ÄìNew Jersey Trail Conference Trail Map 101, East Hudson Trails: Hudson Highlands State Park US 6/202 crosses the Hudson on the Bear Mountain Bridge to the western tip of the mountain, where it meets NY 9D. 9D runs northeast along the northwestern flank of the mountain to Garrison, New York, while 202/6 runs southeast, hugging the cliffs, towards Peekskill. The main line of the New York Central Railroad, now Metro-North's Hudson Line, runs along the mountain and passes under the western tip and the Bear Mountain Bridge through a tunnel bearing the peak's name.  History  The peak has been known as Anthony's Nose since at least 1697, when the name appears on a grant patent. The eponymous Anthony may be St Anthony, as a rock formation called \\"Saint Anthony's Face\\" existed on Breakneck Ridge nearby before its destruction by quarrying. Pierre Van Cortlandt, who owned this mountain, said it was named for a pre-Revolutionary War sea captain, Anthony Hogan. This captain was reputed to have a Cyrano de Bergerac type nose. One of his mates, looking at this mount, as they sailed by it, compared it to that of the captain's nose. He said that they looked similar in size. This good-natured joke soon spread, and the name Anthony's Nose stuck to this peak. Washington Irving's History of New York, a satire, attributes the name to one Antony Van Corlear, who was the trumpeter on Henry Hudson's ship. Other traditions name Anthony de Hooges (1620‚Äì1655), a deacon of the Dutch Reformed Church and early settler of Rensselaerswyck, as the source of \\"Anthony's Nose\\" ‚Äì supposedly after de Hooges' own prominent nose. One of the Hudson River Chains was stretched from Fort Montgomery to the foot of the mountain. The Bear Mountain Bridge was later constructed along approximately that alignment. An airway beacon was once located on the summit.  Geology  The mountain is composed of Canada Hill granite. Large calcite crystals have been collected from the railroad cut along the base.  Trails  The Appalachian Trail crosses the Bear Mountain Bridge and follows 9D for a short distance before turning east and climbing the side of the mountain. It skirts the summit ridge, descends into the clove between Anthony's Nose and Mine Mountain, and from there into South Mountain Pass. The blue-blazed Camp Smith Trail leaves the AT southwestward just above the descent to 9D, and runs along the ridge to reach the summit. From there, it runs along the border of Camp Smith to reach parking along 202/6 on the south side of Manitou Mountain.

There is also one elevator from the back of the staircase that goes down to fare control. Two staircases from the northwest corner of Broadway and West 60th Street go down to an unstaffed fare control area, where three full height turnstiles and a short staircase provide direct access to the north end of the southbound IRT platform. Another staircase at the southern island of the aforementioned intersection go down to a bank of turnstiles leading to the center of the same platform. The Time Warner Center at the northwest corner of West 58th Street and Eighth Avenue has a set of elevators, escalators, and staircases going down to fare control, where a token booth and turnstile bank provide entrance/exit to the station. A single staircase goes down to each IND platform at their extreme south end while a passageway leads to the southbound IRT platform. The mezzanine also has a staircase going up to the northeast corner of West 58th Street and Eighth Avenue. There is a passageway leading to another staircase that goes up to the northwest corner of West 57th Street and Eighth Avenue. This staircase is built within the Hearst Tower. A complex of restaurants and shops called \\"Turnstyle\\" opened in this passageway in April 2016. The south end of the northbound IRT platform has a same-level unstaffed fare control area containing full height turnstiles and two staircases going up to the south corners of West 59th Street and Broadway. In October 1992, at a public hearing, New York City Transit proposed closing street staircase S6 to the northwest corner 61st Street and Central Park West and reopening street staircase S2 at 60th Street and Central Park West, located to the east of the circular stair, in order to expand the Transit Police District Command to accommodate more officers and increase the efficiency of the operation. The circular staircase was expected to be reconstructed to provide more direct access The 61st Street exit was operated part-time, closing at nights, consisted of a high exit turnstile and was used by 2400 daily passengers. It was located in a remote unmonitored portion of the station, making safety an added consideration for its closure. Four staircases to the two platforms that led to the passageway leading to the exit were removed.    IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line platforms  59th Street‚ÄìColumbus Circle on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line has four tracks and two side platforms. =History= Operation of the first subway began on October 27, 1904, with the opening of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway from City Hall to 145th Street on the West Side Branch including the 59th Street station. Despite being a major transfer point to the IND Eighth Avenue Line, the station was constructed as a local stop prior to the IND's construction in 1932. During the 1950s, the New York City Transit Authority considered converting the station to an express stop by rerouting the local tracks to the outside of the platforms. This would have coincided with 72nd Street becoming a local stop by fencing off or walling up the express side of the island platforms there. The conversion of the station to an express station was planned to serve the under construction New York Coliseum. When the station opened, there was an underpass between the downtown and uptown platforms. In 1991, it was closed and the staircase entrances covered over. Today, passengers use the IND mezzanine and platforms to transfer between directions. Both platforms have two fare controls which are on the same level, one of which connects to the mezzanine leading to the IND platforms. = Image gallery = File:Columbus Circle IRT 003.JPG|Name in mosaics File:Columbus Circle IRT 006.JPG|Original cartouche featuring Columbus's ship the Santa Maria File:Columbus Circle IRT 002.JPG|Detailed view of the ceiling File:59th Street Columbus Circle station 1978.jpg|The uptown platform in 1978  IND Eighth Avenue Line platforms  59th Street‚ÄìColumbus Circle on the IND Eighth Avenue Line, which opened on September 10, 1932, is a large express station. There are four tracks and three island platforms with the outer two in revenue service. South of the station, trains can either continue on Eighth Avenue or diverge east to the Seventh Avenue station via the IND Sixth Avenue Line. North of the station are crossovers in both directions, and the northbound tracks cross over the southbound tracks to form a two-level configuration to 103rd Street. The next express station to the north, 125th Street, is 3.35 miles (5.391 km) away with seven local stations in between. This is the longest distance between two express stops in the system. At the middle of each open platform, there are two staircases and one elevator that connect with the northbound platform of IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line. There is also one staircase from each platform at the north end leading to the same area. A single staircase at the extreme south end connects to the southbound IRT platform. There are two newsstands, one each at the center of both platforms. This station formerly had a 1992 artwork called Hello Columbus, made by various New York City artists and public school students. Sol LeWitt created tile work on the stairway from the IND platforms to the uptown IRT platform entitled Whirls and Twirls, installed in 2009. Large white \\"59\\"s are placed over the blue stripes‚Äìsimilar to the \\"42\\"s at 42nd Street‚ÄìPort Authority. =History= alt= The unused center platform during renovation When the Eighth Avenue Line was being built, the station was originally planned to be located at 57th Street, with entrances extending up to 61st Street. This station, along with the IRT station, was designed as a major transit hub under Columbus Circle. The station opened on September 10, 1932, as part of the city-operated Independent Subway System (IND)'s initial segment, the Eighth Avenue Line between Chambers Street and 207th Street. The center platform was originally built along with the other platforms, but was first used in passenger service in 1959. It served the purpose of a Spanish solution, allowing passengers to exit both sides of subway cars as the express trains would open the doors on both sides.

The film stars Paul Petersen, Quinn O'Hara, Charla Doherty, Neil Fletcher and Hugh Feagin. AIP commissioned low-budget cult film auteur Larry Buchanan to produce and direct this film as a color remake of Roger Corman's 1955 film Day the World Ended. Although not set in the year 2889, In the Year 2889s title is borrowed from a short story of the same title by Jules Verne and his son, Michael Verne. Plot A nuclear war has wiped out most of Earth's population. The film follows a group of survivors who are holed up in a secluded valley and must protect themselves from rising radiation levels, mutants, and in some cases, each other. Cast Production AIP gave Buchanan the script of the 1955 Corman film Day the World Ended to use for this film, resulting in an almost line-for-line, scene- for-scene remake. This was Buchanan's fifth Azalea Productions film. It was made by AIP six years after the success of their 1961 Jules Verne adaptation Master of the World. Because this was an even lower budget remake of the earlier low budget Corman film, it needed a new title; AIP already had a registered title available (for a previously unmade Verne project), so it was used on the Buchanan film. Release In the Year 2889 was completed and released in 1967 as a made-for-television movie. All promotional materials, including the original listing in TV Guide, have the title as Year 2889, but the on-screen credits give the correct title. =Home media= In the Year 2889 was released on DVD by Retromedia Entertainment in 2004, packaged as a double feature with Buchanan's 1969 film It's Alive!.http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/9113/its-alive-year-2889/ Reception Paul Gaita from Allmovie called the film \\" threadbare and blandly executed\\", but also noted that the film's pacing, and performances were more professional than the director's previous efforts. Finishing his review, Gaita wrote, \\"No one will mistake this for a classic of the genre, or even one of Corman's titles, but for Buchanan completists and late movie devotees, it's a harmless and agreeable time-killer.\\" See also * List of American films of 1967 * List of films in the public domain in the United States References External links * In the Year 2889 at AllMovie  1967 films 1960s science fiction films American films American International Pictures films American film remakes Films about cannibalism English-language films Films about nuclear war and weapons Films set in the 29th century American science fiction television films Post-apocalyptic films Film about the Third World War ","title":"In the Year 2889 (film)"},{"id":"4034532","text":"The Mt St Helens landslide was a sturzstrom. The slide took place on the north face, and created the valley-like gap seen here. A Sturzstrom (from the German Sturz (fall) and Strom (stream, flow)) or rock avalanche is a large landslide consisting of soil and rock which travels a great horizontal distance (as much as 20 or 30 times) compared to its initial vertical drop. Sturzstroms have similarities to the flow of glaciers, mudflows, and lava flows. They flow across land fairly easily, and their mobility increases when volume increases. They have been found on other bodies in the Solar System, including the Moon, Mars, Venus, Io, Callisto, Iapetus, and Phobos.

Precise radiocarbon dating of the giant K√∂fels landslide (Eastern Alps, Austria), Geomorphology, Volume 243, August 2015, pp. 87‚Äì91 Sturzstroms may be triggered, similarly to other types of landslides, by heavy rains, earthquakes, or volcanic activity. They move rapidly, but do not necessarily require water to be present to move, and there is no definite explanation for their kinematic characteristics. One theory, the acoustic fluidization theory, hypothesizes that vibrations caused by the collisions among the rock fragments reduce friction and allow the mass to travel great distances. Another theory involves air pockets forming under the slide and providing a cushion that the slide rides over with very low friction, although the merit of this theory has been called into question by the presence of sturzstroms in vacuums such as on the Moon and Phobos. Observation of slides on Iapetus suggests that tiny contact points between bits of ice debris may heat up considerably during the movement, causing melting and forming a more fluidand thus less friction-limitedmass of material. K√∂felsite (impactite or frictionite), K√∂fels Structure, Austria. The sample is wide. The amount of energy in a sturzstrom is much higher than in a typical landslide. Once moving, it can ride over nearly any terrain and will cover much more horizontal ground than downward-sloped ground. Its momentum can even carry the sturzstrom up small hills. The process of detachment, movement and deposition of a sturzstrom can be recorded by seismometers tens of kilometers away. The peculiar characteristics of this seismic signal make it distinguishable from that of small earthquakes. In the large K√∂fels landslide, which flowed into the √ñtztal valley in Tyrol, Austria, deposits of fused rocks, called \\"frictionite\\" (or \\"impactite\\", or \\"hyalomylonite\\"), were found in the landslide debris. This has been hypothesized to be volcanic in origin or the result of a meteorite impact, but the leading hypothesis is that it was due to the large amount of internal friction. Friction between static and moving rocks can create enough heat to fuse rocks to form frictionite.

Generally, body load is an unpleasant physical sensation that is difficult to describe objectively either in terms of other sensations or in its specific location. However, it could be likened to an instinct of the body sensing it is about to be placed under exceptional stress, a state of pre-shock. Common symptoms include stomach ache, nausea, dizziness, feelings of being over-stimulated or \\"wired,\\" shivering, feelings of excessive tension in the torso, or, in more severe cases, shortness of breath or a feeling of suffocation. Different drugs may cause different body load sensations which vary in intensity and duration. In contrast, many drug users, and particularly users of cannabis, entactogens like MDMA or of certain synthetic phenethylamines (most notably the popular 2C-B) and tryptamines, also often report a \\"body high\\" or \\"body rush\\", which is similar to body load in many respects but is usually considered pleasant.  Causes  The causes of the experience of body load are unknown. However, one proposed mechanism is the stimulation of serotonergic 5-HT receptors, particularly those involved in tactile sensation and, equally importantly in many cases where nausea is experienced, those located along the lining of the digestive tract. Serotonin is heavily involved in appetite control, and over- stimulation of serotonergic receptors has been shown to cause nausea in overdoses of SSRIs or MDMA. Many psychedelics which can cause body load are partial serotonin agonists, which work by mimicking the structure of serotonin to varying degrees.

Biography Sancho was the son of count Garc√≠a Fern√°ndez and his wife Ava of Ribagorza, the daughter of Raymond I, Count of Pallars and Ribagorza. Sancho rebelled against his father with the support of Al-Mansur of C√≥rdoba.

Sancho led the coalition that was defeated at the Battle of Cervera in July 1000, but in early September successfully turned back the C√≥rdoban invasion of his county. Almanzor died in 1002, leaving the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba in crisis. Sancho ruled for another 15 years. In 1010, he intervened in Ribagorza, bringing about an end to Muslim domination there and leading to the abdication of his aunt countess Toda, and the establishment of a partition between Castilian- educated William Isarn, illegitimate son of Toda's brother and predecessor count Isarn, and Raymond Sunyer of Pallars, husband of Sancho's sister Mayor.

He was captured by Alauddin's general Nusrat Khan during the 1299 invasion of Gujarat, and rose to prominence in the 1300s. As a commander of Alauddin's forces, Kafur defeated the Mongol invaders in 1306. Subsequently, he led a series of expeditions in the southern part of India, against the Yadavas (1308), the Kakatiyas (1310), the Hoysalas (1311), and the Pandyas (1311). From these campaigns, he brought back many treasures, and many elephants and horses for the Delhi Sultanate. From 1313 to 1315, Kafur served as Alauddin's governor of Devagiri. When Alauddin fell seriously ill in 1315, Kafur was recalled to Delhi, where he exercised power as Na'ib (viceroy). After Alauddin's death, he tried to usurp control by appointing Alauddin's minor son, Shihabuddin Omar, as a puppet monarch. Kafur's regency lasted for about a month, before he was assassinated by Alauddin's former bodyguards. Alauddin's elder son, Mubarak Shah, succeeded him as regent, and usurped power shortly afterward.  Early life and career  Kafur is described as of Hindu descent (\\"Marhatta\\", according to the 14th-century chronicler Isami). In his youth, Kafur was the slave of a wealthy Khwaja of Khambhat. He was a slave of great physical beauty, said to have been purchased by his original master for 1,000 dinars. This resulted in the epithet hazar-dinari. It is very unlikely that the price paid was actually 1,000 dinars; the description seems rather to be a metaphorical compliment to Kafur. Ibn Batuta (1304‚Äì1369) refers to Kafur by the epithet al-Alfi (the Arabic equivalent of hazar-dinari), again in reference to the price paid for him, but Ibn Batuta may be in error in stating that the epithet refers to a sum paid by the sultan (Alauddin) himself for Kafur. Kafur was captured from the port city of Khambhat by Alauddin's general Nusrat Khan, during the 1299 invasion of Gujarat, and converted to Islam. He was presented by Nusrat Khan to Sultan Alauddin in Delhi. Nothing is known about Kafur's early career in Alauddin's service. According to Isami, Alauddin favoured Kafur because \\"his counsel had always proved appropriate and fit for the occasion\\". Kafur rose rapidly, mainly because of his proven ability as a wise counsellor and military commander. By 1306, Kafur held the rank of barbeg, used to designate a chamberlain who also served as a military commander. By 1309‚Äì1310, he held the iqta' (administrative grant) of Rapri. Military career Khalji territory (dark green) after annexation of the Sevuna (Yadava) kingdom of Devagiri, showing capital Delhi (star) and territories of the Khalji tributaries (light green) In 1306, Alauddin sent an army led by Kafur to the Punjab to repulse a Mongol invasion by the Chagatai Khanate. The Mongol army had advanced to the Ravi River, ransacking the territories along the way. This army included three contingents, led by Kopek, Iqbalmand, and Tai-Bu. Kafur routed the Mongol army, with support from other commanders, including Malik Tughluq. Kafur was known by this time as Na'ib-i Barbak (\\"assistant master of ceremonies\\"). This may be the origin of his name Malik Na'ib, although some historians believe this relates instead to his later, and more important, role of Na'ib-i Sultan. The 16th-century chronicler \`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni also credits Kafur with leading Alauddin's army in the 1305 Battle of Amroha. This claim, however, is based on the erroneous identification of another officer, called Malik Nayak ( Malik Nanak), with Malik Kafur. Kafur was then sent to the Deccan Plateau, as the commander of a series of great military raids that laid the foundations of Muslim power in that region. In 1307, Alauddin decided to invade the Yadava kingdom of Devagiri, whose king, Ramachandra, had discontinued tribute payments to Delhi for three or four years. Alauddin had originally intended to select another slave to lead this invasion: Malik Shahin, who was the governor of Chittor Fort. But Malik Shahin had fled, fearing a Vaghela resurgence in the neighbouring territory of Gujarat. Alauddin appointed Kafur instead. Alauddin took measures to raise Kafur above all other officers. The royal canopy and the royal pavilion were sent with Kafur, and the officers were directed to pay their respects to Kafur daily and to take their orders from him. Kafur easily subjugated the Yadavas. Along with rich spoils, Kafur brought Ramachandra back to Delhi, where the Yadava king acknowledged Alauddin's suzerainty. In 1309, Alauddin sent Kafur on an expedition to the Kakatiya kingdom. Kafur's army reached the Kakatiya capital, Warangal, in January 1310, and breached its outer fort after a month-long siege. The Kakatiya ruler, Prataparudra, surrendered and agreed to pay tribute. Kafur returned to Delhi in June 1310 with a huge amount of wealth obtained from the defeated king. The Koh-i-Noor diamond was said to be among the loot. Alauddin was very pleased with Kafur, and rewarded him generously. In Warangal, Kafur had learned that the southernmost regions of India were also very wealthy. He obtained Alauddin's permission to lead an expedition there. The expedition set off on 19 October 1310, and reached the extremity of peninsular India. On 25 February 1311, Kafur besieged Dwarasamudra, the Hoysala capital, with 10,000 soldiers. The Hoysala king, Ballala, surrendered vast wealth as part of a truce negotiation, and agreed to pay an annual tribute to the Delhi Sultanate. From Dwarasamudra, Kafur proceeded to the Pandya kingdom, where he raided several places, obtaining much treasure and many elephants and horses. Kafur occupied Madurai on 24 April, and reached Delhi in triumph on 18 October 1311. At court, Kafur seems to have excited the enmity of a faction led by Mahru, Alauddin's second wife; Khizr Khan, his eldest son by her; and Alp Khan, Mahru's brother, who was also Khizr Khan's father-in-law and the governor of Gujarat. In 1313, probably at his own request, Kafur led another expedition to Devagiri, when Ramachandra's successor Singhana (or Shankaradeva) refused to continue the tribute payments. Kafur subdued him, and annexed Devagiri to the Delhi Sultanate. Kafur remained in Devagiri as governor of the newly annexed territory for two years, until he was urgently summoned to Delhi when Alauddin's health began deteriorating. He had administered the territory with sympathy and efficiency.  As viceroy  Kafur ultimately rose to the position of Na'ib (viceroy), although the date of his appointment to this position is not known. In 1315, when Alauddin fell seriously ill, Kafur was recalled from Devagiri to Delhi. Kafur handed over charge of Devagiri to Ayn al-Mulk Multani. During Alaudidn's last days, Kafur held the executive power. During this period, Alauddin became very distrustful of his other officers, and started concentrating power in the hands of his family and his slaves. He removed several experienced administrators, abolished the office of wazir (prime minister), and even executed the minister Sharaf Qa'ini. It appears that Kafur, who considered these officers his rivals and a threat, convinced Alauddin to carry out this purge. Alauddin had greater trust in Kafur than other officers because, unlike the other officers, Kafur had no family or followers. According to Isami, during the final days of Alauddin‚Äôs reign, Kafur allowed no one to see the sultan, and became de facto ruler of the Sultanate. = Relationship with Alauddin = Kafur had been captured by Khalji forces in 1299, and had caught the fancy of Alauddin. A deep emotional bond developed between the two. During his reign (even before his illness), Alauddin was infatuated with Kafur, distinguishing him above all his other friends and helpers, and Kafur held the highest place in his esteem. Regarding the time when Alauddin was ill, the chronicler Ziauddin Barani (1285‚Äì1357) states: Based on Barani's description, scholars Ruth Vanita and Saleem Kidwai believe that Alauddin and Kafur were in a homosexual relationship. Other historians and scholars also believe Alauddin and Kafur were lovers in a sexually intimate relationship. Historian Banarsi Prasad Saksena states that Alauddin was infatuated with Kafur during the last years of his reign, but believes that the closeness between the two was not sexual. = Murder of Alp Khan = Kafur's hold on power was threatened by Alp Khan, an influential noble whose two daughters were married to Alauddin's sons, Khizr Khan (the heir apparent) and Shadi Khan. Kafur convinced Alauddin to order the killing of Alp Khan in the royal palace. He also had Khizr Khan first banished from court to Amroha, and then imprisoned in Gwalior, and had Khizr's brother Shadi Khan imprisoned. According to stories that circulated as far as Persia, Khizr Khan, his mother and Alp Khan had hatched a conspiracy to poison Alauddin, so that Khizr Khan could be appointed as the new Sultan, but Alauddin was able to execute them all before he died. This story was corroborated to some extent by Ibn Battuta. The story may just have been Kafur's propaganda. Next, Kafur convened a meeting of important officers at Alauddin's bedside. At this meeting, Alauddin's six-year-old son Shihabuddin was declared the new heir apparent, and it was decided that Kafur would act as his regent after Alauddin's death. According to Isami, Alauddin was too weak to speak during the meeting, but his silence was taken as consent. The officers supportive of Kafur included Kamal al-Din \\"Gurg\\", whose family came from Kabul. It appears that Kafur and other officers of non-Turkic origin allied to counter the Khalaj establishment of the Sultanate.  As regent  When Alauddin died, on the night of 4 January 1316, Kafur brought his body from the Siri Palace and had it buried in the mausoleum that had been built before Alauddin's death. Ziauddin Barani claimed that, according to \\"some people\\", Kafur murdered Alauddin. The day after Alauddin's death, Kafur convened a meeting of important officers and nobles in the palace. There, he read out a will of the late sultan that named Shihabuddin as his successor while disinheriting Khizr Khan, and then seated Shihabuddin on the throne as the new Sultan. As regent, Kafur held power for a short time‚Äî35 days, according to Barani; 1 month, according to Isami; and 25 days, according to the 16th-century historian Firishta. During this period, he held a daily ceremonial court in the morning at the Hazar Sutun Palace. After the short ceremony, Kafur would send Shihabuddin to his mother, and dismiss the courtiers. He would then meet the officers in his chambers on the ground floor, and issue various orders. He ordered the ministries of revenue, secretariat, war, and commerce to maintain the laws and regulations established by Alauddin. The officers of the ministries were asked to consult Kafur on all policy matters. Kafur took several actions to maintain his control over the throne. Before burying Alauddin, he had taken the royal ring from the Sultan's finger. He gave this ring to his general, Sumbul, and asked him to march to Gwalior and take control of the fort, using the ring as a symbol of royal authority. He asked Sumbul to send the fort's governor to Delhi, and ordered Sumbul to return to Delhi after blinding Khizr Khan, who had been imprisoned in Gwalior. Sumbul carried out these orders, and was appointed Amir-i Hijab as a reward. On his first day as regent, Kafur also ordered his barber to blind Khizr Khan's uterine brother Shadi Khan. This incident intensified resentment of Kafur among the Turkic nobles. Kafur deprived Alauddin's senior queen, who bore the title Malika-i Jahan, of all her property, and later imprisoned her at Gwalior fort. He also imprisoned Mubarak Shah, another adult son of Alauddin. According to Firishta, Kafur married Alauddin's widow Jhatyapalli, the mother of Shihabuddin. Becoming the new Sultan's step-father was probably Kafur's way of legitimizing his power. Alp Khan's murder had led to a rebellion in Gujarat, and Kafur had sent Kamal al-Din \\"Gurg\\" to suppress it. Meanwhile, Kafur summoned the Devagiri governor, Ayn al-Mulk Multani, to Delhi with all his soldiers. While Multani was on his way, Kamal al-Din was killed in Gujarat. Kafur then appointed Multani as governor of Gujarat, and asked him to march there to suppress the rebellion. The rebellion could be suppressed only after Kafur's death.  Death  Alauddin's former bodyguards (paiks) disapproved of Kafur's actions against the family of their deceased master. Led by Mubashshir, Bashir, Saleh, and Munir, these bodyguards decided to kill Kafur. When Kafur became suspicious of a conspiracy against him, he summoned Mubashshir to his room. Mubashshir, who had been permitted to carry arms in the royal quarters since Alauddin's day, wounded Kafur with his sword. His associates then entered the room and beheaded Kafur, also killing two or three gatekeepers who had attempted to protect him. This event took place sometime in February 1316. According to an account cited by the 16th-century chronicler Firishta, Kafur had sent some paiks to blind Mubarak Shah, but the captive prince gave them his jeweled necklace and convinced them to kill Kafur instead. Another legend attributes Kafur's death to his mother's prayers to the mystic Shaikhzada Jam. These accounts are latter-day fabrications. According to Barani's near-contemporary account, the paiks decided to kill Kafur on their own initiative. Kafur's killers freed Mubarak Shah, who was appointed as the new regent. A few months later, Mubarak Shah usurped control by blinding Shihabuddin. Kafur's killers claimed credit for making him king, and began demanding high positions in the royal court. Instead, Mubarak Shah had them executed. The chronicler Barani was severely critical of Kafur. Historian Abraham Eraly, however, believes that Barani's criticism of Kafur is not credible as Barani was deeply prejudiced against Kafur, presumably because of Kafur's non-Turkic, Hindu origins and eunuch status. = Tomb = The location of Kafur's grave is unknown today. His mausoleum existed in the 14th century, when it was repaired by Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlaq (r. 1309-1388).

The 690 species in 97 genera occur widely in the tropics, but little is known of their biology. Hybosorids are small, 5‚Äì7 mm in length and oval in shape. Color ranges from a glossy light brown to black. They are distinctive for their large mandibles and labrum, and their 10-segmented antennae, in which the 8th antennomore of the club is deeply grooved and occupied by the 9th and 10th antennomeres. The legs have prominent spurs. The larvae have the C-shape and creamy white appearance typical of the scarabaeiforms. The 4-segmented legs are well-developed; the front legs are used to stridulate by rubbing against the margin of the epipharynx, a habit unique to this family. Adults are known to feed on invertebrate and vertebrate carrion, with some found in dung. Larvae have been found in decomposing plant material. Little more is known of their life histories. The group has been long recognized as distinct, primarily because of the larval characteristics, either as a distinct family or as a subfamily of Scarabaeidae.

From 1964 to 1968, Milbradt studied economics, law, and mathematics at the University of M√ºnster. He graduated with a degree in economics in 1968. From 1970 to 1980, he was scientific assistant at the institute for finance at the University of M√ºnster, where he obtained his doctoral degree (Dr. rer. pol., summa cum laude) in 1973 and his habilitation in 1980. From 1980 to 1983, Milbradt worked as substitute professor of finance and political economics at the University of Mainz; since 1985 he holds the title of an (unsalaried) professor at the economics faculty in M√ºnster. Political career Milbradt has been a member of the CDU since 1973. He was head of the finance department of the city of M√ºnster from 1983 to 1990 and then Minister of Finance of Saxony from 1990 to January 2001, but was dismissed from office by Minister-President Kurt Biedenkopf because Milbradt had started a debate about Biedenkopf's succession. Milbradt served as member of the state board of the CDU from 1991 and became deputy chairman of the state CDU in 1999 and chairman in 2001. From 1994 until 2009, he was a member of the Landtag of the Free State of Saxony. On 18 April 2002, Milbradt was elected as Minister-President of Saxony despite Biedenkopf's explicit opposition. Milbradt first governed with an absolute CDU majority, but in a coalition with the SPD after the state elections of 19 September 2004, in which the CDU lost a large number of votes. In April 2008 Milbradt announced that he would resign from the office by the end of May and that Stanislaw Tillich would succeed him. He had been under pressure for months because of his involvement in the liquidity crisis of the government's Sachsen LB bank. Milbradt has also been criticized for private loans from the bank during his time as Minister of Finance in Saxony; in April 2008, the state government confirmed that Milbradt and his wife had borrowed a total of around ‚Ç¨172,000 ($272,000) between 1996 and 1999 to help purchase around ‚Ç¨360,000 in investment fund products from a subsidiary of the bank.Political Fallout: Banking Crisis Topples Governor of Saxony Spiegel Online, April 14, 2008.

She set up the Somaly Mam Foundation, raised money, appeared on major television programs, and spoke at many international events. After allegations of lying had appeared in The Cambodia Daily in 2012 and 2013, Newsweek ran a cover-story in May 2014 claiming that Mam had fabricated stories of abuse about herself and others. After the Somaly Mam Foundation undertook its own investigation through Goodwin Procter, a Boston-based law firm, she resigned from her position and the foundation shut down in October 2014.Wilwohl, Joshua. \\"Somaly Mam Foundation Ceases Operations\\", The Cambodia Daily, October 18, 2014. Accessed September 16, 2017 She moved back to live in Cambodia before returning to the US later that year to begin new fund-raising activities. Early life Mam was born to a tribal minority family in Mondulkiri Province, Cambodia. In her memoir, The Road of Lost Innocence, she states that she was born in either 1970 or 1971. Mam was investigated by a journalist working in Cambodia, and his allegations that key parts of her early life were false was carried by Newsweek in May 2014. Mam resigned from the Somaly Mam Foundation shortly thereafter. An investigation by Marie Claire magazine came to a different conclusion, finding witnesses that supported Mam's story and contradicted Newsweek's allegations. In her book Mam said she attended school in Cambodia, but did not graduate. According to the Newsweek article, Mam did graduate and found two students and a teacher to support their claims, but Marie Claire quotes the school director remembering she attended only three years of school. Mam said that she was abused by her \\"grandfather\\" until she was approximately 14 and that she was sold to a brothel and forced into prostitution and that she was also forced to marry a stranger. She has claimed that she was forced to prostitute herself on the streets and made to have sex with five or six clients per day. Mam left Cambodia for Paris, France, in 1993 where she married a French citizen, Pierre Legros. They divorced in 2008. Charity and achievements Mam served as an untrained healthcare worker with M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res and, in her spare time, handed out condoms, soap, and information to women in the brothels. In 1996, she co-founded AFESIP (Agir pour les Femmes en Situation Precaire or \\"Acting for Women in Distressing Situations\\"), a Cambodian NGO dedicated to rescuing, housing and rehabilitating women and children in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam who have been sexually exploited. AFESIP conducts outreach work to try helping the women still enslaved. The organization also works with law enforcement to raid the brothels. The company has locations in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. In June 2007, Mam co-founded the Somaly Mam Foundation, a nonprofit organization formed in the United States that supported anti- trafficking groups and helped women and girls who had been forced into sexual slavery. The Somaly Mam Foundation (SMF) attracted the support of U.S. business leaders and Hollywood stars. SMF was the global fundraising arm of Somaly Mam's Phnom Penh-based AFESIP.Simon Marks in Cambodia Daily October 13, 2013 After the May 2014 Newsweek article questioning Mam's claims, the Somaly Mam Foundation undertook its own investigation by Goodwin Procter, a Boston- based law firm.

In 2016, a new charity, Together1heart, became the primary fundraising vehicle for AFESIP. Actress AnnaLynne McCord serves as CEO of Together1Heart.http://together1heart.org/the-team/ Posts on the group's Facebook page suggest that Mam is still heavily involved, and McCord insists that Mam is a \\"survivor\\" and appears to absolve her of wrongdoing, while stating that neither Together1heart nor AFESIP has made changes as a result of the 2014 public relations crisis. Scrutiny of Mam's stories Scrutiny of Mam's story began with comments she made at the United Nations. Speaking on a United Nations panel to member states, international aid organizations and the media in New York on April 3, Mam stated that eight girls had been killed after her organization AFESIP conducted a high-profile raid on a massage parlor at the Chai Hour II Hotel in Phnom Penh, where 83 women and girls were taken and placed in her refuge center. Somaly Mam has since admitted that this was \\"inaccurate\\" and that the Cambodian army had not killed eight girls. On 25 April 2012, the Cambodia Daily newspaper reported Mam's ex-husband and one-time AFESIP director Pierre Legros, saying that Mam had misrepresented an incident involving their daughter in 2004. Mam had long claimed that the teenager was kidnapped and raped by human traffickers in retaliation for her raid on the Chai Hour II Hotel. In her 2007 autobiography, Mam wrote that the people involved in the kidnapping of her daughter were released from jail, though a trial was pending. Legros said their daughter was not kidnapped, but had run away with her boyfriend, and that in his view the abduction story was a means of \\"marketing for the Somaly Mam Foundation\\". The U.S. Ambassador at the time, Joseph Mussomeli, wrote in a diplomatic cable in 2004 that Mam claimed that Mam's daughter had been \\"lured by her peers\\" to Battambang Province and that she was later found in a night club there in the company of three men who were arrested and charged with trafficking. Cambodian officials told the newspaper they had no record of such events. In October 2013, the Cambodia Daily alleged a further deception took place in January 1998, when Mam was propelled into the international media spotlight largely owing to the on-camera testimony of the young Meas Ratha and other alleged victims of Cambodia's child sex industry. Mam's work as president of AFESIP was being featured on French television as part of the popular weekly show Envoy√© sp√©cial. Ratha, then a teenager of about 14 years from Takeo province, told a story of sexual slavery in an unspecified brothel somewhere in Phnom Penh. Sixteen years later, Ratha (now 32 years old and married) told the newspaper that her testimony for the France 2 channel was fabricated and scripted for her by Mam as a means of drumming up support for the organization. Ratha said, \\"The video that you see, everything that I put in is not my story.\\"Simon Marks and Phorn Bopha in Cambodia Daily October 12, 2013 On 1 June 2015 the Phnom Penh Post, in an article based on recently released State Department cables, revealed that the United States government \\"...knew about the now-infamous deceptions and malpractice within organisations run by Somaly Mam for years prior to the media expos√©s\\". The article cites a cable titled Somaly Mam Under Microscope sent to the State Department from the US embassy in Phnom Penh on May 8, 2012. Speaking of Mam's claim that her daughter was abducted in 2006 in revenge for an Afesip raid on a Phnom Penh brothel in 2004, the cable says: ‚ÄúMs Mam has made this claim on numerous occasions despite having reported to post [the embassy] at the time of the incident that the girl was not kidnapped but rather lured by her peers from Phnom Penh to Battambang‚Äù. The embassy cable quoted sources in the anti- trafficking community in Phnom Penh as saying that Mam was ‚Äúrotten to the core,‚Äù but as having made a ‚Äústrategic decision to remain silent on concerns about Afesip‚Äôs accounting systems and general lack of financial controls to avoid putting ‚Ä¶ other anti-[trafficking] NGOs ‚Äòat risk‚Äô‚Äù.http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/us-was-somaly-mam Resignation On May 28, 2014, after the Newsweek expos√©, and receiving the report from lawyers, Mam resigned from the Somaly Mam Foundation. In late 2014, Mam returned to New York, hoping to restore her reputation and launched a public relations campaign, hiring publicity firm Jonathan Marder & Company.Grove, Lloyd.

By December 2014 she was accepting donations for a new NGO with headquarters in Texas, \\"The New Somaly Mam Fund: Voices for Change\\".

The process was used commercially before the end of the 19th century. This process converts nickel oxides into nickel metal with very high purity being attainable in just a single process. This process involves the fact that carbon monoxide combines with nickel readily and reversibly to give nickel carbonyl. No other element forms a carbonyl compound under the mild conditions used in the process. This process has three steps: 1\\\\. Nickel oxide reacts with syngas at 200 ¬∞C to give nickel, together with impurities including iron and cobalt. :NiO(s) + H2(g) ‚Üí Ni(s) + H2O(g) 2\\\\. The impure nickel reacts with carbon monoxide at 50-60 ¬∞C to form the gas nickel carbonyl, leaving the impurities as solids. :Ni(s) + 4 CO(g) ‚Üí Ni(CO)4(g) 3\\\\. The mixture of nickel carbonyl and syngas is heated to 220-250 ¬∞C, resulting in decomposition back to nickel and carbon monoxide: :Ni(CO)4(g) ‚Üí Ni(s) + 4 CO(g) Steps 2 and 3 illustrate a chemical transport reaction, exploiting the properties that (1) carbon monoxide and nickel readily combine to give a volatile complex and (2) this complex degrades back to nickel and carbon monoxide at higher temperatures. The decomposition may be engineered to produce powder, but more commonly an existing substrate is coated with nickel. For example, nickel pellets are made by dropping small, hot pellets through the carbonyl gas; this deposits a layer of nickel onto the pellets. This process has also been used for plating nickel onto other metals, where a complex shape or sharp corners have made precise results difficult to achieve by electroplating. Although the results are good, the toxicity makes it impractical as an industrial process. Such parts are now plated by electroless nickel plating instead.

It was managed by volunteers without any funding and with a strong emphasis on consensus decision making and DIY culture. The centre was variously known as rampART Social Centre, rampART creative centre and social space, or more commonly as rampART.

He brought organic chemistry to the United States from Germany and educated a generation of American organic chemists. Personal life Charles Loring Jackson was born in Boston on April 4, 1845. He graduated from Harvard College in 1867 after studying in private schools in Boston. He joined the Harvard chemistry department as an assistant lecturer immediately after graduation and on his twenty-first birthday became an assistant professor. He was the third member of the department which consisted of Josiah Parsons Cooke and Henry Barker Hill. In 1870 Jackson developed a chemistry course which evolved into Chemistry I, that he taught for more than forty years. As an adult Jackson enjoyed amateur theatricals and writing poetry and romantic fiction. In retirement he enjoyed gardening at his beautiful estate in Pride's Crossing near Beverly, Massachusetts. Learning chemistry Jackson was frustrated studying chemistry at Harvard because in the early 1870s there were no chemists in Cambridge, Massachusetts to train him. He therefore traveled to Heidelberg, Germany to study at Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg. There he trained under Robert Bunsen, a specialist in gas analysis and platinum metals. Although he did not intend to make organic chemistry his specialty, he also worked with the organic chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann. However, Hofmann inspired Jackson to pursue organic chemistry as a career. Jackson was known to have said that he learned to \\"use his mind\\" under Hofmann, \\"an activity that Bunsen rather discouraged.\\" During Jackson's time in Heidelberg Hofmann was writing his Faraday Lectures on Justus von Liebig and had Jackson correct his English. This was a great opportunity for Jackson to develop an intimate association with Hofmann. In 1874 Jackson published his first paper which dealt with organic selenium compounds. Research at Harvard In 1875 after returning to Harvard Jackson synthesized the first new organic compound made in a Harvard laboratory, p-bromobenzyl bromide. This provided a method of producing substituted benzyl compounds with interesting results, such as a synthesis of anthracene. In the following years he developed syntheses of flavoring compounds curcumin and vanillin. He also synthesised benzine tri- sulfonic acid and developed what is now a traditional method of nitrating organic materials, preliminary sulfonation followed by nitration. In the late 1880s he discovered the reaction between highly substituted aromatic halides and malonic ester in which a halogen radical is replaced by a hydrogen, his most prolific source of scientific publications. He also did considerable work on the derivatives of o-quinone, although he missed the discovery of the parent compound by only a small margin. The European connection The importance of Jackson's studies in Europe to the development of the organic chemistry industry in the United States should not be underestimated. In the 1870s when Jackson traveled to Europe there literally was no organic synthesis being done in the United States either in academia or in industry. This short- coming became very evident with the advent of World War I and World War II when the supply of strategic organic materials from Germany to the United States was cut off. Had the United States been unable to quickly develop an organic synthesis capability, the outcome of the World Wars might have been quite different. Several of Jackson's students at Harvard, Roger Adams, Farrington Daniels, Frank C. Whitmore, James B. Sumner and James Bryant Conant to name a few, were instrumental in developing organic synthesis in the United States. Some of them had traveled to Germany to study organic synthesis using the connections Jackson had established. In Jackson's time academic research was generally quite open, resulting in an open and internationalist philosophy among scientists. The World Wars put this philosophy at odds with commonly held beliefs about national security, intellectual property, trade secrets and technology leakage.

TUXIS originally met under the name ‚ÄúAlberta Older Boy's Parliament‚Äù. The Alberta Older Boy's Parliament added ‚ÄúTUXIS‚Äù to its name in 1932. ‚ÄúTUXIS‚Äù stands for ‚ÄúTraining for Service, with Christ (represented with an 'X' for the Greek letter 'chi') in the centre, and you and I on either side, with no-one but Christ between us‚Äù. An alternative interpretation is \\"Training Under Christ In Service.\\" It was the last of these youth parliaments to retain its ‚ÄúTUXIS‚Äù appellation and maintain its Christian character, but has since become a spiritual, but non- denominational organization. Its membership is not restricted on the basis of religion or personal beliefs. Overview The central focus of the organization is its parliamentary program. The main parliamentary session occurs during the last week of December, which determines the annual agenda of events. This includes five conferences, usually held in February, March, May, September and November and up to two \\"Front Bench Retreats\\". These conferences help plan the upcoming session and have other activities meeting the objectives of the organization. The parliament's goals have evolved from the TUXIS \\"four-fold\\" program to develop the mental, physical, social and spiritual well-being of its members and all youth. TUXIS is a non- denominational spiritual youth Parliament which recently reaffirmed its non- exclusionary spiritual foundation. TUXIS believes that exposure to different points of view encourages tolerance of varying interpretations of religion, faith, and spirituality. Each session has a theme developed by the \\"Ministry of Devotions.\\" Although theme discussions center on issues of spiritual living important to youth, being religious is not a pre-requisite to attending a session or conference of the Parliament; the Parliament is non-exclusionary and invites all Alberta youth to attend. Activities TUXIS holds an annual session from December 26 to 31. The focus of session is the parliamentary sittings where the members learn parliamentary procedure and debate legislation on topics of interest. In addition to the parliamentary procedure and debating activities, members attending the annual session participate in various social action and devotional events. TUXIS also holds weekend conferences throughout the year, usually in February, March, May, September, and November. At each of these conferences, Friday is spent meeting new members and participating in membership, social action, and devotion activities. These include \\"ice breakers\\" and fun \\"energizers.\\" Social action and devotions are more serious events which involve group discussions. Saturday mornings include a Front Bench Meeting designed to update the members on the business of Parliament, make decisions about the direction of the organization and plan for session. The rest of the day is spent with the membership, social action and devotions activities, as well as recreational activities and free time. Sunday activities include church services and clean up. TUXIS is a founding member of the Western Canada Youth Parliament. It was also a founding member and participant in the now-defunct Youth Parliament of Canada/Parlement jeunesse du Canada.http://www.revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?param=104&art;=519 Organizational structure The Executive Committee consists of the Premier, the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Premier, and the Alternate Leader of the Opposition. They are elected at Session by the members of the parliament and serve a one year term. The Executive Committee is colloquially referred to as the \\"Front Four\\" and they run the parliament by appointing the Front Bench: Ministers for the Cabinet and Deputies for the Shadow Cabinet. The current Executive Committee, elected at the 99th Session of the TUXIS Parliament, is Carly Russell as Premier, Matthew Boonstra as Leader of the Opposition, Yuvraj Singh as Deputy Premier, and Simranpreet Ghotra as the Alternate Leader of the Opposition. The current Front Bench is: Cabinet: * Provincial Secretary: Joel Westman *Minister of Finance - Sarah Clark * Minister of Programming - Katie Choy * Minister of Devotions: Caroline Mancenido * Minister of Education - Alexis Holmgren History The first Session of the Older Boys' Parliament of Alberta was first held in the Legislative Chamber of the Provincial Government in Edmonton, from December 28 to 30, 1920. The Mayor of Edmonton, D.M. Duggan, acted as lieutenant governor. Armour Ford was elected as the first Speaker. The first Premier was Edward Hunter Gowan. The Leader of the Opposition was James Robin Davidson. Like many of the other Canadian Youth Parliaments, TUXIS was sponsored by the Boys‚Äô Work Board of the provincial Religious Education Council (‚ÄúREC‚Äù). The REC was a coalition of religious organizations, the most significant of which was the United Church). The REC of Alberta ceased to exist in 1962. As a result, the TUXIS and Older Boy's Parliament of Alberta Alumni Society was formed. The members of this Society now provide sponsorship, including financial backing and continuity, of TUXIS. The 60th Session of the Parliament approved a resolution inviting young women to attend the Parliament and share in the companionship of TUXIS. This same year also approved a resolution to change the name from \\"TUXIS and Older Boys' Parliament of Alberta\\" to \\"TUXIS Parliament of Alberta.\\" Young women first attended the 62nd Session in 1981http://www.revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?param=104&art;=519 at Red Deer and soon entered into the leadership when LaVonne Rosvick was elected Premier for the 67th Session. TUXIS celebrated its ninetieth Session in December 2009. Unlike most other Canadian Youth Parliaments founded during the same time, TUXIS met continuously throughout the Great Depression and World War II. As a result, TUXIS has the longest uninterrupted history of annual sessions of any youth parliament in Canada.

Between 882 and 884 and under the mandate of King Alfonso III of Asturias, he was in charge of the repoblaci√≥n of Burgos and Ubierna. Shortly before 882, he built a castle in Pancorbo from where he confronted a large Arab army trying to annex the valley of the Ebro in two different military campaigns in 882 and 883.

It also appears he restored the episcopal see of Oca (ancient Auca).

The sediment is brown. The river is flowing on bedrock in the upper image, but because sediment was deposited over time the riverbed has risen. This has caused the house to be buried in the lower image. Aggradation (or alluviation) is the term used in geology for the increase in land elevation, typically in a river system, due to the deposition of sediment. Aggradation occurs in areas in which the supply of sediment is greater than the amount of material that the system is able to transport. The mass balance between sediment being transported and sediment in the bed is described by the Exner equation. Typical aggradational environments include lowland alluvial rivers, river deltas, and alluvial fans. Aggradational environments are often undergoing slow subsidence which balances the increase in land surface elevation due to aggradation. After millions of years, an aggradational environment will become a sedimentary basin, which contains the deposited sediment, including paleochannels and ancient floodplains. Aggradation can be caused by changes in climate, land use, and geologic activity, such as volcanic eruption, earthquakes, and faulting. For example, volcanic eruptions may lead to rivers carrying more sediment than the flow can transport: this leads to the burial of the old channel and its floodplain. In another example, the quantity of sediment entering a river channel may increase when climate becomes drier. The increase in sediment is caused by a decrease in soil binding that results from plant growth being suppressed. The drier conditions cause river flow to decrease at the same time as sediment is being supplied in greater quantities, resulting in the river becoming choked with sediment. In 2009, a report by researchers from the University of Colorado at Boulder in the journal Nature Geoscience said that reduced aggradation was contributing to an increased risk of flooding in many river deltas.

As of 2006, the school had an enrollment of 353. Until 1999, Harriman High School was part of the separate Harriman City School System, which was a legacy of the city's founding in the late nineteenth century as a planned community and \\"utopia\\" by temperance movement leaders from the northeastern U.S. and the East Tennessee Land Company. Harriman High came under the authority of the Roane County School System when taxpayers voted to stop paying for a separate system in 1999. Three previous votes on the topic had failed to surrender the system. Proponents of Harriman's separate system claimed the city long had better schools than its county neighbors; those in favor of surrender argued that the town's vanishing industrial base made paying for separate schools impractical. Harriman's campus is located at the intersection of Georgia and Roane Streets and its athletic teams compete in Richard Pickell Gymnasium, on Wallace-Black Field, and Sharieffa Barksdale Track. Harriman's mascot is the Blue Devil. Reportedly, an early member of the school board was an alumnus of Duke University, and used his alma mater's nickname for Harriman. The Blue Devils' historical rivals are the Tigers from Rockwood High School in Rockwood, Tennessee and the two share Tennessee's oldest football rivalries. In Tennessee high school football, the rivalry between Harriman and Rockwood is the state's oldest as the Blue Devils and Tigers have the state's longest consecutive running rivalry. Harriman and Rockwood started playing in 1921 and have played every year since 1924. The 2017 Season will mark the 98th time the teams have played. Notable alumni Harriman High School is the alma mater of: * U.S. Olympic hurdler Sharieffa Barksdale (1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games) * Former University of Tennessee football player Jeremaine Copeland, who starred on UT's 1998 National Championship team. Copeland led Harriman to a Class AA state basketball championship and an appearance in the Class AA state football title game during a time when Harriman was one of the state's smallest Class AA schools. Copeland was one of only 3 Harriman football players to go to an NCAA Division 1 program on scholarship.

The school enrolls approximately 450 students and is a nonsectarian institution. The school has both boarding and day students. History Founders Hall is the oldest campus building, completed in 1869 The Maine Central Institute was founded in 1866 by Rev. Oren B. Cheney and Rev. Ebenezer Knowlton, abolitionists who also founded Bates College in nearby Lewiston, Maine. The Maine State Seminary, originally part of Bates, served as a college preparatory school until it was dissolved in the late 1860s, and MCI (along with the Nichols Latin School in Lewiston) largely took the Seminary's place as a feeder school for Bates. The school was at its inception affiliated with the Free Will Baptists but is officially non-sectarian today. The first building, the Institute Building (Founders Hall), was completed in 1869 and served as the primary campus building until 1958. In 1882 an early case involving the school was appealed to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.Trustees of Maine Central Institute v. Haskell and executors of Going Hathorn 73 ME 140 (1882) https://books.google.com/books?id=8f42AQAAMAAJ The campus has expanded greatly over the past 140 years, and became officially coeducational in 1903 with the purchase of a boarding house from Benjamin Bowden and the construction of a second floor making it Ceder Croft Hall, which in 1927 burned down during a Christmas break. Immediately after, a fundraising campaign initiated by MCI alumni began with the intention to rebuild a residence hall. The dorm was completed in October 1928 and named Alumni Hall after the generous efforts from alumni. Due to World War I increasing enrollment in 1911 it became necessary to erect a female dormitory. The building today called Weymouth Hall houses the offices of Athletics and Activities, the Dean of Students and the Dean of Residential Life, as well as the television studio (WMCI), the Health and Wellness Center, the Campus Bookstore, the Student Union, and classrooms for MCI's prestigious ESL (English as a Second Language) program. Two athletic buildings have been built‚ÄîParks Gymnasium (still standing) which was finished in 1936 due to the MCI students' increased interest in athletics and in 1988 the construction of Wright Gymnasium which houses many of MCI's trophies and recognitions and a state of the art weight room and basketball court. The John W. Manson house was donated in 1944; since that date, it has been the residence of the head of school. In 1950 the William H. Powell Memorial Library was constructed with the donations of Ella Powell in the name of her late husband, Judge William H. Powell. Today the Powell library has over 8,000 nonfiction books, academic subscriptions, and a seminar room dedicated to the original donor of the library Ella Powell. Shortly after the construction of the Powell Library, the Cianchette Science building was erected in name of Joseph R. Cianchette a main financial contributor. In the 1960s two dormitories were built to supplement the increase in postgraduate students and their need for housing. Those buildings are currently named Rowe Hall (constructed in 1961) and Manson Hall (constructed in 1966). Today there are a total of three main residence halls, two male and one female. Rowe Hall and Manson Hall (both male) and under the supervision of Elbe Barker and Megan Thompson (respectively) and Alumni Hall (female) and under the supervision of Kelli Wescott McCannell. In 2000 work on the newest building‚Äîthe Chuck and Helen Cianchette Math and Science Center‚Äîwas finished. This building houses state of the art science labs and classrooms as well as the Headmaster's Office. The Institute has a nationally recognized athletic program and has produced many prominent NBA players. The team's best season was 1998, when they were undefeated (37 wins) and finished #1 in the USA Today polls. The team was led by McDonald's All-American Erick Barkley and future New England Prep player of the year Chris Foxworth. MCI traditions One of the longest- running traditions at MCI is the Manson Essay contest which dates back to 1871. This competition which has happened annually for more than 145 years has evolved into a competition between the entire junior class in which they need to complete a university-level research paper and then give a speech on the topic. Only a select few are given the title of \\"Manson Essay Finalists\\" and then have to perform their speeches in front of the community at the Annual Manson Essay Contest. Only one will achieve the coveted title of \\"Manson Essayist\\".

It comprises songs from their demo album, which was recorded in 1996 and 1997, but not officially released until 8 years later. It was nonetheless leaked onto the underground circuit and caused \\"quite a stir\\" in 1997. The whole album was produced by J Dilla. Many of the songs would later be revamped or re-conceived for their follow up album, Fantastic, Vol. 2 in 2000.  Overview  The album was recorded in 1996 and 1997 in J Dilla's home studio. Fan-Tas-Tic (Vol. 1) quickly became popular with fans of Detroit hip hop, when copies of the cassette were sold by the group at concerts, and also made available at Record Time on Gratiot. The record became highly sought after, with copies costing up to $50 at one point. Although, at the time Slum Village were hailed as successors to A Tribe Called Quest, Fan-Tas-Tic shares little in common with Tribe's earthy, cerebral brand of Hip hop. The lyrical content of the album, which dealt with acquiring wealth and the attention of women, later became commonplace among mainstream hip-hop artists. The group received much praise for their seemingly freestyled approach (which they later admitted to), and also for the production style of the then-upcoming producer Jay Dee, who subtly used low end frequencies, intricate basslines, and offbeat drums, behind the \\"tag-team\\" rhyming of his partners, T3 and Baatin.

It was located at 4885 Monterey Road and Branham Lane. The park was located on what is now Edenvale Garden Park, next to the Hayes Mansion, and was once part of the sprawling Hayes Family Estate. The park was built by Joseph Zukin, Jr. of Palo Alto, CA and largely designed by movie set designer Laurence Hollings Frontier Village Collection, San Jose Public Library California Room. Demise The Last Roundup poster, a poster representing all of the classic Hanna-Barbara characters leaving the village (the closure and abandonment of the park). In 1973 the part owner and co- creator of Frontier Village wanted to expand the park. Without the necessary funds to expand, he sold Frontier Village to Rio Grande Industries for US$1.7 million. The new owners were ready to start expansion but hit a road block with the surrounding residential neighborhood. When the park opened in 1961, it was surrounded by undeveloped land, but by 1973 the park was surrounded by urban sprawl. The new neighbors of Frontier Village didn't want any expansion and fought the park development plans. Lawsuits from nearby homeowners coupled with lower-than-expected park revenues, skyrocketing San Jose land values, and competition from nearby Marriott's Great America signaled the end for the little park. With the high property values, Rio Grande could make more money selling off the land to developers than it could by running the park. In 1980, the undeveloped land and Frontier Village were sold to a land developer, the Bren Company. They, in turn, held a public auction for all rides, buildings, and lumber that made up Frontier Village. On its final days, it held a special event titled \\"The Last Roundup\\". The park closed its gates for the last time on September 28, 1980. All the buildings were removed and San Jose's Edenvale Garden Park now exists at the former location of the amusement park. Little is recognizable from its days as an amusement park, but items such as concrete boulders from the artificial river remain half-buried. Some signage and ride vehicles have remained in the hands of private collectors, while other vehicles were stored at the nearby Happy Hollow Park & Zoo, to be sold later in 1980 at auction.

I-95 bypasses the Biddeford/Saco area, with a spur route, I-195, connecting to Old Orchard Beach. At Scarborough, I-95 meets the southern terminus of I-295 and narrows to four lanes. The highway turns north, serving the Portland International Jetport and bypassing Portland to the west. At Falmouth, the highway meets unsigned I-495, also called the Falmouth Spur. Until January 2004, I-95 followed the Falmouth Spur and I-295 between Falmouth and Gardiner. The highway continues north along the Maine Turnpike (which was I-495 prior to 2004) through Gray to Auburn and Lewiston, which the turnpike bypasses to the south. The highway then runs in an easterly direction to meet the northern terminus of I-295 at Gardiner. From there, I-95 parallels the Kennebec River past Augusta and Waterville. The highway then crosses the river at Fairfield and then turns northeast along the Sebasticook River past Pittsfield to Newport. I-95 then continues east alongside US 2 from Newport to Bangor, where I-395 connects to the city of Brewer. The highway runs along the northern edge of Bangor's center, then turns northeast, following the Penobscot River past Orono and Old Town (Prior to the early 1980s, I-95 was a super two highway north of Old Town). The highway continues north, still running near the river, towards Howland. Near Lincoln, I-95 runs north through uninhabited forest land, crossing the Penobscot River at Medway. The highway goes northeast and east, passing a series of small Aroostook County farming towns before reaching Houlton, where it connects to New Brunswick Route 95 and US 2 at the international border. North of Bangor, traffic levels drop noticeably, with AADT averaging only about 5,000 in northern Penobscot County and going down to as low as 2,000‚Äì4,000 in Houlton. As an Interstate Highway, all of I-95 in Maine is included in the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History Early postcard showing entrance at Kittery The Maine Turnpike Authority was created by the Maine Legislature in 1941 to build and operate a toll highway connecting Kittery and Fort Kent. In 1947, the first section of highway, designated the Maine Turnpike, opened between Kittery and Portland. In 1953, the Turnpike Authority began construction on an extension to the state capital at Augusta using the former right-of-way of the Portland‚ÄìLewiston Interurban railway from Portland through West Falmouth. The original turnpike was the largest construction project in the state's history until the construction of the extension, which opened to the public on December 13, 1955. The Maine Turnpike was the first highway funded using revenue bonds. It remains self-financed and does not receive funding from the state or federal government. When the first section opened in 1947, it was only the second long-distance superhighway in the United States following the October 1940 opening of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. For these reasons, the Maine Turnpike was named a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1999. In 1956, one year after the Portland-Augusta extension opened, Congress created the Interstate Highway System. The remaining sections to be built‚Äîfrom Augusta to Fort Kent‚Äîwould be publicly funded freeways instead of toll roads under the Maine Turnpike Authority. Today, this highway, which ends at Houlton instead of Fort Kent, is signed as Interstate 95 throughout and the Maine Turnpike between the New Hampshire line at Kittery and the junction with US 202 near Augusta. In 2015, the Maine Turnpike Authority purchased the segment from the Piscataqua River Bridge to MM 2.2 of I-95 from MaineDOT. =Speed limits= The Maine Turnpike had a posted speed limit of in the early 1970s, but as Maine then had no law against traveling less than over the posted limit, the de facto speed limit was . In 1974, as part of a federal mandate, the speed limit was reduced to , with a new law including a \\"less than 10 over\\" violation. In 1987, Congress allowed states to post on rural Interstate highways. Following the relaxation, Maine increased its speed limit. In May 2011, a bill was introduced to raise the speed limit on I-95 from Old Town to Houlton from to . It passed, with Maine the first state east of the Mississippi River since the 1970s to establish a speed limit. A further law passed in 2013 by the Maine Legislature allowed the Maine Department of Transportation and the Turnpike Authority to change speed limits with the approval of the Maine State Police. Per that law, Maine DOT increased the limit to on several sections of Interstate 95 on May 27, 2014. These areas included the section from mile marker 114 just outside Augusta to mile 126 just before Waterville. In addition, the section from Fairfield (just north of Waterville) to Bangor also saw an increase to . Speed limits on sections controlled by the Turnpike Authority increased on August 11, 2014. The sections from mile marker 2.1 in Kittery to mile marker 44.1 in Scarborough and the section from mile marker 52.3 in Falmouth to mile marker 109 in Augusta increased from to . The section from mile marker 44.1 in Scarborough to mile marker 52.3 in Falmouth increased from to . Tolls Early postcard of tollbooths at Kittery The Maine Turnpike is a toll road for all of its length except south of York and between Auburn and Sabattus. Flat-fee tolls are paid upon entering the turnpike and at toll barriers in York, New Gloucester, and West Gardiner. As of 2012, it costs passenger vehicles $7 with cash and $6.45 with a Maine issued E-ZPass to travel the entire length of the turnpike. The turnpike joined the E-ZPass electronic toll collection network in 2005, replacing the former Maine-only system designated Transpass that was implemented in 1997. The tolls on the Maine Turnpike were not supposed to be permanent. Toll collections were to stop once the Maine Turnpike Authority paid off the debt from the road's construction. In the 1980s the bonds were going to be paid off but the Maine Legislature authorized the Maine Turnpike Authority in 1982 to continue as a quasi-governmental agency and to continue to collect tolls in order to fund the maintenance of the section of highway controlled by the MTA. Service plazas and rest areas There are eleven total rest areas on I-95 in Maine, Five of which are full service plazas operated by the Maine Turnpike Authority. Five of the rest areas are accessible from northbound only, four are accessible from southbound only, and two are accessible from both directions. The rest stops are open 24 hours and all provide restrooms and visitor information. Food and Fuel services as well as ATMs are available only at the five major plazas. The plazas are at the following locations: * Kennebunk‚Äîa separate plaza is located on each direction of the turnpike at milepost 25. These plazas are the largest and most profitable in the state, and they have near-identical layouts and each includes Burger King, Starbucks, Hershey's Ice Cream, Citgo gas stations, and Z-Market gift shops among the offerings. The original plazas opened in 1947, and incorporated a pedestrian tunnel under the highway to connect the two. These original plazas were replaced in 1972, and the tunnel was sealed. The 1972 plazas were then replaced during the winter of 2006‚Äì2007, reopening in 2007. * Gray (northbound) and Cumberland (southbound)‚Äîa separate plaza is located on each direction of the turnpike on either side of the Gray‚ÄìCumberland town line at milepost 59. Each includes Burger King (both sit- down and drive-thru) and a Citgo gas station. Both plazas were rebuilt in 2007, and are currently the only two plazas to feature a drive-thru food option. * West Gardiner‚Äîaccessible from both directions of both the turnpike (I-95) and I-295, which converge together just north of the plaza. The plaza itself is located just off the highways, along SR 9 and SR 126\\\\. Similar in layout to the Kennebunk plazas, Burger King, Starbucks, and Citgo gas are among the offerings. This plaza also includes the Center for Maine Craft, a gift shop featuring locally made products and visitor information. The West Gardiner plaza was built and opened for business in 2008. The plaza replaced two smaller rest areas that were located in Lewiston (southbound at milepost 83) and Litchfield (northbound at milepost 98), both of which were closed and demolished. There is a rest area and tourist welcome center located on the turnpike northbound at milepost 3 in Kittery. There are weigh stations located on the turnpike northbound and southbound in York at milepost 4 (southbound) and milepost 6 (northbound). There are ramps to and from the northbound turnpike to the Saco Ramada Hotel and Conference Center in Saco at milepost 35. The ramps are from the original exit 5 which was replaced when I-195 was opened just to the north. The hotel was built on the site of the old toll plaza. Ramps connecting the hotel to and from the southbound turnpike were removed as part of the widening project in the early 2000s when hotel ownership opted not to pay nearly $1 million to build a new bridge. The Turnpike Authority is planning to reestablish the exit at this location by 2022 in order to relieve traffic congestion at the intersection of Interstate 195 and Industrial Park Road, which can often back up to Interstate 95. North of Augusta, there are two additional pairs of rest areas before I-95's northern terminus in Houlton. Separate facilities are located on each direction of I-95 in Hampden, just south of Bangor; and in Medway, about halfway between Bangor and Houlton. There are 24-hour restrooms at all four locations, while the Hampden facilities each feature a state-operated Maine information center available during daytime hours. A final rest area, which also contains a state-operated Maine information center, is located in Houlton, and is accessible from both directions of I-95 by taking exit 302. Emergency routes In 2019, MaineDOT began signing emergency routes along roads near I-95. The routes generally lead from one exit to the next exit and are meant to be used when sections of the highway must be closed due to an accident or other disruption. In such an event, electronic signs will be activated and flaggers deployed to direct drivers to use the appropriate emergency route to lead them around the closure and maintain traffic flow. Northbound routes are designated with a single letter, while southbound routes are designated with double letters. This system was first used when a section of highway was closed due to the death of a Maine State Trooper in an accident.

It is the third film in the Deathstalker tetralogy. Plot summary The film, which takes place in a fantasy setting, opens at a festival featuring Deathstalker and the wizard Nicias. Deathstalker once saved Nicias and the two go from village to village obtaining money by Nicias foretelling the future and showing his magic. During the festival, a hooded woman arrives to see Nicias. She is actually the princess Carissa bringing a magical stone hoping that Nicias has the other one, which when united, will at long last uncover the magical and rich city of Arandor of whom Nicias is the last of the city's descendants. Nicias does not possess the second stone, but knows it is south in Southland which is ruled by the evil sorcerer Troxartes. Troxartes has the second stone and wants the first so he can harness its power and rule more. The festival is attacked by Troxartes's black-clad right-hand man Makut and his horse soldiers looking for the stone. Amid the slaughter and chaos, Nicias teleports away while the princess is saved from capture by Deathstalker and the two escape. She is nonetheless killed by a few of the unknowing soldiers and passes the stone and knowledge on to Deathstalker. He travels to the hot and wooded Southland where he meets the twin sister of Carissa, the feisty Princess Elizena who was sent from the North to marry Troxartes. Makut is searching for Deathstalker now and finds him again so Deathstalker hides in Elizena's tent but is alerted by her after she sees he held her with a twig instead of a knife. He escapes into an impenetrable valley where he is given shelter by two wild women, Marinda and her mother. Marinda has sex with Deathstalker and then lead him to their horses so he can escape since Makut has entered the valley. The mother, outraged at Marinda's absence, leads Makut to the horses, but Deathstalker has escaped. Learning that he is up against Deathstalker, Troxartes uses his power to awaken all the dead foes he defeated to catch the ‚Äúlegend.‚Äù Elizena's guards were killed by Makut after he thought they were aiding Deathstalker. She accidentally meets Deathstalker who is camping in the woods. In the morning she leaves and is found by Troxartes who takes her back to his castle as his bride. Deathstalker trails them and infiltrates the castle by night, but is found by Troxartes himself who asks for the stone until Deathstalker is knocked unconscious and the stone retrieved. Troxartes figures out there is actually a third stone needed to harness the power so he puts his mistress to torture Deathstalker for the knowledge, but he escapes and ties her up. Heading for the stones, Nicias unknowingly teleports right near Troxartes in the castle who jovially captures him and intends to put him in his army if his magic cannot find the third stone. In the woods at night, Deathstalker finds Marinda and runs into a few of the undead warriors near a camp fire recognizing Gragas who was killed in a fair fight between Deathstalker earlier. They are forced to do Troxartes's bidding because their souls are kept secure in jars so Deathstalker makes a deal to get the jars if they will help him against Troxartes. He also tells Marinda to go alert the northern band to come help in the fight against the castle. Elizena learns she is just being kept alive until the third stone is found so she leads Deathstalker to where Nicias is being kept. The third stone is accidentally discovered to have been hidden in the castle all along. The northern band arrives and the souls are released by Deathstalker so the undead warriors turn on Troxartes and his band. In the ensuing battle, Makut is killed by an arrow during a duel between Deathstalker. Troxartes kills Marinda and is then killed by Deathstalker during the fight. The three stones are united at last and it reveals the secret city of Arandor and peace is brought to the land. Deathstalker rides off into the sunset for further adventures.

Reception  = Influence = This movie appeared on the seventh season of Mystery Science Theater 3000. In the episode, Mike Nelson, Tom Servo, and Crow T. Robot mock lead actor John Allen Nelson's inability to maintain a consistent accent throughout the film, as well as his character's irritating cockiness that causes them to root against him for most of the movie. They also ridicule Makut's helmet, which has enormous metal bat wings welded on each side. Thom Christopher's physical appearance and poor line delivery in the film also prove to be fodder for several jokes. At one point, Tom Servo comments that he cannot take an \\"arch nemesis who's 5'8\\" and bald\\" seriously. The wizard Nicias prompts numerous jokes as well, primarily The Lord of the Rings comments that compare his appearance to Gandalf, Saruman, and Radagast the Brown. The film's lame attempt at a battle scene prompted Nelson to say on two occasions, \\"This movie is like playing Doom when there's no monsters or opponents.\\" and \\"This is one of the most ambitiously bad movies we have ever done.\\" The episode's stinger (following the end credits) is Marinda's mother angrily declaring \\"Potatoes are what we eat!\\" The MST3K version of Deathstalker and the Warriors from Hell was included as part of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, Volume XXXV DVD collection, released by Shout! Factory on March 29, 2016.

He decided to attend the CIC's meeting in Geneva only after learning that both Albert Einstein and Henri Bergson would also be attending.  Biography  Benrubi was born in Thessaloniki, Ottoman Empire, in 1876. He came from an old family of rabbis, from the same Jewish community of Portuguese provenance, to which Spinoza belonged to in Amsterdam. He presented his thesis in German, under the direction of the great philosopher Eucken, on the \\"Moral ideal of J.J. Rousseau\\" (1904). According to Benrubi, Rousseau is the source of all German philosophy- from Kant to Nietzsche - and the spiritual father of the great poets Goethe, Schiller, and Holderlin. He studied philosophy and was educated in Jena, Berlin, and Paris (1898‚Äì1914). In 1904, he participated in the 2nd Congress of Philosophy in Geneva, where he stayed, teaching the history of European philosophy until his death. Between 1927 and 1933 he was appointed by the Prussian Government to teach French philosophy at Bonn, a job that he considered as a cultural mission for fostering the intellectual ties between France and Germany. In his work Benrubi tries to go beyond the agnosticism and timidity of modern philosophical reflection, to re-establish the bridge between the Self and the things, to abolish the dualism of speculative and practical thinking. The author attempts to exhibit the universe as a whole: terrestrial unity, solidarity of the living, the existence of a human race, united in its diversity, arriving in conclusion at a moral: Natural obligation of cosmic and human solidarity. In a second work, Benrubi studied at depth the great movements of moral philosophy in a manuscript of more than 600 pages, that is archived at the Biblioth√®que de Gen√®ve, in which the essential ideas of the sceptics, relativists and utilitarians are analyzed in detail and compared - from the Greek Sophists to Max Stirner and Herbert Spencer, passing through Montaigne, Blaise Pascal, La Rochefoucauld, and Helv√©tius, among others (J.

Since 2006 Fox prefers hiring national play-by-play announcers who work more than one sport.. =National Football League= During football seasons past, Lewin served as both a sideline reporter and play-by-play man for Fox NFL and called NFL games for SportsUSA/Jones Radio. From 2005 to 2016, he was the radio voice of the San Diego Chargers (he left after the team's move to Los Angeles at the end of the 2016 season).http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/chargers/sd-sp-chargers- radio-josh-lewin-20170605-story.html On August 26, 2006, Lewin provided television play-by-play for Fox Sports' Fox Saturday Baseball game of the week between the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. That game took place at Angel Stadium of Anaheim. When the game was over, he traveled 90 miles down to Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego to provide radio play-by-play coverage of the San Diego Chargers' NFL preseason game against the Seattle Seahawks for the Chargers Radio Network. The two games announced in one day was similar to Ted Leitner's time as announcer for both the Chargers and the San Diego Padres when he would broadcast a Chargers game then travel to join the Padres broadcast late in the baseball season. =National Hockey League= Lewin has also subbed in as the Dallas Stars play-by-play man when Dallas' usual lead voice, Ralph Strangis, was recovering from a car accident in 2003. He also did play-by-play for Fox NHL Saturday in 1998 and FSN Detroit's coverage of CCHA hockey. =The Josh and Elf Show= On October 29, 2010, it was announced that Lewin would be moving to 105.3 The Fan to host a new show in their 11am‚Äì2pm time slot. The new show started on November 1, 2010, with Greg Williams and Richie Witt moving their show to the 2pm‚Äì7pm slot. On Monday, November 29, 2010, it was announced Mark \\"Elf\\" Elfenbein would be joining the show now named The Josh and Elf Show. Following Lewin's hiring by the New York Mets and departure from The Fan, Elf and friends was launched. Numerous personalities tried out to fill Lewin's spot. He would eventually be replaced by Jane Slater, making it The Elf and Slater Show. =College football= Lewin is employed by the Big Ten Network calling football games. He also has called Conference USA football on Sports USA as well. On June 2, 2016, he was hired to be the play-by-play announcer for the UCLA Bruins football team. =College basketball= Lewin also calls collegiate basketball with UCLA, Sports USA, Fox Sports Networks and formerly with the SMU Mustangs and Michigan State Spartans.

The unit was established under the denomination of Special Combat Teams in 1978, when Argentina hosted the Football World Cup. Ten years later, in 1988, the division changed its name to Police Operations Group and officially became the premier counter-terrorism team of the Federal Police. In 1994 the GEOF was created and the GE-1 dramatically reduced its size, although some elements remained still functional. The Superintendent of Metropolitan Security re- activated the unit in 2002. The group quickly became an elite tactical force, with more than 400 successful tactical interventions. All GE-1 officers must pass a rigorous, extensive training course before he/she apply to join. It is important to know that all active personnel remains in their original unit and are called when needed, a selective style similar to many American SWAT groups. The division constantly trains with similar Argentine and foreign special units. The group uses specialized weapons and gear such as the Glock 17 9mm pistol, Heckler & Koch HK33 assault rifles, Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine gun, and the M24 SWS sniper rifle.

There are accounts of this event in the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and John, but it is not included in the Gospel of Luke. This story, following the miracle of the feeding of the five thousand, tells how Jesus sent the disciples by ship back to the \\"other side\\" of the Sea of Galilee (the western side) while he remained behind, alone, to pray. Night fell and the sea arose as the ship became caught in a wind storm. After rowing against the wind for most of the night, the disciples saw Jesus walking on the water. They were frightened, thinking that they were seeing a spirit, but when Jesus told them not to be afraid, they were reassured. After Jesus entered the ship, the wind ceased, and they arrived at land. Biblical narrative Jesus walking on water in stained glass, St Giles' Cathedral The story of Jesus walking on water as most pictures is from the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and John; it is not in the Gospel of Luke. This episode is narrated towards the end of the Ministry of Jesus in Galilee before the key turning points halfway through the gospel narratives where Peter proclaimed Jesus as Christ and saw the Transfiguration.The Life and Ministry of Jesus: The Gospels by Douglas Redford 2007 pages 189‚Äì207 In all three gospels it follows the feeding of the five thousand, where Jesus had withdrawn by ship to a desert place \\"belonging to\\" Bethsaida after hearing of the death of John the Baptist, but was followed by the crowds who travelled on foot.Steven L. Cox, Kendell H Easley, 2007, HCSB Harmony of the Gospels, B&H; Publishing Group, pages 270‚Äì272 At the end of the evening, the disciples boarded a ship to cross to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, without Jesus who went up the mountain to pray alone. John alone specifies they were headed \\"toward Capernaum\\". During the journey on the sea, the disciples were distressed by wind and waves, but saw Jesus walking towards them on the sea. John's Gospel specifies that they were five or six kilometers away from their departure point. The disciples were startled to see Jesus, but he told them not to be afraid. Matthew's account adds that Peter asked Jesus, \\"if it is you\\", to tell him, or command him, to come to Jesus on the water (waters)., ta hydata is plural, see Englishman's Concordance According to the Pulpit Commentary, the word 'if' is not intended to imply any doubt on Peter's part.Pulpit Commentary on Matthew 14, accessed 19 January 2017 After Peter came down out of the ship and walked on the water, he became afraid of the storm and began to sink. He called out to Jesus for help. Jesus caught him and reproved him for his lack of faith, and led him back to the ship, whereupon the storm stopped. Matthew also notes that the disciples called Jesus the Son of God. The fact that the John account also lacks this detail suggests that this account of \\"St. Peter's venture\\" Pulpit Commentary on Matthew 14, accessed 19 January 2017 is a redactional addition by Matthew.Rachel Nicholls, Walking on the Water: Reading Mt. 14:22‚Äì33 in the Light of Its Wirkungsgeschichte (BRILL, 2008) page 45. In all three accounts, after Jesus got into the ship, the wind ceased and they reached the shore. Only John's account has their ship immediately reach the shore. Matthew's and Mark's accounts end at this point, but John mentions that the next day some people from the other side of the sea that looked for Jesus, noted that the disciples left without him, but they didn't know where he went. When they came to Capernaum and asked Jesus how he came there, instead of answering the question, he told the crowd that they followed him, not because they had seen signs, but because of the free loaves they had eaten the day before, and he advised them not to seek earthly gains, but aim for a life based on higher spiritual values.Jack Dean Kingsbury, Mark Allan Powell, David R. Bauer, 1999 Who do you say that I am?: essays on Christology, Westminster John Knox Press, , page 83  Interpretations  Christ walking on the sea, by Am√©d√©e Varint =Christian teachings= The walking on the sea episode has specific interpretations within Christian teachings and has been viewed by scholars as important due to its perceived impact on the formation of Christian ecumenical creeds, as discussed below. One aspect of the pericope (passage) is how it highlights the relationship between Jesus and his apostles. Merrill Tenney states that the incident is in essence centered on that aspect, rather than their peril or the miracle itself.Tenney, Merrill Chapin (1997) John: Gospel of Belief, , p. 114 Dwight Pentecost and John Danilson state that this miracle was deliberately designed by Jesus to instruct his apostles and increase their faith. David Cook and Craig Evans note that \\"of little faith\\" is a somewhat common expression in Matthew (e.g. 8:26 when calming the storm or 16:8 regarding bread and the Pharisees just before the Confession of Peter) and may mean \\"of no faith\\".Cook, David C.; Evans, Craig A. (2003) Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke, , p. 303 Richard Cassidy states that this episode sheds special light on the position of Peter who had faith in Jesus and acknowledged Jesus' extraordinary powers, and by considering to walk on water himself, wanted to share in the act of Jesus before the other disciples for he considered himself closest to Jesus.Cassidy, Richard J. (2007) Four Times Peter: Portrayals of Peter in the Four Gospels And at Philippi, , p. 70‚Äì73 Cook and Evans note that the \\"Lord Save me\\" cry of Peter is similar to and in the calming the storm episode and again emphasizes the reliance of the disciples on Jesus. Cook and Evans also echo Pentecost's interpretation that the detail regarding \\"many stadia away\\" and \\"battered by the waves\\" were intended to emphasize that Jesus could walk on the water far away from the shore, on a rough sea, thus establishing his dominance over nature. R.T. France has also pointed out that the details regarding the boat being a long way from the shore, and the portrayal of Peter sinking are intended as a confirmation of the depth of the water. Scholars such as Ulrich Luz and separately Dale Allison view the pericope as instrumental in asserting the divinity of Jesus among early Christians.Bruner, Frederick Dale (2004) Matthew: The Churchbook, Matthew 13‚Äì28, Eerdmans, , pp. 74‚Äì76 Alan Robinson sees the pericope as important in establishing the belief in the early Church that the disciples viewed Jesus as the Son of God.Robinson, Alan (2005) The Apostles' Creed: God's special revelation, , p. 35‚Äì36 Dale Allison states that Matthew's presentation emphasizes that God the Father is willing to share divine power with his son and that the impact of this pericope on the affirmation of the divinity of Jesus in the ecumenical creeds is undeniable.Allison, Dale C. (2005) Matthew: A Shorter Commentary, A&C; Black, , p. 244 =Historical-critical analysis= Fran√ßois Boucher Cath√©drale Saint- Louis (1766) Versailles The beach of the Sea of Galilee, in Israel Scholars who hold that the story records actual events do so on the basis that Jesus, as Son of God, was above the laws of nature; or, in a variation, that Jesus projected an image himself while actually remaining on the shore. The meaning of the episode is held to be inherent in its miraculous nature: \\"The meaning of the pericope (story) ... only has meaning ... if it is understood as relating a miraculous event which really took place\\" (Leopold Sabourin, 1975). In recent scholarship, Bart Ehrman has championed the view that in general, it is impossible to either prove or disprove supernatural events such as miracles using the historical method, for proving them would require belief in a supernatural world not amenable to historical analysis, and disproving them would require historical evidence that is usually hard to come by.Ehrman, Bart D. (2008 )A Brief Introduction to the New Testament, , p. 141 Still, some scholars have held the view that while this event took place, it was not miraculous: Albert Schweitzer, for example, suggested that the disciples saw Jesus walking on the shore, but were confused by high wind and darkness; some scholars who accept this \\"misperception thesis\\" argue that Mark originally wrote that Jesus walked on the seashore rather than on the sea, and that John had a more accurate version. Others have held that the entire episode is a \\"pious legend\\" (B.H. Branscomb, 1937), based perhaps on some lost incident; perhaps Jesus waded through the surf (Vincent Taylor, 1957), or perhaps he walked on a sand bar (Sherman Johnson, 1972, J.D.M. Derrett, 1981). Finally are those scholars who regard the story as an example of \\"creative symbolism\\", or myth, which probably was understood by a part of the audience literally and by others allegorically. Rudolf Bultmann pointed out that the sea-walking theme is familiar in many cultures. Furthermore, the motif of walking on water was associated with kings like Xerxes or Alexander, but also rejected and satirized as humanly impossible and as proverbial for the arrogance of the rulers by Menander, Dio Chrysostom or in 2 Maccabees 5:21.Adela Yarbro Collins: Mark: a commentary. Minneapolis, Fortress Press, 2007, p. 328-333. . Others look for an origin in the mythic world of the Old Testament itself (Christ's victory over the waters paralleling Yahweh's defeat of the primeval Sea, representing Chaos), or within the New Testament, as an originally simple story later embellished with Hellenistic and Old Testament details. In the Hebrew Bible, God gives power over the sea, e.g. to Moses (Ex 14:21‚Äì29) or to Elijah (2 kg 2:8). Adela Yarbro Collins concludes that the text characterizes Jesus as Messiah and king of Israel endowed with divine properties. =Literary-critical analysis= Biblical scholar George W. Young dismisses the naturalistic explanations, the traditional and the historical critical perspectives. He contends that these methods of exegesis rely on factual interpretations and fail to capture the full meaning of the text based on its structure. Instead, Young explores the pericope with literary-critical methods as narrative art. Young views the text as fiction, and uses tools and terms often associated with fantastic literature to analyze it. Young analyses the pericope as the expression of three entangled, conflicting perspectives on reality: (i) the \\"conventional reality\\" based on sensory perception; (ii) the \\"impossible\\" vision of Jesus resulting in the astonishment of the observers; (iii) the narrator's metaphysical comment in Mark 6:52 identifying Jesus as the Son of God. The earliest biblical references to Jesus, like the Pauline letters, do not mention miracles like walking on water. This miracle is introduced in the gospels. Some other deities in mythologies older than the Bible were said to walk on water, for example the Greek god Orion. =Gospel of Mark (c. 66‚Äì70 AD)= =Gospel of Matthew (c. 80‚Äì90 AD)= =Gospel of John (c. 90‚Äì100 AD)= .

She was also the younger sister of former President of the United States Theodore Roosevelt and an aunt of future First Lady of the United States, Eleanor Roosevelt. Early years Corinne Roosevelt was born on September 27, 1861, at 28 East 20th Street in New York City, the fourth and youngest child of businessman/philanthropist Theodore \\"Thee\\" Roosevelt Sr. and socialite Martha Stewart \\"Mittie\\" Bulloch. Her siblings were Anna (called \\"Bamie\\" or \\"Bye\\"), Theodore Jr. (who became president), and Elliott (the father of future First Lady of the United States Anna Eleanor Roosevelt). As an Oyster Bay Roosevelt Corinne was a descendant of the Schuyler family.Brogan, Hugh and Mosley, Charles American Presidential Families October 1993, page 568 She received most of her education from private tutors. Corinne was best friends with Edith Kermit Carow, her brother T.R.'s second wife and later the First Lady of the United States. Theodore Sr. was a supporter of the North during the Civil War, while Mittie supported the South. Mittie's home state was Georgia, and she had moved to New York only because of her marriage to Theodore. Mittie's brothers were members of the Confederate Navy. However, the conflict between Corinne's parents' political loyalties did not prevent her from experiencing a privileged childhood, including the best schools and regular travel, or the formal debut into society expected of the daughters of prominent families.  Career  Robinson began writing at an early age, through the encouragement of her friends, in particular Edith Wharton who helped critique her poetry. In 1911, Robinson published her first poem, \\"The Call of Brotherhood\\", in Scribner's Magazine. Her first book of poems of the same title was published in 1912. This volume was quickly followed by One Woman to Another and Other Poems (1914) dedicated to her daughter, also named Corinne, commemorating the loss of Robinson's brother Elliott and son, Stewart. Other volumes of poetry by Robinson include Service and Sacrifice (1919) dedicated to her brother Theodore Roosevelt, The Poems of Corinne Roosevelt Robinson (1924), and Out of Nymph (1930) dedicated to Charles Scribner. She also wrote the prose memoir My Brother Theodore Roosevelt (1924). =Political career= Robinson was a member of the executive committee of the Republican National Committee and the New York State Republican Committee. During the election of 1920, Robinson became the first woman ever called upon to second the nomination of a national party convention candidate; speaking before a crowd of 14,000, she endorsed General Leonard Wood as the 1920 Republican candidate for president. After Wood lost the nomination to Harding, Robinson came out strongly for Harding and his vice-presidential candidate, Calvin Coolidge. In the 1924 election, she served as a member of Coolidge's advisory committee. Also in 1924, she wrote a letter to The New York Times commenting on the election loss of her nephew, Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., for Governor of New York. Despite being a prominent Republican, Corinne voted for her fifth cousin and nephew-in-law Franklin when he ran for Governor of New York in 1928, and in 1932 when he was elected President of the United States. During the 1932 election, she declined the designation of a Republican elector-at-large, and wrote to Franklin saying that she had refused to take an active part in the campaign. She also stated that: > You must understand why I cannot comment on the national campaign. My own > beloved niece is the wife of the Democratic candidate. She is the daughter > of the brother who was nearer to me in age than Theodore. For her I have the > deepest affection and respect. So, much as I would like to pay the highest > tribute to President Hoover, I cannot do so in this campaign.  Personal life  On April 29, 1882, she married Douglas Robinson Jr. (1855‚Äì1918), son of Douglas Robinson Sr. and Frances (n√©e Monroe) Robinson at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. Robinson's maternal grandfather, James Monroe (1799‚Äì1870), a member of the House of Representatives, was a nephew of U.S. President James Monroe (1758‚Äì1831). Their marriage produced four children: * Theodore Douglas Robinson (1883‚Äì1934), a member of the New York State Senate who married his distant cousin, Helen Rebecca Roosevelt (1881‚Äì1962), daughter of James Roosevelt \\"Rosey\\" Roosevelt (1854‚Äì1927) and Helen Schermerhorn Astor (1855‚Äì1893) of the Astor family, and half-niece of Franklin Delano Roosevelt * Corinne Douglas Robinson (1886‚Äì1971), a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives. * Monroe Douglas Robinson (1887‚Äì1944) * Stewart Douglas Robinson (1889‚Äì1909), who died after falling out of his college dormitory window after sustaining a head injury at a party. Throughout the 1920s, Robinson's health failed her a number of times and she had a total of sixteen eye surgeries. Robinson died on February 17, 1933, age 71, of pneumonia, in New York City, less than a month before Franklin was inaugurated as President. Her funeral was held at St. Bartholomew's Protestant Episcopal Church and was attended by more than 1,000 people, including President-elect Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt, Sara Roosevelt, Anna Roosevelt, and Curtis B. Dall. The bulk of her estate was divided among her three surviving children with smaller bequests made to grandchildren, nephews, friends and institutions. She left all real and personal property she had received from her uncle, Cornelius V. S. Roosevelt to her daughter, Corrine. The household furniture, residue of the property, including $30,000 left to her by another uncle, James King Gracie (1840‚Äì1903), was to be shared equally among her children. A portrait of Harriet Douglas (1790‚Äì1872), sister-in-law of James Monroe, painted by Sir William Beechey, was left to her grandson, Douglas Robinson (1906-1964), of whom Harriet was his great-great-great aunt. A memorial was held for her by the Women's Roosevelt Memorial Association, of which she was a director, at Roosevelt House at 28 East 20th Street. The benediction was pronounced by the Rev. Dr. Henry Sloane Coffin. The Association also planned a memorial fund in her honor to augment the Roosevelt endowment fund for the preservation of the Roosevelt House. In 1942, two oriental plane trees were planted in front of the Roosevelt House and dedicated to the memory of Anna Roosevelt Cowles and Corinne. =Residences and clubs= Robinson, who was born at the Roosevelt House at 28 East 20th Street in New York City, had her own home in New York City at 147 East 61st Street, as well as a country home called Gelston Castle in Mohawk near Jordanville, New York where she cultivated her interest in flowers. In 1925, she leased her former home, 422 and 424 Madison Avenue, a five-story building adjoining the southwest corner of 49th Street, to Bernard A. Ottenberg and Roy Foster for a period of 80 years with annual rent of about $25,000 a year for the first 20 years. At the time, the entire building was occupied by the Braus Art Galleries. After the expiration of the Braus lease, the new lessees planned to construct a nine-story store and loft building with foundations for twelve to fifteen stories. She was a member of the Colony Club, Cosmopolitan Club, Women's National Republican Club, Town Hall Club, MacDowell Club and Essex Country Club. =Descendants= Robinson was the grandmother of columnists Joseph Wright Alsop V (1910‚Äì1989) and Stewart Johonnot Oliver Alsop (1914‚Äì1974).

History  The town of Townsville's early newspaper was The Cleveland Bay Herald and Northern Pioneer which came into existence on 3 March 1866, which was soon renamed as the Cleveland Bay Express, and later became the Townsville Herald. The Townsville Bulletin was then established on 5 September 1881 by Edward Rhode, John Kiley Mehan (‚Äì1941) and Dodd Smith Clarke (‚ÄìJuly 1918). Rhode, Mehan, and Clarke had previously started a newspaper in Cairns. Co-founder and first editor Clarke was credited as 'mainly instrumental through his brilliant writings in making the venture the success it proved'. It was priced at three pence, a 50% reduction on that of the two other local newspapers, and became a daily publication on 1 January 1883. Out of this, the North Queensland Bulletin was launched as a weekly journal by mid-1883. With the formation of the Townsville Newspaper Company in 1884, the Townsville Herald was acquired, and later merged into the Bulletin. It would appear as the North Queensland Herald. The Bulletin offices were first in a premises on the eastern side of Stoke Street, before moving to a larger premises at south-eastern corner of Flinders and Stanley Streets from 1887 to 1896. The company then moved to the south-western corner of the intersection, until November 1908 when they moved further west on Flinders Street to a two-story building. Prior to air conditioning systems, the building was selected for cool air flow, and had installed an electric fan system. The original newspaper was printed on a double demy Albion hand press, followed about 1883 by a gas engine powering a small single feeder Inglis machine ‚Äì which printed two pages at a time, resulting in 250 newspapers an hour ‚Äì before settling on a Cox Duplex rotary self-feeding and folding machine, able to turn out 1000 eight-page broadsheet by 1909. Electricity had also been installed, but with gas lighting maintained in case of emergency. Staffing-wise, the 1881 start saw three proprietors and a boy; by 1909, eight staff had over twenty years service with the company. A fire of the premises on 18 October 1912 destroyed much of the newspaper's early records. Described as completely gutted other than for the strong-room, insurance amounts totalled ¬£13,680. The newspaper continued for the moment between the Evening Star and Northern Miner offices. The Bulletin was later amalgamated with The Northern Miner, and in 1940, it incorporated The Townsville Evening Star. Modern era In 1984, the Townsville Daily Bulletin was acquired by News Corp Australia and renamed as the Townsville Bulletin. The newspaper chartered a Boeing 747 to take North Queensland fans to the 2005 NRL grand final, the Cowboys' first. It was awarded News Limited's Regional Newspaper of the Year in 2009.

Barton is the current CEO of Zillow, Inc. Business model Zillow has stated that it is a media company that generates revenue by selling advertising on its web site. In April 2009, Zillow announced a partnership to lend its real estate search engine to the web sites of more than 180 United States newspapers as a part of the Zillow Newspaper Consortium. Zillow shares advertising revenue from the co-branded sites with the newspapers and extends its reach into local markets. In February 2011, Zillow and Yahoo! Real Estate launched an exclusive partnership creating the largest real-estate advertising network on the web, according to comScore Media Metrix. Zillow now allows renters to pay rent online to their landlords for properties on the Zillow Rental Manager tool. Zillow charges renters a transaction fee when using Debit or Credit Cards to pay their landlord. However, Renters also have a no-fee option to pay their rent by using ACH. In 2018, Zillow Group began operations as a blanket referral fee network without an upfront cost called Zillow Flex. Once a broker closes a home transaction with a client, they pay a referral fee out of escrow to Zillow. In areas where Flex partner brokers operate alongside brokers who pay for Zillow Premier Agent upfront, leads and connections flow through the same system and are allocated randomly to partner brokers. Blanket referral fees paid to Zillow Group are not disclosed to consumers, but likely range anywhere between 30‚Äì40% of the entire broker's commission. The main qualification for real estate brokers who participate with Zillow Flex Program is their willingness to pay a blanket referral fee once the transaction is complete.  History  Barton got the inspiration for funding Zillow when he was working at Microsoft and he realized that the real estate industry would be transformed. In December 2004, Zillow was founded. Zillow's website was launched in February 2006. In 2010, Spencer Rascoff was named CEO of the company. Barton stayed as executive chairman. In April 2018, Zillow entered the on-demand home buying market with Zillow Offers. In February 2019, Barton returned as CEO to lead the transition. In 2018, Zillow signed a partnership with Century 21 Canada to begin listing Canadian properties on the site, marking the first country outside the United States to be covered by the company. In February 2020, Zillow's stock was up 18 percent after going down by four years. In March of the same year, the CEO of Zillow announced a cut in expenses by 25%, and stopped hiring due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Website features Zillow has data on approximately 110 million homes across the United States. The company offers several features including value estimates of homes, value changes of each home in a given time frame, aerial views of homes, and prices of comparable homes in the area. It also provides basic information on a given home, such as square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Users can also get estimates of homes that have undergone significant changes, such as a remodeled kitchen. In December 2006, Zillow launched features allowing users to post homes for sale and set a \\"Make Me Move\\" price (an informal way to pre- market a home), as well as a real estate wiki. That same year, Zillow teamed with Microsoft to offer a feature in Microsoft Virtual Earth that shows aerial photographs. In December 2009, Zillow expanded its listings to include rental homes. In late 2013, Zillow began powering AOL Real Estate. In July 2014, Zillow also took over the real estate portal for MSN Real Estate. In October 2017, Zillow announced to add 3D tours to get 360-degree photos of houses they're interested in buying or renting. In July 2018, Zillow released a tool for prospective renters to submit a credit check and eviction history report to landlords. The company reportedly had 36 million unique visitors in January 2019. =Zillow Mortgage Marketplace= On April 3, 2008, Zillow launched a service called Zillow Mortgage Marketplace. This service allows for borrowers to get custom loan quotes without revealing personally identifying information. =Zillow Mobile= Zillow Mobile apps allow users to view nearby homes based on the user's location. *April 29, 2009 - iPhone application * March 18, 2010 - Android application *April 2, 2010 - iPad application * March 31, 2011 - Blackberry application * July 13, 2012 - Windows Phone application (Not updated since initial release as of 2015-03-26.

The reports identify market trends including, but not limited to: five and 10-year annualized change, negative equity, short sales and foreclosure transactions. Zillow also releases a Homeowner Confidence Survey. The survey is conducted by Harris Interactive and measures homeowners' perceptions about home value changes of their own home and the local market. =Neighborhood boundary maps (GIS data)= The Zillow data team has created a database of nearly 7,544 neighborhood boundaries in the largest cities in the U.S. and made them available via Creative Commons Attribute-Sharealike license. Zestimate Zillow determines an estimate, also known as a \\"Zestimate,\\" for a home based on a range of publicly available information, including sales of comparable houses in a neighborhood. According to Zillow, the Zestimate is a starting point in determining a home's value. The accuracy of the Zestimate varies by location depending on how much information is publicly available, but Zillow allows users to check the accuracy of Zestimates in their own region against actual sales. In March 2011, Zillow released Rent Zestimates, which provide estimated rent prices for 90 million homes. On June 14, 2011, Zillow changed its algorithm used to calculate Zestimates. In addition to changing the current Zestimate for millions of homes throughout the country, Zillow changed historical Zestimate value information dating back to 2006. Critique of Zestimate accuracy In 2007, The Wall Street Journal studied the accuracy of Zillow's estimates and found that they \\"often are very good, frequently within a few percentage points of the actual price paid. But when Zillow is bad, it can be terrible.\\"Hagerty, James R. \\"How Good Are Zillow's Estimates?\\", The Wall Street Journal, 2007-02-14. Retrieved on 2009-02-25. In October 2006, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission\\"Federal Trade Commission Complaint\\" stating that Zillow was \\"intentionally misleading consumers and real-estate professionals to rely upon the accuracy of its valuation services despite the full knowledge of the company officials that their valuation Automated Valuation Model (AVM) mechanism is highly inaccurate and misleading.\\" In a letter dated May 4, 2007, the FTC elected not to investigate this complaint, which was later withdrawn by the NCRC. Using data published on the Zillow website, the typical Zestimate error in the United States in July 2016 was $14,000. Controversy and lawsuits While factors contributing to estimates are described elsewhere, Zillow seemingly overemphasises home square footage as the major metric driving property valuation. This method may not be unique to Zillow, but unduly distorts value expectations. Listings in areas where land is priced at high premiums often reflect an identical Zillow Estimate to that of nearby homes with comparable interior square footage, but where the home might be decades older. Condition, age of home, special features, proximity to nuisances are insufficiently factored into the estimate. Zillow has made some effort to add balance by including option for owners to provide their own value estimate; but, these figures can be similarly unreliable as being opinion instead of quantifiable. In 2014, Zillow faced several lawsuits from former employees at the Zillow operation in Irvine, California, alleging violations of California Labor Code and California Business and Professions Code. On February 26, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California certified the class to include anyone who worked as an inside sales consultant at Zillow between November 2010 and January 2015. Among the numerous allegations brought by high-profile attorneys Bobby Samini and Mark Geragos, Zillow is accused of failing to pay wages, failing to pay overtime pay, and failing to provide meal and rest breaks. Zillow responded that \\"the narrative being pushed by this law firm through their multiple lawsuits is completely inconsistent with those who know and work with Zillow...the behavior described does not accurately depict our culture or the 1,200 Zillow employees.\\" In addition, Samini and Geragos represented a former Zillow employee in a sexual harassment action against the company, alleging \\"sexual torture\\" and \\"the most heinous acts of sexual harassment imaginable\\". According to the lawsuit, Zillow's Southern California office represents an \\"adult frat house where sexual harassment and misconduct are normalized, condoned, and promoted by male managers.\\" Based on the allegations against the company, Samini has called Zillow a \\"modern day Animal House.\\" On May 5, 2016, Zillow settled the action for an undisclosed amount, without admitting any wrongdoings. In 2017, Zillow sent a cease and desist letter to Kate Wagner, the author of McMansion Hell, a blog that lampooned the presentations of ostentatious homes found on the site. Wagner was represented by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Zillow later released a statement saying they had \\"decided against moving forward with legal action\\" on the matter.

It is located on two hills overlooking the River Ardila, a tributary of the Guadiana, 12 miles east of the Portuguese border. The old town is surrounded by a Moorish wall with six gates. The newer portion is well built, and has numerous orange and other fruit trees. Its main industry is in agricultural production, especially in ham and bacon from herds of swine which are reared in the surrounding oak forests. The town is said to have been founded by Alfonso IX of Leon in 1229; in 1232 it was extended by his son Ferdinand III the Saint, who gave it to the Knights Templar. Hence the name Jerez de los Caballeros, Jerez of the Knights. Jerez de los Caballeros is the birthplace of the explorers Hernando de Soto and Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa. On 10 May 1539, Hernando de Soto wrote in his will: \\"That a chapel be erected within the Church of San Miguel in Jerez de los Cabelleros, Spain, where De Soto grew up, at a cost of 2,000 ducats, with an altarpiece featuring the Virgin Mary, Our Lady of the Conception, that his tomb be covered in a fine black broadcloth topped by a red cross of the Order of the Knights of Santiago, and on special occasions a pall of black velvet with the De Soto coat of arms be placed on the altar; that a chaplain be hired at the salary of 12,000 maravedis to perform five masses every week for the souls of De Soto, his parents and wife; that thirty masses be said for him the day his body was interred, and twenty for our Lady of the Conception, ten for the Holy Ghost, sixty for souls in purgatory and masses for many others as well; that 150000 maravedis be given annually to his wife Isabel for her needs and an equal amount used yearly to marry off three orphan damsels...the poorest that can be found,\\" who would then assist his wife and also serve to burnish the memory of De Soto as a man of charity and substance. However, De Soto ended up dead in the house of an Indian chief at the headwaters of the Arkansas River near present-day McArthur, Arkansas, and died an impoverished defeated man, with \\"four Indian slaves, three horses and 700 hogs\\".Davidson, James West.

In computer science, garbage includes data, objects, or other regions of the memory of a computer system (or other system resources), which will not be used in any future computation by the system, or by a program running on it. Because every computer system has a finite amount of memory, and most software produces garbage, it is frequently necessary to deallocate memory that is occupied by garbage and return it to the heap, or memory pool, for reuse. Classification Garbage is generally classified into two types: syntactic garbage, any object or data which is within a program's memory space but unreachable from the program's root set; and semantic garbage, any object or data which is never accessed by a running program for any combination of program inputs. Objects and/or data which are not garbage are said to be live. Casually stated, syntactic garbage is data that cannot be reached, and semantic garbage is data that will not be reached. More precisely, syntactic garbage is data that is unreachable due to the reference graph (there is no path to it), which can be determined by many algorithms, as discussed in Tracing garbage collection, and only requires analyzing the data, not the code. Semantic garbage is data that will not be accessed, either because it is unreachable (hence also syntactic garbage), or is reachable but will not be accessed; this latter requires analysis of the code, and is in general an undecidable problem. Syntactic garbage is a (usually strict) subset of semantic garbage, as it is entirely possible for an object to hold a reference to another object without ever using that object. Example In the following simple stack implementation in Java, each element popped from the stack becomes semantic garbage once there are no outside references to it: public class Stack { private Object[] elements; private int size; public Stack(int capacity) { elements = new Object[capacity]; } public void push(Object e) { elements[size++] = e; } public Object pop() { return elements[--size]; } } This is because \`elements[]\` still contains a reference to the object, but the object will never be accessed again through this reference, because \`elements[]\` is private to the class and the \`pop\` method only returns references to elements it has not already popped. (After it decrements \`size\`, this class will never access that element again.) However, knowing this requires analysis of the code of the class, which is undecidable in general. If a later \`push\` call re-grows the stack to the previous size, overwriting this last reference, then the object will become syntactic garbage, because it can never be accessed again, and will be eligible for garbage collection. =Automatic garbage collection= An example of the automatic collection of syntactic garbage, by reference counting garbage collection, can be produced using the Python command-line interpreter: >>> class Foo(object): ... \\"\\"\\"This is an empty testing class.\\"\\"\\" ... pass ... >>> bar = Foo() >>> bar <__main__.Foo object at 0x54f30> >>> del bar In this session, an object is created, its location in the memory is displayed, and the only reference to the object is then destroyed‚Äîthere is no way to ever use the object again from this point on, as there are no references to it. This becomes apparent when we try to access the original reference: >>> bar Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"\\", line 1, in ? NameError: name 'bar' is not defined As it is now impossible to refer to the object, the object has become useless; it is garbage. Since Python uses garbage collection, it automatically deallocates the memory that was used for the object so that it may be used again: >>> class Bar(object): ... \\"\\"\\"This is another testing class.\\"\\"\\" ... pass ... >>> baz = Bar() >>> baz <__main__.Bar object at 0x54f30> The instance now resides at the memory location ; at the same place as where our previous object, the instance, was located. Since the instance was destroyed, freeing up the memory used to contain it, the interpreter creates the object at the same memory location as before, making good use of the available resources. Effects Garbage consumes heap memory, and thus one wishes to collect it (to minimize memory use, allow faster memory allocation, and prevent out-of-memory errors by reducing heap fragmentation and memory use). However, collecting garbage takes time and, if done manually, requires coding overhead. Further, collecting garbage destroys objects and thus can cause calls to finalizers, executing potentially arbitrary code at an arbitrary point in the program's execution. Incorrect garbage collection (deallocating memory that is not garbage), primarily due to errors in manual garbage collection (rather than errors in garbage collectors), results in memory safety violations (that often create security holes) due to use of dangling pointers. Syntactic garbage can be collected automatically, and garbage collectors have been extensively studied and developed. Semantic garbage cannot be automatically collected in general, and thus causes memory leaks even in garbage-collected languages. Detecting and eliminating semantic garbage is typically done using a specialized debugging tool called a heap profiler, which allows one to see which objects are live and how they are reachable, enabling one to remove the unintended reference. Eliminating garbage The problem of managing the deallocation of garbage is well-known in computer science. Several approaches are taken: * Many operating systems reclaim the memory and resources used by a process or program when it terminates. Simple or short-lived programs which are designed to run in such environments can exit and allow the operating system to perform any necessary reclamation. * In systems or programming languages with manual memory management, the programmer must explicitly arrange for memory to be deallocated when it is no longer used. C and C++ are two well-known languages which support this model. * Garbage collection uses various algorithms to automatically analyze the state of a program, identify garbage, and deallocate it without intervention by the programmer. Many modern programming languages such as Java and Haskell provide automated garbage collection. However, it is not a recent development, as it has also been used in older languages such as LISP. * There is ongoing research to type-theoretic approaches (such as region inference) to identification and removal of garbage from a program. No general type-theoretic solution to the problem has been developed.

Daniel being Flutlicht's public face whilst Marco the technical mastermind behind their productions. Daniel started deejaying about ten years ago at little events or in tiny Swiss clubs and ever since his passion for electronic music has grown stronger every day. His style of performing high quality trance and groovy techno has earned him a good reputation and as a result he has been booked for events such as Futurescope, Nautilus, Energy or Nature One in Germany. Daniel toured the UK, the Netherlands, Scotland and Australia. Flutlicht started with the single \\"Icarus\\", Drizzly Records 2001, licensed for more than 150 compilations worldwide.

According to the American Bar Association, touting occurs when a person advertises, promotes, or otherwise describes a security for sale without disclosing that the person is being paid to do so. An example would be a person who frequents heavily touristed areas and presents himself as a tour guide (particularly towards those who do not speak the local language) but operates on behalf of local bars, restaurant, or hotels, being paid to direct tourists towards certain establishments.

She is played by Daniela Bianchi in the movie, with her voice dubbed in by Barbara Jefford. Novel and film biography Tatiana Romanova is introduced as a corporal in Soviet Army Intelligence, assigned to work in the Soviet consulate in Istanbul as a cipher clerk. Her superiors, in connection with SMERSH, plan to sow dissension in the intelligence community by murdering and discrediting a significant figure in western intelligence. The target was James Bond. Her commanding officer is Rosa Klebb--in the screenplay adaptation, Klebb is secretly an agent for SPECTRE--who manipulates Romanova into believing that she is on an important mission for her country, when she is in fact merely a pawn in the terrorist organization's latest bid to destroy the British Secret Service. In the novel, Klebb is actually a member of the Soviet government, commander in chief of the Otdyel II section of SMERSH. Romanova's mission is to seduce Bond and have him take her to England to deliver a code machine (a Spektor in the novel, a Lektor in the film), as well as plant false information, before being rescued from prison and returned to Russia. She is promised a promotion to Captain if she completes the mission. Once in Istanbul, she contacts Darko Kerim (Ali Kerim Bey in the film) and tells him her plans: she will voluntarily defect from the Soviet Union and take the machine with her only if Bond assists in the operation. She claims to have fallen in love with Bond and developed a desire to live with him after seeing his picture in a secret file. Both M and Bond believe the offer to be a trap, but the prize is valuable enough to go for it. They react just as the main instigator of the plot, chess champion Kronsteen, had predicted. Bond then flies to Istanbul and contacts Kerim, spending several days there and waiting for contact. After a riot at a Gypsy camp, Bond returns to his hotel room and finds Romanova walking across the room and getting into his bed, wearing only a black velvet choker and black stockings. They make love, but are secretly filmed by Klebb's minions via a one-way mirror. The film is meant to be used to embarrass MI6. In the film, after meeting her again to verify the authenticity of her information, they blow up the Soviet consulate in Istanbul to cover their escape. With the help of Kerim, they board the Orient Express and depart for Trieste and the Italian frontier. As a part of Kronsteen's strategy, the SMERSH/SPECTRE assassin Donovan 'Red' Grant kills Kerim. Bond contacts Grant, who is pretending to be an agent named Nash. After sedating Romanova, Nash reveals his identity to Bond, who then fights Grant in their train compartment. Prior to the fight, Grant explains that he is going to kill Bond and then execute the sleeping Romanova with Bond's gun, making it look like a murder-suicide. Bond finally defeats Grant and takes Romanova to Venice. It is there they meet Klebb again who, in an attempt to retrieve the LEKTOR and kill Bond, disguises herself as a maid and tries to eliminate the agent with a dagger-tipped shoe poisoned with blowfish venom. Romanova shoots Klebb, thus saving Bond. She and Bond are last seen on a boat in Venice, with Bond dropping the incriminating film into the canal. Similarly, in the novel, they board the Orient Express with Kerim, planning to travel to England over the course of four days. Kerim, instead of being killed by Grant, is killed by a Russian agent named Benz who had boarded the train earlier and also is killed in the struggle. This prompts the bombing of the Soviet consulate in Istanbul in retaliation. Despite this, Bond elects not to leave the train for a plane or the consulate, after having fallen for Romanova and not wanting to cut their time short. Grant pretends to be Nash, an MI6 agent sent by M in response to the death of Kerim. After sedating Romanova, under the guise of standing guard over Bond, he waits until they are both asleep, and plans to murder them. However, due to his vanity, he taunts Bond, revealing details of a meeting with Rosa Klebb. This allows Bond to disarm Grant and save Romanova's life. It is unclear as to what ultimately becomes of Tatiana in the novel as in her last appearance, she is still heavily affected by the sedatives, sleeping in the British consulate, while Bond confronts Klebb. It is presumed that she has been arrested and/or released by the British. Analysis The characters of Romanova and Grant exist in juxtaposition to one another with both being defectors from their respective nations, and it was the intention of Fleming in writing From Russia with Love to contrast these two characters as a way of justifying the moral superiority of Great Britain over the Soviet Union. In the 1950s, there were real fears in the West that Communism might be the more efficient system, and the Soviet Union would pull ahead both economically and technologically over the West. Additionally, the Burgess-Maclean affair of 1951 when two senior British diplomats, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess defected to the Soviet Union added to these fears. At the time, it was not widely known that Maclean and Burgess were spies for the Soviet Union and in case of Maclean was on the brink of being arrested on charges of treason. The Soviet government claimed that Maclean and Burgess had defected because life was better in the Soviet Union while the British government was content to go along with this explanation rather than admit that two senior diplomats had been spies for the Soviet Union for the better part of the last twenty years. Since Maclean and Burgess were both members of \\"the Establishment\\", having attended public schools and Cambridge University, the defection of the two attracted much attention at the time. Fleming's intention in writing From Russia with love was at least in part to promote a \\"West is the best\\" message by creating two parallel characters who would prove British superiority over the Soviet Union. Throughout the novel, Fleming drew contrasts between the Soviet Union and Great Britain, always to the benefit of the latter. For an example, the officers of SMERSH are portrayed as living in fear of their superiors while relations between MI6 officers are shown as warm and friendly. Romanova's life in Moscow as a low-ranking clerk for the MGB is portrayed as dull, confiding, and stifling as she lives a life of mind-numbing bureaucratic drudgery. As a member of the MGB, Romanova enjoys a relatively privileged life in Moscow, but complains that her MGB uniform makes it hard for her to make friends as people fear her. All of Romanova's superiors are portrayed as twisted and hideous-Rosa Klebb is an ugly woman with a \\"toad-like figure\\" and a lesbian while Kronsteen is a bisexual who is labelled \\"a monster\\" in the book. The book makes it clear that people such as Klebb and Kronsteen are the norm in the Soviet system. in the 1950s, homosexuality and bisexuality were widely considered to be perversions and Fleming by making most of his British characters straight in contrast to most of the Russian characters were part of his strategy to show \\"the West is the best\\". In From Russia with love, Fleming was promoting what would now be called heteronormativity, namely that to be straight is to be normal. When Klebb tries to seduce Romanova in her Moscow apartment, she flees in terror. The fact that Romanova unlike the other characters in the MGB is both hetrosexual and not sexually perverted is meant to show that she can be redeemed from her loyalty to her country in a way that they cannot be. However despite her repulsive superiors in the MGB, she is portrayed as a committed Communist who is at the same time vaguely unhappy with her existence as Fleming wrote: \\"The Romanov blood might well have given a yearning for men other than that type of modern Russian officer she would meet-stern, cold, mechanical, basically hysterical and because of their Party education infernally dull\\". Upon meeting Bond, she abandons her belief in Communism as she sees the advantage to a Western lifestyle while also finding Bond a much better lover than her Russian lovers. Romanova falling in love with Bond is portrayed as both a political and sexual liberation for her. The way that Bond literally and metaphorically seduces Romanova over to the West was meant by Fleming to prove the superiority of the West in general and Britain in particular. Romanova even prefers Bond for his smell as Fleming portrays Russian men as refusing to bath and hence have unpleasant body odours. The book's message that only men from the West like Bond can really sexually satisfy Romanova was another aspect of Fleming's \\"the West is the best\\" message. In contrast to Romanova who chooses life in the West over life in the Soviet Union, the book's villain, Grant, goes in the opposition direction. Grant is described as a man from Northern Ireland who joins the British Army in the late 1940s which briefly cheques his insanity and his love of killing. After Grant is disciplined for his vicious style as a boxer, he decides to defect to the Soviet Union as: \\"He liked all he heard about the Russians, their brutality, their carelessness of human life, and their guile and he decided to go over to them\\". Grant rides over on a motorcycle to a Red Army post in East Germany and says: \\"I am expert in killing people. I do it very well. I like it\\". Grant is promptly accepted and became the top assassin for SMERSH who happily kills because he is insane and because killing is the only thing he knows how to do well. In contrast to the soft and feminine Romanova who deep down really wants to be in love with a man which causes her to choose the West despite her privileged existence in Moscow, the hard and masculine Grant chooses the East because it is the only system where a perverted, violent man like himself can flourish. The 1963 film somewhat altered the novel's message by making SPECTRE rather than SMERSH as the main antagonist. The Grant of the film is depoliticised, becoming an murderer who was acquitted by reason of insanity who then escapes from a mental institution and comes to serve as an assassin for a criminal organisation instead of a soldier who broke his oath to serve King and Country by defecting to the Soviet Union. The Romanova of the film is much closer to the Romanova of the book who is shown as thoroughly enjoying the consumerist lifestyle of the West who is constantly buying expensive clothing that Bond introduces her to. Like in the book, her relationship with Bond serves as both a political and a sexual liberation. Unlike in the book, Romanova of the film makes a more clear decision to choose the West by shooting Klebb in the film's climax to save Bond, a decision made more significant as Romanova is unaware that Klebb is really working for SPECTRE. The theme of defection does not play the same central role in the film as it does in the novel. The film's message that the obsessive struggle between MI6 and the MGB allows a criminal organisation like SPECTRE to flourish seems to be a criticism of the Cold War. The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 had just occurred the previous year, and the film's message is that through the Soviet Union might be an enemy, it is best to keep the level of hostilities down to a manageable level. The fact that Romanova in the film as in the book chooses the West was meant to prove Western superiority, but at the same time the film seems to be cautioning against her excessively anti-Communist policies.. Other media The character's role in the video game adaptation of From Russia With Love is more or less the same as in the novel and film, the only major difference being that she is now an unwitting double agent for a terrorist organization called \\"OCTOPUS\\". She is voiced by Kari Wahlgren. The character also appears in the 1993 James Bond comic book that takes place after the events of From Russia With Love, called Light of My Death, in which she is reinstated as KGB agent, aiding Bond in his mission against a shadowy villain who wants to provoke a war between the Soviets and the West.

Dilapidation is derived from the Latin for scattering the stones () of a building. Ecclesiastical law A dilapidated church A building in the old town area of Bratislava, Slovakia In general English law a tenant for life has no power to cut down timber, destroy buildings, etc., or to let buildings fall into disrepair (see Waste). In the eye of the law an incumbent of a living is a tenant for life of his benefice, and any waste, voluntary or permissive, on his part must be made good by his administrators to his successor in office. The principles on which such dilapidations are to be ascertained, and the application of the money payable in respect thereof, depend partly on old ecclesiastical law and partly on acts of Parliament. Questions as to ecclesiastical dilapidations usually arise in respect of the residence house and other buildings belonging to the living. Inclosures, hedges, ditches and the like are included in things of which the beneficed person has the burden and charge of reparation. In a leading case (Ross v. Adcock, 1868, L.R. 3 C.P. 657) it was said that the court was acquainted with no precedent or decision extending the liability of the executors of a deceased incumbent to any species of waste beyond dilapidation of the house, chancel or other buildings or fences of the benefice. And it has been held that the mere mismanagement or miscultivation of the ecclesiastical lands will not give rise to an action for dilapidations. To place the law relating to dilapidations on a more satisfactory footing, the Ecclesiastical Dilapidations Act 1871 was passed. The buildings to which the act applies are defined to be such houses of residence, chancels, walls, fences and other buildings and things as the incumbent of the benefice is by law and custom bound to maintain in repair. In each diocese a surveyor is appointed by the archdeacons and rural deans subject to the approval of the bishop; and such surveyor shall by the direction of the bishop examine the buildings on the following occasions viz. # when the benefice is sequestrated; # when it is vacant; # at the request of the incumbent or on complaint by the archdeacon, rural dean or patron. The surveyor specifies the works required, and gives an estimate of their probable cost. In the case of a vacant benefice, the new incumbent and the old incumbent or his representatives may lodge objections to the surveyors report on any grounds of fact or law, and the bishop, after consideration, may make an order for the repairs and their cost, for which the late incumbent or his representatives are liable. The sum so stated becomes a debt due from the late incumbent or his representatives to the new incumbent, who shall pay over the money when recovered to the governors of Queen Anne's Bounty. The governors pay for the works on execution on receipt of a certificate from the surveyor; and the surveyor, when the works have been completed to his satisfaction, gives a certificate to that effect, the effect of which, so far as regards the incumbent, is to protect him from liability for dilapidations for the next five years. Unnecessary buildings belonging to a residence house may, by the authority of the bishop and with the consent of the patron, be removed. An amending statute of 1872 (Ecclesiastical Dilapidations Act (1871) Amendment) relates chiefly to advances by the governors of Queen Anne's Bounty for the purposes of the act. Commercial property  In the commercial property world, ‚Äòdilapidations‚Äô refers to breaches of lease covenants relating to the condition of a property, and the process of remedying those breaches. Tenants enter commercial leases agreeing to keep premises in repair; if they do not, the law of dilapidations applies. Landlords have the ability to serve a schedule of dilapidations on a tenant either during or more commonly at the end of the lease, itemising the breaches of covenant. Remedies for the landlord will be for the tenant to undertake the specified works or for them to seek to recover from the tenant the cost of making good the disrepair. Dilapidations occur primarily at the end of a lease, and often disputes arise between landlords and tenants as to their extent, and in order to reach a conclusion this inevitably leads to an appraisal of past case law which stems over 100 years. In an economic downturn dilapidations are also commonplace either during a lease term or if the tenant exercises a break clause.Dilapidations, 6th edition, Guidance Note (RICS), pp. 17, 19 and 22. Most dilapidations are settled by negotiation, but other methods exist in demonstrating loss suffered by a landlord such as a diminution valuation. Landlords and tenants will normally be advised by a specialist surveyor or property consultant. Formal guidance on dilapidations exists such as the PLA protocol which was currently adopted under the Civil Procedure Rules in 2012. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors produces a guidance note on dealing with dilapidations claims and this is currently in its sixth edition. The Financial Reporting Council's accounting standard FRS12 requires occupiers to budget for dilapidations in their accounts leading to more tenants seeking advice on dilapidations before the end of their leases.

Releases  The first pressings of the album in the USA contained two bonus tracks: \\"Raw Addict,\\" and \\"Ice\\" (which otherwise are only on a white label 12\\" issued by Stones Throw); the first pressing of the CD in Europe included those two and a third track, \\"Pillz,\\" which was later featured as the b-side to the single for \\"McNasty Filth\\". In 2005 Madlib's compilation of unreleased Jaylib tracks got leaked as an early version of Madvillain's Madvillainy did before. These two CDs were compiled by Madlib in late 2002 to listen to on a trip to Brazil.Stones Throw Records The Jaylib compilation is called The Rough Drafts and the Madvillain compilation is called Madvillainy Preview. The 2007 re-issue of Champion Sound was abruptly delayed when Stones Throw was issued a cease-and-desist from the camp of artist Cris Williamson. \\"The Red\\", one of the more popular songs from the LP, contained an unauthorized sample of her song \\"Shine On, Straight Arrow\\". According to J-Rocc of the Beat Junkies, the sample clearance issue came down to Williamson's gripe about a Madlib lyric: \\"There's a Jaylib track called ‚ÄòThe Red‚Äô they got sued for. Cris Williamson is the artist and she‚Äôs a total feminist, a real woman-power type. In that song Madlib says \\"mostly shitty women\\". She said, 'I‚Äôm not having that, take it off the album.' But she‚Äôs still letting them use the instrumental for licensing and so on. So even there they‚Äôve worked something out\\". \\"The Red\\" appears on the reissue with an alternate beat, though one still arranged by Jay Dee. An alternate beat was also used for the song \\"No Games\\" on the re-issue.  Reception  In 2010, Champion Sound was listed by Black Milk as one of the \\"Top Ten Albums of the Last Decade\\". In 2015, it ranked at number 41 on Facts \\"100 Best Indie Hip-Hop Records of All Time\\" list. In that year, it was also listed by HipHopDX as one of the \\"30 Best Underground Hip Hop Albums Since 2000\\".

Built between 1855 and 1859 by William Butler Johnston and his wife Anne Tracy Johnston in the Italian Renaissance Revival style, the house has been called the \\"Palace of the South.\\" The mansion sits atop Coleman Hill on Georgia Avenue in downtown Macon, near the Walter F. George School of Law, part of Mercer University. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973 for its architectural uniqueness. The , 24-room home was designed by the New York architect T. Thomas and Son. It was built in part by craftsman and artisans brought from Italy who were supervised by local master builder James B. Ayers.It has four levels and is crowned by a three-story cupola. Commissioned by imaginative owners and constructed by the most skillful workers of the time, its technological amenities were unsurpassed in the mid-nineteenth century: hot and cold running water, central heat, a speaker-tube system connecting 15 rooms, a French lift equivalent to today's elevator, in-house kitchen, and an elaborate ventilation system.  House history  Two families lived in Hay House, the first over four generations. Most of the home's present-day furnishings date from the Hay family's occupancy (1926‚Äì1962). A few pieces are from the Johnston family (1860‚Äì1896), most notably the Eastlake-style dining room suite. The most notable piece in the collection may be the 1857 marble statue, \\"Ruth Gleaning,\\" by American expatriate sculptor Randolph Rogers. The home was a place of comfort for the Johnston family and their daughters until the late 1800s. In 1896 after the death of Mrs. Johnston, their daughter Mary Ellen Felton and her husband lived in the home. The Feltons updated the plumbing and electricity and stayed in the home until the time of their deaths in 1926. = The Johnstons = The Hay House living room William Butler Johnston obtained his substantial wealth through investments in banking, railroads and public utilities rather than from the agrarian cotton economy. In 1851, he married Anne Clark Tracy, 20 years his junior, and the couple embarked on an extended honeymoon in Europe from 1852 to 1855. During their trip, the Johnstons visited hundreds of museums, historic sites and art studios. They collected fine porcelains, sculptures and paintings as mementos during their grand tour. Inspired by the Italian architecture they observed, the Johnstons constructed the monumental Italian Renaissance Revival mansion in Macon upon their return to America. Only two of the Johnstons' six children survived to adulthood. Caroline and Mary Ellen Johnston were born in 1862 and 1864, respectively, and grew up in the house on Georgia Avenue. = The Feltons = After the death of Mrs. Johnston in 1896, daughter Mary Ellen and her husband, Judge William H. Felton, lived in the house. They remodeled and redecorated parts of the house, updated the plumbing and added electricity. Their only child, William Hamilton Felton, Jr., was born in 1889. He married Luisa Macgill Gibson in 1915, and the newlywed couple soon moved in with the Feltons. They and their two sons, William Hamilton Felton III and George Gibson Felton, lived in the house until 1926. = The Hays = After the deaths of William Sr. and Mary Ellen Felton, the house was sold to Parks Lee Hay and his wife, Maude. After purchasing, the Hays redecorated the entire home, updating it to fit the new twentieth-century d√©cor. The home was seen as a local landmark to all in middle Georgia. Mr. Hay died in 1957, and Mrs. Hay died in 1962.  Present day  A closer view in 2018 Following Mrs. Hay's death, her heirs established the P.L. Hay Foundation and operated the house as a private house museum. By virtue of its national architectural significance, Hay House was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974. In 1977, the ownership and operation of the house was formally transferred to The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation to ensure its long-term preservation. In 2000, the White House Millennium Council designated Hay House an Official Project of Save America's Treasures in 2000.The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation (2007-11-11).

Of the money raised in the capital campaign, $3.5 million was earmarked to establish an endowment for ongoing maintenance. A need of $17.5 million has been identified to fund a complete restoration of the Hay House and permanently endow all future maintenance and management. The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation received a number of donations and grants including a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, a grant from the National Endowment of the Arts, and an Architectural Conservation grant from the Getty Foundation.The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation (2009). \\"Annual Report 2008\\". =Restoration= The house in 2018 Today, Hay House is open to visitors. Tours are held daily. Some of the plants in the landscaping of the home date back to the 19th century. Renovations continue to occur to keep Hay House up to date. Upcoming projects include a redesign of the gift shop, including new insulation, and writing specifications for mortar repairs outside of the building. Half of the money raised in the capital campaign was allocated for restoration of the exterior, cupola, and most public rooms of the house. Other restoration efforts include repairing the porch and stairs, masonry, and window and door shutter; conserving the stained glass; installing UV protection on windows; restoring the ground floor, attic, and cupola; lighting the 8,000-gallon water tank interior to illustrate the technological innovations of the house; conserving the collections of paintings and porcelain; and repairing the exterior grounds. Original furnishings and decorations in the downstairs rooms are also being researched in order to accurately restore the wall coverings, paint finishes, and furniture upholstery to their appearance during the Hay family's residency in the house.

For the 1965 film adaptation of the same name, her name was changed to Dominique Derval, nicknamed Domino, and she was portrayed by French actress Claudine Auger. In the 1983 film adaptation Never Say Never Again, her character was renamed Domino Petachi and she was portrayed by American actress Kim Basinger. Biography =The novel= Born Dominetta Petacchi, she is an Italian beauty from Bolzano who went to school in England at Cheltenham Ladies' College. She later studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art until being forced (after her parents' death in a train wreck) to return to Italy, where she became an actress. She changed her surname to Vitali, a stage name. While in Italy she also became the mistress of Emilio Largo, whom she calls a \\"guardian\\" of no relation. Bond meets Domino while in Nassau. She is staying on Largo's yacht, the Disco Volante, and believes Largo is in the area on a treasure hunt. For reasons she does not understand Largo makes her stay on land while he and his partners (whom she describes as shareholders) go prospecting for the hidden treasure. She also tells Bond that she has never been able to see the map that they use. Although Bond is successful in engaging Domino in conversation, she snubs him, but later agrees to meet with him again when she returns to land. She also becomes testy when Bond uses her given name, Dominetta, and bluntly tells him to call her 'Domino'. When Bond and Domino meet again at the casino later, she has entirely changed. She tells Bond that she is tired of watching Largo show off and letting him use her. She explains to Bond that she is trapped like a bird in a gilded cage. Domino later reveals that Giuseppe Petacchi is her brother who she hasn't seen for quite some time. Bond finds out that Largo had Petacchi killed after Petacchi had hijacked a bomber on SPECTRE's behalf. He proves this to Domino, and recruits her as an ally to spy on Largo. Domino returns to Largo's yacht, the Disco Volante, with a geiger counter to verify the ship as the location of the two stolen nuclear bombs, however, she is uncovered and taken prisoner. Largo tortures her by burning her with a cigar for heat and then using ice cubes for cold. Domino ultimately escapes as Largo attempts to carry out his plan. Before he can kill a weakened James Bond, she appears behind him and shoots him through the neck with a harpoon from a spear gun, avenging her brother and for what Largo had done to him. =The films= Thunderball In early drafts of the film's screenplay, the character's name was Dominetta Palazzi. When Claudine Auger was cast as Domino, the character's surname was changed to Derval to reflect her nationality. Dominique Derval is seen when Bond is swimming in Nassau, her foot gets stuck in coral on the ocean floor but Bond sets her free. She swims up to her boat and thanks Bond. Bond swims back to his boat with his Nassau contact, Paula Caplan. Paula takes care of their boat, as Bond is about to learn more about Domino. Domino and Bond have lunch on the beach, but Quist spies on the two, a sign that Domino had to go back to the yacht Disco Volante. At the hotel Bond stayed in, Bond sees Domino with Largo, Domino smoking a cigar, as Bond bids in the game against Largo. Domino tells Largo that Bond has pressed her to a drink. Domino and Bond slow-dance outside but Largo collects her. Upon arriving at Largo's home in Palmyra, Domino is swimming when Bond visits. After leaving to make lunch, Largo invites Bond to the Nassau Junkanoo. Domino accompanies them and informs Bond that Felix Leiter is trying to contact him. Bond then searches for Paula, who had been kidnapped by Fiona Volpe. He finds out that Paula committed suicide with cyanide. The next day, Domino and Bond make love in the water. They go on shore and Bond tells Domino the story: Largo killed her brother, a French Air Force pilot assigned to NATO, in order for SPECTRE to steal a Royal Air Force Avro Vulcan strategic bomber with two nuclear bombs. Largo, as a senior SPECTRE operative, plans to create a nuclear holocaust using the weapons. Domino then aids Bond by helping him kill Vargas and spying on the Disco Volante, but Largo captures and tortures her. Domino escapes and kills Largo with a harpoon in the back. She and Bond then jump off Volante just in time before it explodes. They are immediately rescued by the CIA B-17 and carried into the air on a sky hook. Never Say Never Again Domino Petachi (played by Kim Basinger) is structured after Domino Derval. The character is called Domino, it is no longer just a nickname, but her last name has reverted to the novel's original Petachi. Unlike the character in the first film version where she refers to him as her \\"guardian,\\" it is well known that she and Largo are long term lovers. She meets Bond at a spa in Monte Carlo, where he poses as a masseur and massages her for information. This gives her immense pleasure, though she later realizes he is not who he appears to be. She encounters him again at a casino where Bond introduces himself to her. They have drinks together before being interrupted by Largo. The two dance briefly, where Bond informs her about the death of her brother Jack. Bond is then invited to Largo's yacht, where Largo spies on them kissing in her cabin. He leaves Bond manacled near Palmyra, while Domino is auctioned off as a slave to some unsavory Arabs. Bond eventually escapes and rescues her. They are then chased by the Arabs on horseback until the horse jumps off a cliff into the ocean. They are rescued from the water by Felix Leiter and a team from MI6. After their rescue, Domino and Bond track Largo to a location known as \\"The Tears of Allah\\". The two take a shower together, and Bond kisses her before heading off to stop Largo. The circumstances of her spearing Largo as he and Bond fight are altered from the original film ‚Äì it here takes place underwater, with all the characters in scuba gear. The film ends with Bond indicating his intention to retire from MI6 and settle down with Domino. Reception In a poll conducted by Moviefone.com in 2008, Basinger was ranked #3 in the top 10 sexiest Bond girls for her portrayal of Domino.

It has served in the American Civil War, Boxer Rebellion, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, Operation Restore Hope, Operation Uphold Democracy, Operation Joint Guard, Operation Desert Storm, Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Gothic Serpent, Operation New Dawn, Operation Resolute Support, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 14th Infantry Regiment did not take part in combat during World War I. It has also conducted peacekeeping and humanitarian missions in the Sinai Peninsula, Guant√°namo Bay in Cuba, Bosnia, and Kosovo. Only the 2nd Battalion of the 14th Infantry Regiment is currently active, assigned to 2nd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, New York. History =Civil War, 1861‚Äì66= In May 1861, President Abraham Lincoln called for the creation of nine additional Regular Army infantry regiments in preparation for the looming civil war. These regiments were designated the 11th through the 19th Infantry and organized as \\"three- battalion\\" regiments, each battalion containing eight companies of infantry, in contrast to the original ten regular regiments of infantry, which were organized on the traditional ten-company line. The 14th Infantry Regiment was organized on 3 May 1861 at Fort Trumbull, Connecticut, in two battalions with the third added in April 1862. Part of the Army of the Potomac, the regiment saw its first combat action in the Peninsula Campaign 17 May 1862. The regiment was assigned to 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, 5th Corps, Army of the Potomac and fought at Antietam, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Wilderness and Petersburg. In recognition of the regiment's heroic performance of duty during twelve of the bloodiest campaigns of the American Civil War, General George Meade, awarded the 14th Infantry Regiment the place of honor at the \\"Right of the Line\\" in the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington, DC at the end of the war. This is where the regiment takes its motto \\"The Right of the Line\\". Following the Civil War, the Army was reorganized by Congress in July 1866, and the 14th was divided into three regiments, each battalion receiving two additional companies and being organized along traditional lines. The 1st Battalion retained the designation of the 14th Infantry, while the 2nd Battalion became the 23rd Infantry and the 3rd Battalion the 32nd Infantry. =Indian Wars, 1866‚Äì78= The regiment was sent to the Presidio of San Francisco following the Civil War and from there line companies were posted to stations in Arizona, California, Oregon, and Washington. The regiment took part in two Indian campaigns and detachments were in two other campaigns (including the 1866-1868 Snake War) but not in sufficient strength to entitle the regiment as a whole to participation credit. Campaign participation credit during this time includes Arizona 1866; Wyoming 1874; Little Big Horn 1876; Bannocks 1878. Several companies fought the Apaches in 1866 in Arizona. In 1874, elements of the regiment operated against Indian tribes raiding ranches and mines in the Wyoming territory. Several companies participated in the 1876 campaign. Soon after the Battle of the Little Bighorn in June 1876, four companies from the regiment (Companies B, C, F, and I) participated in the Horsemeat March, one of the most grueling marches in American military history, and the Battle of Slim Buttes. Captain James Kennington led Company B during the Battle of Slim Buttes; a year later Kennington was the Officer of the Day at Camp Robinson and escorted Crazy Horse to the guardhouse when the captured Lakota war leader was killed on 5 September 1877. =Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, 1898= The regiment was at the capture of Manila in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and in the fighting around the same city in 1899. =China Relief Expedition, 1900= Corporal Titus scaling the walls of Peking. During the early years of the 20th century, the 14th Infantry Regiment was deployed to China to help put down the Boxer Rebellion. The 14th was the spearhead in winning a victory over the Chinese army at the Battle of Yangcun. At the Tung Pien Gate in Peking, the regiment was taking heavy fire and was unable to effectively engage the enemy. To counteract, volunteers were called for to scale the wall and lay down suppressive fire from the better vantage point while the rest of the regiment followed. Corporal Calvin P. Titus, a band member and chaplains assistant from E Company, volunteered, and with rope slung over his shoulder scaled the wall and laid down the suppressive fire that allowed more and more soldiers behind him to follow. For his actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor as well as receiving an appointment to West Point. For their conduct of the operation, the 14th Infantry Regiment was rewarded by the Chinese government a large amount of silver bullion which was later fashioned into an ornamented punchbowl with matching cups and other dinnerware that is still kept in 2nd Battalion, 14th Infantry Regiment headquarters. =World War I, 1917‚Äì18= On the eve of the US entry into World War I, the 14th Infantry Regiment was stationed in Yuma, Arizona, although the 1st Battalion was on detached duty in Alaska. The regiment was subsequently transferred to Vancouver Barracks, Washington. In 1918 the 14th was moved to Butte, Montana to guard the Anaconda copper mines. Although a Regular Army unit, the regiment did not see active service during the war. =Interwar Period, 1919-1941= The 14th Infantry Regiment was stationed at Camp Custer, Michigan, in 1919. On 22 October 1920, it was transferred to Fort Davis, in the Panama Canal Zone, and was assigned to the Panama Canal Division on 3 July 1921. When the Panama Canal Division was inactivated in 1932, the regiment was attached to Headquarters, Atlantic Sector on 15 April 1932. On 10 April 1940, the regiment was assigned to the Panama Canal Division's successor, the Panama Mobile Force. =World War II, 1941‚Äì45= In 1943, the Golden Dragons were ordered to Camp Carson, Colorado. The regiment arrived in San Francisco, California on 18 June 1943 and was assigned to the 71st Light Division on 10 July 1943. The 14th, along with the rest of the 71st Division underwent unit combat training at Camp Carson then at Camp Roberts, California and at Fort Benning Georgia. At Fort Benning the 71st was reorganized and redesignated as the 71st Infantry Division. On 25 January 1945, the Golden Dragons sailed from New York with the rest of the 71st Division, arriving in Le Havre on 7 February 1945. The 14th then moved some across France. At Ratzwiller the 71st Division relieved the 100th Division. On 21 March 1945 the 14th took part in the 71st Division's breaching the Siegfried Line and the capture of Pirmasens. On 30 March 1945 the 71st crossed the Rhine River and went into reserve near Frankfurt. The 14th Infantry then participated along with its sister regiment the 5th Infantry in the elimination of bypassed German forces north of Hanau, Germany on 2 April 1945. On 13 April 1945 the Golden Dragons cut the main Berlin to Munich autobahn. On 14‚Äì16 April 1945 the 14th participated in its heaviest combat as the 71st Division seized the town of Bayreuth, Germany. Bypassing German strongpoints the 71st Division sped south with the 14th Infantry crossing the Danube River and participating in the seizure of the city of Regensburg on 27 April 1945. From there the 14th made an assault crossing of the Isar River under fire and entered Austria on 2 May 1945. The 71st Division linked up with advancing Soviet Army units east of Linz, Austria on 8 May 1945 and hostilities ceased on 9 May 1945. =Korean War, 1950‚Äì53= In responding to the North Korean invasion of South Korea in June 1950 the U.S. Army found itself desperately short of units to halt the Communist advance. Continental U.S. (CONUS) units were stripped of personnel and equipment and sent to Korea on a priority basis. On 21 July 1950 the 3rd Battalion, 14th Infantry was reassigned to the Far East Command and then to the 1st Cavalry Division where it was redesignated as the 3rd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment. Unlike other units that had been cobbled together at the last minute, the 3rd Battalion, 14th Infantry was at full strength and due to its rigorous training in mountain warfare was in excellent shape to fight in the Korean mountains. On 23 July 1951, the 1st Battalion, 14th Infantry was transferred to Fort Benning where it was assigned to and redesignated as a battalion in one of the 3rd Infantry Division's regiments. The 3rd Division was initially sent to Japan then to Korea. The remaining personnel and equipment of the 14th Infantry at Camp Carson were reassigned to other CONUS units. On 1 August 1951 the 14th Infantry less personnel and equipment was assigned to the 25th Infantry Division then fighting in Korea. To man and equip the 14th Infantry the assets of the 34th Infantry Regiment of the 24th Division, then conducting infantry training in Japan, were used. The 14th Infantry moved to Korea where it replaced the 24th Infantry Regiment, which was being inactivated as part of the integration of the Army. The next two years found the regiment in almost constant combat along the 38th parallel defending places like \\"The Punchbowl\\" and \\"Porkchop Hill\\". The 25th Infantry Division assumed the responsibility of guarding the approaches to Seoul on 5 May 1953. 23 days later, when ceasefire negotiations at Panmunjom stalled, a heavy PVA assault hit the Nevada Complex, the Division held its ground; the brunt of the attack was absorbed by the attached Turkish Brigade and the 14th Infantry. The 14th Infantry's service in Korea earned the regiment five campaign streamers and a Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation for gallantry at Munsan-Ni. Three soldiers were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions in Korea; Sergeant Donn F. Porter, Private First Class Ernest E. West, and Private First Class Bryant H. Womack. =Vietnam, 1965‚Äì72= UH-1D helicopters airlift members of the 2nd Battalion, 14th Infantry Regiment from the Filhol Rubber Plantation area to a new staging area, during Operation Wahiawa, a search and destroy mission conducted by the 25th Infantry Division, northeast of Cu Chi, 1966 1st Battalion, 14th Infantry: In the fall of 1965 the 25th Division was ordered to Vietnam. The initial brigade to go was the 3rd Brigade composed of the 1st Battalion, 14th Infantry, the 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry, the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry and the 2nd Battalion, 9th Artillery. The urgency of getting the 3rd Brigade to the Central Highlands of Vietnam led to the Army and Air Force undertaking Operation Blue Light, a massive airlift of the entire 3rd Brigade from Hawaii to Pleiku. The airlift began on 28 December 1965 and was successfully concluded on 17 January 1966. Commanded by LTC Gilbert Procter, Jr., the 1/14th spent most of 1966 operating along the Cambodian border as part of the 3rd Brigade's mission of preventing the North Vietnamese from cutting South Vietnam in half. In November 1966, elements of the 1st Battalion engaged two battalions of the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Among the numerous Golden Dragons performing heroically during these engagements, two members of the 1st Battalion - 1st Lt. Joseph Grant and Sgt. Ted Belcher were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Addenda: 1st Battalion Operations Vietnam, 1966‚Äì1967. The 1st Battalion was reassigned to the 4th Infantry Division on 1 August 1967 as part of the exchange of 3rd Brigades between the 25th and 4th Infantry Divisions. The 1st Battalion participated in a total of 12 Vietnam campaigns, receiving the Navy Presidential Unit Citation for gallantry in action at Chu Lai. Company A received the Valorous Unit Award for action in Quang Ngai Province. In addition the 1st Battalion received four awards of the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Palm and one award of the Vietnam Civil Action Medal, First Class. On 8 December 1970 the 1st Battalion was reduced to zero strength at An Khe, Vietnam with the exception of a battalion color guard which returned the battalion colors to Schofield Barracks. On 15 December 1970 the 1st Battalion was reassigned to the 25th Division and the 3rd Battalion, 14th Infantry was inactivated with its personnel and equipment reassigned to the 1st Battalion. 2nd Battalion, 14th Infantry: The 1st Brigade of the 25th Division to which the 2nd Battalion, 14th Infantry was assigned was scheduled to be the last of the three maneuver brigades to deploy to Vietnam. The brigade was shy two of its three infantry battalions. When the 25th was reorganized from battle groups to battalions in 1963 two of the nine authorized infantry battalions were not activated as a cost-saving measure. Initially the plan was to activate and train two new battalions for the 1st Brigade but the timetable was too short. Adding to the problem was the need to heavily levy the 2nd Battalion for fillers for infantry battalions of the 3rd Brigade, which left in December 1965 and of the 2nd Brigade, which departed Schofield in January 1966. To round out the 1st Brigade two battalions assigned to Alaska‚Äîthe 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry and the 4th Battalion, 23rd Infantry‚Äîwere reassigned to the 1st Brigade on 14 January 1966. By February 1966 the 2nd Battalion began receiving large numbers of replacements, most directly out of Advanced Individual Training. This resulted in an accelerated unit training program to ready the battalion for deployment. To enhance developing unit cohesiveness and to create espirit-de-corps the 2nd Battalion took the informal nickname of Battle Dragons. A \\"Battle Dragon Chant\\" was also written and used in battalion formations. In early April, the 1st Brigade was alerted for movement to Vietnam. On 16 April 1966 the USNS Nelson M. Walker sailed from Pearl Harbor with the entire 1st Brigade aboard. The ship arrived at Vung Tau near Saigon on 28 April. The 2nd Battalion left the ship on 30 April and was moved by truck and aircraft to C·ªß Chi. In its over four years of combat in Vietnam, the 2nd Battalion received participation credit for 12 of the campaigns of the Vietnam War. The battalion received two awards of the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Palm and one award of the Vietnam Civic Action Medal First Class. On 8 December 1970 the 2nd Battalion left Vietnam and returned to Schofield Barracks. The battalion was inactivated on 5 June 1972. Addenda: 2nd Battalion Operations Vietnam, 1966‚Äì1968. 3rd Battalion, 14th Infantry: To provide for a Pacific area strategic reserve for contingencies other than the ongoing Vietnam War, the Army activated the 4th Brigade, 25th Infantry Division at Schofield Barracks on 6 December 1969. The 3rd Battalion, 14th Infantry was activated as one of the 4th Brigade's three infantry battalions. The 3rd Battalion (descending from Company C) was initially activated under CARS as the 3rd Battle Group, 14th Infantry on 1 June 1959 and assigned to the 102nd Infantry Division, U.S. Army Reserve at Kansas City, Missouri. The 3rd Battle Group was reorganized and redesignated as the 3rd Battalion, 14th Infantry on 1 April 1963. On 31 December 1965 the 3rd Battalion was inactivated. It was allotted back to the Regular Army on 6 December 1969 and activated at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii as a component of the 4th Brigade, 25th Division. As the 25th Division returned to Schofield Barracks from Vietnam to resume its traditional mission of being the strategic reserve for the Pacific area the 4th Brigade along with the 3rd Battalion 14th Infantry was inactivated on 15 December 1970. The personnel and equipment of the 3rd Battalion was used to re-man and re-equip the 1st Battalion, 14th Infantry. Company E served in Vietnam from 30 June 1971 to 20 November 1972 as a separate rifle security company assigned to the U.S. Army Support Command with the mission of guarding the Long B√¨nh support facility. Company E received campaign participation credit for the last four campaigns of the Vietnam War. In 1986 it was assigned to the 25th Division as Headquarters Company, 5th Battalion. (See below.) =Post Vietnam= As part of the overall post-Vietnam draw-down of the Army only the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division remained active. The 1st Battalion 14th Infantry was assigned to the 1st Brigade and the 2nd Battalion, 14th Infantry was inactivated but remained assigned to the Tropic Lightning. The 3rd Battalion, 14th Infantry was reactivated in 1987 and was based in Fort Drum, New York. =Somalia, 1993= On 3 October 1993, 2-14 Infantry was part of the quick reaction force which helped rescue members of Special Operations Task Force Ranger which had conducted a daylight raid on an enemy stronghold. 2-14 Infantry fought a moving battle for 3 hours from the gates of the Soccer Stadium Mogadishu to the Rangers' perimeter. They successfully linked up with the Rangers and then began to withdraw under fire. During the 12-hour ordeal, 29 soldiers from 2nd Battalion were wounded and 2 were killed (PFC James Martin and Sgt. Cornell Houston).2-14 Infantry along with TF Ranger endured the Mogadishu Mile before returning to the stadium. =Haiti, 1994= Operation Uphold Democracy (19 September 1994 ‚Äì 31 March 1995) was an intervention designed to remove the military regime installed by the 1991 Haitian coup d'√©tat that overthrew the elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The operation was effectively authorized by the 31 July 1994 United Nations Security Council Resolution 940. Teams were deployed throughout the country to establish order and humanitarian services. Regular Army forces consisting of units from the 10th Mountain Division occupied Port-au-Prince (3-14) with 3rd Bn (Airborne) 73rd Armor Regiment (82nd Airborne Division) and elements from the U.S. Army Materiel Command provided logistical support in the form of the Joint Logistics Support Command (JLSC) which provided oversight and direct control over all Multinational Force and U.S. deployed logistics units =Bosnia, 1997= On 19 March 1997, two companies of 2-14 Infantry deployed to Bosnia. Bravo Company's mission was to defend a critical bridge site over the Sava River, while Charlie Company was to act as the theater reserve. =Bosnia, 2001= In November, 2001, 2-14 Infantry deployed to Bosnia as part of Task Force Falcon. =Bosnia, 2002= On 28 March 2002, two companies of 1-14 Infantry deployed to Bosnia. =2003‚Äìpresent= In March 2003, 2nd Battalion, 14th Infantry Regiment, deployed from Fort Drum in preparation for the invasion of Iraq. As part of Task Force Viking, the battalion was attached to 10th Special Forces Group in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The battalion linked-up with 10th Special Forces in Constanta, Romania, then deployed to Irbil, Mosul, and Kirkuk. This task force, fighting with Kurdish rebels, defeated six Iraqi divisions. The battalion re-deployed to Fort Drum, New York, six months later.

Led by Martin Luther King Jr., James Bevel, Fred Shuttlesworth and others, the campaign of nonviolent direct action culminated in widely publicized confrontations between young black students and white civic authorities, and eventually led the municipal government to change the city's discrimination laws. In the early 1960s, Birmingham was one of the most racially divided cities in the United States, both as enforced by law and culturally. Black citizens faced legal and economic disparities, and violent retribution when they attempted to draw attention to their problems. Martin Luther King Jr. called it the most segregated city in the country.Undated interview with King, included in Spike Lee's documentary 4 Little Girls. Protests in Birmingham began with a boycott led by Shuttlesworth meant to pressure business leaders to open employment to people of all races, and end segregation in public facilities, restaurants, schools, and stores. When local business and governmental leaders resisted the boycott, SCLC agreed to assist. Organizer Wyatt Tee Walker joined Birmingham activist Shuttlesworth and began what they called Project C, a series of sit- ins and marches intended to provoke mass arrests. When the campaign ran low on adult volunteers, James Bevel thought of the idea of having students become the main demonstrators in the Birmingham campaign. He then trained and directed high school, college, and elementary school students in nonviolence, and asked them to participate in the demonstrations by taking a peaceful walk 50 at a time from the 16th Street Baptist Church to City Hall in order to talk to the mayor about segregation. This resulted in over a thousand arrests, and, as the jails and holding areas filled with arrested students, the Birmingham Police Department, led by Eugene \\"Bull\\" Connor, used high-pressure water hoses and police attack dogs on the children and adult bystanders. Not all of the bystanders were peaceful, despite the avowed intentions of SCLC to hold a completely nonviolent walk, but the students held to the nonviolent premise. Martin Luther King Jr. and the SCLC drew both criticism and praise for allowing children to participate and put themselves in harm's way. The Birmingham campaign was a model of nonviolent direct action protest and, through the media, drew the world's attention to racial segregation in the South. It burnished King's reputation, ousted Connor from his job, forced desegregation in Birmingham, and directly paved the way for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which prohibited racial discrimination in hiring practices and public services throughout the United States. Background =City of segregation= Birmingham, Alabama was, in 1963, \\"probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States\\", according to King.King, Martin L., Jr., Letter from Birmingham Jail, April 16, 1963. Although the city's population of almost 350,000 was 60% white and 40% black, Birmingham had no black police officers, firefighters, sales clerks in department stores, bus drivers, bank tellers, or store cashiers. Black secretaries could not work for white professionals. Jobs available to black workers were limited to manual labor in Birmingham's steel mills, work in household service and yard maintenance, or work in black neighborhoods. When layoffs were necessary, black employees were often the first to go. The unemployment rate for black people was two and a half times higher than for white people.Garrow, (1989) p. 166. The average income for black employees in the city was less than half that of white employees. Significantly lower pay scales for black workers at the local steel mills were common.Garrow, (1989) p. 165. Racial segregation of public and commercial facilities throughout Jefferson County was legally required, covered all aspects of life, and was rigidly enforced. Only 10 percent of the city's black population was registered to vote in 1960.Eskew, p. 86. In addition, Birmingham's economy was stagnating as the city was shifting from blue collar to white collar jobs.Bass, p. 89. According to Time magazine in 1958, the only thing white workers had to gain from desegregation was more competition from black workers. Fifty unsolved racially motivated bombings between 1945 and 1962 had earned the city the nickname \\"Bombingham\\". A neighborhood shared by white and black families experienced so many attacks that it was called \\"Dynamite Hill\\". Black churches in which civil rights were discussed became specific targets for attack.Branch, p. 570-571. Black organizers had worked in Birmingham for about ten years, as it was the headquarters of the Southern Negro Youth Congress (SNYC). In Birmingham, SNYC experienced both successes and failures, as well as arrests and official violence. SNYC was forced out in 1949, leaving behind a Black population that thus had some experience of civil rights organizing. A few years later, Birmingham's black population began to organize to effect change. After Alabama banned the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1956, Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth formed the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR) the same year to challenge the city's segregation policies through lawsuits and protests. When the courts overturned the segregation of the city's parks, the city responded by closing them. Shuttlesworth's home was repeatedly bombed, as was Bethel Baptist Church, where he was pastor. After Shuttlesworth was arrested and jailed for violating the city's segregation rules in 1962, he sent a petition to Mayor Art Hanes' office asking that public facilities be desegregated. Hanes responded with a letter informing Shuttlesworth that his petition had been thrown in the garbage.Garrow, (1989) p. 168. Looking for outside help, Shuttlesworth invited Martin Luther King Jr. and the SCLC to Birmingham, saying, \\"If you come to Birmingham, you will not only gain prestige, but really shake the country. If you win in Birmingham, as Birmingham goes, so goes the nation.\\"Hampton, p. 125. =Campaign goals= King and the SCLC had recently been involved in a campaign to desegregate the city of Albany, Georgia, but did not see the results they had anticipated. Described by historian Henry Hampton as a \\"morass\\", the Albany movement lost momentum and stalled.Hampton, p. 112. King's reputation had been hurt by the Albany campaign, and he was eager to improve it.Bass, p. 96. Determined not to make the same mistakes in Birmingham, King and the SCLC changed several of their strategies. In Albany, they concentrated on the desegregation of the city as a whole. In Birmingham, their campaign tactics focused on more narrowly defined goals for the downtown shopping and government district. These goals included the desegregation of Birmingham's downtown stores, fair hiring practices in shops and city employment, the reopening of public parks, and the creation of a bi-racial committee to oversee the desegregation of Birmingham's public schools. Maurice Isserman & Michael Kazin, 'America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s', (Oxford, 2008), p. 90. King summarized the philosophy of the Birmingham campaign when he said: \\"The purpose of ... direct action is to create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation\\".Garrow, (1986) p. 246. =Commissioner of Public Safety= A significant factor in the success of the Birmingham campaign was the structure of the city government and the personality of its contentious Commissioner of Public Safety, Eugene \\"Bull\\" Connor. Described as an \\"arch-segregationist\\" by Time magazine, Connor asserted that the city \\"ain't gonna segregate no niggers and whites together in this town \\". He also apparently believed that the Civil Rights Movement was a Communist plot, and after the churches were bombed, Connor blamed the violence on local black citizens.Isserman and Kazin, p.89. Birmingham's government was set up in such a way that it gave Connor powerful influence. In 1958, police arrested ministers organizing a bus boycott. When the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) initiated a probe amid allegations of police misconduct for the arrests, Connor responded that he \\"[hadn't] got any damn apology to the FBI or anybody else\\", and predicted, \\"If the North keeps trying to cram this thing [desegregation] down our throats, there's going to be bloodshed.\\" In 1961, Connor delayed sending police to intervene when Freedom Riders were beaten by local mobs.Garrow, (1989) p. 169. The police harassed religious leaders and protest organizers by ticketing cars parked at mass meetings and entering the meetings in plainclothes to take notes. The Birmingham Fire Department interrupted such meetings to search for \\"phantom fire hazards\\".Manis, p. 162-163. Connor was so antagonistic towards the Civil Rights Movement that his actions galvanized support for black Americans. President John F. Kennedy later said of him, \\"The Civil Rights Movement should thank God for Bull Connor. He's helped it as much as Abraham Lincoln.\\" Turmoil in the mayor's office also weakened the Birmingham city government in its opposition to the campaign. Connor, who had run for several elected offices in the months leading up to the campaign, had lost all but the race for Public Safety Commissioner. Because they believed Connor's extreme conservatism slowed progress for the city as a whole, a group of white political moderates worked to defeat him.McWhorter, p. 286. The Citizens for Progress was backed by the Chamber of Commerce and other white professionals in the city, and their tactics were successful. In November 1962, Connor lost the race for mayor to Albert Boutwell, a less combative segregationist. However, Connor and his colleagues on the City Commission refused to accept the new mayor's authority. They claimed on a technicality that their terms not expire until 1965 instead of in the spring of 1963. So for a brief time, Birmingham had two city governments attempting to conduct business.Cotman, p. 11-12. Focus on Birmingham =Selective buying campaign= Modeled on the Montgomery bus boycott, protest actions in Birmingham began in 1962, when students from local colleges arranged for a year of staggered boycotts. They caused downtown business to decline by as much as 40 percent, which attracted attention from Chamber of Commerce president Sidney Smyer, who commented that the \\"racial incidents have given us a black eye that we'll be a long time trying to forget\\".Fairclough, p. 113 In response to the boycott, the City Commission of Birmingham punished the black community by withdrawing $45,000 ($ in ) from a surplus-food program used primarily by low-income black families. The result, however, was a black community more motivated to resist. The SCLC decided that economic pressure on Birmingham businesses would be more effective than pressure on politicians, a lesson learned in Albany as few black citizens were registered to vote in 1962. In the spring of 1963, before Easter, the Birmingham boycott intensified during the second-busiest shopping season of the year. Pastors urged their congregations to avoid shopping in Birmingham stores in the downtown district. For six weeks supporters of the boycott patrolled the downtown area to make sure black shoppers were not patronizing stores that promoted or tolerated segregation. If black shoppers were found in these stores, organizers confronted them and shamed them into participating in the boycott. Shuttlesworth recalled a woman whose $15 hat ($ in ) was destroyed by boycott enforcers. Campaign participant Joe Dickson recalled, \\"We had to go under strict surveillance. We had to tell people, say look: if you go downtown and buy something, you're going to have to answer to us.\\" After several business owners in Birmingham took down \\"white only\\" and \\"colored only\\" signs, Commissioner Connor told business owners that if they did not obey the segregation ordinances, they would lose their business licenses.Nunnelley, p. 132.Davis, p. 200. =Project C= The 16th Street Baptist Church, headquarters and rendezvous point for the campaign Martin Luther King Jr.'s presence in Birmingham was not welcomed by all in the black community. A local black attorney complained in Time that the new city administration did not have enough time to confer with the various groups invested in changing the city's segregation policies. Black hotel owner A. G. Gaston agreed. A white Jesuit priest assisting in desegregation negotiations attested the \\"demonstrations [were] poorly timed and misdirected\\". Protest organizers knew they would meet with violence from the Birmingham Police Department and chose a confrontational approach to get the attention of the federal government. Wyatt Tee Walker, one of the SCLC founders and the executive director from 1960 to 1964, planned the tactics of the direct action protests, specifically targeting Bull Connor's tendency to react to demonstrations with violence: \\"My theory was that if we mounted a strong nonviolent movement, the opposition would surely do something to attract the media, and in turn induce national sympathy and attention to the everyday segregated circumstance of a person living in the Deep South.\\" He headed the planning of what he called Project C, which stood for \\"confrontation\\". Organizers believed their phones were tapped, so to prevent their plans from being leaked and perhaps influencing the mayoral election, they used code words for demonstrations.Garrow, (1989) p. 175. The plan called for direct nonviolent action to attract media attention to \\"the biggest and baddest city of the South\\".Hampton, p. 126. In preparation for the protests, Walker timed the walking distance from the 16th Street Baptist Church, headquarters for the campaign, to the downtown area. He surveyed the segregated lunch counters of department stores, and listed federal buildings as secondary targets should police block the protesters' entrance into primary targets such as stores, libraries, and all-white churches.Garrow, (1989) p. 176-177. Methods The campaign used a variety of nonviolent methods of confrontation, including sit-ins at libraries and lunch counters, kneel-ins by black visitors at white churches, and a march to the county building to mark the beginning of a voter- registration drive. Most businesses responded by refusing to serve demonstrators. Some white spectators at a sit-in at a Woolworth's lunch counter spat upon the participants.Eskew, p. 218. A few hundred protesters, including jazz musician Al Hibbler, were arrested, although Hibbler was immediately released by Connor. The SCLC's goals were to fill the jails with protesters to force the city government to negotiate as demonstrations continued. However, not enough people were arrested to affect the functioning of the city and the wisdom of the plans were being questioned in the black community. The editor of The Birmingham World, the city's black newspaper, called the direct actions by the demonstrators \\"wasteful and worthless\\", and urged black citizens to use the courts to change the city's racist policies.Bass, p. 105. Most white residents of Birmingham expressed shock at the demonstrations. White religious leaders denounced King and the other organizers, saying that \\"a cause should be pressed in the courts and the negotiations among local leaders, and not in the streets\\".Wilson, p. 94. Some white Birmingham residents were supportive as the boycott continued. When one black woman entered Loveman's department store to buy her children Easter shoes, a white saleswoman said to her, \\"Negro, ain't you ashamed of yourself, your people out there on the street getting put in jail and you in here spending money and I'm not going to sell you any, you'll have to go some other place.\\"Eskew, p. 237. King promised a protest every day until \\"peaceful equality had been assured\\" and expressed doubt that the new mayor would ever voluntarily desegregate the city.Bass, p. 16. City reaction On April 10, 1963, Bull Connor obtained an injunction barring the protests and subsequently raised bail bond for those arrested from $200 to $1,500 ($ to $ in ). Fred Shuttlesworth called the injunction a \\"flagrant denial of our constitutional rights\\" and organizers prepared to defy the order. The decision to ignore the injunction had been made during the planning stage of the campaign.Bass, p. 108. King and the SCLC had obeyed court injunctions in their Albany protests and reasoned that obeying them contributed to the Albany campaign's lack of success.Eskew, p. 238. In a press release they explained, \\"We are now confronted with recalcitrant forces in the Deep South that will use the courts to perpetuate the unjust and illegal systems of racial separation\\". Incoming mayor Albert Boutwell called King and the SCLC organizers \\"strangers\\" whose only purpose in Birmingham was \\"to stir inter- racial discord\\". Connor promised, \\"You can rest assured that I will fill the jail full of any persons violating the law as long as I'm at City Hall.\\"Eskew, p. 222. The movement organizers found themselves out of money after the amount of required bail was raised. Because King was the major fundraiser, his associates urged him to travel the country to raise bail money for those arrested. He had, however, previously promised to lead the marchers to jail in solidarity, but hesitated as the planned date arrived. Some SCLC members grew frustrated with his indecisiveness. \\"I have never seen Martin so troubled\\", one of King's friends later said.Bass p. 109. After King prayed and reflected alone in his hotel room, he and the campaign leaders decided to defy the injunction and prepared for mass arrests of campaign supporters. To build morale and to recruit volunteers to go to jail, Ralph Abernathy spoke at a mass meeting of Birmingham's black citizens at the 6th Avenue Baptist Church: \\"The eyes of the world are on Birmingham tonight. Bobby Kennedy is looking here at Birmingham, the United States Congress is looking at Birmingham. The Department of Justice is looking at Birmingham. Are you ready, are you ready to make the challenge? I am ready to go to jail, are you?\\"Eskew, p. 221, Bass With Abernathy, King was among 50 Birmingham residents ranging in age from 15 to 81 years who were arrested on Good Friday, April 12, 1963. It was King's 13th arrest. =Martin Luther King Jr. jailed= Martin Luther King Jr., a year later in 1964, promoting the book Why We Can't Wait, based on his \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\" Martin Luther King Jr. was held in the Birmingham jail and was denied a consultation with an attorney from the NAACP without guards present. When historian Jonathan Bass wrote of the incident in 2001, he noted that news of King's incarceration was spread quickly by Wyatt Tee Walker, as planned. King's supporters sent telegrams about his arrest to the White House. He could have been released on bail at any time, and jail administrators wished him to be released as soon as possible to avoid the media attention while King was in custody. However, campaign organizers offered no bail in order \\"to focus the attention of the media and national public opinion on the Birmingham situation\\".Bass, p. 115. Twenty-four hours after his arrest, King was allowed to see local attorneys from the SCLC. When Coretta Scott King did not hear from her husband, she called Walker and he suggested that she call President Kennedy directly.McWhorter, p. 353. Mrs. King was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child when she received a call from President Kennedy the Monday after the arrest. The president told her she could expect a call from her husband soon. When Martin Luther King Jr. called his wife, their conversation was brief and guarded; he correctly assumed that his phones were tapped.Fairclough, p. 123. Several days later, Jacqueline Kennedy called Coretta Scott King to express her concern for King while he was incarcerated. Using scraps of paper given to him by a janitor, notes written on the margins of a newspaper, and later a legal pad given to him by SCLC attorneys, King wrote his essay \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\". It responded to eight politically moderate white clergymen who accused King of agitating local residents and not giving the incoming mayor a chance to make any changes. Bass suggested that \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\" was pre-planned, as was every move King and his associates made in Birmingham. The essay was a culmination of many of King's ideas, which he had touched on in earlier writings.Bass, p. 116-117. King's arrest attracted national attention, including that of corporate officers of retail chains with stores in downtown Birmingham. After King's arrest, the chains' profits began to erode. National business owners pressed the Kennedy administration to intervene. King was released on April 20, 1963. Conflict escalation =Recruiting students= Despite the publicity surrounding King's arrest, the campaign was faltering because few demonstrators were willing to risk arrest.McWhorter, p. 357. In addition, although Connor had used police dogs to assist in the arrest of demonstrators, this did not attract the media attention that organizers had hoped for.Eskew, p. 227-228. To re-energize the campaign, SCLC organizer James Bevel devised a controversial alternative plan he named D Day that was later called the \\"Children's Crusade\\" by Newsweek magazine. The term \\"Children's Crusade\\" has a notable history, originating from the 1212 Children's Crusade. D Day called for students from Birmingham elementary schools and high schools as well as nearby Miles College to take part in the demonstrations. Bevel, a veteran of earlier nonviolent student protests with the Nashville Student Movement and SNCC, had been named SCLC's Director of Direct Action and Nonviolent Education. After initiating the idea he organized and educated the students in nonviolence tactics and philosophy. King hesitated to approve the use of children,McWhorter, p. 364. but Bevel believed that children were appropriate for the demonstrations because jail time for them would not hurt families economically as much as the loss of a working parent. He also saw that adults in the black community were divided about how much support to give the protests. Bevel and the organizers knew that high school students were a more cohesive group; they had been together as classmates since kindergarten. He recruited girls who were school leaders and boys who were athletes. Bevel found girls more receptive to his ideas because they had less experience as victims of white violence. When the girls joined, however, the boys were close behind.Hampton, p. 131-132. Bevel and the SCLC held workshops to help students overcome their fear of dogs and jails. They showed films of the Nashville sit- ins organized in 1960 to end segregation at public lunch counters. Birmingham's black radio station, WENN, supported the new plan by telling students to arrive at the demonstration meeting place with a toothbrush to be used in jail.McWhorter, p. 360, 366. Flyers were distributed in black schools and neighborhoods that said, \\"Fight for freedom first then go to school\\" and \\"It's up to you to free our teachers, our parents, yourself, and our country.\\" =Children's Crusade= On May 2, 1963, 7th grader Gwendolyn Sanders helped organize her classmates, and hundreds of kids from high schoolers down to first graders who joined her in a massive walkout defying the principal of Parker High School who attempted to lock the gates to keep students inside.Eskew, p. 264. Demonstrators were given instructions to march to the downtown area, to meet with the Mayor, and integrate the chosen buildings. They were to leave in smaller groups and continue on their courses until arrested. Marching in disciplined ranks, some of them using walkie-talkies, they were sent at timed intervals from various churches to the downtown business area. More than 600 students were arrested; the youngest of these was reported to be eight years old. Children left the churches while singing hymns and \\"freedom songs\\" such as \\"We Shall Overcome\\". They clapped and laughed while being arrested and awaiting transport to jail. The mood was compared to that of a school picnic. Although Bevel informed Connor that the march was to take place, Connor and the police were dumbfounded by the numbers and behavior of the children.Eskew, p. 264-265.Nunnelley, p. 147. They assembled paddy wagons and school buses to take the children to jail. When no squad cars were left to block the city streets, Connor, whose authority extended to the fire department, used fire trucks. The day's arrests brought the total number of jailed protesters to 1,200 in the 900-capacity Birmingham jail. Some considered the use of children controversial, including incoming Birmingham mayor Albert Boutwell and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who condemned the decision to use children in the protests.Branch, p. 761-762. Kennedy was reported in The New York Times as saying, \\"an injured, maimed, or dead child is a price that none of us can afford to pay\\", although adding, \\"I believe that everyone understands their just grievances must be resolved.\\" Malcolm X criticized the decision, saying, \\"Real men don't put their children on the firing line.\\"Manis, p. 370. King, who had been silent and then out of town while Bevel was organizing the children, was impressed by the success of the children's protests. That evening he declared at a mass meeting, \\"I have been inspired and moved by today. I have never seen anything like it.\\"McWhorter, p. 368. Although Wyatt Tee Walker was initially against the use of children in the demonstrations, he responded to criticism by saying, \\"Negro children will get a better education in five days in jail than in five months in a segregated school.\\" The D Day campaign received front page coverage by The Washington Post and The New York Times. =Fire hoses and police dogs= When Connor realized that the Birmingham jail was full, on May 3 he changed police tactics to keep protesters out of the downtown business area. Another thousand students gathered at the church and left to walk across Kelly Ingram Park while chanting, \\"We're going to walk, walk, walk. Freedom ... freedom ... freedom.\\" As the demonstrators left the church, police warned them to stop and turn back, \\"or you'll get wet\\". When they continued, Connor ordered the city's fire hoses, set at a level that would peel bark off a tree or separate bricks from mortar, to be turned on the children. Boys' shirts were ripped off, and girls were pushed over the tops of cars by the force of the water. When the students crouched or fell, the blasts of water rolled them down the asphalt streets and concrete sidewalks.McWhorter, p. 370-371. Connor allowed white spectators to push forward, shouting, \\"Let those people come forward, sergeant. I want 'em to see the dogs work.\\" A.G. Gaston, who was appalled at the idea of using children, was on the phone with white attorney David Vann trying to negotiate a resolution to the crisis. When Gaston looked out the window and saw the children being hit with high-pressure water, he said, \\"Lawyer Vann, I can't talk to you now or ever. My people are out there fighting for their lives and my freedom. I have to go help them\\", and hung up the phone.McWhorter, p. 371. Black parents and adults who were observing cheered on the marching students, but when the hoses were turned on, bystanders began to throw rocks and bottles at the police. To disperse them, Connor ordered police to use German shepherd dogs to keep them in line. James Bevel wove in and out of the crowds warning them, \\"If any cops get hurt, we're going to lose this fight.\\" At 3 p.m., the protest was over. During a kind of truce, protesters went home. Police removed the barricades and re-opened the streets to traffic. That evening King told worried parents in a crowd of a thousand, \\"Don't worry about your children who are in jail. The eyes of the world are on Birmingham. We're going on in spite of dogs and fire hoses. We've gone too far to turn back now.\\" Images of the day Bill Hudson's image of Parker High School student Walter Gadsden being attacked by dogs was published in The New York Times on May 4, 1963. The images had a profound effect in Birmingham. Despite decades of disagreements, when the photos were released, \\"the black community was instantaneously consolidated behind King\\", according to David Vann, who would later serve as mayor of Birmingham.Hampton, p. 133. Horrified at what the Birmingham police were doing to protect segregation, New York Senator Jacob K. Javits declared, \\"the country won't tolerate it\\", and pressed Congress to pass a civil rights bill. Similar reactions were reported by Kentucky Senator Sherman Cooper, and Oregon Senator Wayne Morse, who compared Birmingham to South Africa under apartheid. A New York Times editorial called the behavior of the Birmingham police \\"a national disgrace.\\" The Washington Post editorialized, \\"The spectacle in Birmingham ... must excite the sympathy of the rest of the country for the decent, just, and reasonable citizens of the community, who have so recently demonstrated at the polls their lack of support for the very policies that have produced the Birmingham riots. The authorities who tried, by these brutal means, to stop the freedom marchers do not speak or act in the name of the enlightened people of the city.\\" President Kennedy sent Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall to Birmingham to help negotiate a truce. Marshall faced a stalemate when merchants and protest organizers refused to budge.Eskew, p. 270. =Standoff= Black onlookers in the area of Kelly Ingram Park abandoned nonviolence on May 5. Spectators taunted police, and SCLC leaders begged them to be peaceful or go home. James Bevel borrowed a bullhorn from the police and shouted, \\"Everybody get off this corner. If you're not going to demonstrate in a nonviolent way, then leave!\\" Commissioner Connor was overheard saying, \\"If you'd ask half of them what freedom means, they couldn't tell you.\\"Nunnelley, p. 152. To prevent further marches, Connor ordered the doors to the churches blocked to prevent students from leaving. By May 6, the jails were so full that Connor transformed the stockade at the state fairgrounds into a makeshift jail to hold protesters. Black protestors arrived at white churches to integrate services. They were accepted in Roman Catholic, Episcopal, and Presbyterian churches but turned away at others, where they knelt and prayed until they were arrested. Well-known national figures arrived to show support. Singer Joan Baez arrived to perform for free at Miles College and stayed at the black-owned and integrated Gaston Motel. Comedian Dick Gregory and Barbara Deming, a writer for The Nation, were both arrested. The young Dan Rather reported for CBS News.Nunnelley, p. 153. The car of Fannie Flagg, a local television personality and recent Miss Alabama finalist, was surrounded by teenagers who recognized her. Flagg worked at Channel 6 on the morning show, and after asking her producers why the show was not covering the demonstrations, she received orders never to mention them on air. She rolled down the window and shouted to the children, \\"I'm with you all the way!\\"McWhorter, p. 402. Birmingham's fire department refused orders from Connor to turn the hoses on demonstrators again,McWhorter, p. 387. and waded through the basement of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church to clean up water from earlier fire-hose flooding.McWhorter, p. 406. White business leaders met with protest organizers to try and arrange an economic solution but said they had no control over politics. Protest organizers disagreed, saying that business leaders were positioned to pressure political leaders.McWhorter, p. 388-390. =City paralysis= The situation reached a crisis on May 7, 1963. Breakfast in the jail took four hours to distribute to all the prisoners. Seventy members of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce pleaded with the protest organizers to stop the actions. The NAACP asked for sympathizers to picket in unity in 100 American cities. Twenty rabbis flew to Birmingham to support the cause, equating silence about segregation to the atrocities of the Holocaust. Local rabbis disagreed and asked them to go home.Eskew, p. 283. The editor of The Birmingham News wired President Kennedy and pleaded with him to end the protests. Fire hoses were used once again, injuring police and Fred Shuttlesworth, as well as other demonstrators. Commissioner Connor expressed regret at missing seeing Shuttlesworth get hit and said he \\"wished they'd carried him away in a hearse\\". Another 1,000 people were arrested, bringing the total to 2,500. News of the mass arrests of children had reached Western Europe and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union devoted up to 25 percent of its news broadcast to the demonstrations, sending much of it to Africa, where Soviet and U.S. interests clashed. Soviet news commentary accused the Kennedy administration of neglect and \\"inactivity\\".Cotman,p. 101-102. Alabama Governor George Wallace sent state troopers to assist Connor. Attorney General Robert Kennedy prepared to activate the Alabama National Guard and notified the Second Infantry Division from Fort Benning, Georgia that it might be deployed to Birmingham.Eskew, p. 282. No business of any kind was being conducted downtown. Organizers planned to flood the downtown area businesses with black people. Smaller groups of decoys were set out to distract police attention from activities at the 16th Street Baptist Church. Protesters set off false fire alarms to occupy the fire department and its hoses.Eskew, p. 277. One group of children approached a police officer and announced, \\"We want to go to jail!\\" When the officer pointed the way, the students ran across Kelly Ingram Park shouting, \\"We're going to jail!\\"Eskew, p. 278. Six hundred picketers reached downtown Birmingham. Large groups of protesters sat in stores and sang freedom songs. Streets, sidewalks, stores, and buildings were overwhelmed with more than 3,000 protesters.Cotman, p. 45. The sheriff and chief of police admitted to Burke Marshall that they did not think they could handle the situation for more than a few hours.Fairclough, p. 128. =Resolution= bomb explosion on May 11, 1963 On May 8 at 4 a.m., white business leaders agreed to most of the protesters' demands. Political leaders held fast, however. The rift between the businessmen and the politicians became clear when business leaders admitted they could not guarantee the protesters' release from jail. On May 10, Fred Shuttlesworth and Martin Luther King Jr. told reporters that they had an agreement from the City of Birmingham to desegregate lunch counters, restrooms, drinking fountains and fitting rooms within 90 days, and to hire black people in stores as salesmen and clerks. Those in jail would be released on bond or their own recognizance. Urged by Kennedy, the United Auto Workers, National Maritime Union, United Steelworkers Union, and the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) raised $237,000 in bail money ($ in ) to free the demonstrators.Garrow, (1989) p. 182. Commissioner Connor and the outgoing mayor condemned the resolution.Nunnelley, p. 157. On the night of May 11, a bomb heavily damaged the Gaston Motel where King had been staying‚Äîand had left only hours before‚Äîand another damaged the house of A. D. King, Martin Luther King Jr.'s brother. When police went to inspect the motel, they were met with rocks and bottles from neighborhood black citizens. The arrival of state troopers only further angered the crowd; in the early hours of the morning, thousands of black people rioted, numerous buildings and vehicles were burned, and several people, including a police officer, were stabbed. \\"Freedom-Now\\" Time, May 17, 1963 ; Glenn T. Eskew, But for Birmingham: The Local and National Struggles in the Civil Rights Movement (University of North Carolina Press, 1997), p. 301. By May 13, three thousand federal troops were deployed to Birmingham to restore order, even though Alabama Governor George Wallace told President Kennedy that state and local forces were sufficient.Cotman, p. 89‚Äì90. Martin Luther King Jr. returned to Birmingham to stress nonviolence. Outgoing mayor Art Hanes left office after the Alabama State Supreme Court ruled that Albert Boutwell could take office on May 21, 1963. Upon picking up his last paycheck, Bull Connor remarked tearfully, \\"This is the worst day of my life.\\"Nunnelley, p. 162. In June 1963, the Jim Crow signs regulating segregated public places in Birmingham were taken down. After the campaign Desegregation in Birmingham took place slowly after the demonstrations. King and the SCLC were criticized by some for ending the campaign with promises that were too vague and \\"settling for a lot less than even moderate demands\\".Fairclough, p. 129. In fact, Sydney Smyer, president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, re- interpreted the terms of the agreement. Shuttlesworth and King had announced that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15. Smyer then said that a single black clerk hired 90 days from when the new city government took office would be sufficient.Fairclough, p. 132. By July, most of the city's segregation ordinances had been overturned. Some of the lunch counters in department stores complied with the new rules. City parks and golf courses were opened again to black and white citizens. Mayor Boutwell appointed a biracial committee to discuss further changes. However, no hiring of black clerks, police officers, and firefighters had yet been completed and the Birmingham Bar Association rejected membership by black attorneys.Fairclough, p. 132-133. The reputation of Martin Luther King Jr. soared after the protests in Birmingham, and he was lauded by many as a hero.Branch, p. 803-806. The SCLC was much in demand to effect change in many Southern cities.Fairclough, p. 143. In the summer of 1963, King led the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom where he delivered his most famous speech, \\"I Have a Dream\\". King became Time's Man of the Year for 1963 and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. John F. Kennedy addressing the nation about Civil Rights on June 11, 1963 The Birmingham campaign, as well as George Wallace's refusal to admit black students to the University of Alabama, convinced President Kennedy to address the severe inequalities between black and white citizens in the South: \\"The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased cries for equality that no city or state or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.\\"Garrow, (1989) p. 239. Despite the apparent lack of immediate local success after the Birmingham campaign, Fred Shuttlesworth and Wyatt Tee Walker pointed to its influence on national affairs as its true impact.Fairclough, p. 133. President Kennedy's administration drew up the Civil Rights Act bill. After being filibustered for 75 days by \\"diehard southerners\\" in Congress, it was passed into law in 1964 and signed by President Lyndon Johnson.Franklin, p. 52. The Civil Rights Act applied to the entire nation, prohibiting racial discrimination in employment and in access to public places. Roy Wilkins of the NAACP, however, disagreed that the Birmingham campaign was the primary force behind the Civil Rights Act. Wilkins gave credit to other movements, such as the Freedom Rides, the integration of the University of Mississippi, and campaigns to end public school segregation.Fairclough, p. 134-135. Birmingham's public schools were integrated in September 1963. Governor Wallace sent National Guard troops to keep black students out but President Kennedy reversed Wallace by ordering the troops to stand down.Branch, p. 888-889. Violence continued to plague the city, however. Someone threw a tear gas canister into Loveman's department store when it complied with the desegregation agreement; twenty people in the store required hospital treatment.Branch, p. 868. Birmingham residents view the bomb-damaged home of NAACP attorney Arthur Shores on September 5, 1963. Four months after the Birmingham campaign settlement, someone bombed the house of NAACP attorney Arthur Shores, injuring his wife in the attack. On September 15, 1963, Birmingham again earned international attention when Ku Klux Klan members bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church on a Sunday morning and killed four young girls. FBI informant Gary Thomas Rowe was hired to infiltrate the KKK and monitor their activities and plans. Rowe was involved, along with the Birmingham Police, with the KKK attacks on the Freedom Riders, led by Fred Shuttlesworth, in Anniston, Alabama on May 14, 1961. In addition, Rowe and several other Klansmen also partook in the killing of Civil Rights activist Viola Liuzzo on March 25, 1965, in Lowndes County, Georgia after the Selma to Montgomery march. The Birmingham campaign inspired the Civil Rights Movement in other parts of the South. Two days after King and Shuttlesworth announced the settlement in Birmingham, Medgar Evers of the NAACP in Jackson, Mississippi demanded a biracial committee to address concerns there.Branch, p. 813. On June 12, 1963, Evers was fatally shot outside his home. He had been organizing demonstrations similar to those in Birmingham to pressure Jackson's city government. In 1965 Shuttlesworth assisted Bevel, King, and the SCLC to lead the Selma to Montgomery marches, intended to increase voter registration among black citizens. =Campaign impact= Historian Glenn Eskew wrote that the campaign \\"led to an awakening to the evils of segregation and a need for reforms in the region.\\" According to Eskew, the riots that occurred after the bombing of the Gaston Motel foreshadowed rioting in larger cities later in the 1960s.Garrow, (1989) p. 94. ACMHR vice president Abraham Woods claimed that the rioting in Birmingham set a precedent for the \\"Burn, baby, burn\\" mindset, a cry used in later civic unrest in the Watts Riots, the 12th Street riots in Detroit, and other American cities in the 1960s.McWhorter, p. 437. A study of the Watts riots concluded, \\"The 'rules of the game' in race relations were permanently changed in Birmingham.\\" Wyatt Tee Walker wrote that the Birmingham campaign was \\"legend\\" and had become the Civil Rights Movement's most important chapter. It was \\"the chief watershed of the nonviolent movement in the United States. It marked the maturation of the SCLC as a national force in the civil rights arena of the land that had been dominated by the older and stodgier NAACP.\\"White and Manis, p. 68. Walker called the Birmingham campaign and the Selma marches \\"Siamese twins\\" joining to \\"kill segregation ... and bury the body\\".White and Manis, p. 74 Jonathan Bass declared that \\"King had won a tremendous public relations victory in Birmingham\\" but also stated pointedly that \\"it was the citizens of the Magic City, both black and white, and not Martin Luther King Jr. and the SCLC, that brought about the real transformation of the city.\\"Bass, p. 226.

In an installment sale, the seller defers recognition of gain on the sale of a business or real estate to the tax year in which the related sale proceeds are received. In a structured sale, the seller is able to pay U.S. Federal income tax over time while having the seller's right to receive those payments guaranteed by a high credit quality alternate obligor. This obligor assumes the buyer's periodic payment obligation. Transactions can be arranged for amounts as small as $100,000. To fund its future payment obligation, the assignment company then purchases an annuity from a life insurance company, united states treasuries via a trust or other financial instrument. Case law and administrative precedents support recognition of the original contract terms after a substitution of obligors.See IRS Revenue Ruling 82-122, 1982-1 C.B. 80 (Jan. 1, 1982) (amplifying IRS Rev. Rul. 75-457); Wynne v. Commissioner, 47 B.T.A. 731 (1942), at ; and Cunningham v. Commissioner, 44 T.C. 103 (1965), at . In addition, proper handling of the transaction will help the parties avoid problems with constructive receipt and economic benefit issues. After Allstate Life stopped taking new annuity business in 2013, other structured sale opportunities arose. In lieu of annuities, United States Treasury obligations held in a trust (treasury funded structured settlements) are used to fund the future cash flows. Some companies use Key Man Life Insurance Policies in place of annuities, which provide the added protection of a death benefit to the seller and a payout that continues long after the seller passes. This arrangement may preferable when the seller is interested in passing wealth to the seller's beneficiaries after death. A Key Man Policy may also pay out more than an annuity in certain circumstances. While negotiating the installment payments, the seller is free to design payment streams with a great deal of flexibility. Each installment payment to the seller has three components: return of basis, capital gain, and ordinary income earned on the money in the annuity. Under the doctrine of constructive receipt, with a properly documented structured sale, no taxable event is recognized until a payment is actually received. Taxation is the same as if the buyer were making installment payments directly. Structured sales are an alternative to a section 1031 exchange. In a 1031 exchange, however, the seller is required to continue to hold some form of property. Structured sales work well for sellers who want to create a continuing stream of income without management worries. Retiring business owners and downsizing homeowners are examples of sellers who can benefit. The structured sale must be documented, and money must be handled in such a way that the ultimate recipient is not treated as having constructively received the payment prior to the time it is actually made. For the buyer, there is no difference from a traditional cash-and-title-now deal, except for additional paperwork. Because of tax advantages to the seller, structuring the sale might, however, make the buyer's offer more attractive. Because the buyer has paid in full, the buyer gets full title at time of closing. There are no direct fees to the buyer or seller to employ the structured sale strategy. Alternatives A sales method called the Installment sale and a Monetized Installment Sale, are variations of the Structured sale and is intended to protect the seller of a capital asset completely from the risk in connection with the buyer's creditworthiness. Confusion Created by Secondary Market Firms Some buyers of structured settlement payment rights have attempted to play off the popularity of the term structured sale to lure prospects for the sale of structured settlement payment rightshttps://structuredsettlements.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c520753ef0240a4b96c01200b-pi. The structured settlement specialist who implements the transaction is paid directly by the life insurance company that writes the annuity, or by the service provider for the treasury funded structured settlements. The internal rate of return is comparable to long term high quality debt instruments. Internal Revenue Service Private Letter Ruling 150850-07, dated June 2, 2008, confirmed the IRS position the taxpayer does not constructively receive payment for tax purposes until the actual cash payment is made pursuant to a properly drafted non-qualified assignment.

The diodes at A decode 1 of 12 lines to light the seven segment displays to show the hours 1 to 12. The transistors at B drive the decode diodes and displays. The diodes at C trigger one of the 12 pairs of transistors based on the state of the transistor flip-flops at D. Additional diodes in the chain of flip flops allow this to count hours. Diode logic (DL), or diode-resistor logic (DRL), is the construction of Boolean logic gates from diodes. Diode logic was used extensively in the construction of early computers, where semiconductor diodes could replace bulky and costly active vacuum tube elements. The most common use for diode logic is in diode‚Äìtransistor logic (DTL) integrated circuits that, in addition to diodes, include inverter logic to provide a NOT function and signal restoration. While diode logic has the advantage of simplicity, the lack of an amplifying stage in each gate limits its application. Not all logical functions can be implemented in diode logic alone; only the non- inverting logical AND and logical OR functions can be realized by diode gates. If several diode logic gates are cascaded, the voltage levels at each stage are significantly changed, so diode logic is normally limited to a single stage, though, in special designs, two-stage systems are sometimes achieved. Simplifying assumptions For illustration this discussion assumes idealized diodes that conduct in the forward direction with no voltage drop and do not conduct in the reverse direction. Logic design assumes two distinct levels of signals that are labeled 1 and 0. For positive logic the 1 represents the most positive level and 0 for the most negative level. For illustration in this discussion, positive logic 1 is represented by +6 volts and 0 volts represents logic 0. In binary logic the exact magnitude of the signal voltage is not critical and it is only necessary that 1 and 0 states be represented by detectably different voltage levels. In these examples at least one input of every gate must be connected to a voltage level providing the defined logic 1 or logic 0 levels. If all the inputs are disconnected from any driving source the output signal is not confined to the correct voltage range.  Diode logic gates  In logic gates, logical functions are performed by parallel or series connected switches (such as relay contacts or insulated gate FETs like CMOS) controlled by logical inputs or parallel resistors or diodes which are passive components. Diode logic is implemented by diodes which exhibit low impedance when forward biased and a very high impedance when reverse biased. There are two kinds of diode logic gates - OR and AND. It is not possible to construct NOT (invert) diode gates because the invert function requires an active component such as a transistor. =OR logic gate = A diode OR gate with positive logic truth table The image to the right shows a diode OR circuit. The diode symbol is an arrow showing the forward low impedance direction of current flow. All diodes have inputs on their anodes and their cathodes are connected together to drive the output. R is connected from the output to some negative voltage (-6 volts) to provide bias current for the diodes. If all inputs A and B and C are at 0 volts (logic level 0), current flowing through R will pull the output voltage down until the diodes clamp the output. Since these diodes are treated as ideal, the output is clamped to 0 volts, which is logic level 0. If any input switches to a positive voltage (logic 1), current flowing through the now forward-biased diode will pull the output voltage up, providing a positive voltage at the output, a logic 1. Any positive voltage will represent a logic 1 state; the summing of currents through multiple diodes does not change the logic level. The other diodes are reverse biased and conduct no current. If any input A OR B OR C is 1, the output will be 1. Only if all inputs, A and B and C are 0 will the output be 0. This is the definition of a logic OR. The truth table on the right of the image shows the output for all combinations of inputs. This can be written as: :A OR B OR C = OUTPUT ::or :A+B+C=OUTPUT In Boolean algebra the plus sign (+) is used to denote OR. R can return to any negative voltage. If R is connected to 0 volts it will have no drive current available to drive the next circuit; practical diodes need a bias current. In a practical circuit, all signal levels, the value of R and its return voltage are chosen by the circuit designer to meet the design requirements. =AND logic gate = A diode AND gate with positive logic truth table The diode AND is basically the same as the OR except it is turned upside down. The diodes are reversed so that the cathodes are connected to the inputs and the anodes are connected together to provide the output. R is connected to +12 volts to provide the forward bias current for the diodes and current for output drive. If all inputs A AND B AND C are a positive voltage (+6 volts here), current flowing through R will pull the output positive till the diodes clamp the output to +6 volts, the logical 1 output level. If any input switches to 0 volts (logical 0 level), current flowing through the diode will pull the output voltage down to 0 volts. The other diodes would be reverse biased and conduct no current. If input A or B or C is 0, the output will be 0. Only if all inputs, A AND B AND C are 1 will the output be 1. This is the definition of a logic AND. The truth table on the right of the image shows the output for all combinations of inputs. This can be written as: :A AND B AND C = OUTPUT ::or :A√óB√óC=OUTPUT (In Boolean algebra the multiplication symbol denotes AND.) Similar to the diode OR, R can return to any voltage that is more positive than the logic level 1. If R is connected to a voltage equal to the 1 level it will have no drive current available to drive the next circuit. All signal levels, the value of R and its return voltage are options chosen by the circuit designer to meet the design requirements. Negative logic The assignment of 1 and 0 to the positive and negative signal levels respectively is an option of the logic designer using the AND or OR circuits. With this assignment it assumes that the logic is positive. It is just as likely that the assignment might be the reversed where 1 is the negative voltage and 0 is the positive voltage. This would be negative logic. Switching between positive and negative logic is commonly used to achieve a more efficient logic design. In Boolean algebra it is recognized that a positive logic OR is a negative logic AND. Similarly a positive logic AND is a negative logic OR. This relationship can easily be recognized by reading the above description of their operation. In the OR it stated, ‚ÄúOnly if all inputs, A and B and C are 0 will the output be 0.‚Äù In negative logic each node at the lower voltage would become a logic 1, making the statement, ‚ÄúOnly if all inputs, A AND B AND C are 1 will the output be 1.‚Äù That is the definition of an AND function. Similarly for the AND it was stated, ‚ÄúIf input A or B or C is 0 the output will be 0.‚Äù In negative logic each node at the lower voltage would become a logic 1, making the statement, ‚ÄúIf input A OR B OR C is 1 the output will be 1.‚Äù That is the definition of an OR function. The logical function of any arrangement of diodes can only be established if the representation of logic states by voltage levels is known. United States Dept. of the Army, Communications-electronics Fundamentals: Digital Computers Field manual FM 11-72 1978, pages 3-17 through 3-22 Diode logic with real diodes Diode approximation of voltage vs. current The above descriptions assumed an ideal diode with zero resistance in the forward direction and infinite resistance in the reverse direction. The circuit designer must concern himself with real diodes. The articles p-n diode and a less detailed article p-n junction describe the physics of the PN diode. After all the discussion of electrons, holes, majority and minority carriers etc. each come down to an equation that most directly relates to the circuit designer. The real PN diode actually has a voltage current characteristic similar to the curve on the right. A more specific definition can be found in the Shockley diode equation. The designer of a reliable diode logic circuit is usually limited to what the diode specification provides which is often less than the equation suggests. Typically the specification will primarily provide a maximum forward voltage drop at one or more forward currents and a reverse leakage current. It will also provide a maximum reverse voltage limited by zener or avalanche breakdown. Typical worst case specifications are shown below for both germanium and silicon PN diodes. Germanium diode: :Max forward voltage at 10 mA = 1 volt @ 0 to 85 ¬∞C :Max reverse leakage current at 15 volts = 100 microamps @ 85 ¬∞C Silicon diode: :Max forward voltage at 10 mA = 1 volt @ 0 to 125 ¬∞C :Max reverse leakage current at 15 volts = 1 microamps @ 85 ¬∞C Effects of component manufacturing variations and temperature are usually included in these specifications. More realistically the germanium forward voltage might be 0.25 to 0.4 volts but this is often not specified. The silicon leakage current might be much lower, possibly 1 to 100 nanoamps. PN diodes also have transient behaviors that might be of concern with the design. The capacitance of a PN diode between anode and cathode is inversely proportional to the reverse voltage, growing as it approaches zero volts and into forward bias. There is also a recovery concern where the current will not decrease immediately when it is switched from forward bias to reverse bias. In the case of the diode OR if two or more of the inputs are at the 1 level and one switches to 0 it will cause a glitch or increase in current in the diodes that remain at 1. This can cause a short term dip in the output voltage. In practice if the diode logic gate drives a transistor inverter, as it usually does, and the diode and transistor are of similar construction the transistor will have a similar base collector capacitance that is amplified by the transistor gain so that it will be too slow to pass the glitch. Only when the diode is of a much slower construction will it become any concern at all. In one unusual design small selenium diode discs were used with germanium transistors. The recovery time of the very slow selenium diodes caused a glitch on the inverter output. It was fixed by placing a selenium diode across the base emitter junction of the transistor making it ‚Äúthink‚Äù it was a selenium transistor (if there could ever be one). Early diode logic with transistor inverter NAND and NOR DTL logic circuits as used on IBM 608 cards. The PNP and NPN transistor symbols are those used by IBM.IBM Customer Manual of Instruction: Transistor Component Circuits, p. 20, IBM, 1960. Up until 1952, IBM manufactured transistors by modifying off-the-shelf germanium diodes, after which they had their own alloy-junction transistor manufacturing plant at Poughkeepsie.Emerson W. Pugh, Lyle R. Johnson, John H. Palmer, IBM's 360 and Early 370 Systems, pp. 33-34, MIT Press, 1991 .Bo Lojek, History of Semiconductors, pp. 60-61, Springer Science & Business Media, 2007 . In the mid 1950s diode logic was used in the IBM 608 which was the first all- transistorized computer in the world. The image on the right shows two basic logic circuits used on 608 cards. A single card would hold four two-way circuits or three three-way or one eight-way. All input and output signals were compatible. The circuits were capable of reliably switching pulses as narrow as one microsecond. The designers of the 1962 D-17B used diode-resistor logic as much as possible, to minimize the number of transistors used.  Restoration  In cascaded AND-OR diode gates, the high voltage level is decreased more than two times. Digital logic implemented by active elements is characterized by signal restoration. True and false or 1 and 0 are represented by two specific voltage levels. If the inputs to a digital logic gate is close to their respective levels, the output will be closer or exactly equal to its desired level. Active logic gates may be integrated in large numbers because each gate tends to remove noise at its input. Diode logic gates are implemented by passive elements; so, they have two restoration problems. ;Forward voltage drop :The first restoration problem of diode logic is that there is a voltage drop VF about 0.6 V across the forward-biased diode. This voltage is added to or subtracted from the input of every gate so that it accumulates when diode gates are cascaded. In an OR gate, VF decreases the high voltage level (the logical 1) while in an AND gate, it increases the low voltage level (the logical 0). The feasible number of logic stages thus depends on the voltage drop and difference between the high and low voltages. ;Source resistance :Another problem of diode logic is the internal resistance of the input voltage sources. Together with the gate resistor, it constitutes a voltage divider that causes deviations in voltage levels. In an OR gate, the source resistance decreases the high voltage level (the logical 1) while in an AND gate, it increases the low voltage level (the logical 0). In the cascaded AND-OR diode gates in the picture on the right, the AND high output voltages are decreased because of the internal voltage drops across the AND pull-up resistances.Diode logic  Applications  Diode logic gates are used to build diode‚Äìtransistor logic (DTL) gates as integrated circuits. The outputs of conventional ICs (with complementary output drive stages) are never directly connected together since they act as voltage sources. However, diodes can be used to combine two or more digital (high/low) outputs from an IC such as a counter. This wired logic connection can be a useful way of producing simple logic functions without using additional logic gates.Integrated Circuits (Chips) Most circuit families are designed to have compatible inputs and outputs depending on these signal levels to achieve reliable performance. Adding diode logic will degrade the signal level and result in poor noise rejection and possible failure. Tunnel diodes During the 1960s the use of tunnel diodes in logic circuits was an active research topic. When compared to transistor logic gates of the time, the tunnel diode offered much higher speeds. Unlike other diode types, the tunnel diode offered the possibility of amplification of signals at each stage. The operating principles of a tunnel diode logic rely on biasing of the tunnel diode and supply of current from inputs over a threshold current, to switch the diode between two states. Consequently, tunnel diode logic circuits required a means to reset the diode after each logical operation. A simple tunnel diode gate offered little isolation between inputs and outputs and had low fan in and fan out. More complex gates, with additional tunnel diodes and bias power supplies, overcame some of these limitations. Tunnel Diodes for Switching and Microwave Applications Technical Manual TD-30, RCA 1963, (3rd Chapter) Switching Advances in discrete and integrated circuit transistor speed and the more nearly unilateral nature of transistor amplifiers overtook the tunnel diode gate and it is no longer used in modern computers.

From 1942 until 1982, the island was the site of the Coast Guard's recruiting training center (boot camp), enlisting and training hundreds of thousands of Coast Guardsmen including many of the 214,239 who served in the Pacific and European Theaters of World War II. The island is situated in the historic Brooklyn Basin, now known as Embarcadero Cove. It is within Alameda city limits, but is tied to land only via a bridge from Dennison Street in Oakland.

The functions and capabilities of the units remain as departments within Base Alameda. The facilities on Coast Guard Island also include an industrial service center, enlisted barracks, a medical and dental clinic, and public works facilities to service the island. History and formation Originally known as Government Island, this artificial island was formed in 1913 by the dredging project that extended the Oakland Estuary to San Leandro Bay. The Coast Guard first came to the island in 1926 when it established \\"Base 11\\" under an Executive Order signed in September 1931 that gave title to a tract for a permanent base. Improvements were started at that time and by 1933 included streets, utilities, spur tracks, a trestle bridge from Oakland, a transformer station, and rebuilding of the existing wharves. The cost was more than one and a half million dollars and provided facilities for Base 11 and the Coast Guard Store (warehouses). Establishment The shore establishment expanded in 1939 with the amalgamation of the Lighthouse Service. A training center was established in 1940 to meet the service's increased personnel needs. An area of was acquired from the City of Alameda in 1939 with an additional purchased by the U.S. Coast Guard in 1942. The entire island of was devoted to training center facilities. The first contract provided for five barracks, mess hall and galley, engineering and administration buildings, an infirmary, roadways, heating, plumbing, electrical and fire protection. The contract was awarded February 21, 1942 and completed June 30, 1942 at a cost of $1,680,082.94. Additional contracts for another half million dollars provided for additional barracks, clothing issue building, paving a drill field, band room, incinerator, anti-aircraft trainer building, and docks for small boats. Recruit Training Center The training center was first opened on June 1, 1942 with accommodations for 900 men. It was solely to train recruits. Specialty training was added later to include fireman, signalman, laundryman, radioman, boatswain's mate, cooks and bakers, and port security. After the war, Government Island remained a Coast Guard Training Center with addition of the Weather Bureau, Internal Auditors, and the Bureau of Roads. During the late 1960s the Training & Supply Center was the Coast Guard's largest field unit on the West Coast. The Training Center graduated 60-100 seaman apprentices and fireman apprentices each week. The Supply Center provided support to the western area districts including Squadron One and Squadron Three in Vietnam. The cutters Taney, Gresham, and Barataria were homeported on the island at the time. In 1982, the Training Center was closed and recruit training was moved to United States Coast Guard Training Center Cape May, New Jersey, where it remains today. Support Center Alameda was established June 1, 1982 and the island was renamed Coast Guard Island. The Coast Guard Pacific Area, Coast Guard 11th District (then known as Coast Guard 12th District), and Marine Safety Office San Francisco moved from downtown San Francisco to the island. On June 24, 1987, Maintenance & Logistics Command Pacific was established and located on the island until its decommissioning. The Support Center was redesignated as Integrated Support Command Alameda on March 15, 1996, and today is Base Alameda. Notable Commanders * World War II Era Rear Admiral A. J.

Early years Born in Dayton, Ohio, on November 1, 1946, Davis was raised in French Camp, California. His family had a long tradition of military service; his grandfather served in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, his father Robert Davis was in World War II, and his brothers Hubert (\\"Buddy\\") and Darrell Davis served in Korea and Vietnam, respectively. Davis attended Manteca High School in Manteca, California, where he was a member of the football and diving teams. He also participated in Sea Scouting in Stockton. After his junior year of high school, Davis' family moved to Indiana. He graduated from Mooresville High School in 1966. Military career Davis enlisted in the United States Army from Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1965. In March 1967, Davis was sent to South Vietnam as a private first class, and was assigned to Battery C, 2nd Battalion, 4th Artillery Regiment, 9th Infantry Division. On November 18, 1967, his unit at Firebase Cudgel () west of Cai Lay, fell under machine gun fire and heavy mortar attack by an estimated three companies of Viet Cong from the 261st Viet Cong Main Force Battalion, which swarmed the area from the south and then west. Upon detecting an enemy position, Davis manned a machine gun to give his comrades covering fire so they could fire artillery in response. Davis was wounded, but ignored warnings to take cover, taking over the unit's burning howitzer and firing several shells himself. He also disregarded his inability to swim due to a broken back, and crossed a river there on an air mattress to help rescue three wounded American soldiers. He ultimately found his way to another howitzer site to continue fighting the NVA attack until they fled. The battle lasted two hours.

It is a popular fishing and camping destination, and although it is surrounded by the Lincoln National Forest, it is not a part of the national forest. It is currently owned by the city of Alamogordo, New Mexico as their primary water source. Because of the high altitude, the lake's temperature is cold year round, and is home to an abundance of rainbow trout. The area around the lake has several campgrounds with hiking trails and streams. The area is now a part of the Lincoln National Forest, but in the late 19th century, the Southern Pacific Railroad owned most of the water rights in the area. In 1907 the railroad built a small dam in South Fork Canyon, upstream from the current dam. From that dam they extended a wooden pipeline to Pastura, New Mexico to provide water for the steam trains of the era.Killings Began Town's Slide, Lake Later Finished It Off The remnants of the original dam and pieces of the wooden pipeline are still visible to hikers along the trail in South Fork Canyon. By the 1920s, the railroad needed even more water, and they petitioned the Government of New Mexico to allow them to build another, larger dam along Bonito Creek. The engineers who surveyed the canyon determined that the best place to build a dam would be downstream from the town of Bonito, across a narrow spot in the canyon. This location would allow the dam to contain the water of two streams which merged just above the dam. This location, however, meant that the town of Bonito would be flooded by the dam's lake. The people living in Bonito were given land further down the canyon, and the entire town was moved downstream to a new location. The dam was completed in 1931,Seventy-Five Years of Progress - The Southern Pacific Railroad (1869-1944) and by 1933 the lake was completely filled. At full capacity, the lake contains 1,500 acre-feet of water. By the 1950s, steam locomotives had been replaced by diesel electric locomotives, and the railroad no longer needed the water from the lake. The railroad sold the lake to the city of Alamogordo, New Mexico, which needed a reliable water supply to provide the town's drinking water. A pipeline was built to Alamogordo's \\"La Luz\\" water treatment plant.CITY OF ALAMOGORDO 40-YEAR WATER SUPPLY PLAN Alamogordo still owns the dam and lake, but all of the land around the lake is a part of the Lincoln National Forest. The lake and the surrounding mountains are now popular for fishing, camping, and hiking. Little Bear Fire The 2012 Little Bear Fire caused flooding and other damage to Bonito Lake and the surrounding area. The lake has been closed to fishing since that time, and the campgrounds around the lake are also closed. The fire caused severe erosion in the watershed above the lake, and the lake was contaminated with sediment and ash from the fire. In the summer of 2015 engineers began the process of draining the lake in order to dredge it. The expected reopen date is currently unknown, but may be as late as 2019 or 2020.https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2017/03/27/bonito-lake- reopening-possible-2020/99709464/ On September 26, 2017 the Alamogordo city commissioners approved an $8.6 million contract to drain, dredge, and restore the lake. The city engineer estimated that it would take about 24 months for the work to be completed and the lake reopened.http://www.alamogordonews.com/story/news/local/2017/09/27/8-6-million- contract-awarded-bonito-lake-restoration-project/710642001/ References External links *History article about the town of Bonito * Reservoirs in New Mexico Bodies of water of Lincoln County, New Mexico Protected areas of Lincoln County, New Mexico Buildings and structures in Lincoln County, New Mexico Lincoln National Forest ","title":"Bonito Lake"},{"id":"4035611","text":"James or Jim Lardner may refer to: *James L.

His retrospective was exhibited at the Schaezlerpalais in 2019. In 1939, at the age of 20, Wolfgang joined the German Army and served as a communications officer in occupied Paris from 1940 to 1943, during which time he worked on his watercolours and first became exposed to surrealism. Later in the war, he became a reconnaissance airman in Norway, where he was captured at the end of the war and held for four months. He returned to Augsburg in 1945, and worked there as a freelance painter from 1945 to 1948. In 1949, however, the currency reform forced him to turn to construction work to make ends meet. He continued working on his landscapes, portraits and surrealist art while working construction jobs and odd jobs. From 1954 onwards, he was able to concentrate on his art. He married Franziska Link in 1949. Success with his freelance art led him to develop his surrealism, and in 1963 he participated in the Grosse Kunstausstellung M√ºnchen (the \\"Grand Art Exhibition Munich\\"), becoming a member of the Neue M√ºnchener K√ºnstlergenossenschaft (\\"New Munich Artists' Cooperative Society\\"). One-man shows in Germany and abroad followed. In addition to his surrealist work, the landscapes around Manfredonia, his second home in Apulia, Italy, inspired him to sometimes paint in an impressionistic style. In 1992, on the occasion of a retrospective exhibition at the Toskan Hall of Columns, he offered his paintings to the city of Augsburg on permanent loan. After the opening of the \\"Lettl Atrium - Museum for Surreal Art\\" in Augsburg in 1993, Lettl has concentrated on experiments in other media (including film), as well as continuing with his painting.

Feeding the multitude is a term used to refer to two separate miracles of Jesus reported in the Gospels. The first miracle, the \\"Feeding of the 5,000\\", is told by all four gospels (Matthew 14-; Mark 6-; Luke 9-; John 6-). It is the only miracle recorded in all four gospels. The second miracle, the \\"Feeding of the 4,000\\", with seven loaves of bread and fish, is reported by Matthew 15 () and Mark 8 (), but not by Luke or John. The Feeding of the 5,000 people The five loaves and two fishes (bottom), depicted on Moone High Cross, Ireland (10th century) The Feeding of the 5,000 is also known as the \\"miracle of the five loaves and two fish\\"; the Gospel of John reports that Jesus used five loaves and two fish supplied by a boy to feed a multitude. According to Matthew's gospel, when Jesus heard that John the Baptist had been killed, he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. Luke specifies that the place was near Bethsaida. The crowds followed Jesus on foot from the towns. When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their sick. As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, \\"This is a remote place, it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.\\" Jesus said that they did not need to go away, and therefore the disciples were to give them something to eat. They said that they only had five loaves and two fish, which Jesus asked to be brought to him. Jesus directed the people to sit down in groups on the grass. In Mark's Gospel, the crowds sat in groups of 50 and 100, and in Luke's Gospel, Jesus' instructions were to seat the crowd in groups of 50, implying that there were 100 such groups. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to Heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of broken pieces that were leftover. The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, beside women and children. In John's Gospel, the multitude has been attracted around Jesus because of the healing works he has performed, and the feeding of the multitude is taken as a further sign () that Jesus is the Messiah, the prophet who (according to the promise in the Book of Deuteronomy () ) is to come into the world\\" ().Meyer's New Testament Commentary on , accessed 15 March 2016 The Church of the Multiplication in Tabgha is the site where many Christians believe the feeding of the five thousand to have taken place.  The Feeding of the 4,000  This story, which appears only in Mark and Matthew, is also known as the miracle of the seven loaves and fish, as the Gospel of Matthew refers to seven loaves and two fish used by Jesus to feed a multitude.John Clowes, 1817, The Miracles of Jesus Christ published by J. Gleave, Manchester, UK, page 161 According to the Gospels, a large crowd had gathered and was following Jesus. Jesus called his disciples to him and said: > \\"I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three > days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or > they may collapse on the way.\\" His disciples answered: > \\"Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?\\" > \\"How many loaves do you have?\\" Jesus asked. \\"Seven,\\" they replied, \\"and two > fish.\\" Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground.

After Jesus had sent the crowd > away, he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan (or Magdala).  Analysis  Some commentators note the differences between some of the details of the accounts as a means of emphasizing that there were two distinct miracles: for example, the baskets used for collecting the food that remained were twelve 'Œ∫œåœÜŒπŒΩŒøŒπ' (hand baskets) in but seven 'œÉœÄœÖœÅŒØŒ¥ŒµœÇ' (large baskets) in . Cornelius a Lapide stated that a 'œÉœÄœÖœÅŒØœÇ' or 'large basket' was double the size of a 'Œ∫œåœÜŒπŒΩŒøœÇ'.Pulpit Commentary on An indication of the size of a 'œÉœÄœÖœÅŒØœÇ' is that the apostle Paul was let out of a building through a gap in the Damascus city wall inside one 'œÉœÄœÖœÅŒØœÇ' in order to avert a plot to kill him (Acts 9:25). In and Jesus distinguishes the two miracles in a conversation with his apostles. A similar miracle is celebrated by St Paul the apostle in .

The Musgrave Block (also known as the Musgrave Province) is an east-west trending belt of Proterozoic granulite-gneiss basement rocks approximately long. The Musgrave Block extends from western South Australia into Western Australia. The Musgrave Block is primarily exposed through the actions of the Petermann Orogeny at c. 535-550 Ma, which exhumed the orogenic belt along the Woodroffe Thrust.  Geomorphology of Quaternary deposits  The Musgrave Block is currently passive geologically, with surficial processes described as residual erosion. The area currently experiences on average less than 150mm (6 inches) of rainfall per annum, which provides little surface runoff and hence virtually no erosion. The landforms of the area are primarily composed of wide calcrete plains, often covered by Pleistocene Age aeolian deposits of sand dunes, sometimes reworked into ephemeral sheetwash fans. Outcrop is rare, restricted primarily to the igneous rocks of the Giles Complex and several granite domes, gneiss domes and isolated outcrops. This area is also a distinct physiographic province of the larger West Australian Shield. Palaeozoic rocks Several Palaeozoic to neoproterozoic sedimentary basins onlap the Musgrave Block, and are exposed mostly around its edges. These were derived from erosion of the Musgrave Block basement during the neoproterozoic to Permian. Proterozoic basement The Proterozoic of the Musgrave Block is composed of seven main classes of rocks: * Surficial volcanics of c.1050 to 1080 Ma, both mafic (Mummawarrawarra Basalt) and andesitic to rhyolitic (Tollu, Smoke Hill Volcanics) and the Bentley Supergroup volcanics and sediments of c. 1080 Ma * Large intrusive caldera type granite intrusive complexes (Palgrave, Skirmish Hill, Smoke Hill), possibly of c. 1050 and likely no older than 1080 Ma * Partly metamorphosed, rarely dissected c. 1080 Ma granite * Usually unmetamorphosed, rarely dissected granites of a c. 1050 intrusive suite * Partly metamorphosed, dissected intrusive rocks of the mafic-ultramafic c. 1080 Ma Giles Complex * Highly metamorphosed metagranites of the c. 1200 Ma suite * High-grade crystalline metamorphic basement rocks of c. 1550-1300 Ma age The Musgrave Block is flanked by several Proterozoic to Palaeozoic sedimentary basins, whose sedimentary history can elucidate the timing of tectonic events in the Musgrave Block post-1080 Ma. These include the Proterozoic Amadeus and Officer Basins. Events The most illustrating way of considering the Musgrave Block is as part of a time-space plot in which geological events are arrayed in time against rock units, stratigraphic relationships and for correlative purposes. The key events in the Musgrave Block are: * Protolith formation ~1550 Ma. Formation of crustal rocks of the Birksgate Complex, which are both mafic and felsic in composition. * Igneous event and orogeny ~1300 Ma inferred from geochronology and distribution of felsic ‚Äúvolcanic‚Äù supracrustal sequence of the high grade gneissesWhite, Clarke, Nelson, 1999, SHRIMP U‚ÄìPb zircon dating of Grenville-age events in the western part of the Musgrave Block, central Australia, 17(5), 465-481 * Musgravian orogeny at ~1200 Ma including generation of voluminous Kulgera Suite of granites and metamorphosis of the Birksgate Complex and ~1300 supracrustal sequence to amphibolite-granulite facies * Warakurna Large igneous province at 1076 ¬± 6 Ma including the intrusion of the Giles Complex and the Winburn Suite of granites, plus deposition of the Bentley Supergroup (including Tollu and Smoke Hill Volcanics) * Amata Dyke Suite at ~830-880 Ma * Petermann Orogeny, 535-550 Ma; marginal foreland basin formation, trending to crustal consolidation and quiescence * Permian glaciation and erosion of Petermann Orogeny mountains; deposition of Permian sequences in Officer and Amadeus basins * Intracontinental setting till present Granites and calderas There are three main phases of granite intrusion into the Musgrave Block: * Kulgera Suite at 1200 Ma * At ~1080Ma synchronous with the Giles Complex * Winburn Suite at ~1050Ma postdating the Giles Complex The Kulgera Suite is a widespread, voluminous suite of fractionated amphibole-bearing plagioclase rich tonalite to granodiorites of an I-type affinity (Stewart, 2003). They are dated at ~1200 Ma and are considered to be related to melting of the lower crust during the ~1200 Ma Musgravian Orogeny. The Windburn Suite is considered to be an anorogenic A-type granite suite produced by anatexis of the lower crust at ~1080 to 1050 Ma by the injection of the mafic Giles Complex intrusions. They are in most cases poorly fractionated, biotite-muscovite granites, with little hornblende, a high radiometric count and the presence of fluorine. The 1080 Ma granites and 1050 Ma granites can be distinguished on geochemical grounds, the latter is perhaps created by the above process, and the earlier suite a hybrid between A-type and I-type granites formed by assimilation and mixing. There are also significant granite caldera complexes, of many hundred square kilometres in area, which intrude the Musgrave Block. These are of the ~1050 Ma age, and are subvolcanic, possibly related to some of the ~1050 Ma volcanic rocks. =Palgrave Volcanic Association= The Palgrave Palgrave Volcanic Association is a large volcanic and granite caldera edifice of about 1500 square kilometres sandwiched between the Jameson Range Intrusion and the gneisses underlying the Bentley Supergroup volcanics. The caldera is in two parts, an overlying volcanic edifice composed primarily of porphyritic rhyolite and dacite with occasional vent complex agglomerates, which shows prominent circular ring-complex faults, and the Winburn Granite which underlies the caldera and is primarily exposed in the east as a pink, potassium-feldspathic porphyry granite, the lower margins of which are weakly tectonised. The whole caldera edifice is tilted to the southwest, which is why the Winburn Granite is exposed along the east and northeast. =Skirmish Hill Caldera= The Skirmish Hill Caldera is poorly exposed along the southern margin of the Musgrave Block and consists of granite and overlying? rhyolite. It has been traditionally seen as a potential source for the Tollu Volcanics. The caldera is truncated on the north by a north-dipping thrust fault and is probably tilted to the south. =Other calderas= Several other prominent gravity and magnetic highs are arranged along the Mugrave Block strike line, one of which was drilled by BHP in the 1990s through 300m of Permian glacial sediments. This caldera is composed of highly tectonised, stretched felsic volcanic rocks, interleaved with a significant thickness of equally sheared titaniferous differentiated mafic sills. The best interpretation of this, and probably also of the Palgrave Caldera is that they represent hot spots along the Musgrave Block where significant magma flux penetrated, formed volcanic calderas with large subvolcanic granite intrusions, and associated mafic volcanism. The relationship of the large granite calderas to the 1050-1080 Ma volcanics has been postulated as one in which the granite calderas were the source for the intermediate and felsic volcanic rocks. Bentley Supergroup The Bentley Supergroup Volcanics are a sequence of bimodal supracrustal volcanic rocks formed during the ~1080 Warakurna Large Igneous Province, and are widely considered comagmatic with the mafic to ultramafic Giles Complex intrusions. The Bentley Supergroup is composed primarily of bimodal volcanism, with several hundred-metres thicknesses each of alternating rhyolite and basaltic volcanism adding up to several kilometres true thickness in the area of the Warburton Range to the southwest of the Palgrave caldera. The Bentley Supergroup is divided into the Cassidy Group, Pussycat Group and Tollu Group. The prevailing theory of the formation of the Bentley Supergroup is that the Warakurna Large Igneous Province, primarily represented by the Giles Complex intruding into the lower crust, breached the crust and erupted voluminous basaltic lava flows, and when enough heat had been added to the crust by the massive intrusions below, intracrustal felsic and intermediate melts were produced, forming A-type intracontinental granites of the Winburn Suite, and the felsic volcanic rocks. This created the typical bimodal volcanic signature of the Cassidy Group and Pussycat Groups; the Tollu Group is a bit different, and it is considered the product of the large granite calderas which were formed immediately after the Giles Complex magmatism. Giles (1980) and earlier mappers have assigned the MacDougall Formation, overlying Mummawarrawarra Basalt, intermediate Smoke Hill Volcanics and the Tollu Volcanics to the Bentley Supergroup. There has been little real study done on the Bentley Supergroup Volcanics since the 1960s. Geochemical and petrological observations are few and far between or lacking comprehensive rare earth and trace elements suites. The Bentley Supergoup is poorly exposed in South Australia (if at all).

To date he was won thirteen East Coast Music Awards and one Canadian Folk Music Award. Cormier was born in London, Ontario and began playing guitar around age five. As a child he displayed an unusual ability to play a variety of instruments by ear and won a guitar contest at age nine. Appearances on Up Home Tonight, a television show devoted to bluegrass music, followed at age fourteen. Cormier has stated that he learned to play guitar by listening to such noted country / bluegrass musicians as Chet Atkins and Doc Watson. Other instruments J.P. has played on his albums include fiddle, twelve string guitar, upright bass, banjo, mandolin, drums, percussion, synthesizer, cello, tenor banjo and piano. By age sixteen Cormier had recorded his first album (a collection of bluegrass instrumentals) and he began working the U.S. festival circuit. This led him to move to the United States and to begin working as a session musician. He continued to perform live on the festival circuit and at the Grand Ole Opry with country artists Waylon Jennings, Marty Stuart, Earl Scruggs, Bill Monroe and others. In 1989 he attended the now-named Northeast Mississippi Community College in Booneville, Mississippi, where he majored in music education. At the time it was one of only three colleges in North America that offered a specialty in bluegrass instruments. During his stay at Northeast he began playing the dobro and piano. It was also during this time he first had the idea for the song \\"Northwind\\". Cormier was involved in a serious truck accident in 2009, resulting in a fractured vertebra and a halt to his touring in 2012. He went back into the studio, focused on his singer-songwriter abilities, and released Somewhere in the Back of My Heart in the same year. In April 2015 Cormier released a new album, The Chance, which included the previously released single Hometown Battlefield, about soldiers experiencing posttraumatic stress disorder. The song, inspired by Cormier's 2007 Afghanistan tour and news about soldiers' suicides, went viral, with millions of Facebook visits and 800,000 YouTube views (July 2015).

He was part of the Mexican muralism movement in subject matter but less so in style, favoring a non-figurative and later geometric style rather than a figurative, narrative style. M√©rida is best known for canvas and mural work, the latter including elements such as glass and ceramic mosaic on major constructions in the 1950s and 1960s. One of his major works, 4000m2 on the Benito Juarez housing complex, was completely destroyed with the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, but a monument to it exists at another complex in the south of the city. Life Carlos M√©rida was born Carlos Santiago Ortega in Guatemala City to Serapio Santiago M√©rida and Guadalupe Ortega Barnoya. He later changed his name what is known by as he thought it was more sonorous. His brothers and children also took the M√©rida name later on. He was of mixed Spanish/Maya-Quich√© heritage which he promoted during his life. As a young child, M√©rida had both music and art lessons, and his first passion was music, which led to piano lessons. From 1907 to 1909, the family went to live in the small town of Almolonga in the Quetzaltenango Department of Guatemala, where they were from. Here he continued music and art lessons. At age 15, a malformation of his ear caused him to lose part of his hearing, so his father steered him towards painting. He felt ‚Äúdefeated‚Äù by music but found art to be an acceptable substitute. After he completed middle school and the family returned to Guatemala City, he entered a trade school called the Instituto de Artes y Oficios, then the Instituto de Ciencias y Letras. Here he began to have a reputation for the avant garde. In 1919, he married Dalila G√°lvez, with whom he had two daughters, Alma and Ana. She was from a wealthy family and understood M√©rida‚Äôs aspirations although her parents had reservations about the marriage. She died ten years before him in 1974. Mer√≠da‚Äôs first trip to the United States was in 1917, where he met writer Jos√© Juan Tablada. M√©rida made several trips to Europe over his lifetime to both study art and work as an artist and diplomat. His early trips in the 1920s and 1930s put him in touch with both avant garde movements in Europe as well as noted Latin American artists, especially those from Mexico. His last trip was in 1950s. In 1963, he donated canvases, graphic pieces and mural sketches to the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico. M√©rida was one of a number of artists such as Diego Rivera and Gerardo Murillo who became committed to promoting the handcrafts and folk art of Mexico and Central America, with a particular interest in those of Guatemala, often featuring Mayan textiles or elements in their decoration in his artwork. He died in Mexico City at the age of 94 on December 21, 1985. Career M√©rida‚Äôs art career began when he was still a teenager. His family‚Äôs move back to Guatemala City put him in touch with various artists and intellectuals. At age nineteen, he approached Catalan artist and writer Jaime Sabart√©s, who helped M√©rida organize his first individual exhibition at the offices of the El Economista newspaper in Guatemala City in 1910. As there was little opportunity for artists in Guatemala, in 1910, M√©rida traveled to Paris with a friend named Carlos Valenti on a German cargo ship. From then until 1914, he lived and worked in Paris and traveled much of Europe. This put him in touch with European avant garde artists such as Van Dagen, Amedeo Modigliani, Pablo Picasso and Piet Mondrian as well as Latin American artists studying in Europe such as Diego Rivera, Jorge Enciso, √Ångel Z√°rraga and Dr. Atl. He exhibited his work in venues such as the Independent Salon and the Giroux Gallery in Paris. For unknown reasons, his traveling companion committed suicide in his studio, which affected M√©rida deeply and temporarily losing interest in art. He was helped in overcoming this by Roberto Montenegro. In 1914, M√©rida returned to Guatemala and saw his country in a different light, becoming fascinated in the folklor \\"diversidad\\"/> His second exhibition in Guatemala was at the Rosenthal Building in 1915, an exhibition which marks the beginning of modern painting in Guatemala. His time with Mexican artists in Europe prompted him to go to Mexico in 1919, when the fighting from the Mexican Revolution had ended but there was still disorder. He arrived to the country a year before Diego Rivera returned from Europe.Cardoza y Arag√≥n, p 17. M√©rida is noted for both easel and mural works. His first exhibition in Mexico was in 1920 at the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes. In that same year, he exhibited in the United States at the Hispanic Society of New York. He participated in a collective show called the Independent Artists Exhibition in New York in 1922 and exhibited individually at the Academia Nacional de Bellas Artes in Guatemala and the Valentin Dudesing Gallery in New York in 1926. In the 1930s and 1940s, the reputation of Mexican painting was rising; however, M√©rida still needed to work to get his paintings sold. One reason for this was that his work differed from that of the Mexican muralists and was often not well received by critics. M√©rida has forty five exhibitions in the United States and eighteen in Mexico from 1928 to 1948. These included an exhibition with Rufino Tamayo at the Art Center of New York (1930), the John Becker and Valentine galleries in New York (1930), the Club de Escritores de M√©xico and the Galer√≠a Posada in Mexico City (1931), the Stedhal Gallery and the Stanley Rose Gallery in Los Angeles, the East West Gallery in San Francisco, the Palacio de Bellas Artes and the Georgette Passedoit and Cuchnitz galleries in New York (1939-1940) as well as the International Surrealist Exhibition in 1940 in Mexico City. He worked intensely in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s producing designs, graphic works, scenographic sketches for dance, and tapestries, playing with geometric variants. Other venues for his exhibitions included Harvard University, the Berkeley Art Museum at the University of California in Berkeley, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. In 1954 he exhibited at the Museo de Bellas Artes in Caracas. His important works include Alcalde de Almolonga, Buc√≥lica, Im√°genes de Guatemala (portfolio), Danzas de Mexico (album), Carnaval en M√©xico (album), Mexican costume (album), Trajes regionales mexicanos (album), Trajes ind√≠genas de Guatemala (album), La virgen y las fieras, Divagaciones pl√°sticas alrededor de un tema azteca (series), Estilizaci√≥n de motivos mayas and La mestiza de Guatemala. M√©rida‚Äôs early monumental work was related to Mexican muralism, one reason he relocated to Mexico at the end of the Mexican Revolution. There he joined a group called the Renacimiento Mexicano (Mexican Renaissance) and then worked with Diego Rivera as an assistant at the Bolivar Amphitheater (San Ildefonso College) along with Jean Charlot, Amado de la Cueva, and Xavier Guerrero. He also painted Caperucita roja y los cuatro elementos at the children‚Äôs library of the Secretariat of Public Education in the 1920s. In the late 1940s, he worked on murals again, at the Secretaria de Rucursos Hidraulicos and the children‚Äôs area of the Miguel Alem√°n housing complex with Mario Pani. This prompted an interest in a concept called ‚Äúplastic integration‚Äù combining art and architecture. In 1950 he returned to Europe, studying Venetian mosaic techniques in Italy. His next major project with Pani was for the Benito Ju√°rez housing project covering 4,000m2. The concept of this project was to have the works clearly visible to cars passing by the buildings. However, this work was destroyed along with most of the housing complex in the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. A monument to the Juarez project was created by a student of M√©rida, Alfonso Soto Soria, at the Fuentes Brotantes housing complex in the south of Mexico City using the plans of the original work. Other projects of this type included the glass mosaic murals at the Reaseguros Alianza Building in Mexico City (1953), the artwork at the Torre Banobras in the center of Tlatelolco, the Cine M√°car and the Museo Nacional de Antropolog√≠a (1964). In Guatemala, he also created murals and other monumental works including the Palacio Municipal of Guatemala City (La mestiza de Guatemala,), the Chancellery of Guatemala (Glorificaci√≥n de Quetzal, 1955), the Instituto Guatemalteco de Seguridad Social, at the Cr√©dito Hipotectario Nacional and at the Bank of Guatemala (1956). Center part of the mural by Carlos M√©rida at the Municipal Palace of Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico In addition to canvas and murals, M√©rida also worked in education. In 1932, he founded the dance school of the Secretariat of Public Education with Carlos Orozco Romero and invited the participation of other artists such as Agust√≠n Lazo, Leopoldo M√©ndez, Silvestre Revueltas and Blas Galindo. He ran the school for three years working with dancers such as Gloria and Nellie Campobello, Graciela Arriaga, Anna Sololow, Waldeen, Gloria Contreras, Evelia Beristain, Rosa Rayna and his own daughter Ana M√©rida. For M√©rida dance was a way to express what painting and music could not. His daughter Ana studied at the school and became a noted Mexican choreographer. This interest in dance led him to design stage set and costumes for twenty two works from 1940 to 1979. He was particularly interested in indigenous dance, documenting 162 of them, some completely pre-Hispanic. In addition, in 1942 he was invited to teach fresco painting at the North Texas State Teacher‚Äôs College in Denton, today the University of North Texas . In 1957 M√©rida won the acquisition prize at the IV Bienal de S√£o Paulo, Brazil. His first major recognition was in 1958, when he received the Order of the Quetzal from the Guatemalan government. This was following by the naming of an annual arts prize of the Instituto de Bellas Artes of Guatemala after him, and the Orden al M√©rito Cultual y Artistico also from Guatemala. His first retrospective was in 1966, organized by the Bank of Guatemala. He participated in the III Bienal de Grabado Latinoamericano in San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1974 and the Panorama Art√≠stico de la Gr√°ficia at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in 1979. In 1980 he received the Orden del √Åguila Azteca the highest honor Mexico gives to foreigners. The Palacio de Bellas Artes held important retrospectives in 1981 and again in 1992. Since his death, there have been other events to honor his work including a retrospective at the Museo Metropolitano in Monterrey (2000), a retrospective at the Instituto de Artes Gr√°ficas de Oaxaca (2008), another at the Museo Modelo de Ciencia e Industria (2010), and the Ana Lucia G√≥mez Gallery in Guatemala City held an homage to the artist (2011). M√©rida‚Äôs work can be found in major public and private collections around the world. Artistry Carlos M√©rida is best known for his canvas and mural works, most of which was done in Mexico. However, he also did engraving, set design and mosaic work. His artistic direction has been compared to that of Rufino Tamayo, generally rejecting large-scale narrative paintings, preferring canvas, being more interested in becoming a painter than in politicsCardoza y Arag√≥n, p 32. (with an exception in the 1950s when he was horrified by nuclear testing). He experimented with color and form as well as techniques. Music and dance were lifelong interests and they influenced his paintings with rhythmic, poetic and lyrical pieces. He had three major epochs, a figurative period from 1907 to 1926, a surrealism phase from the late 1920s to the mid-1940s and from 1950 until his death, geometric forms characterized his work. His early work is marked by experimentation.Cardoza y Arag√≥n, p 31. He was in Europe when the avant garde was transitioning from Impressionism to Cubism and he was influenced by the works of Modigliani and Picasso. His surrealist phase again came from time in Europe, meeting not only Paul Klee and Mir√≥ but also fellow Guatemalan Luis Cardoza y Arag√≥n. At this time, he abandoned his former figurative style and became one of Mexico¬¥s first non-figurative artists, leaning to abstractionism and separating him from other Mexican artists. This focus on the non-figurative continued into his later work, but with focus on geometric elements, especially those linked to New World indigenous cultures such as the Maya. His work is considered highly intellectual, not representing things, but rather a concept of them. Salvador Novo wrote ‚ÄúThe pre Hispanic world, in Carlos M√©rida, attains a perfect synthesis, an ideal sublimation of numeric rhythm sprung from geometry. The debt owed by the abstract painting of our time to Carlos M√©rida is thus as great as his work is perennially solid and relevant. While heavily influenced by trends in Europe, especially his earlier work, M√©rida felt it important to emphasize his American (New World) identity and culture. He fused European Modernism with forms and subjects specific to the Americas. One reason for this was that in Europe he found that European artists were not interested in what was happening on the other side of the Atlantic. He became convinced of the need to establish natively American art which would express the ‚Äúoriginal character which animates our nature and our race will inevitably engender a personal artistic expression.‚Äù His work reflects on both the Mayan and Aztec civilizations along with the colonial period representing the indigenous as symbols of post Revolution Mexico. He even integrated indigenous amate paper in to some of his works. While part of Mexican muralism, he predated it slightly by promoting indigenous motifs seven years before Rivera led Mexican painting to fame. Luis Cardoza y Aragon called him a pioneer of Latin American art, painting elements such as indigenous people, Mexican and Central American landscapes without oversentimenalizing which had not been done before.Cardoza y Arag√≥n, p 12. This emphasis on the New World not only was expressed with folkloric images, especially in his early work, but also in his later work. The discovery of Bonampak motivated him deeply, taking new ideas from the ruins and eventually led to his interest in integrating painting and sculpture into architecture.

The Yurchenko was named after Soviet gymnast Natalia Yurchenko in 1982 during a competition in Moscow. The first gymnast to actually perform it in a competition was Viktor Levinkov, a male Russian gymnast, who was the original inventor of the Yurchenko. In a Yurchenko vault, the gymnast does a round-off onto the springboard and a back handspring onto the horse or vaulting table. The gymnast then performs a salto, which may range in difficulty from a simple single tuck to a triple twist layout. The Yurchenko gave birth to a new vault group called \\"Round off with or without 1/2 to 1/1 turn (180-360 degrees) in entry phase (Yurchenko entry) - Salto forward or backward with or without long axis turn in second flight phase.  Variations  Any vault with a roundoff-back handspring entry is classified as a \\"Yurchenko-style\\" vault in the Code of Points. Many variations of the original vault have been introduced by gymnasts in international competitions. Even as of 2019, gymnasts and coaches continue to develop more difficult versions of the Yurchenko. Backhandspring entry (off the table): * Dungelova: Roundoff, back handspring entry; tucked salto bwd with 2/1 turn (720¬∞) off * 1¬Ω twisting Yurchenko: Roundoff, back handspring entry; one and a half twisting layout. Abbreviated as 1.5Y. * Baitova (more commonly referred to as Double Twisting Yurchenko): Roundoff, backhandspring entry; double twisting layout. Abbreviated as DTY. * Amanar/Shewfelt (2¬Ω twisting Yurchenko): Roundoff, back handspring entry; two and a half twisting layout.

List of some vault values for reference: * Yurchenko back tuck - 9.5 ** Yurchenko back tuck 1/2 - 9.8 ** Yurchenko back tuck 1/1 - 9.9 ** Yurchenko back tuck 1.5 - 10.0 * Yurchenko back pike - 9.6 ** Yurchenko back pike 1/2 - 9.9 ** Yurchenko back pike 1/1 - 10.0 * Yurchenko back layout - 9.75 ** Yurchenko back layout 1/2 - 9.95 ** Yurchenko 1/2 front layout - 9.95 ** Yurchenko back layout 1/1 - 9.95 ** Yurchenko back layout 1.5 - 10.0 ** Yurchenko back layout 2/1 - 10.0 ** Yurchenko back layout 2.5 - 10.0 * Yurchenko 1/2 on front tuck - 9.9 ** Yurchenko 1/2 on front tuck 1/2 - 10.0 ** Yurchenko 1/2 on front tuck 1/1 - 10.0 * Yurchenko 1/2 on front pike - 10.0 * Yurchenko 1/2 on front layout - 10.0 * Yurchenko 1/2 on front layout 1/2 - 10.0 * Yurchenko 1/1 on back tuck - 10.0  Deductions  Compared to the other events, vault has the fewest elements being performed as there are only few skills in comparison to, for instance, a floor routine which could have a variety of skills involved in the routine. = Landings = Landing are treated the same as the other events although they can be treated a bit harsher due to there being less benefit of the doubt of a short landing or sticks; those may be forgiven at the end of a bar or beam routine, but they will not be overlooked after a vault. Small steps will get 0.05 off and larger/lunges will get 0.1 off. Hops are also treated harshly due to it looking as though there was a lack of control. Small hops such as bunny hops or little bounces in place typically only get 0.05 off. A hop in place is not considered a stick and points will be deducted accordingly. Landing short, for example landing too far forward and piked down, looking as though the full flip was incomplete, will be deducted along with any other additional steps. Uncontrolled landings or huge bounds and or lunges will get hit with multiple tenth deductions. = Pike Shape and Bent Knees = Most vaults are attempted in a layout position and on those judges are looking for a perfectly straight body. If performing a layout position and there is a pike, deductions can be made depending on where in the rotation there is a pike and the severity of it and the deduction could be more than 0.05. If the pike occurs right before the landing, there is a possibility that it will be overlooked and they can get away with it. The term \\"flaring\\" means that a gymnast is opening and extending their arms at the end of the rotation to slow themselves down to get prepared for their landing. This both looks pretty and also shows that the gymnast is spatially aware and they have more than enough time to land their vault without landing in a triangular shape. If going for a piked vault, many are worried that they will be in too much of a piked position and getting deducted for being piked in the landing position. = Amplitude = Flight off the table is judged critically as it is necessary for the gymnast to show their repulsion off of the table and a high completion of the vault. If the amplitude is not reached they could end up landing short and get deductions as said before. There is no specific height that must be reached, but all necessary twists/rotations must be completed with at least the gymnasts hip being at the level or above the table.

Nesbitt. Cullen was born with achondroplasia - a type of dwarfism.2003 Memorandum submitted by Claire M Jordan: on behalf of the late Eric Cullen, criticising the role of certain papers in reporting the story, including the Sunday Mail article below. Early life He was born to a single mother and was adopted by a family from Hamilton. He was diagnosed with achondroplasia at the age of seven. Acting career Cullen began acting when he was at school. He started to find roles appearing in several theatre groups before appearing in several Scottish TV programmes in the 1980s, particularly A Kick Up the Eighties. Cullen eventually found lasting fame playing the youngest son, Wee Burney, in the first three series of Rab C. Nesbitt. However, he left the programme in December 1993; owing to personal problems and citing ill health. Victim of abuse Cullen was sexually abused by a violent paedophile ring from the age of thirteen, and since his condition meant that he looked much younger than he was, this abuse continued into his twenties. Once he became a successful actor, his abusers returned to extort money with menaces. As a result, he developed clinical depression. Child campaigner Cullen was arrested in 1993 for possession of child pornography, and the subsequent police investigation and press coverage left him suffering acute clinical depression when he \\"finally cracked under a load which had become unbearable\\".The Herald 30 June 1995 The Eric Cullen case revealed the actor's disturbing history. A victim of abuse and success In 1995, Cullen was convicted of child pornography offences, and his own history of being sexually abused since the age of 13 was revealed. His nine-month prison sentence was reduced to three years' probation on appeal. As soon as his prison sentence had been quashed on appeal, he began to be offered acting parts again, but he was still too ill with severe posttraumatic stress disorder to resume work. Once the court case was out of the way Cullen dedicated himself to campaigning against child pornography, and to trying to bring his abusers to justice. Of the three men he named as his principal abusers one, Francis Currens, was jailed during Cullen's lifetime; one, Cullen's uncle Jack Williams, was jailed after his death (both of them for sexual offences including the repeated rape of young boys); and as of summer 2006 one, whom Cullen named as the ringleader, has never been prosecuted. Death Only a day or two before his fatal heart attack, which followed on from surgery for a twisted bowel, he had been asked to take up the role of Wee Burney again. He was however in two minds as to whether to resume his acting career or become a Clinical Psychologist specialising in the treatment of abuse victims; he already had a BA in psychology, and had been accepted to begin a more advanced course in Forensic Psychology that autumn.

Oui ceased publication in 2007. (\\"Oui\\" is French for \\"yes\\".)  Playboy years  Oui was originally published in France under the name Lui by Daniel Filipacchi (first French issue November 1963), as a French equivalent of Playboy.Aaron Latham, \\"Rabbit, Run\\", New York, Nov 27, 1972, p.54St√©phane Groueff, \\"My Odyssey\\", iUniverse, 2003, , p. 574 In 1972, Playboy Enterprises purchased the rights for a U.S. edition, changing the name to Oui, and the first issue was published in October of that year. Jon Carroll, formerly assistant editor at Rolling Stone magazine and editor of Rags and later editor of The Village Voice, was selected as the first editor.Carroll, Jon: \\"Strange Days at The Playboy Mansion\\", San Francisco Chronicle, April 09, 1996Carroll, Jon: \\"Strange Days at The Playboy Mansion (Part II)\\", San Francisco Chronicle, April 10, 1996Carroll, Jon: \\"Sex and Magazines\\" JONCARROLLPROSE October 14, 2016 Arthur Kretchmer, the editor of Playboy, however, had a role in ensuring that editorial choices would be in line with Hugh Hefner's vision.Carroll, Jon: \\"Windy City legend hangs up his cleats\\", San Francisco Chronicle, September 16, 2002Carroll, Jon: \\"Arthur Kretchmer tried to warn me\\", San Francisco Chronicle, September 17, 2002 The intention was to differentiate the audience in mass-market men's magazines, in an attempt to answer the challenge brought by Penthouse and Hustler, with its more explicit photography and therefore compete on multiple fronts. At first Playboy considered a direct response by following Penthouse in a nudity escalation, but Playboy management was hesitant to alter the magazine's philosophy, based on a more 'mature' and 'sophisticated' audience (one-third of Playboys readership at that time was estimated to be over 35 \\"Hefner's Grandchild\\" Time, August 28, 1972). Instead, a separate publication, Oui, was introduced in order to pursue a younger readership, offering a combination of a \\"rambunctious editorial slant with uninhibited nudes pictured in the Penthouse mood.\\" \\"Adventures in the Skin Trade\\", Time, Jul. 30, 1973  Article content  In the late seventies, Oui published some interesting articles, including \\"Is this the man who ate Michael Rockefeller?\\" (April 1977) by Lorne Blair (lately famous for the Ring of Fire documentaries), beginning with a photograph of a grinning New Guinea native, told by the intrepid anthropologist/reporter who journeyed to New Guinea, interviewed people who had known Michael Rockefeller, then ventured into the jungle and talked to members of the tribe from whom Rockefeller had bought native art artifacts, including totem poles. In the end, he found a man who claimed he had eaten the unfortunate collector. Oui also hosted several reportages about Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) activity, like the article \\"CIA vs. USA ‚Äì The Agency's Plot to Take Over America\\" by Philip Agee, about an alleged Operation PBPrime, whose leaders were the top four men in the Central Intelligence Agency and whose target was the control of the U.S. government. In a more humorous vein, Oui also published the essay \\"The 3 Most Important Things in Life\\"\\"The 3 Most Important Things in Life\\" at harlanellison.com by Harlan Ellison in its November 1978 issue. The three things in question were sex, violence and labor relations, each illustrated by anecdotes from Ellison's life. The sex anecdote involved a less-than- successful assignation with a young woman, the violence anecdote was about witnessing a murder in a movie theater during a screening of Save the Tiger, and the labor relations anecdote was Ellison's version of the story of his being fired after only one morning at The Walt Disney Company for jokingly suggesting the making of a pornographic cartoon using the primary Disney characters. The piece has since been republished in Ellison's Stalking the Nightmare and Edgeworks 1. Oui also published short fiction. A 1977 interview by Peter Manso of the then 29-year-old emerging actor Arnold Schwarzenegger on issues like sex, drugs, bodybuilding and homosexuality produced some embarrassment 25 years later to candidate Schwarzenegger in the 2003 California gubernatorial campaign.\\"Schwarzenegger has 'no memory' of lewd 1977 interview - Candidate says he never lived 'to be a politician'\\" Thursday, August 28, 2003 CNN  Post Playboy years  Despite its popularity, Oui was unable to produce a profit. Furthermore, management realized that Oui was taking more readers from Playboy than from Penthouse.Steven Watts, Mr Playboy: Hugh Hefner and the American Dream, John Wiley and Sons, 2009Susan Gunelius, Building Brand Value the Playboy Way, Palgrave Macmillan, 2009Elizabeth Fraterrigo, Playboy and the Making of the Good Life in Modern America, Oxford University Press, 2011 So, in June 1981 Playboy Enterprises, based in Chicago, ended its Oui experiment. The magazine was sold to Laurant Publishing Ltd. in New York; its new president and chief operating officer was Irwin E. Billman, former executive vice president and chief operating officer of the Penthouse Group.Dougherty, Philip H. New York Times, June 12, 1981 Initially, Laurant featured celebrity nudity in Oui, peaking in 1982 with pictorials of Linda Blair, Demi Moore and Pia Zadora. The 1990s found the magazine focusing on pop culture and youth-centered topics, with rock musician interviews and an increasingly large comics section that included R-rated versions of the X-rated Carnal Comics: True Stories of Adult Film Stars line, Rip Off Press' Demi the Demoness (later the first adults-only comic character to be adapted as a live action film), and a serialized version of Jay Allen Sanford's illustrated book Triple-X Cinema: A Cartoon History. The magazine subsequently experienced a significant decline in circulation. As had many of its competitors, Oui expanded its photo content to hardcore in the early 2000s, which included depictions of couples having sexual intercourse, including explicit penetration.

Distributed by Track Records, the album was named John Entwistle's Rigor Mortis Sets In in the U.S. Co-produced by Entwistle and John Alcock, it consists of three Fifties rock and roll covers, a new version of the Entwistle song \\"My Wife\\" from The Who's album Who's Next, and new tracks (only six of the ten songs were new). Rigor Mortis Sets In set in motion John Entwistle assembling his own touring unit during the increasing periods of The Who's inactivity. Bearing the dedication \\"In Loving Memory of Rock 'n' Roll 1950‚Äì‚àû: Never Really Passed Away Just Ran Out of Time\\", Entwistle's affection for Fifties rock and roll was evident by covers of \\"Mr. Bass Man\\", \\"Hound Dog\\", and \\"Lucille\\". As George Lucas had released American Graffiti at the same time as Rigor Mortis Sets In was released, creating a huge market for Fifties nostalgia, Entwistle's timing was uncannily prescient. In Entwistle's original material for the album, light whimsy prevailed over the darker (and more creative) vein of Smash Your Head Against the Wall and Whistle Rymes. The album was completed in less than three weeks, ultimately costing $10,000 in studio time and $4,000 on liquor bills.John Entwistle - So Who's The Bass Player? The Ox Anthology Liner Notes The cover art of the gatefold LP features on one cover an outdoor photo of a grave, whose heart-shaped headstone is engraved with the dedication described above, while the grave's footstone is inscribed \\"V.S.O.P.\\" (a grading acronym for cognac). The opposite cover features a wooden coffin bearing a brass plate engraved with the album's name. The UK (Track) LP used the coffin on the cover and the gravestone on the inner gatefold, while the U.S. (MCA) LP had the opposite arrangement. Compact disc releases have been fronted with Track's original coffin cover, with the gravestone cover proportionally preserved inside as part of the liner notes. Rigor Mortis Sets In had a rough launch due to its title and cover art. BBC Radio refused to play the album and banned it, ironically in part due to the influence of DJ Jimmy Savile who had just suffered a death in his family. The album's U.S. debut was problematic for MCA Records (Track's new American distributor), who insisted on appending the artist's name to the title, out of concern that the album's sales would be weak without the Entwistle name in the title. Critical reception The album was rated by AllMusic as a \\"Nosedive\\" in his career compared to Smash Your Head Against the Wall and Whistle Rymes. His covers of \\"Hound Dog\\" and \\"Lucille\\" were so \\"lifelessly performed that it sounds like the band is merely attempting to imitate Sha Na Na instead of sending up the original tunes themselves\\". The song that was known as the biggest offender in this respect was \\"Mr. Bass Man\\" which replaces the enthusiasm of Johnny Cymbal's original version with a self-consciously campy production built on cutesy vocals guaranteed to make listeners grind their teeth. The album was more positively received by John Rockwell of the New York Times. In a 1973 article about solo albums released by members of popular bands, Rockwell said that the album found Entwistle \\"working effectively in a straight-ahead fifties idiom that the Who themselves have long since abandoned.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/05/archives/when-egos-rock-the- groups-pop-when-egos-rock-the-groups.html Track listing All songs by John Entwistle, except where noted. =Bonus tracks= Personnel *John Entwistle - lead vocals, bass guitar, electric guitar, keyboards *Alan Ross - electric guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, accordion, trumpet, synthesizer; lead vocals (2) *Jim Ryan - lead guitar *Tony Ashton - keyboards, Hammond organ, piano *Bryan Williams - trombone, electric organ (6, 8) *Howie Casey - saxophone (1, 3, 4) *Members of The Ladybirds: **Gloria George - backing vocals **Maggie Stredder - backing vocals **Marian Davies - backing vocals *Graham Deakin - drums, percussion (5, 6, 8) ;Technical *Mike Weighell - engineer  References  1973 albums John Entwistle albums Track Records albums ","title":"Rigor Mortis Sets In"},{"id":"4035869","text":"Atabey is a town and district of Isparta Province in the Mediterranean region of Turkey.

Royal Asiatic Society Sen retired from the University in 1964.  Work  He joined the University of Calcutta as a lecturer in 1930, where he served as a professor for thirty four years. He became the second Khaira Professor in the Department of Comparative Philology after his mentor, Suniti Kumar Chatterji, in 1954. After assuming this title, the department attracted many scholars from India and abroad to study and conduct research. Sen was the first scholar to explore the Old Indo-Aryan syntax in his book, Use of Cases in Vedic Prose (1928), and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit (1928). He later analysed the syntax of Middle Indo-Aryan in An Outline of Syntax of Middle Indo-Aryan (1950). He contributed significantly to Bengali literature, addressing themes ranging from mythology, the Puranas and crime to horror. Sen's crime stories were compiled in the book Galpa Samgraha (2009). He published numerous significant articles and research papers. These include the Bangla Sahityer Itihas (5 Vol 1939, 1991), Bhashar Itibritta (1939, 1993), A History of Brajabuli Literature (1935), A Comparative Grammar of Middle Indo-Aryan (1960), Ramkathar Prak Itihas (1977), Bangla Sthannaam (1982), Bharat Kathar Granthimochan (1981), Bharatiya Arya Sahityer Itihas (1963, 1992) and Women's Dialect in Bengali (1923). Bhashar Itibritta is the first book in the Bengali language on Indo-Aryan and Indo-European historical linguistics. In this book, he postulated Jharkhandi as the fifth dialect of the Bengali language. His book Bangala Sahitye Gadya (1934) remains the best example of a systematic, stylistic description of the literary dialect of the language. The Etymological Dictionary of Bengali (in two volumes, 1971) is one of the largest works on historical etymology in any Indian language. Bangala Sahityer Itihas was also a monumental contribution. Rabindranath Tagore commended the book and wrote the preface. The English edition was published by the Sahitya Akademi in 1960. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru wrote the foreword for this book. His autobiography was 'Diner Pore Din Je Gelo' (The Days Pass By).  Recognition  The Royal Asiatic Society of London honoured him with a Jubilee Gold Medal in 1984, making him the first Asian to receive the prize. Other prizes include the Rabindra Puraskar (1963), Ananda Puraskar (1966, 1984), Vidyasagar Puraskar (1981), Desikottam (1982), and the Padma Bhushan (1990).

Developed by Sportvision and PVI Virtual Media Services, it is best known for generating and displaying a yellow first down line over a live broadcast of a football gamemaking it easier for viewers to follow play on the field. The line is not physically present on the field, and is seen only by the television audience. 1st & Ten is sometimes used generically to refer to the class of systems capable of adding first down lines and similar visual elements, and not just the Sportvision system. However, PVI's competing system is more accurately named L-VIS, for Live Video Insertion System. Over time, usage has evolved. Some football broadcasts change the color of the line from yellow to red on 4th down, or show a second computer-generated line (usually blue in color) that marks the line of scrimmage. Lines can also be projected to show other types of field position, including markings for the red zone and the optimum maximum distance for a placekicker's statistical field goal range. In extreme weather situations, an entire virtual field with yard and boundary markers can be projected onto the field in order to allow league officials, broadcasters and viewers some way to follow action when all field markings are obscured by snow, fog or mud.

U.S. Patent 5,953,076 \\"System and method of real time insertions into video using adaptive occlusion with a static reference image\\" History and development The idea of creating an on-field marker to help TV viewers identify first down distances was conceived and patented in 1978 by David W. Crain, US Patent 4,084,184 \\"TV Object locator and image identifier\\" David W. Crain who presented the concept to Roone Arledge and Roger Goodman of ABC News and Sports and to the CBS Technology Center. At the time, both decided the broadcast industry was not ready to use Crain's invention. \\"At ABC Sports, we have an unwritten rule that graphics cannot be inserted between the viewers and the action on the field,\\" Roger Goodman stated at the time. In 1998, ESPN programmer Gary Morgenstern and others revived the idea. ESPN's NFL coordinating producer, Fred Gaudelli, was tasked with overseeing an implementation for his network. The 1st & Ten line was first broadcast by Sportvision, a private company, during ESPN's coverage of a Cincinnati Bengals-Baltimore Ravens game on September 27, 1998. How Stuff Works - the first down line A few weeks later, on Thanksgiving Day in 1998, Princeton Video Image (PVI) aired its version of the virtual yellow down line on a CBS broadcast of a Pittsburgh Steelers‚ÄìDetroit Lions game. \\"Football made simpler\\" by Glen Dickson, Broadcasting & Cable, June 07, 1999 Four years later, SportsMEDIA introduced a third version during NBC coverage of a Notre Dame game. The rivalry between PVI and Sportvision began with a collaboration. In July 1995, PVI had successfully used its L-VIS (Live Video Insertion System) match moving technology to broadcast virtual advertising behind the home plate on a local broadcast of a Trenton Thunder baseball game. In January 1996, Roy Rosser, director of special projects at PVI, saw Sportvision's FoxTrax puck on the broadcast of the 1996 NHL All-Star Game and realized that a combination of L-VIS and FoxTrax would allow virtual insertions in a wider range of situations than either could do on its own, given the power of affordable computers. He contacted Stan Honey, CTO at Sportvision, and the two companies undertook a joint demonstration of their combined technologies during the 1996 World Series between the Atlanta Braves and the New York Yankees at the Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium. The test was not a success and the two companies parted ways, each developing complementary systems that were eventually used to broadcast Sportvision's \\"First and Ten\\" line and PVI's \\"Yellow Down Line\\".Sportvision, Inc. and Fox Sports Productions, Inc. v. Princeton Video Image, Inc., Civil Action No. 99-CV-20998 (N.D. Cal.) In October 1999, SportVision sued PVI alleging that PVI's virtual signage, first down line and other products infringed Fox/Sportvision patents. In August 2001, PVI counterclaimed against Sportvision in the federal court action, alleging that Sportvision's virtual strike zone and virtual signage products infringed a PVI patent. In 2002, the companies settled the lawsuits out of court through a cross-licensing deal. Sportvision, Fox and PVI Settle Patent Litigation; \\"Lawsuits Resolved By Cross-Licenses and Interference Not Pursued, Business Wire\\" February 21, 2002  Before the game  Each football field has a unique crown and contour and is not perfectly flat in order to facilitate drainage, so a 3D model is made of the field prior to the game. Due to the low amount of change throughout a football season, this 3D model is usually only generated once a season at most. It also has a unique color palette, typically various shades of green, depending on the type of surface (i.e. real or artificial grass) and the weather (e.g. bright, shady or even snowing). In addition, after cameras are set up, the position of the camera relative to the field is established to be used in conjunction with the previously created 3D model of the field.  Cameras  There are usually a number of cameras shooting the field, but typically only three or four main cameras are used for an American football broadcast (one on the fifty-yard line, and one on each twenty-yard line, with most high profile games also having a Skycam, as described below). The cameras with video that will be used with the graphics system have electronic encoders within parts of the camera assembly (in the lens and the moving platform the camera sits on, sometimes called a \\"panhead\\") that monitor how the camera is used during the game (pan, tilt, zoom, focus and extender). The encoders transmit that info live 30 or more times per second to the broadcaster's production truck, where it is processed by Sportvision computers (typically one for each camera). A camera with this type of extra hardware is usually called an \\"instrumented\\" camera. This information helps keep the yellow 1st & ten line in the proper place without being distorted whenever the camera follows the players or the ball. In the larger productions, several other cameras can be \\"instrumented\\" to work with the graphics system, but these are usually restricted to following additional types: a camera usually placed in a high position to see all twenty-two men on the field, typically called the \\"all 22\\" camera, and a camera shooting from above one end zone, called an \\"end zone camera\\", or in the industry often just \\"camera 4\\". The Skycam (or moving camera attached to cables above the field) can also be used to draw a yellow line over its video, but the mechanism has some major differences from the typical \\"instrumented\\" camera.  Crew  For the initial implementation, there were seven computers in total and a crew of four. Recent implementations require around four computers, one computer per camera plus a shared computer for chroma-keying and other tasks, that can be run by a single operator (although two is optimal). The primary operator usually uses a KVM to switch between camera computers and has an extra monitor, keyboard, and mouse setup for the chroma-keying computer. Of the original four-member crew, two members, one inside the stadium and one in front of a computer, communicated the position of the real first down line to make sure everything was working. The third crew member was a troubleshooter. The last crew member monitored the various colors that make up the color palette onto which the line is drawn. In recent setups only a single operator is required for all cameras. The operator clicks on the ball in the video to set the line of scrimmage and right-clicks where the first down line should be (or presses a button to automatically position it 10 yards in the direction of play). If lighting conditions don't change that much, the primary operator can also monitor chroma-key settings, but often a secondary operator is used when conditions get too variable.  Data  Each set of camera encoders on a camera transmits orientation and zoom data to an aggregator box that translates the digital information into modulated audio where it is sent down to the corresponding camera computer in the truck. This data is synchronized with the video from that camera. At the camera computer the camera position data is demodulated back to digital data for use by the program that draws the \\"yellow line\\" over the video. Separately, the chroma-keying computer is told what colors of the field are okay to draw over (basically grass) and that information is sent to the camera computers.  The old way  The first computer in the truck gathers all the separate readings from the cameras and transmits a single, consolidated data stream to the central computer. The central computer takes these readings, the 3D field model and color palette, the knowledge of which camera is on the air, and together using a geometrical calculation determines which pixels in the video frame would make up the first down line. All pixels that are obstructed by a player, a referee, the ball or any other object are identified and not included in the calculation. This will ensure that the 1st & Ten line will be projected only onto the field. The PVI Virtual Media system relies on a single spotter to relay the down and distance, and a single operator at the studio as their vision system does not need camera data to perform the insertion. The primary operator of the Sportvision system does the spotting by merely clicking on the video to place the line.  Technology errors  The only pixels that should change are the ones that are the same color as the field, typically several shades of green. As a result, there are a few situations that are difficult. One is when the player's uniform color nearly matches that of the field (for example, the Green Bay Packers' jersey on a bright, sunny day, or for Bronco Stadium at Boise State University, where the field and the home team uniform share the same blue shade). The other is when the field itself changes, like during a rain/snow storm or if the grass field becomes very muddy. In those cases, the field's color palette would need to include brown and/or white shades. The most difficult situations are when the shade of the field is constantly changing as in situations where moving clouds are shadowing the field on some spots, but not others, but continue to move across the field. The data collection and computation also requires time. The audio feed goes to an audio delay to be synchronized with the delayed video. The total delay for the viewer from the live feed ends up being about 2/3 of a second.  Final result  After the camera computer has determined which pixels represent the 1st & Ten line, it takes that pixel information and draws the yellow line in video format at around 60 times per second (depends on video refresh frequency). A 2011 study conducted by SportVision determined the yellow line has an average margin of error of 1.38 inches compared to the official first down marker. In recent years the system has been upgraded to add more features. During Fox broadcasts, the Sportvision system also generates an arrow-like graphic on the field with down and distance text information inside of an arrow pointing in the direction of play. Competitors have also added this feature in recent years. Additionally, the Sportvision system can also place virtual graphics that have another embedded video feed inside them like a video picture frame. This is sometimes called \\"video-in-perspective\\". This technology is also the basis for showing ads where they may not appear (i.e. behind home plate in baseball during national broadcasts), and Race F/X in which images can be displayed on the race track, and info can follow a specific car, no matter what the camera does. This technology is used by CBS, ESPN, Fox, NBC, NFL Network, RDS, TSN, and TNT.

Prior, \\"Plato and the 'Socratic Fallacy'\\", Phronesis 43(2) (1998), pp. 97‚Äì113. is a logical fallacy, identified by William Frankena in 1939, that involves the definition of one property in terms of another. Overview The philosopher William Frankena first used the term definist fallacy in a paper published in the British analytic philosophy journal Mind in 1939. In this article he generalized and critiqued G. E. Moore's naturalistic fallacy, which argued that good cannot be defined by natural properties, as a broader confusion caused by attempting to define a term using non-synonymous properties. Frankena argued that naturalistic fallacy is a complete misnomer because it is neither limited to naturalistic properties nor necessarily a fallacy. On the first word (naturalistic), he noted that Moore rejected defining good in non-natural as well as natural terms. On the second word (fallacy), Frankena rejected the idea that it represented an error in reasoning - a fallacy as it is usually recognized - rather than an error in semantics. In Moore's open-question argument, because questions such as \\"Is that which is pleasurable good?\\" have no definitive answer, then pleasurable is not synonymous with good. Frankena rejected this argument as: the fact that there is always an open question, merely reflects the fact that it makes sense to ask whether two things that may be identical in fact are. Thus, even if good were identical to pleasurable, it makes sense to ask whether it is; the answer may be \\"yes\\", but the question was legitimate. This seems to contradict Moore's view which accepts that sometimes alternative answers could be dismissed without argument, however Frankena objects that this would be committing the fallacy of begging the question.

Her twelfth and latest book is When Johnny and Jane Come Marching Home: How All of Us Can Help Veterans, which won the 2011 American Publishers Award for Professional and Scholarly Excellence in the Psychology category. Since the 1980s, Caplan has been concerned that psychiatric diagnoses are unscientific, that giving someone a psychiatric label does not reduce their suffering, and that labeling them carries enormous risks of harm. Caplan has outwardly addresses her concerns to the public. In her book, They Say You‚Äôre Crazy: How the Worlds most Powerful Psychiatrists Decide Who‚Äôs Normal, Caplan discusses the nature of diagnosis and how the DSM contributes to the unique faults of psychiatry. She has sought to educate the public about the unregulated nature of psychiatric diagnosis and the consequent lack of recourse for people who have been harmed by getting such labels, including the stark fact that getting a psychiatric diagnosis and label often actually stands in the way of recovery.

Humula Station, which is just outside the town, is one of Australia's most historic farming and grazing properties. Humula was once named \\"American Yards\\" or \\"American Fields\\" during the gold rush, where many Chinese came for gold years ago. At the 2016 census, Humula had a population of 124 people. Although Humula is a small town, it has its own fire brigade, public school,p and a recreation ground. After surviving many fires including the latest in February 2006, Humula is still in one piece. Murraguldrie Post Office opened nearby on 20 March 1874 and was replaced by a Humula office in 1888. Humula has been around for well over 100 years. Older buildings include the butcher's shop at the end of Mate Street, the Humula Public School on School Street, and the ruins of the old Humula Hotel. In earlier years, Humula's town centre was on the southern side of the two creeks running through the town, but following a huge fire which burnt down the Humula Hotel, and several floods which cut the town in half, the town centre was relocated to the north of the creeks. Humula once had a police station at the end of School Street. In the late 1970s and 1980s, Humula's activity and population peaked when logging was the main industry in the area. The Humula sawmill employed many people; when it closed Humula became almost a ghost town. The Sports Club is the only business still operating. Outside the town is Humula's large farming area, most of which has been converted to pine plantations. The Post Office closed several years ago and the General Store continued in a much smaller role until about 2016.

Long line ups are a common sight at the restaurant, which made the restaurant build a footbridge over the highway to provide access for guests from the southbound side. The restaurant's hamburger patties are also sold at Loblaws outlets. As of 2009, Webers is reported to sell approximately 8000 hamburgers on a typically busy Friday. The restaurant is open weekends from Thanksgiving until Christmas, but closed from January to March break. History Webers was opened on July 11, 1963, by Paul Weber Sr., to cater to cottage goers. By the 1970s, it became so popular that patrons on the opposite side of the highway would often risk injury running across the street to the restaurant. In 1981, the province built a traffic barrier along the median of the highway in an effort to stop the jaywalking. Even so, travellers heading toward Toronto climbed over the waist- high wall to get their food. The following year, the province took further precaution by erecting a fence on top of the barrier. In 1983, Paul Weber Jr., the founder's son, bought a footbridge from a Toronto lawyer that was being used as part of the CN Tower's SkyWalk over Front Street to provide safe access to southbound travelers. This bridge has the distinction of being the first and only privately owned bridge spanning a public highway in Ontario. In 1987, Webers installed three CN train cars, retrofitted to house their own meat processing facility. They have since added five train cars, one of which is used as an eatery. The founder's sons eventually took over the business before their father's death in 1994. Webers opened up additional restaurants in Barrie in the late 1980s; one in Orillia, off the highway, in 1995; and two outlets in Toronto Pearson International Airport in the late 1990s. These restaurants have since closed, leaving only the original location on Highway 11. In 2005, Webers began selling frozen hamburgers through Loblaws. Paul Weber Jr. sold the company in 2004 to Guelph businessman Tom Rennie, to spend more time with his family. This gave Rennie rights to the Webers name, and control of the Highway 11 flagship location as well as the outlets at Pearson. John Weber, the founder's other son, retained control of the locations in Orillia and Barrie. Since the additional restaurants closed their doors, Rennie became the sole owner of Webers. The Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, visited Webers on July 19, 2018 after visiting the Tim Hortons Memorial Camp in Parry Sound.

Musical styles They have also been described as gamewave and nintendocore. Their songs typically sampled video game, or video game inspired, sounds and while being based in rock, are heavily electronic as well. They have a total of 22 official releases, albums and singles. They maintained an indie career throughout their years, and were never a hot selling band among the visual kei scene, mainly due to their uncompromising approach to their sound. History Metronome's claim to fame is that they travelled from the future‚ÄîThe year 2005, to be exact. Because they were getting bad record sales in 2005, they decided to travel back in time to 1998, thus boosting sales via their \\"futuristic\\" sound and look. In a 2007 interview, Talbo-1 Fukusuke mentioned how they stopped with saying they were from the year 2005 as said year neared. The band apparently had thought they wouldn't still be around by the time 2005 rolled around. They split in 2009 for unknown reasons. Later in 2016 the band got back together after being asked if during band members solo projects if they would perform covers of Metronome song which they responded that if they were to perform Metronome songs they were going to do it right. This led to their first single since their break up being released. The next year they released a new full-length album.

In the film, Aki, played by Akiko Wakabayashi, is a female ninja agent with the fictional Japanese Secret Intelligence Service (SIS).  Creation  Aki's Toyota 2000GT Open-Top on display at the Toyota Automobile Museum. It was ranked as the seventh best car in the James Bond series by Complex in 2011. Aki does not appear in Ian Fleming's 1964 novel. She was originally named Suki in Roald Dahl's screenplay. According to The James Bond Films, the character was \\"Dahl's tribute to the Japanese woman of the Sixties\\".Steven Jay Rubin, The James Bond Films: A Behind the Scenes History (p.75) The character is portrayed as an attractive female Japanese SIS agent, a skilled ninja and an expert driver who often uses her skills at driving her white Toyota 2000GT sports car equipped with several high-tech communication devices. Mie Hama was cast to play Suki, but she had trouble learning English; to solve the problem, she and Akiko Wakabayashi, originally cast to play the part of almost-silent Kissy Suzuki, decided to swap their respective roles. Wakabayashi then convinced director Lewis Gilbert to change the name of her character to Aki.Paul Simpson, The Rough Guide to James Bond (p.11)  Character  Aki is first seen when 007 meets her at a sumo wrestling show. Bond is there to meet a contact who will take him to Mr. Henderson, M's recommended contact in Japan. He confirms that Aki is his contact by saying the code words \\"I love you\\" to her. Aki takes Bond to meet Henderson in her car. After Henderson is killed during their meeting, Bond attacks and kills one of Henderson's killers. Taking the man's place, he is driven to the Osato Chemical Works HQ, where he is discovered by the villains. Aki rescues him, using her skills as a driver, then takes him to meet her boss, Tiger Tanaka. It is after this meeting that a bikini-clad Aki invites Bond to spend the night with her, famously saying \\"I think I will enjoy very much serving under you\\", before Bond carries her to bed. The next morning, Bond returns to the Osato Chemical Works and meets Blofeld's henchman Mr. Osato. Leaving after the meeting, he is pursued by SPECTRE gunmen, from whom Aki rescues him again. The gunmen chase Aki's car and she leads them out into the countryside, where a SIS helicopter lifts the gunmen's car off the road with a giant magnet and drops it into the sea (in 2012, Complex ranked it as the sixth best James Bond chase scene). She then takes him to a quayside to investigate a ship he suspects is being used by the villains. When investigating the ship Bond and Aki are attacked by SPECTRE henchmen. Bond tells her to leave and report to Tanaka; Aki refuses to leave Bond at first, but eventually complies. Aki next appears after Bond is captured and almost killed by Helga Brandt, when she meets with him back at Tanaka's headquarters and Bond is about to go on another mission that she cannot accompany him on. When Bond returns to the base in Kyoto, Aki meets him there to discuss the plan to disrupt SPECTRE's plot. She had hoped to play the part of Bond's \\"wife\\" in the cover operation, however this was vetoed as she was not a native of the Ama island. This proves to be a fortunate decision as Aki never makes it to the island at all. On Blofeld's orders Osato had sent ninja assassins to kill Bond, one of whom stealthily enters the bedroom where Bond and Aki are sleeping together and tries to poison Bond by dripping poison down a thread. (Dahl took inspiration for this by watching a similar scene in the first film in the Shinobi no Mono ninja film series.) Bond, however, moves in his sleep and at the last moment Aki moves to his position and unwittingly takes the poison instead. Her subsequent gasping wakes Bond who kills the assassin before tending to Aki, who dies soon after. The scene was accompanied by the musical track \\"The Death of Aki\\" by John Barry. Despite the relationship they had built up, Bond does not appear to be strongly impacted by Aki's death and neither he nor Tanaka mention her again. By this point Aki had largely fulfilled her role and once she is dead the way is clear for the introduction of Kissy Suzuki as Bond's \\"wife\\". Though Kissy appears the less experienced of the two, unlike Aki she survives the mission and she and Bond enjoy their victory together.  Reception  Various lists frequently ranked Aki among the best Bond girls ever, including as tenth by Zimbio in 2008 (\\"So beautiful you almost forget that Sean Connery has been ridiculously made up to look Japanese. Almost\\"),Top 20 Hottest Bond Babes, Zimbio, 23 September 2008. ninth by Postmedia News the same year (\\"Kissy Suzuki is considered the 'main' Bond girl in this film, but Aki has a bigger role and is more memorable\\"),From Octopussy to Jinx: The Best of the Bond Girls, Canada.com, 14 November 2008 and eight by WagerWeb in 2009 (\\"Hot Japanese agent, she kicks ass and look damn fine doing it. Besides, she dies to save James Bond, you have to give her some extra credit for that\\"). According to UGO, \\"although Akiko Wakabayashi is charming in the role, her chemistry with Bond is disappointing, and she lacks both the look and the attitude to make her a good Bond girl,\\" but in another article UGO praised her as \\"Bond's super-hot guardian angel\\".

They worked with NFL, NBA, NASCAR, NHL, MLB, PGA and college football broadcasts. In 1996, Rick Cavallaro, working for Stan Honey at Etak (then owned by Fox/News America) developed a way to track hockey pucks with a blue halo as seen by television viewers. It was assumed at that time that viewers had a hard time keeping track of the puck. Released as the FoxTrax puck, it was not a success but led to the 1998 formation of the Sportvision company and later that year the development of the 1st & Ten computer system, which generates and displays the yellow first down line that a TV viewer sees during a live football broadcast. The system became a major hit with television viewers when used during a broadcast of the Super Bowl. It has since become part of all standard American professional and college football and Canadian pro football broadcasts. Another popular Sportvision product is seen in broadcasts of NASCAR races. It is called RACEf/x, and creates virtual flags above the cars to make them easier to follow by the viewers. Sportvision also created the PITCHf/x system used by Major League Baseball to provide pitch data to users of MLB.com GameDay and viewers of Fox, Fox Sports Net, Rogers Sports Net and TBS, until its replacement by Statcast in 2017. The latest attempt for hockey was tested for deployment during the 2015 NHL All-Star weekend. The new system used computer chips to standardize and increase the volume of data tracked during the course of a game. In a deal finalized Oct. 4, 2016, Sportvision was acquired by SMT.

Living in Austria in the 1950s, Michener was at the border of Austria and Hungary during the period in which a significant wave of refugees fled Hungary. The book is one of Michener's journalistic works (his 9th or 10th published book) and much shorter than the episodic novels that he wrote over the next thirty years. While the book is of a historical event based upon interviews with eyewitnesses, the story is told largely through composite characters or characters based on real people whose names were changed, either for their safety or the safety of family left behind. The story examines the experience of different segments of Hungarian society, both before and during the uprising, such as students, workers, soldiers, secret police, and ordinary citizens. The book takes the reader to the streets of Budapest, where unarmed young people, factory workers, and poorly equipped Hungarian soldiers fought Soviet tanks. It also tells the bittersweet story of the few days of freedom enjoyed by the citizens of Budapest before the Soviets returned in force.

It was conceived as an external appendage of the Soviet Union's secret police forces and gained an indigenous reputation for brutality during a series of purges beginning in 1948, intensifying in 1949 and ending in 1953. In 1953 Joseph Stalin died, and Imre Nagy (a moderate reformer) was appointed Prime Minister of Hungary. Under Nagy's first government from 1953 to 1955, the √ÅVH was gradually reined in.

Its elaborate \\"Ice Cream Fantasy Finale\\" production number was filmed in three- strip Technicolor, one of the earliest uses of that process in a feature- length film. Plot In New York City, 1934, jazz singer Dot Clark and her shady gangster boyfriend, Louie The Lug (\\"An Earful of Music\\"), are introduced. After having an affair with the deceased Professor Edward Wilson, Dot is now technically his common-law wife and heiress to $77 million. She has to go to Egypt to claim the money, and sets off with Louie in hopes of getting the cash. Former assistant to Edward Wilson, Gerald Lane, informs the law offices of Benton, Loring, and Slade of Professor Wilson's death and the fact that Edward's son, Eddie Wilson, Jr, is the rightful heir to the money. Mr. Slade, the lawyer, goes to a barge in Brooklyn where Eddie is living with his adopted father, Pops, an old stevedore, and his three sons, Oscar, Adolph, and Herman, who roughhouse Eddie. However, Eddie is managing to live a nice life nonetheless, with his girlfriend, Nora 'Toots', and his care for all the kids on the barge. He dreams of the day when he will have enough money to live his own life outside of the dirty barge (\\"When My Ship Comes In\\"). Moments later, Eddie is informed that he has inherited the $77 million and boards a ship bound for Egypt to claim the money. Aboard the ship is Colonel Henry Larrabee, a gentleman from Virginia who sponsored Eddie, Sr's exploration endeavors and wants a share of the money, as well. Eddie befriends his beautiful niece, Joan, and Dot and Louie realize that they are not the only ones traveling to Egypt. In an elaborate scheme to trick Eddie into signing over the inheritance, Dot disguises herself as Eddie's mother and almost succeeds in duping him, but Louie ruins the plan at the last minute. Meanwhile, Gerald Lane has boarded the ship and he is revealed to be in love with Joan Larrabee. In the ship's bar, the Colonel, Gerald, and Louie realize they are all traveling for the same reason, and Gerald calls Colonel Larrabee a liar. Joan overhears and becomes angry with him, much to Jerry's dismay. Louie tries to get Eddie to hand over the cash by trying to bump him off by pushing him off the ship's deck in a wheelchair. The duo thinks they have succeeded in getting rid of Eddie, but they are foiled again. Eddie tries to help Jerry win back Joan, and suggests they rehearse a number for the ship's concert the next evening. They rehearse (\\"Your Head On My Shoulder\\"), but Joan is still frosty toward him. At the ship's concert, Jerry, Eddie, Dot, Joan, and members of the chorus perform a big minstrel show number featuring a specialty tap by the Nicholas Brothers (\\"Mandy N' Me\\"). The ship lands in Alexandria, Egypt, and Joan is still angry with Jerry. Eddie, still convinced that Dot is his mother and Louie is his uncle, wants to see a magician performing at the ship's port. When the magician taunts Louie and calls him a coward, Louie gets in the magic basket and ends up getting beaten by Egyptian slaves. Eddie chases a little dog running through the marketplace and lands literally in the lap of the sheikh's daughter, Princess Fanya, who falls instantly in love with Eddie. She forces him to come with her back to the palace, where Eddie meets her father, Sheikh Mulhulla, and her fianc√©, Ben Ali, who is extremely jealous. Fanya hyperbolizes the encounter with the dog, saying that Eddie saved her from a lion's attack instead of a puppy. Eddie then is invited to stay at the palace, much to Fanya's delight. However, soon Sheikh Mulhulla learns of the Americans being in Egypt who have come to take the $77 million treasure that he believes is rightfully his. He tells Eddie about this and Eddie begins to worry about his mother and his uncle, along with the others. In a comical scene, the sheikh and Eddie smoke a hookah pipe and the sheikh tells him of the affair he is having with a famous dancer who lives in the village. The harem women try to seduce Eddie, but he is steadfast to remain faithful to Nora 'Toots' (\\"Okay Toots\\"). Princess Fanya has a plot to get Eddie to marry her, and she tells her father that Eddie kissed her on the camel when they first met. The sheikh then decrees that Eddie must marry Fanya or die, and has him suspended over a large bowl of soup. Eddie then agrees to marry Fanya, and is kept in a room on a dog collar until the next morning, when Ben Ali comes in with a gun in a jealous rage. Eddie convinces Ben Ali that he does not want to marry Fanya, and Ben Ali is convinced and lets him go. However, Joan, Jerry, the Colonel, Dot, and Louie arrive at the palace and are immediately accosted by the guards. In the tomb, Eddie and the men disguise themselves as the spirits of the sheikh's ancestors and tell him to let the Americans go free. The sheikh is so scared by the prophecies, he agrees to let them go on one condition: Eddie will never be able to see Fanya ever again. He agrees and boards a plane home to New York City, where he uses the inheritance to open a free ice cream factory with Toots, thus realizing their lifelong dream (\\"Ice Cream Fantasy Finale\\").Green, Stanley (1999) Hollywood Musicals Year by Year (2nd ed.), pub.

Despite Bond's womanizing, Kissy Suzuki (at least the literary version) remains the only character known to the reader who bears a child by him. The treatment of Kissy varies greatly between the novel and the film, where she is never identified by her name, no family name appears in the closing credits and the film ends in the usual Bond-style happy ending. Novel version In the book, Kissy is an Ama diver and former Hollywood actress. She is distantly related to an agent of Tiger Tanaka, head of the Japanese Secret Service and is, therefore, asked to assist Bond. Bond stays with Kissy's family on an island near the castle, where Ernst Stavro Blofeld maintains a \\"suicide garden\\" where people come to die (and are killed by the \\"gardeners\\" if they change their mind), and Bond is seeking revenge for the murder of his wife at the conclusion of the previous novel, On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Bond enters the castle alone and succeeds in killing Blofeld and then destroying the castle. Bond then sustains amnesia in the aftermath of his attack with Blofeld and is believed dead by his superiors; in reality, he comes to believe he is a fisherman and lives with Kissy for several months. Kissy decides that she will not stop him if he decides to pursue his true identity, but will encourage the cover story that allowed him to stay with her until something else happens. When Bond decides to leave for Russia, believing the answers to his identity are there, Kissy does not follow; unknown to Bond, she is pregnant with his child. Kissy Suzuki does not appear again in the Bond canon, and Bond's child does not appear until \\"Blast From the Past\\", a short story published in 1996 by Raymond Benson as a direct sequel to You Only Live Twice. By the time of this story, Kissy is now dead, having died from ovarian cancer a few years before the story's timeline. Bond learns that she bore him a son, James Suzuki; Bond had little involvement in raising him, but paid for his university education. Film version In the 1967 film adaptation, Kissy is one of the ninja agents working for Tanaka. Though the least experienced of the film's three women, Kissy is the only one left alive by the end, unlike Aki and Helga Brandt. She is first introduced in a mock wedding ceremony as James goes undercover, posing as a Japanese fisherman. Bond and Kissy eventually find Blofeld's secret base, hidden within a volcano and Kissy is sent to alert Tanaka. While swimming to her destination, she is pursued and fired upon by a SPECTRE helicopter, but her experience as a pearl diver enables her to dive underwater and stay there long enough to convince her pursuers that she drowned. After alerting Tanaka, she joins the raid that manages to foil Blofeld's scheme, thereby averting the outbreak of World War III. In the movie, Kissy is played by Mie Hama. She was originally cast to be played by Akiko Wakabayashi; however, Hama had trouble learning English for the much bigger role of Aki, so the two decided to swap their roles. When Hama became ill during shooting, Sean Connery's wife Diane Cilento doubled for her in the swimming sequence.Mie Hama (Kissy Suzuki) - Girls :: MI6 :: The Home Of James Bond 007 Her lines were dubbed by Nikki van der Zyl. Cultural impact A limited number of Kissy Suzuki dolls were produced in 1967; today, these dolls are valuable on the collector market. Mie Hama also appeared in Playboy magazine in a 1967 nude pictorial \\"007's Oriental Eyefuls\\" as the first Asian woman to appear in the magazine, a source of controversy in Japan. Pajiba included Hama on the list of the 15 most embarrassing post-Bond roles for Bond Girls at number seven for King Kong Escapes. UGO.com offered a mixed review of the character: \\"Although Mie Hama is attractive in her bikini, this also looks extremely out of place.

The genus is primarily found in Sub-Saharan Africa, but one species occurs in parts of southern and southeastern Asia. Some of the African species are widespread but contain undescribed cryptic diversity. Most (but not all) species have a white upper lip, and the genus is sometimes known as the white-lipped frogs. Taxonomy Amnirana was originally introduced as a subgenus of Rana. It was often included in the then-diverse genus Hylarana, until Oliver and colleagues revised the genus in 2015, delimiting Hylarana more narrowly and elevating Amnirana to genus rank. Within the genus, Amnirana nicobariensis appears to be the sister taxon of the African clade of species, but the data are inconclusive. With more data available to resolve possible non-molecular synapomorphies of the genus, A. nicobariensis might become recognized as a separate genus. A later study suggested it to be closer to other Asian Hylarana sensu lato than to African Amnirana. Description The current delimitation of Amnirana is primarily based on molecular evidence in combination with geography. No morphological diagnosis is available, and the genus shows variability in characteristics that have been suggested to have diagnostic value within the genus Hylarana sensu lato. The body is robust and medium to very large in size. The dorsum is smooth to shagreened in texture and uniform to mottled in pattern. The upper lip is usually white, but it is dark in Amnirana lepus. Males have paired vocal sac, which may be internal or protrude externally. Species There are 11 recognized species: In addition, the AmphibiaWeb recognizes Amnirana longipes as a valid species, whereas the Amphibian Species of the World, following Jongsma and colleagues, considers it synonym of Amnirana albolabris. Nevertheless, the \\"true\\" species number is likely to be substantially higher, with molecular data suggesting at least seven new African species.

These frogs are closely related to such genera as Huia, Meristogenys, Odorrana, Pelohylax and Rana, but still form a distinct lineage among the core radiation of true frogs.Cai et al. (2007), Stuart (2008) They are commonly known as \\"torrent frogs\\" after their favorite habitat - small rapid-flowing mountain and hill streams - but this name is used for many similar-looking frogs regardless of whether they are loosely related. Several species are highly convergent with other Ranidae \\"torrent frogs\\". A. archotaphus and its relatives for example very much resemble Odorrana livida. In another incidence of convergent evolution yielding adaptation to habitat, the tadpoles of Amolops, Huia, Meristogenys as well as Rana sauteri have a raised and usually well-developed sucker on their belly. This is useful in keeping in place in rocky torrents, where these frogs grow up. But as Odorrana and Staurois from comparable habitat prove, this sucker is by no means a necessity and other means of adaptation to torrent habitat exist.Stuart (2008) Species The delimitation of this genus has proven complicated, with many species believed to belong elsewhere. Due to the degree of convergent evolution, DNA sequence studies are very helpful in assigning species to the genera, though the possibility of past hybridization cannot be discounted in Ranidae.

It is a colorless solid that dissolves in water to give highly basic solution. These solutions slowly hydrolyse to ammonia and urea.Thomas G√ºthner, Bernd Mertschenk and Bernd Schulz \\"Guanidine and Derivatives\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Biguanidine drugs A variety of derivatives of biguanide are used as pharmaceutical drugs. =Antihyperglycemic agents= The term \\"biguanidine\\" often refers specifically to a class of drugs that function as oral antihyperglycemic drugs used for diabetes mellitus or prediabetes treatment. Examples include: * Metformin - widely used in treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 * Phenformin - withdrawn from the market in most countries due to toxic effects * Buformin - withdrawn from the market due to toxic effects File:Metformin.svg|Metformin, an asymmetric dimethylbiguanidine File:Buformin.svg|Buformin. A butyl derivative of biguanidine. File:Phenformin.svg|Phenformin. A phenethylated biguanidine. History Galega officinalis (French lilac) was used in diabetes treatment for centuries. In the 1920s, guanidine compounds were discovered in Galega extracts. Animal studies showed that these compounds lowered blood glucose levels. Some less toxic derivatives, synthalin A and synthalin B, were used for diabetes treatment, but after the discovery of insulin, their use declined. Biguanides were reintroduced into Type 2 diabetes treatment in the late 1950s. Initially phenformin was widely used, but its potential for sometimes fatal lactic acidosis resulted in its withdrawal from most pharmacopeias (in the U.S. in 1978). Metformin has a much better safety profile, and it is the principal biguanide drug used in pharmacotherapy worldwide. Mechanism of action The mechanism of action of biguanides is not fully understood, and many mechanisms have been proposed for metformin. Biguanides do not affect the output of insulin, unlike other hypoglycemic agents such as sulfonylureas and meglitinides. Therefore, they are effective in Type 2 diabetics; and in Type 1 diabetes when used in conjunction with insulin therapy. Mainly used in Type II diabetes, metformin is considered to increase insulin sensitivity in vivo, resulting in reduced plasma glucose concentrations, increased glucose uptake, and decreased gluconeogenesis. However, in hyperinsulinemia, biguanides can lower fasting levels of insulin in plasma. Their therapeutic uses derive from their tendency to reduce gluconeogenesis in the liver, and, as a result, reduce the level of glucose in the blood. Biguanides also tend to make the cells of the body more willing to absorb glucose already present in the bloodstream, and there again reducing the level of glucose in the plasma. Side effects and toxicity The most common side effect is diarrhea and dyspepsia, occurring in up to 30% of patients. The most important and serious side effect is lactic acidosis, therefore metformin is contraindicated in advanced chronic kidney disease. Kidney function should be assessed before starting metformin. Phenformin and buformin are more prone to cause acidosis than metformin; therefore they have been practically replaced by it. However, when metformin is combined with other drugs (combination therapy), hypoglycemia and other side effects are possible. =Antimalarial= Some biguanides are also used as antimalarial drugs. Examples include: * Proguanil * Chlorproguanil =Disinfectants= The disinfectants chlorhexidine, polyaminopropyl biguanide (PAPB), polihexanide, and alexidine feature biguanide functional groups.

Its name can be linked to Anglo-Saxon roots, Pacca being the founder of a settlement on the hill surrounding Pakenham church. The village describes itself as the \\"Village of Two Mills\\", as it has a water mill which claims to be the only working example in the county, as well as a working windmill. The village sits to the east of Bury St. Edmunds and is administered as part of the borough of St Edmundsbury. Prior to the local government reorganisation of 1974 it was part of Thingoe Rural District. History Pacca was the founder of a settlement on the hill where Pakenham church now sits, on an area higher than the waters of Pakenham Fen. The discovery of many Anglo-Saxon remains, notably that of a bone-toothed comb in the old school garden (near the church) in the 1950s, testify to the authenticity of the site. The village was therefore named Pacca's Ham, i.e. the home of Pacca. This name eventually became Pakenham, (pronounced locally with a long \\"a\\" sound.) The Anglo-Saxon family name later became \\"de Pakenham\\". Pacca's descendants continued to farm here until the Norman Conquest of 1066. The village has contained several manor houses, such as Pakenham Hall the family seat of the Spring family, but has now been demolished. Nether Hall was the original home of the de Pakenham family, and later seat of the Greene baronets. Newe House was built by Sir Robert Bright before becoming the dower house of the Spring family. Several members of the Spring family are buried in the parish church. Notable residents *Hamon L'Estrange (1605 ‚Äì 1660), writer on history, theology and liturgy who is buried at Pakenham. *Joanne Jennings (1969- ), high jumper who competed for Great Britain twice at the Summer Olympics and won silver at the 1998 Commonwealth Games. *Thomas Thornhill (1837-1900), baronet, High Sheriff of Suffolk in 1860, Conservative politician, and Member of Parliament (MP) for the Western division of Suffolk at a by-election in October 1875, and held the seat until the constituency was abolished at the 1885 general election.

Malcolm's first instrument was the piano, and his first teacher was a nun who recognised his talent and recommended him to the Royal College of Music at the age of seven, where he studied under Kathleen McQuitty FRCM until he was 19. He attended Wimbledon College, and went on to study at Balliol College, Oxford in the 1930s.Obituary. The Catholic Herald. Retrieved 22 September 2014. During the Second World War he had a musical role with the RAF becoming a bandleader. After the War he completed his musical studies with Herbert Fryer. He bought a harpsichord at auction and went on to develop a career as a harpsichordist. He continued to make occasional appearances as a pianist in chamber music, notably with the Dennis Brain Wind Ensemble. He left few recordings of his piano playing (one interesting example is the first performance of the Gordon Jacob Sextet, written for the group). Harpsichord career Like Wanda Landowska, he favoured rather large 'revival' harpsichords with pedals, built in a modern style, that now are seen as \\"unauthentic\\" for Baroque music.Rather than the Pleyel instruments favoured by Landowska, Malcolm preferred a later generation of instruments by makers like Thomas Goff. While aspects of his interpretations may seem outdated by the standards of today's \\"historically informed performance practice\\", his recordings and live performances introduced many people to the harpsichord and influenced a number of today's musicians. As well as Baroque works, he played modern harpsichord repertoire. His own composition \\"Bach before the Mast\\" (a humorous set of variations on The Sailor's Hornpipe in the style of Johann Sebastian Bach) was written as a B side for a cover version of the Alec Templeton number Bach goes to town which he released in the 1950s.The Faber Pocket Guide to Bach He also wrote \\"Variations on a Theme of Mozart\\". In the 1950s he participated in annual concerts featuring four harpsichordists, the three others being Thurston Dart, Denis Vaughan and Eileen Joyce. In 1957 this group also recorded two of Vivaldi's Concertos for Four Harpsichords, one in a Bach arrangement, with the Pro Arte Orchestra under Boris Ord. Malcolm, Dart and Joyce also recorded Bach's Concerto in C for Three Harpsichords. In 1967, he appeared with Eileen Joyce, Geoffrey Parsons and Simon Preston in a four- harpsichord concert with the Academy of St Martin in the Fields under Neville Marriner in the Royal Festival Hall.Eileen Joyce (1908‚Äì1991) profile , callawaymedia.arts.uwa.edu.au. Retrieved 22 September 2014. In 1967, he recorded The Complete Harpsichord Works of Rameau (Argo Record Co, London). Organist and choir-master He also pursued a notable career as an organist and choir-trainer. After serving as organist-choirmaster of St Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Clapham, he was Master of Music of Westminster Cathedral for 12 years (1947‚Äì1959). He developed the choir's forthright, full-throated tone‚Äîoften, but rather vacuously described as \\"continental\\"‚Äîwhich contrasted with that of Anglican choirs at the time. Benjamin Britten praised the choir's 'staggering brilliance and authority', and proposed to write a piece for them. This resulted in the Missa Brevis (1959). Its first performance was one of Malcolm's last services at Westminster Cathedral before he retired on 1 September 1959.J. O'Donnell, George Malcolm CBE KSG (1917‚Äì1997) ‚Äì An Appreciation. Article in: Oremus, The Monthly Bulletin of Westminster Cathedral, December 1997, p. 10-11. He continued to play the organ, recording the Handel organ concertos for example.\\"CLIP AND SAVE: JOHN BARKER'S BEST-OF- HANDEL LIST.(RHYTHM)\\". The Wisconsin State Journal (Madison, WI). McClatchy- Tribune Information Services. April 2008. Accessed via HighBeam Research. 28 October 2014 (subscription required). Malcolm was founding patron of Spode Music Week, an annual residential music school that places particular emphasis on the music of the Roman Catholic liturgy. Malcolm also composed for voices, a well-known piece being his Palm Sunday introit Ingrediente Domino. His setting of Psalm 51 Miserere mei (composed in 1950, presumed lost but rediscovered in the Cathedral archives in 2011) is reminiscent of Ivor Atkins' 1951 version of Gregorio Allegri's Miserere. A devout Roman Catholic, Malcolm was awarded papal honours for his services as Master of Music at Westminster Cathedral. Conducting Benjamin Britten engaged Malcolm in 1960 to conduct the second and third performances of A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream. In later life Malcolm developed a career as a conductor, forging long-standing relationships with ensembles such as the English Chamber Orchestra and the Northern Sinfonia orchestra. The pianist Andr√°s Schiff, who left Hungary to study with Malcolm, was a frequent concerto soloist under his baton, and the two recorded Mozart's complete works for piano duet together on the composer's own piano. Burial and legacy Malcolm was born and died in London. He is interred in the graveyard at Saintbury Church, Gloucestershire. Malcolm's centenary was marked by Balliol College in 2017.

First proposed in 1915 by Istv√°n J√≥zsef Bolkay, a Hungarian naturalist, the genus did not see widespread adoption at first. As late as the 1990s it was generally included in Rana, but more recent studies have confirmed its distinctness. These frogs are remarkable for being extremely euryhaline by amphibian standards. Species such as the crab-eating frog (F. cancrivora) can thrive in brackish water, and its tadpoles can even survive in pure seawater. Systematics and taxonomy This specimen from the Javadi Hills of Tamil Nadu (India) resembles the Cricket Frog (F. limnocharis) of Indonesia, but its origin suggests that it does not belong to that species, and perhaps not even in Fejervarya sensu stricto. Fejervarya was first introduced as subgenus of Rana and later placed as subgenus as Limnonectes. It was treated as an independent genus first in 1998. However, Fejervarya sensu lato was found to be paraphyletic with respect to Sphaerotheca. This issue was eventually resolved in 2011 by splitting off Zakerana from Fejervarya. Fejervarya, as now defined, is distributed from eastern India (Orissa) eastwards through Myanmar to southern China and Indochina to the islands of the Sunda Shelf as well as Japan. In contrast, Zakerana contains species from southern Asia (Sri Lanka and Indian subcontinent including Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh). The widespread Cricket Frog (F. limnocharis) and some others have also been suspected to be cryptic species complexes since at least the 1970s, and indeed a few populations have been identified that almost certainly constitute undescribed species. Species The following 13 species are recognised in the genus Fejerverya: * Fejervarya cancrivora (Gravenhorst, 1829) * Fejervarya iskandari Veith, Kosuch, Ohler, and Dubois, 2001 * Fejervarya kawamurai Djong, Matsui, Kuramoto, Nishioka, and Sumida, 2011 * Fejervarya kupitzi K√∂hler et al., 2019 * Fejervarya limnocharis (Gravenhorst, 1829) * Fejervarya moodiei (Taylor, 1920) * Fejervarya multistriata (Hallowell, 1861) * Fejervarya orissaensis (Dutta, 1997) * Fejervarya pulla (Stoliczka, 1870) * Fejervarya sakishimensis Matsui, Toda, and Ota, 2008 * Fejervarya triora Stuart, Chuaynkern, Chan-ard, and Inger, 2006 * Fejervarya verruculosa (Roux, 1911) * Fejervarya vittigera (Wiegmann, 1834) Phylogeny The following phylogeny of Fejervarya is from Pyron & Wiens (2011). 7 species are included. Fejervarya is a sister group of Zakerana, which had until recently been included in Fejervarya. Vocalisation behaviour File:Fejervarya vocalisation stomach distended - front view.jpg|1.

The storyline concerns three sailors on shore leave in Liverpool. The play was a factor in Owen later being hired to write the script for The Beatles' first feature film, A Hard Day's Night (1964), as they had been impressed with his depiction of their home city in the production. For his work on that film, Owen was nominated for an Academy Award in 1965.

Drimys lanceolata), commonly known as Tasmanian pepperberry, mountain pepper (Aus), or Cornish pepper leaf (UK), is a shrub native to woodlands and cool temperate rainforest of south-eastern Australia. The shrub varies from 2 to 10 m high. The aromatic leaves are lanceolate to narrow-elliptic or oblanceolate, 4‚Äì12 cm long, and 0.7‚Äì2.0 cm wide, with a distinctly pale undersurface. Stems are quite red in colour. The small cream or white flowers appear in summer and are followed by black, globose, two- lobed berries 5‚Äì8 mm wide, which appear in autumn.Beadle, N.C.W., Evans, O.D., Carolin, R.C., Flora of the Sydney Region, A.H. & A.W. Reed, 1976, Floyd, A.G., Rainforest Trees of Mainland South-eastern Australia, Inkata Press, 1989, There are separate male and female plants. Originally described by French botanist Jean Louis Marie Poiret, it gained its current name in 1969 by A.C. Smith. It had been known for many years as Drimys lanceolata. Also known as Tasmanian pepperberry, it is found from Tasmania, northwards through Victoria to Barrington Tops in New South Wales. It is found in gullies in rainforest. Uses Leaves and berries of the Mountain pepper Dried and crushed Mountain pepper leaves Polygodial has been identified as the primary active compound in Tasmannia lanceolata, and is also responsible for its peppery taste. The leaf and berry are used as a spice, typically dried. Tasmanian pepperberry was used as a colonial pepper substitute.Maiden, J.H., The Useful Native Plants of Australia, Turner & Henderson, Sydney, 1889 More recently, it has become popularised as bushfood condiment. It can be added to curries, cheeses, and alcoholic beverages. It is exported to Japan to flavour wasabi. The berries are sweet and fruity at first with a lingering peppery aftertaste. Dried T. lanceolata berries and leaves have strong antimicrobial activity against food spoilage organisms. It also has high antioxidant activity.Zhao, J., Agboola, S., Functional Properties of Australian Bushfoods - A Report for the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, 2007, RIRDC Publication No 07/030 Low safrole clonal selections are grown in plantations for commercial use, as safrole is considered a low-risk toxin.Menary, R.C., Drager, V.A., Garland, S.A., Tasmannia lanceolata - Developing a New Commercial Flavour Product, Rural Industries and Development Corporation, 1999. Used in colonial medicine as a substitute for Winter's bark, a stomachic, it was also used for treating scurvy.Ewart, A.J., Flora of Victoria, Melbourne University Press, Melbourne, 1930. Tasmanian pepper is one of a number of native Australian herbs and food species being supported by the Australian Native Food Industry Ltd, which brings together producers of food species from all parts of Australia. The pepperberry can be used as a fish poison. The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia' records that common names included \\"Pepper Tree\\" and that \\"The drupe is used as a condiment, being a fair substitute for pepper, or rather allspice The leaves and bark also have a hot, biting, cinnamon-like taste.\\" It can be grown as a garden plant. Its berries attract birds, including Currawongs, that feed on them. It can be propagated from cuttings or seed, and can grow in a well- drained acidic soil with some shade, but is sensitive to Phytophthora cinnamomi. Garden cultivars include 'Mt.

The festival builds on the town's industrial heritage in which canal boats were used to move coal and other raw materials in the town for the production of salt, and then move the salt out of town, either for use directly, or as a raw material in the manufacture of chemicals such as chlorine and soda ash. The Middlewich Folk and Boat festival is now firmly established on the folk circuit and it is estimated that 30,000 people visit the town during the festival weekend, along with 400 boats. The festival was originally organised by members of the Middlewich Paddies, and taken over by the local council in 2011 when the original committee were unable to continue with the event. In 2008, the festival was declared among the top three folk festivals in England by Guardian Online. History The festival has been held since 1990. It was cancelled in 2001 because of Foot and Mouth disease. The festival Since 1990 there has been an annual folk music and (canal) boat festival, which is now highly regarded on the folk circuit with visitors coming into the town from all over the UK.

July 1960) is an American writer, musician, and activist. Her debut novel, Sister Safety Pin, details the life of a 20-something lesbian named Melany as she struggles to come to terms with her sexuality, her lovers, her future, and her place in the changing world of punk rock. Peppered heavily with references to seminal punk bands, the novel follows Melany through a small series of relationships, attaining her undergraduate degree, and contemplating \\"if a lesbian... especially a punk lesbian... is supposed to get a Ph.D.\\" Honed with sharp wit, the story unfolds against a backdrop of 1980s California, New York City, and D.C.; a time when punk rock was shifting faces and the AIDS crisis was exploding amongst the gay community. Widely reviewed, Sister Safety Pin has become a classic among its lesbian audience. After the publication of her novel, Sprecher turned her attention to music, forming the one-woman band Sugar Rat. Her music is politically charged, most recently addressing the bombing of Afghanistan. Her debut album, Rats Have Rights, was released in 2001. In 2002, Sprecher released her follow-up to Rats, entitled The Opposite of Popular. Both albums were self-distributed and are available via iTunes or Sprecher's website. She has also contributed songs to the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA). Sprecher is a vocal member of ACT UP, an organization dedicated to fighting AIDS, and has been arrested six times in Washington D.C. during various protests. She holds a Ph.D. in English literature from the University of Maryland, where her dissertation was on Gertrude Stein. She is currently working on her third novel and an acoustic album for Sugar Rat.

She is a two-time Olympic Champion from 2002 Winter Olympics and a six-time Overall World Champion for 1997‚Äì2002. Known as Yang Yang (A), she was formerly a member of the Chinese national short track team. Yang is one of the most accomplished short track speed skaters of all time having won 34 world titles, including six Overall World Championships. She is the first person to have won six Overall World Titles and won six consecutively. Her victory in the women's 500 m short track at the 2002 Winter Olympics made her China's first-ever Winter Olympics gold medalist. She added a second gold in the women's 1000 m short track at the same Games and has also won two silver and a bronze medal. After 2003 World Championships, Yang took time off competing, but came back in 2004‚Äì2005 season in lead-up to 2006 Winter Olympics where she won the bronze medal in 1000m race. She retired soon afterwards. Naming Yang, born 1976, is sometimes known as Yang Yang (A), to differentiate her from the speed skater named Yang Yang born in 1977 (known as \\"Yang Yang (S)\\"). By coincidence, Yang Yang had a contemporary on the Chinese skating team, one year and one month her junior, also named Yang Yang in pinyin and English (although with a different given name character in Chinese). The \\"(A)\\" identifier was used as a way to distinguish her from the younger Yang Yang. Originally, the older Yang Yang was known as Yang Yang (L) for \\"large\\" (Â§ß or 'big' in Chinese is used to distinguish between younger and older persons of roughly the same age), as she is older than Yang Yang (S) (for \\"small\\"); however, she objected to the \\"L\\" identifier, changing it to \\"A\\" for \\"August\\", her birth month. Although the younger Yang Yang (S) is now retired from competition and there is no longer a need to distinguish between the two in results, Yang Yang (A) still used the identifier in competition, considering it a part of her identity. Retirement Yang Yang (A) was chosen to be one of 12,000 torchbearers to carry the Olympic torch for the Vancouver 2010 Olympics, and on November 22, 2009, she ran a portion of the Prince Edward Island legs.http://www.ctvolympics.ca/news- centre/newsid=14160.html?cid=rssnews1130http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/November2009/10/c7954.html Yang was elected as an IOC member in 2010 becoming mainland China's fourth IOC member.http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/sports/2010-02/13/c_13174113.htm She is also a committee member of the World Anti Doping Agency, and founding member of the Chinese Athlete Education Foundation. In 2013, Yang co-founded the Feiyang Skating Centre in Shanghai, a new double-rink facility with an Olympic-sized rink upstairs and a recreational-sized rink downstairs, built to promote ice sports in China.

He was born in Cape Town, South Africa. Biography Jansen began his career in the pop band The Rockets. The first instruments he played were concertina and mouth organ. The repertoire of the first bands he played with consisted of British pop of the hippie era. But after a trip to London, which was part of a prize in a band competition, he discovered black music from the U.S. and in particular groups with brass sections and he decided he wanted to be a brass instrument player. Brass instrument bands were not new to him as his father was associated with Salvation Army bands, but Jansen chose rock and jazz. He played in the brass section of Cape Town's jazz-rock group The Pacific Express. From there he began a solo career as a singer and saxophonist. His first nationwide recognition in South Africa was as a member of the Dollar Brand group. He and saxophonist Basil Coetzee toured and recorded with Brand on Mannenberg sessions. He later recorded with Brand, also known as Abdullah Ibrahim, on other projects. His work with Brand and Coetzee in the 1970s introduced him to jazz audiences, and he became a leading figure in Cape Jazz. He signed with Mountain Records and was instrumental in encouraging the record label to collect works from their archive to issue the first definitive Cape Jazz collection album. South African duo Johnny Clegg and Sipho Mchunu hired to play flute and saxophone on Juluka's debut album, Universal Men. Jansen joined the band for their next two albums, but he departed between African Litany and Ubuhle Bemvelo to resume his solo career. In 2006 his album Nomad Jez was a finalist for a South African Music Award as best jazz album of the year. He recorded two other solo albums: Vastrap Island and The Cape Doctor. The albums were produced by Patrick Lee-Thorp for Mountain Records. Jansen was in the hospital after becoming ill in July 2005. The provincial government of the Western Cape met his medical bills as he had no medical insurance. He was immensely popular with Capetonians and when he returned to performing, usually with his band Sons of the Table Mountain, he was always met with affection, love, and respect. A blow to his career came in March 2007 when his doctors said that he could no longer travel long distances by air due to his respiratory condition. This forced the cancellation of his 2007 European tour and put an end to his international performances. He collapsed while on tour in Grahamstown in 2010 when his respirator malfunctioned. He died in hospital in Cape Town in July 2010 at the age of 61. Controversy In 2006, a Media24 community newspaper, the People's Post, refused to publish an interview conducted with Jansen, citing his criticism of that year's SAMA. The interview was, according to papers filed at the Labour Court of South Africa, unfit to publish in a family newspaper. \\"Mr Jansen's views are too controversial to publish in a community newspaper targeted at a family audience.\\" The editor of the People's Post at the time also cited Jansen's reputation as a drinker and frequenter of nightclubs. The journalist who conducted the interview brought a civil case against the corporation.

With 4,251 works exhibited by the painter, the museum has one of the most complete permanent collections of works. The museum is housed in five adjoining medieval palaces in Barcelona's La Ribera neighborhood, in the Old City, and more specifically, it is located on Montcada Street, a formerly very prestigious street home to wealthy merchants and nobility from the Gothic to the Baroque periods. It opened to the public on 9 March 1963, becoming the first museum dedicated to Picasso's work and the only one created during the artist's lifetime. It has since been declared a museum of national interest by the Government of Catalonia. Highlights of the collection include two of his first major works, The First Communion (1896), and Science and Charity (1897). In particular, the Museu Picasso reveals Picasso's relationship with the city of Barcelona, a relationship that was shaped in his youth and adolescence and continued until his death. History The original idea for the museum came from Picasso's lifelong friend and secretary, Jaume Sabart√©s, whom Picasso had given many paintings, drawings, and prints since meeting in 1899. Originally, Sabart√©s intended to found the museum in M√°laga, Picasso's birthplace. It was Picasso himself who suggested that Barcelona would be more appropriate, given his long-standing connections with the city. On 27 July 1960, Sabart√©s signed an agreement with the city of Barcelona to found the museum. The museum opened in 1963, with the collection established through Sabart√©s' donation of 574 works from his personal collection. Other items included works that Picasso had given to the city of Barcelona, such as Harlequin, works previously in the possession of the city's museum of modern art, and other gifts from Picasso's friends and collectors. The museum opened under the name of the Sabart√©s Collection, because of Picasso's strong opposition to Franco's regime. In the end, Barcelona mayor Josep Porcioles went against the wishes of the central government in order to open the museum. When it opened, the museum was located in Palau Aguilar on Montcada Street. In this era, the collection consisted mainly of the personal collection Sabart√©s, some lithographs, and posters. Other donations during the museum's first year included a book of engravings made by Picasso of Ovid's Metamorphoses, donated by Salvador Dal√≠, as well as a collage given by Gala Dal√≠, titled No, 1913. In subsequent years, the collection was expanded with donations, including 7-drawings dated between 1899 and 1904 given by Junyer Sebastian Vidal. =Expansion= After Sabart√©s death in 1968, in 1970 Picasso made his last personal donation to the museum. The donation was made up of 920 varied works, including items from his early work that his family had been keeping for him ever since the time he first settled in France. These included school books, academic pieces and paintings from Picasso's Blue Period. Sabart√©s himself bequested a number of works upon his death, including a series of 58 paintings on Las Meninas. In December 1970, the museum underwent its first expansion, adding the Palau del Bar√≥ de Castellet, which is attached to the original museum building, Palau Aguilar. As years passed, the museum grew in importance as more substantial donations were made. During the early 1980s the collection was expanded with several donations from individuals and various art galleries, as well as through acquisitions. In 1982, Picasso's widow Jacqueline Roque gave 41 pieces to the museum. (In 1983), the Louise Leiris Gallery made a donation of 117 engravings. Some notable donations include those from Carles Domingo and the Editorial Gustavo Gili, among others. In 1985, the museum's physical space expanded again with the addition of Palau Meca. During the 1990s donations included (women bust or Man sitting). The museum also acquired works such as Portrait of Jacqueline with tape, among others. In the late 1990s the museum expanded yet again with the acquisition of Casa Mauri and Palau Windows, both on the same street and adjacent to the museum. Opened in 1999, this new extension added 3,400 square meters to the museum, serving as a space for temporary exhibitions, an auditorium, and additional services. The extension was opened with the temporary exhibition Picasso: Interior and Exterior Landscape, with more than 200 works by the artist created between 1917 and 1970. =21st century= In 2003, the museum's interior was remodeled and the artworks rearranged. Two years later, The Government of Catalonia declared the institution a museum of national interest. In 2006, Maite Oca√±a, the museum's director since 1983, resigned in order to direct the National Art Museum of Catalonia. Pepe Serra was appointed director of the Picasso in the same year. In 2008, the Museu Picasso rearranged the permanent collection and opened new rooms dedicated to engraving, including one dedicated to Sabart√©s. Serra has since established a network of organizations associated with Picasso, including the City of G√≥sol, the Centre Picasso of Horta de Sant Joan and Palau Foundation in Caldes d'Estrac, with the central aim of promoting the position of the artist by the Catalan territory. In 2009, the museum was listed as one of the 40 most visited art museums in the world by The Art Newspaper. In 2010 the museum began a project to improve its active presence in social networks such as Twitter, Flickr, and Facebook. The museum's efforts resulted in the Museums & the Web 2010 Best of the Web award for social media. . The museum's social media projects promote participatory discussion around the institution's research and knowledge. More recently, the museum has built a new building in Sabart√©s square, behind Montcada Street. This expansion helped alleviate the overcrowding at the entry of the museum. The building was designed by the architect Jordi Garc√©s, who had completed the previous expansion of the museum. Architecture The Museu Picasso occupies five large houses or palaces of the Carrer de Montcada Barcelona, dating from the 13th century and 14th century, occupying a total area of 10,628 sqm. The buildings follow the style of Gothic civil Catalan. Each of the 5 buildings are built following a similar pattern, around a courtyard equipped with an exterior staircase that allows access to the main floors. The buildings that house the collection of Picasso's works also have their own history. =Palau Aguilar= Palau Aguilar The Palau Aguilar (Montcada, 15) was the first building occupied by the museum. The building was probably built on the residence of James Ses sources, an important character in the life of Barcelona.XIII (DDAA, 1984) p.15) The building dates from the 13th century but underwent significant alterations between the 15th and 18th centuries. Between the 13th and 14th centuries the building belonged to various nobles of the Court of Aragon. It was purchased in 1386 by the bourgeois family Corominas- Despl√†, who then sold it fourteen years later to Berenguer Aguilar, from which the palace is named. Later owners included several members of the Catalan bourgeoisie prior to the building's purchase by the City Council on 3 November 1953.DDAA, Guide to the Museum of Catalonia. Barcelona. 2001. During a restoration made in 1960, the remains of a 13th-century painting were discovered while removing plaster from one of the rooms. Today this work is exhibited in the National Art Museum of Catalonia.Online Catalogue MNAC Reference Cjt-071 447] A large fresco representing the conquest of Majorca in 1229, the work is made up of cauldrons and roses, which suggest that the palace belonged to the lineage Caldes and Desvalls. It depicts the central courtyard of the building during the 15th century, with an open staircase and a pointed Gotchic arch. =Palau Bar√≥ de Castellet= Palau Bar√≥ de Castellet The Palau Bar√≥ de Castellet (Montcada, 17) is a palace from the medieval period. Built during the 13th century, it was owned by the Gerona family during the 15th century. Since then it has changed hands between the bourgeois and aristocratic families of Barcelona, having been remodeled during the 18th century. In 1797, the then owner (Mariano Alegre Aparici Amat) received the noble title of Baron Castle at the hands of King Charles IV, prompting the palace to receive its name. Upon the death of the Baron, the building was bequeathed to the Hospital of the Holy Cross, who rented it to different tenants until they sold it to the Rivers family. The City Council then purchased the building in the 1950s. The palace was built around a central courtyard and includes on its facade a relief from the 16th century that depicts religious themes. The interior's main floor is in the neo-classical style of the mid-18th century, including elements of marble and polychrome reliefs. =Palau Meca= Palau Meca 1982 The Palau Meca (Montcada, 19) was built between the 13th and 14th centuries and also underwent restoration during the 18th century. Similar to the other palaces, it contains a central courtyard. Highlights include the medieval polychrome coffered ceilings of the main floor as well as unique ceilings from the 19th century. In 1349, the property was owned by James Knight, then Minister of the City Council. Under the ownership of his grandson, Ramon Despl√† Knight, it became the largest palace on the block. The building later became the property of the family of Cassador (or Hunter), Marquis of Ciutadilla. The first owner, Joseph Mecca Hunter gave the palace its current name. The next family to own it, the Milans, restored the building after it was badly damaged during the War of Spanish Succession. In 1901, the building was given to the Brothers of Christian Doctrine and (was installed Montep√≠o of Santa Madrona.) Over time the Montep√≠o integrated with a bank, who gave the building to the City Council on 5 December 1977. The Palace was reopened as part of the museum on 11 January 1982. =Casa Mauri= Casa Mauri Casa Mauri (Montcada, 21) includes some structures that date from Roman times, when the space was occupied by the suburbs of Barcino. Of note is the unique wood facade, one of the few examples in Barcelona of the locking system typical of the 18th century. Between 1378 and 1516 the building was owned by the Rocha family and in 1716 it was owned by F. Casamada. During the 19th century several renovations were made. Under the owner Josep Vidal Torrents, the building was made to have industrial uses until it was bought by Mauri bakeries in 1943, the company that gave the building its name. In 1999 the building was acquired by Museu Picasso. =Palau Finestres= Palau Finestres, temporals entry The Palau Finestres (Montcada, 23) was built on the foundations of a building dating to the 13th century and occupies a former Roman necropolis. Between 1363 and 1516 the area belonged to the Marimon family. In 1872, the owner of Casa Mauri, Jose Vidal Torres, bought the building in order to annex it to his home. The City acquired the building in 1970. There are arcades on the ground floor, added during the reforms of the fifteenth and 17th centuries. On the main floor, a coffered ceiling from the end of the 13th century have been restored. The building is currently used as exhibition space. =Knowledge and Research Center= The Knowledge and Research Center was opened on 17 February, a new building located in Plaza Sabart√©s that was designed by architect Jordi Garc√©s. The site aims to become an international landmark in the study of Picasso and his artistic and social context. Director Pepe Sierra explained that the space would be used for discussion, dialogue, and debate, rather than as a place of consumption. (The organization responsible for this is Silvia Domenech, commissioned between 1997 and 2007 of the Photographic Archive of Barcelona.) Jordi Garc√©s, who already performed the previous expansion of the museum, designed the 1500 square meter building with a transparent glass facade protected by a cantilever. The building houses an educational center on the ground floor, with 4 multi-purpose spaces aimed at providing educational service for the museum. The first floor is devoted to the library, documentation center, and archives of the museum. The basement is devoted to visitor services. The construction began on 10 July 2009 and ended on 16 February 2011, costing 6.7 million. The permanent collection The permanent collection is organized into three sections: painting and drawing, engraving, and ceramics. These cover principally the early years of Picasso's artistic life, such as his Blue Period from 1901 to 1904, but Picasso, his family, and his friends would bequest or loan other later pieces as well. There are now more than 3,500 works making up the permanent collection of the museum. The collection is organized into areas that include the early years (M√°laga, Corunna and Barcelona, 1890‚Äì97), the training period (Barcelona, Horta de San Juan and Madrid, 1897‚Äì1901), the Blue Period (1901‚Äì04), works in Barcelona from 1917, and the entire Las Meninas (1957) series. Most of the paintings on display at the museum are from the period between 1890 and 1917, an important collection in regard to that portion of Picasso's life. The museum has very few paintings after 1917, with the exception of the Las Meninas, painted in 1957. The collection of lithographs comprises the years 1962 and 1982. Picasso himself gave the museum a copy of each of his works produced after the death of Sabart√©s in 1968. The collection also includes illustrations made by the artist for various books, as well as ceramics gifted to the museum by Picasso's widow, Jacqueline. Between 2009 and 2010 the museum began making information on the permanent collection public on their website. As of October 2010, over 65% of the museum's collection was available to view online. Exhibitions The Picasso Museum has carried out dozens of exhibitions since it opened. Often, these exposures are related to the figure of the painter or topics related to their environment, trying to research and review the work and studies of the painter from M√°laga. We have also held exhibitions on the relationship between Picasso and other artists as Picasso vs. Rusi√±ol held in 2010. Sometimes also organized a traveling exhibition, and Bullfighting. Paintings, drawings and prints in the collection of the Museu Picasso which could be seen at the Casa Lis in Salamanca in 2010. Also made small exhibition focused on one topic, called displays, such as analyzing the painting Science and Charity, the results of studies showing radiographic and reflectologia or another that analyzes a statement that was made about Picasso in Barcelona 1936, Room Esteva. Picasso Exhibition, 1936. The Museu Picasso frequently hosts special exhibitions presenting artworks by Picasso and other artists. From time to time, the museum also organizes seminars and lectures on subjects related to Picasso or on museological issues of interest given by specialists from throughout the world. Services =Library= Library The museum has a free public library of over 6,000 references, located on the third floor of the Palau Aguilar. It is a space for consultation with a documentary on the life and work of the artist and his artistic context, covering virtually every pictorial movement of the 20th century. Those who wish to access it need to make an appointment in advance. The library can be found from catalogs of exhibitions of Picasso to bibliophile editions. There are also collections of some of the journals of the avant-garde Catalan of the early 20th century, where Picasso collaborated and appeared often. Also available with restricted access, a collection of artist's books with illustrations by Picasso himself or by other renowned artists. =Educational activities= One of the other aspects of the Picasso Museum is to highlight the number of services and training proposals and entertainment for families and schools. The museum has a specific department and a section on the website where you can download specific resources to carry out educational activities during the visit, aimed at both primary school teachers as secondary or high school. [24] organizes guided tours for both adults, such as dynamic visits adapted to the different educational levels, both in the permanent collection and temporary exhibitions. The museum also organizes conferences and seminars and activities in collaboration with other institutions such as the UOC, the Grec Festival, the San Juan de Dios Hospital, the Pompeu Fabra University and the School Tool, among others. =Preventive conservation and restoration= The museum has its own team of preventive conservation and restoration, to ensure that the works of our own collection are in the best possible conditions for future generations. From this department studied and documented both the work and materials that Picasso used in order to improve understanding of his work. In this department also establishes the most appropriate measures of environmental protection and establishing the most appropriate security protocols.

He is best known for penning the Christian hymn It Is Well With My Soul following a family tragedy in which his four daughters died aboard the S.S. Ville du Havre on a transatlantic voyage.  Life  Anna Spafford Spafford was the son of Gazetteer author Horatio Gates Spafford and Elizabeth Clark Hewitt Spafford. On September 5, 1861 he married Anna Larsen of Stavanger, Norway in Chicago. Spafford was a lawyer and a senior partner in a large law firm.https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/americancolony/images/ac0004bs.jpg The Spaffords were supporters and friends of evangelist Dwight L. Moody. Spafford invested in real estate north of Chicago in the spring of 1871. In October 1871, the Great Fire of Chicago reduced the city to ashes, destroying most of Spafford's investment. =The wreck of the Ville du Havre= Two years after the devastation of the Great Chicago Fire the family planned a trip to Europe. Late business demands (zoning issues arising from the Fire) kept Spafford from joining his wife and four daughters on a family vacation in England where his friend D. L. Moody would be preaching. On November 22, 1873, while crossing the Atlantic on the steamship Ville du Havre, the ship was struck by an iron sailing vesselhttps://www.loc.gov/exhibits/americancolony/images/ac0005s.jpg killing 226 people, including all of Spafford's daughters.

(Refrain:) It is well (it is well), with my soul (with my soul), It is well, it is well with my soul. Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come, Let this blest assurance control, That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate, And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

(Refrain) =Later years= Following the sinking of the Ville du Havre, Anna gave birth to three children, Horatio Goertner, (1877), Bertha Hedges (March 24, 1878) and Grace (January 18, 1881). On February 11, 1880, Horatio died of scarlet fever at age three. This final tragedy, after a decade of financial loss and personal grief accompanied by a lack of support from their church community, began Horatio's philosophical move away from material success towards a lifelong spiritual pilgrimage. Anna and Horatio Spafford soon left the Presbyterian congregation Horatio had helped build and hosted prayer meetings in their home. Their Messianic sect was dubbed \\"the Overcomers\\" by the American press.Jerusalem: The Biography, page 365, Simon Sebag Montefiore, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2011. In August 1881, the Spaffords went to Jerusalem as a party of 13 adults and three children to set up an American Colony. Colony members, joined by Swedish Christians, engaged in philanthropic work among the people of Jerusalem regardless of their religious affiliation and without proselytizing motives, gaining the trust of the local Muslim, Jewish and Christian communities. In Jerusalem, Horatio and Anna Spafford adopted a teenager, Jacob Eliahu (1864‚Äì1932), who was born in Ramallah into a Turkish Jewish family. As a schoolboy, Jacob Spafford discovered the Siloam inscription. Death Spafford died of malaria on October 16, 1888 and was buried in Mount Zion Cemetery in Jerusalem.

It was established in 1950 by the Roman Catholic diocese of Nelson and opened with twelve students. In 1951 Notre Dame became affiliated as a junior college with Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, United States, and in 1961 it became affiliated with St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. In 1963, it was chartered as a private four-year university by the Province of British Columbia. Shortly thereafter, it adopted the name Notre Dame University of Nelson (NDU). At the height of its operation, it enrolled 2,000 students in a variety of academic disciplines. The university granted both Major B.A. Degrees, with intensive work in one subject area, and B.A. Degrees with Concentrations in two subject areas. It hosted a wide range of foreign students, including many from Hong Kong, Indonesia, and the United States. Dr. Hugh L. Keenleyside, a noted Canadian civil servant and scholar, served as Chancellor and Chairman of the Board of Governors of Notre Dame University College from 1969 to 1977. Prominent Faculty members included Dr. P.J. Micallef, Professor of Philosophy, a Laval scholar, and Dr. L.A.D. Morey, Professor of English, a former student of J.R.R. Tolkien at Oxford University, among many other highly regarded academicians. NDU served as the headquarters of the Canadian National Ski Team and embarked on a student-inspired scheme to finance a new student union building independently of university funds. Although the University attracted sufficient numbers of students, it encountered financial difficulties, perhaps in part connected to internal strife - Notre Dame was the first university in Canada to endorse a faculty labour union.Memoirs of Hugh L.

It is only known from six tail vertebrae but, as a sauropod, it can be assumed that this dinosaur was a very large animal with a long neck and tail. Sculpture of Adamantisaurus Like many titanosaurians, Adamantisaurus is incompletely known, making its exact relationships difficult to establish. However, similarities have been noted with Aeolosaurus and the Bauru Group titanosaurian formerly known as the \\"Peiropolis titanosaur\\", now called Trigonosaurus. Description As Adamantisaurus mezzalirai is only known from the anterior portion of the tail, relatively little is known about the anatomy of this species. It was probably a medium-sized titanosaur. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul estimated it to be roughly 13 meters (43 ft) long and 5 tonnes (5.5 short tons) in weight . However, in 2020 Molina-P√©rez and Larramendi gave a larger estimation of 18 meters (60 ft) and 14.4 tonnes (15.8 short tons). Discovery and naming Although this animal's remains were first mentioned in print in 1959, it was not named until the description written by Brazilian paleontologists Rodrigo Santucci and Reinaldo Bertini in 2006. It was the first dinosaur named in that year. The type specimen, the only material known of the genus, consists of the second through seventh caudal vertebrae and two chevrons. Adamantisaurus is currently known only from the Adamantina Formation of Brazil. The Adamantina Formation is part of the Bauru Group of geologic formations. The stratigraphy and exact age of the Bauru Group is still unsettled, but the Adamantina probably occurs somewhere between the Turonian through early Maastrichtian stages of the Late Cretaceous Period (93 to 70 million years ago). Adamantisaurus shares the Adamantina with fellow titanosaurian, Gondwanatitan. Adamantisaurus is named after the Adamantina Formation in the Brazilian state of S√£o Paulo, where the fossil was found and also incorporates the Greek word sauros meaning 'lizard', the most common suffix used in dinosaur names. The type and only species, Adamantisaurus mezzalirai is named in honor of S√©rgio Mezzalira, the Brazilian geologist who originally found the specimen and first mentioned it in print. Classification The phylogenetic relationship of Adamantisaurus has yet to be rigorously tested. However, it appears to be more derived than Malawisaurus based on the ball-and-socket articulation of the caudal vertebrae. All titanosaurs at least as derived as Malawisaurus are members of the clade Lithostrotia. Within that clade, however, its relationships are unclear. It is not a close relative of Saltasaurus. Adamantisaurus resembles Aeolosaurus, a close relative of its contemporary Gondwanatitan, in some respects. Adamantisaurus cannot be directly compared to Brasilotitan, another genus found in the Adamantina Formation. References Further reading * [In Portuguese] *Powell, J.E. 1987.

He was one of the first Catholic priests to arrive in what was then known as the Oregon Country and subsequently became the first bishop and archbishop of the Archdiocese of Oregon City (now known as the Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon). Early life and priesthood Fran√ßois Norbert Blanchet was born near Saint-Pierre-de-la-Rivi√®re-du-Sud in Lower Canada (present-day Quebec). Along with his younger brother Augustin-Magloire Blanchet, he entered the Seminary of Quebec and was ordained a priest in 1819. Blanchet spent a year working at the cathedral in Quebec before being sent to do missionary work with the Micmac and Acadian people in present-day New Brunswick. To be able to preach to the local Irish, Blanchet became fluent in English.Catholic History, O'Hara, Edwin V. Portland, Oregon.: Glass & Prudhomme Co., 1911 In 1827 he was summoned back to Montreal and became a pastor. Missionary work and episcopal career In the 1830s, John McLoughlin sent letters from French Canadian Catholic employees of the Hudson's Bay Company requesting from bishop Provencher of the Red River colony to send priests to what was then known as the Oregon Country.Blanchet, Francis Norbert, and Edward J. Kowrach. Historical sketches of the Catholic Church in Oregon. Fairfield, Wash.: Ye Galleon Press, 1983 Bishop Provencher originally suggested that priests be sent to the Willamette Valley but the Hudson's Bay Company pressed for the considered mission to be on the Cowlitz River, north of the Columbia River. Blanchet was appointed the Vicar General of the Oregon Country, with fellow priest Modeste Demers to aid in the missionary efforts. The missionaries were instructed by Archbishop Joseph Signay of Quebec: \\"In order to make yourselves sooner useful to the natives... you will apply yourselves... to the study of the Indian languages... so as to be able to publish a grammar after some of your residence there.\\" The two priests along with nuns and lay people departed from Quebec on May 3, 1838, and traveled along the York Factory Express. Arriving on 18 November at Fort Nez Perc√©s, a Hudson's Bay Company fur trade outpost located in the present state of Washington, Blanchet celebrated Masses and baptized three Roman Catholic converts. In November of that year, they arrived at Fort Vancouver in present-day Vancouver, Washington. A delegation composed of French-Canadians from the Willamette Valley composed of Pierre Belleque, Joseph Gervais and √âtienne Lucier were present to greet them. During their winter stay at the Fort, the priests held services in Chinook Jargon with Klickitats in attendance. Blanchet and Demers held Masses in various buildings within the fort, and Catholics often had to share worship space with Protestants, an arrangement that did not please either group. Beginning on January 3, 1839, Blanchet, with Belleque and Lucier, went to the French Prairie farms maintained by the French-Canadians. The first Catholic Mass south of the Columbia river (in the Oregon Country) was celebrated at the St. Paul church on January 6, where Blanchet remained for five weeks. During his second visit in March 1839 to Cowlitz to visually explain basic Catholic religious concepts, Blanchet created the \\"Sahale stick\\" or stick from God in Chinook Jargon.White, Kris A. White, and Janice St. Laurent. \\"Mysterious Journey: The Catholic Ladder of 1840.\\" Oregon Historical Quarterly 97, no. 1 (1996): 70-88. This was later made more complex with the use of cloth, to allow for additional representations. The use of the Sahale stick was later adopted by Methodists and Presbyterians like Daniel Lee and Henry H. Spalding. Blanchet was the first non-Native American to make an overnight stay on Whidbey Island in May 1840, where he offered Mass for several tribes at an outdoor altar; he had been invited by Chief Tslalakum.http://www.historylink.org/File/5258https://www.stjames- cathedral.org/history/holythings/24whidbey.aspx The chief presented him with a huge wooden cross (24 feet long) and by 1841 the inhabitants were building a log church in the same area. Blanchet stayed on the island for nearly a year.https://www.sos.wa.gov/legacy/timeline/detail.aspx?id=182 In February 1841 several gatherings were convened to determine the fate of recently deceased Ewing Young's estate, the first of the Champoeg Meetings which two years later saw formation of the Provisional Government of Oregon. Jason Lee as chairman of the first meeting on the 17th proposed that a Willamette Valley-based settler government be formed. Included in the considered government was the position of governor, which led Blanchet to counter propose a political system with a judge as the highest authority.Creating a Provisional Government in Oregon: A Revision, Loewenberg, Robert J., Seattle: The Pacific Northwest Quarterly, Vol. 68, No. 1 (Jan., 1977), pp. 19-20 During the subsequent meeting held at David Leslie's home near Champoeg on the next day Blanchet was selected to chair a committee to draft the laws of government.Grover, La Fayette, The Oregon Archives, Salem: A. Bush, 1853 Blanchet was still opposed to the contemplated political structure, and six months later asked for a reprieve of his duties. On December 1, 1843, the Vatican under Pope Gregory XVI established the Vicariate Apostolic of the Oregon Territory, and named Blanchet its vicar apostolic. With no bishops out west to consecrate him, Blanchet had to journey home to Quebec to be consecrated a bishop. He began his journey for Canada in December 1844, boarded a steamer on the Columbia River, touched at Honolulu, Hawaii doubled Cape Horn, landed at Dover, England, went by rail to Liverpool, took a vessel to Boston, Massachusetts, and finally proceeded by rail to Montreal, a journey of 22,000 miles. Blanchet was consecrated a bishop on July 25, 1845 by Archbishop Ignace Bourget at Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral in Montr√©al. Then on July 24, 1846, the Vatican under Pope Pius IX divided the vicariate apostolic into three dioceses: Oregon City, Vancouver Island, and Walla Walla. Blanchet was named Bishop of Oregon City, while Demers was named Bishop of Vancouver Island and Augustin Blanchet Bishop of Walla Walla. The Diocese of Oregon City was elevated to an archdiocese on July 29, 1850, and Fran√ßois Blanchet was elevated to archbishop. He retired in 1880; retaining the title of archbishop, he was named to a titular see, in the practice of that time. He died in 1883 and is interred at St. Paul Cemetery in St. Paul, Oregon. Fran√ßois‚Äôs brother was Augustin-Magloire Blanchet, who was the Bishop of Walla Walla until 1850 and then the Bishop of the Diocese of Nesqually, which later became the Diocese of Seattle. Legacy In 1995, the Archdiocese of Portland approved the plan to build a Catholic secondary school in Salem, Oregon, under the condition the school be named Blanchet.

Fraser was accused of being affiliated with White Supremacist groups, including the Patriotic Youth League (PYL), by the anti-racist group FightDemBack. Although both he and the PYL initially denied any connection, Fraser admitted he had attended PYL meetings and signed up to the PYL website after video footage of a PYL member describing him as an official legal adviser surfaced.Fight dem back! Following an outcry from Sydney's Sudanese community, Macquarie University Vice-Chancellor Dianne Yerbury on 29 July 2005 decided to suspend Fraser from teaching any further at the campus on the grounds that the race debate was \\"threatening to spill over into the classroom\\" and was \\"affecting the university's ability to operate effectively.\\"Race row professor suspended for 'safety' - National - smh.com.au Macquarie University offered to pay out the final year of his contract but Fraser declined, describing the offer as a \\"dishonorable discharge\\".Radio National - Counterpoint 01/08/2005 On this incident, Fraser wrote: > Truth is no longer a defence when it comes to charges of academic deviance. > Instead of an invitation to debate the issues, the Vice-Chancellor's office > sought to get me off campus as soon as possible by offering to buy out my > contract.

In August 2005, more than 300 Macquarie University staff and students attended a forum on racism and free speech, at which Fraser (as well as Sudanese community and University members) was allowed to put his views from the floor.\\"Race Attack's Positive Side \\", The Weekly Times (Sydney), 10 August 2005. Fraser's suspension ended in mid-2006, when an early-retirement package took effect. In September 2005, Fraser wrote an article advocating a return of the White Australia Policy, entitled \\"Rethinking the White Australia Policy\\". The article was set to be published in the law journal of Deakin University, but the university directed the journal not to publish it.Academic attacks race article ban - National - theage.com.au \\"Rethinking the White Australia Policy\\" has since been published and circulated across the internet.A shortened version, with the most controversial elements edited out, was published in The Australian newspaper on 21 September 2005. A complaint from the Sydney Sudanese community about the original newspaper letter was upheld on 31 March 2006 by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, on whose direction Fraser reluctantly apologised for his remarks.http://abc.gov.au/news/stories/2006/08/30/1727919.htmHareer v Fraser (Ref 2016307FC). (HREOC is now named the Australian Human Rights Commission.) The decision and Fraser's responses have appeared on the website of the Adelaide Institute, run by Holocaust denier Fredrick T√∂ben. Fraser addressed the American Renaissance Conference in February 2006, alongside speakers such as Nick Griffin of the British National Party and Professor J. Philippe Rushton. This was followed up later in the year with appearances at the Inverell political forum in March and at the Sydney Forum in August alongside speakers who included Jim Saleam of the Australia First Party. =Freedom of speech in Australia= In an article for Alternative Right entitled \\"The Cult of \\"The Other\\"\\", Fraser warned that academic freedom was being stifled in Australian universities. He wrote: > Academic freedom in Australia is dying before our eyes; another sacrifice > performed in the now holy name of \\"The Other.\\" In the universities, as > elsewhere, public criticism of privileged minorities must walk a shaky legal > tightrope...

In 2011 Fraser published The WASP Question, in which he examined the failure of Anglo-Saxon peoples in North America, Australia and elsewhere to defend their ethnic identity and interests in the postmodern, multicultural age. In The WASP Question, Fraser writes: > The defining characteristic of WASPs White Anglo-Saxon Protestants] is that > they are much less ethnocentric than other peoples; indeed for all practical > purposes Anglo-Saxon Protestants appear to be all but completely bereft of > in-group solidarity.

Biography  ValdemƒÅr's grave in the Great Cemetery of Riga Kri≈°jƒÅnis ValdemƒÅrs was born in December 2, 1825 at Vecjunkuri homestead, ƒÄrlava parish (now Valdgale parish, Courland, Latvia). He was the son of a Lutheran curate MƒÅrti≈Ü≈° ValdemƒÅrs. He graduated from local parish school and worked as a teacher in Sasmaka (now named ValdemƒÅrpils in his honor). Later he worked as a parish secretary in RundƒÅle and ƒídole parish. In 1854 he graduated from gymnasium in LiepƒÅja and started his studies at the University of Tartu (then Dorpat). His main subject and interest were economics. While studying there he became known with the first public declaration of Latvian nationality. He affixed a visiting card to his door that read \\"C. Woldemar stud. cam. Latweetis.\\" At the time, it was almost unheard of for an educated person to call himself a Latvian; education meant Germanisation, and ValdemƒÅrs' act has been compared with Martin Luther's posting of the 95 Theses at the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg in its importance for the birth of Latvian nationalism. ValdemƒÅrs is seen as the spiritual father of the First Awakening. With Juris AlunƒÅns, he led Latvian student gatherings while in Tartu and advocated the study of folklore. After graduation in 1858 he moved to St Petersburg and worked as a clerk in Ministry of Finance. Also he was a correspondent in local German-language newspaper St. Petersburgische Zeitung. In 1862 he became editor and main publisher of the Latvian newspaper Pƒìterburgas Avƒ´zes which was hitherto the most radical Latvian newspaper. It strongly opposed Baltic German rule and the remnants of feudalism in Baltic provinces. The newspaper became the main platform for Young Latvian ideas. It was closed by the Russian authorities in 1865. In 1864 ValdemƒÅrs helped establish the first Latvian naval school in Aina≈æi as a way of making Latvians rich. At its opening he uttered the famous phrase \\"Brauciet, latvji, j≈´ri≈ÜƒÅ, krƒÅjiet zeltu p≈´ri≈ÜƒÅ!\\" (roughly: Latvians, sail the seas, stuff boxes with gold). Many other Latvian naval schools was established during the next years in the coastal towns of Latvia. It had big influence on local economy and culture because hundreds of Latvian peasant sons had a chance to get education for free and become captains or steersmen. It led to the \\"Age of Sailors\\" in Latvia as active shipbuilding started in coastal towns and villages and those Latvian-built, Latvian-owned and -crewed ships became the first national merchant fleet which was even involved in trans-Atlantic voyages. ValdemƒÅrs published a Latvian-Russian-German dictionary in 1879. In later life ValdemƒÅrs was mostly involved in polemics with Baltic Germans, popularized seafaring and edited the first Latvian naval dictionary. ValdemƒÅrs died on 7 December 1891 in Moscow. He is buried in Riga's Great Cemetery. One of the main streets in Riga is named after him.

It follows the adventures of three young men in modern-day Mumbai (or Bombay). The boys are of Indian origin, but were all raised in the West. Krishna Sahni (played by Naveen Andrews) is an aspiring actor from New York City who wants to make it big in Bollywood. Ricardo Fernandes (Rahul Bose) is from Sydney, Australia and is in Mumbai to search for his long-lost brother. Finally, Xerxes Mistry (Alexander Gifford), a musician from London, is looking to discover his \\"roots\\" in the land of his ancestors. Synopsis The three meet each other for the first time at Mumbai's airport and decide to find a place together. In the course of the movie, Krishna finds out that, in order to break into the local film industry, he must first win the (decidedly risky) patronage of Don Mastana (Naseeruddin Shah), a godfather of the Mumbai underworld who's also a film producer. Mastana is a violent man who thinks nothing of impaling a lizard with a knife or shattering the skull of a fellow crime boss for making a pass at his girlfriend. Ricardo, the serious-looking Australian, finds out the sad fate of his brother, but also manages to fall in love with Mastana's spunky moll Dolly (Tara Deshpande), igniting further flames.

Many Singaporeans felt his initial handling of the crisis, citing his lack of leadership and indecisiveness, helped prolong the epidemic that eventually drove the economy into a recession. While then Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said \\"SARS has significantly disrupted our economy. It has affected not only tourist spending but also domestic consumption... certainly our first half growth will be affected, and we will have to revise down our growth forecasts for the year.\\" Others cited his calls to quarantine patients and to close and extend local school holidays were late in coming.

In his tenure as the Minister of Trade, numerous spa, beauty and wellness operators ceased their operations in Singapore. There were hundreds of complaints and legal cases submitted to the Small Claims Tribunal and CASE on the poor service and unethical practices of spa operators. As a consequence of the closure of a major spa operator, True Spa Subtle Senses, leading to a huge amount of money being lost by members, over 400 people submitted a petition to the Ministry of Trade and Industry to step in to protect consumers from being cheated of millions of dollars. During a Parliamentary session in 2010, Lim commented: \\"Imposing prescriptive regulations can restrict business flexibility, reduce consumer choice, and potentially lead to higher costs for consumers. A better approach to protect consumers is to help raise their vigilance through consumer education and industry accreditation of spas. CASE has, with MTI's support, launched the CaseTrust for Spa and Wellness Accreditation Scheme in April this year to raise consumers' awareness of spa standards and to put in place good business practices. These include giving customers a cooling-off period of at least five working days to seek full refund of payments made for packages, and not allowing sales pitch to customers during treatment. These measures will help obviate cases where consumers are pressured into buying packages. CASE is also currently looking into requiring financial soundness to be taken into account in the accreditation scheme. We will monitor the situation and refine our approach further, if necessary.\\"http://www.parliament.gov.sg/reports/public/hansard/full/20101122/20101122_HR.html Lim is also the Deputy Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and a Board Director of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC).

Near the square is a Medborgarplatsen metro station. The station was opened as an underground tram station in 1933, and was converted for the new metro system in 1950 as one of the first stations on the network. The original exits did not open onto the square, but to the nearby street Folkungagatan. An entrance was opened on to Bj√∂rns tr√§dg√•rd on November 29, 1995. The square has become a common place for demonstrations. On May Day, the Left Party usually start their parade from there, and are accompanied by other smaller leftist and communist parties as they walk to Kungstr√§dg√•rden.

Biography Jovanoviƒá, was of Bulgarian origin and during his life he always felt himself a Bulgarian and at the same time a Serb.During his life, Anastas Jovanoviƒá always felt himself a Bulgarian, and at the same time a Serb. For some time, Jovanoviƒá signed under his lithographs as a \\"Bulgarian lithographer\\". In his memoirs about his teaching in Belgrade in 1871-1874, the Bulgarian ethnographer Dimitar Marinov noted that Anastas Jovanoviƒá was an honorary member of the Bulgarian Society in the city.

He was born in Vratsa, an important administrative and garrison city under Ottoman rule in 1817. When Anastas was 9 years old, his father sent him to continue his education in Belgrade, where his uncle worked at the Prince Obrenoviƒá sewing studio. In 1830, after the death of Anastas' father, his family moved to Belgrade. But only after one year his uncle who was their support died too. At that time the artistic talents of Jovanoviƒá were recognized by the Prince of Serbia. His mentor Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá I, sent Jovanoviƒá, at the expense of the government, to Vienna in 1837 to study painting, graphics, and lithography at the Vienna Academy under the direction of Karl Gsellhofer (art) and Johann Stadler (graphics and lithography). While at the academy he became interested in the invention of Louis Daguerre. He was also among the first photographers to capitalize on this new invention, which was capable of capturing a \\"truthful likeness\\" of anyone and anything. Jovanoviƒá, of course, became among the first photographers to open a Daguerreotype studio while still in Vienna. When he returned home in 1850, he was also among the first to make portraits using the new daguerreotype method. (The first Serbian photographer, however, to use the daguerreotype was Dimitrije Novakoviƒá, according to documents in the Historical Museum of Serbia). Monument to Anastas Jovanoviƒá in Belgrade After graduating from the academy, Jovanoviƒá was named personal photographer to Prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá as well as the Chief of Prince Mihailo's cabinet. From the very beginning, Jovanoviƒá's ambition was to create a collection of paintings and lithographs of Belgrade. He first painted and lithographed, and then when the new invention came along, photographed its historic buildings, its fortresses, garrisons, statues, shops and streets, and almost every notable Serb of his day. His technique was advanced for its time, and his figures were obviously posed, but the directness and sensitivity of his work demonstrate without a doubt that he immediately recognized the new medium‚Äîphotography‚Äîas an art form. He sold some of his work to Vienna museums, private collectors, and some early photographs to painters for reference. Many of his pictures were printed in Serbian magazines and newspapers. Jovanoviƒá's importance was recognized almost immediately by the Serbian government. Exhibitions of his work were first seen in Serbia in 1850 and had a strong influence on the style of young Serbian photographers. Some 892 of his photographs form part of the permanent collection of the Historical Museum of Serbia in Belgrade. His most important portrait studies are: Petar II Petroviƒá-Njego≈°; Mihailo Obrenoviƒá III, Prince of Serbia; Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá; Branko Radiƒçeviƒá; Toma Vuƒçiƒá-Peri≈°iƒá; and others. His lithographs of Serbian men of letters (Dositej Obradoviƒá) and military leaders (Hajduk Veljko Petroviƒá and Stevan ≈†upljikac) are equally important from the historical perspective. The portrait tradition of Anastas Jovanoviƒá was continued by Milan Jovanoviƒá, (no relation) who died during World War II. Anastas' son Konstantin Jovanoviƒá (1849‚Äì1923) was a prominent architect. Anastas's daughter Katarina Jovanoviƒá was a prominent Serbian to German translator. He was awarded the Order of Prince Danilo I.

Brooks, David Davis, Stan Daniels and Ed. Weinberger. The company existed from 1978 until 1983 and produced the TV show Taxi. The foursome who created John Charles Walters were part of the creative team that produced The Mary Tyler Moore Show and its spinoff Phyllis, as well as The Betty White Show among others, during the 1970s. They were lured away by Paramount following the end of The Mary Tyler Moore Show's run. Paramount financed the John Charles Walters Company during its existence. The company also produced The Associates, a TV sitcom about a small group of young Wall Street lawyers which ran during the 1979 television season starring Martin Short. The show lasted for nine of the 13 episodes produced, but received two Golden Globe nominations after its cancelation. Company name According to a 2003 interview, James L. Brooks said that the company was named the John Charles Walters Company because the foursome \\"wanted a venerable Protestant name.\\" The book Hailing Taxi indicates that the partners discovered an old pub sign that said \\"Charles Walters.\\" They bought it in order to make it their logo, but then discovered that there was a director in Hollywood named Charles Walters.

History In July 1941, the US Army Ordnance Corps issued specifications for a heavy armored car (along with another specification for a medium armored car, which resulted in the T17 Armored Car) to be built for supply to the British. The prototype was developed in 1942 by the Yellow Coach Company. It was a large 8x8 (eight wheels, all driven; called an \\"eight-by-eight\\") vehicle with four front wheels used for steering. Thick armor brought the weight to 26 tons, about the weight of contemporary medium tanks. Initial armament consisted of a 37 mm gun M6 in a turret with a coaxial .30 inch machine gun and another .30 inch MG in the bow mount. By then, it was clear that the anti-tank performance of the 37 mm gun was insufficient and the production version, the T18E2, which was named Boarhound by the British, received the 57 mm gun M1, the US-manufactured variant of the British QF 6 pounder. The only surviving T-18 at The Tank Museum, Bovington (1998) The United States Army had only shown minimal interest in the vehicle and retained the first 3 production vehicles. The British Army placed an order for 2,500 units, but high production costs and poor cross-country performance led to cancellation of the order with only 27 being delivered to North Africa. The T18 was never used widely in combat; however, a number were made use of by defending bases of operation in North Africa, with a few even taking part in convoy operations. There are accounts that a limited few were refitted for special duties in the rear echelon as well. Late in 1942, orders were issued for upwards of some eight Boarhounds to be assigned to the 8th Army, which used them sparingly as supporting armored vehicles and, to some extent, in reconnaissance roles according to records at The National Archives (TNA) at Kew, West London. None are said to have seen heavy action.General Orders pursuant to Armoured Actions - North Africa - Reference: Available Armoured Stockpiles-1942-7-12 and 1942-7-23 - The National Archives (TNA) at Kew, West London The only surviving vehicle is displayed in The Tank Museum, Bovington, UK.

His older brother Paul Strang also played international cricket for Zimbabwe. Domestic career In 2001, he helped bowl Matabeleland out for a national record low score in first-class cricket of 19 runs, taking 5 wickets for 6. International career Strang was a left-arm medium bowler and due to his nagging accuracy was hard to get away in ODI cricket. This earned him a career economy rate of 4.13. His best bowling figures in ODI cricket of 6 for 20, made against Bangladesh in 1997 are a Zimbabwean record. He played his last game for Zimbabwe in July 2001 and in 2002 he moved to South Africa due to political unrest. He's become a vocal critic of Zimbabwean cricket and during the 2003 World Cup he stated that Zimbabwe should be barred from hosting World Cup matches on moral grounds. As a result, when he attempted a comeback in 2003‚Äì04 the Zimbabwean Cricket Union banned him. Following the lifting of the ban in 2005 Strang made a comeback and was recalled for a training squad ahead of the New Zealand and India tours of Zimbabwe and played for Zimbabwe A against Pakistan A in 2006. However he was later informed by Zimbabwe Cricket that he services were no longer required. Beyond cricket In 2008 he received an honorary degree in Sports Sciences from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, making him eligible for their crunch cricket match against the University of Edinburgh in July. As the years have progressed he has really enjoyed his coaching and teaching. Since returning to Zimbabwe, he went into coaching at schools like Lilfordia School and St. George's College in Harare. He has done lots more coaching at many levels. He really enjoys giving back to the kids of his country in any sport and would like to see them get the best coaching so that they can be the best they can be and enjoy it along the way. In 2009, he expressed that he is looking for an opportunity to get involved with ZC to contribute more. He wants to coach which he really loves and if he is needed to play, he is more than willing as he thinks that he is enough fit and ready to do so. He thinks that he has still got a lot to offer as a player. He was involved in teaching at St. John's Prep School in the sports department. He coaches at Lilfordia School, where Alistair Campbell and his father are also heavily involved. He has also opened a business about life skills and goal setting. At the end of October 2009, he left his school teaching.

It is a two deck game in the Sir Tommy family. One unique feature of this game is the building of the reserve, which is not used until the entire stock runs out.\\"Grand Duchess\\" (p.91) in The Little Book of Solitaire, Running Press, 2002. Rules First, four cards are dealt face-up, one onto each tableau pile, and two more cards are dealt face-down on the reserve to be used later. After each deal of six cards, the player pauses to see if any cards are playable. Available for play to the foundations (which are above the four tableau piles) are the top cards of each tableau pile. As they become available, one ace and one king of each suit are placed in the foundations. The aces are built up to kings while the kings are built down to aces, all by suit. Furthermore, once a foundation card is set, any can be built upon it at any time. Once the player builds the necessary cards one could, another set of six is dealt: one on each of the four tableau piles and two face-down ones set aside on the reserve. Afterwards, the player builds more cards and the process is repeated until the stock runs out. Once this occurs, the entire reserve is turned face-up. All cards in that reserve become available to be built on the foundations, along with the top cards of each reserve pile. When play goes on a stand still (when the tableau and the reserve no longer yields playable cards), the player is then entitled to three redeals. To do a redeal, the player picks up first tableau pile and places it over the second pile, picks up that newly formed pile and puts in over the third pile, and these three piles are then laid over the fourth pile. Then, the piles are turned face-down to form the new stock, and the remaining reserve piles are placed under it. On the first two redeals, the process of dealing one card on each of the four tableau piles and two more on the reserve faced down, stopping each time to make any play, and using the reserve when the stock runs out is repeated. But on the last redeal, there is no more reserve; all cards are dealt four at a time, one on each tableau pile. The game ends soon after the stock runs out in the last redeal. The game is won when all cards end up in the foundations. Parisienne Parisienne (also known as La Parisienne or Parisian) is a variant of Grand Duchess.

The son of an army officer from Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Gore studied medicine at Trinity College Dublin, graduating in 1897 and practising until 1901. An intervening period of some months in 1898 was spent studying art under Henry Tonks at the Slade School of Art, giving him a taste for life as a professional painter. After a stint abroad, during which he worked as a ship's surgeon on sailings to North America, India and Italy, he returned to London and the Slade, studying there from 1900 until 1904. Whilst there he befriended Sir William Orpen and Augustus John, sharing a studio with the latter. In 1905 he first exhibited with the RHA and from then until 1939 he contributed over a hundred works to their annual shows. In 1916 he was elected an Associate member of the RHA and in 1918 he was made a full member. His works were mainly interiors and still-lives in oils. Flower painting in particular attracted him, and it was on his encouragement that the Royal Horticultural Society of Ireland first hosted an exhibition of Flower and Garden Paintings at the Metropolitan School of Art in the 1940s. He was represented in many survey shows of Irish art, including the much-vaunted Irish Exhibition in Brussels in 1930.

Personal background Henderson graduated from Pennsylvania Military College (now Widener University) and Temple University law school. He passed the New York bar exam. For ten years he worked as an attorney (claims adjuster) for an automobile insurance company (Hardware Mutuals) and later for The Hartford. Henderson had three sons from two wives. One of his sons was named \\"Rob\\", after Robert Ettinger. Both of Henderson's two wives divorced him in large part because of his cryonics activities. The intense hostility of Henderson's second wife to cryonics inspired Mike Darwin to begin a study of the many cases where \\"hostile spouses or girlfriends have prevented, reduced or reversed the involvement of their male partner in cryonics.\\" Henderson died on June 25, 2009 and is cryopreserved at the Cryonics Institute. Organizational activities The first cryonics-related organization in New York City was a branch of Evan Cooper'sEvan Cooper's obituary - Alcor's Cryonics, March 1983 Washington, D.C.-based Life Extension Society (LES). James Sutton, the New York LES coordinator and others became frustrated with LES when Cooper refused to give names and addresses of New Yorkers who had contacted Cooper. Deciding to form a new organization, Sutton arranged a meeting in August 1965 that included Curtis Henderson, Saul Kent and a designer named Karl Werner. At the meeting, Karl Werner coined the word \\"cryonics\\", and the new organization was called the Cryonics Society of New York (CSNY). Henderson soon became the President. Curtis Henderson and Saul Kent spent October 1966 touring the United States to assist in the consolidation of the nascent cryonics movement. On October 2 they attended a meeting in Oak Park, Michigan which led to the formation of the Cryonics Society of Michigan, with Robert Ettinger as President. On October 14 they attended a meeting in Woodland Hills, California where it was agreed to incorporate the Cryonics Society of California (CSC), with Robert Nelson as President. (The following January, CSC cryopreserved the first man, Dr. James Bedford.) On March 2, 1968 CSNY held its first Annual Cryonics Conference at the New York Academy of Sciences, a meeting attended by over one hundred people. In July 1968 CSNY cryopreserved its first patient, Steven Mandell. In 1969 Cryo-Span Corporation was created to specialize in the technical and business aspects of cryopreservation, as distinct from the educational and administrative activities of CSNY. Curtis Henderson, Saul Kent and Paul Segall were the Cryo-Span Directors, but in practice Curtis Henderson was responsible for maintaining the patients in liquid nitrogen. In 1974, the State of New York Department of Public Health informed Curtis Henderson that cryonics was in violation of the law and that continued cryopreservation would be fined at a rate of $1,000 per day. The bodies of the three CSNY patients being maintained were returned to their relatives. Henderson was unusual as a pioneer who was ruthlessly honest about the limitations of cryonics. He admonished his contemporaries with aphorisms such as \\"There is no such thing as feelgood cryonics,\\" meaning that optimism and faith in the future should never be allowed to distract advocates from the hard choices, challenges, and inadequacies of procedures in the real world. After grim personal experiences he became an advocate for \\"no third-party funding,\\" referring to the practice (now obsolete) of accepting cases funded by a third party such as a spouse, child, or sibling of the deceased who might promise to make installment payments but almost invariably would cease doing so after a relatively short period, thus leaving the cryonics organization to deal with the problem of maintenance. Curtis Henderson continued to be active in cryonics as a Member of Alcor Life Extension Foundation, CryoCare Foundation and most recently the Cryonics Institute until his death on June 25, 2009. He was cryopreserved on July 3, 2009.

The term brick-and- mortar business is often used to refer to a company that possesses or leases retail shops, factory production facilities, or warehouses for its operations. More specifically, in the jargon of e-commerce businesses in the 2000s, brick- and-mortar businesses are companies that have a physical presence (e.g., a retail shop in a building) and offer face-to-face customer experiences. This term is usually used to contrast with a transitory business or an Internet- only presence, such as fully online shops, which have no physical presence for shoppers to visit, talk with staff in person, touch and handle products and buy from the firm in person. However, such online businesses normally have non-public physical facilities from which they either run business operations (e.g., the company headquarters and back office facilities), and/or warehouses for storing and distributing products. Concerns such as foot traffic, storefront visibility, and appealing interior design apply to brick-and-mortar businesses rather than online ones. An online-only business needs to have an attractive, well-designed website, a reliable e-commerce system for payment, a good delivery or shipping service and effective online marketing tactics to drive web traffic to the site. Governments are also adopting e-government approaches, which is the use of online services for citizens to enable them to fill in government forms, pay tax bills and register for government programs online; these services aim to cut bricks and mortar costs (building leasing/purchase and staff costs) and improve services to citizens (by offering 24/7 access to information and services). Etymology The name is a metonym derived from the traditional building materials associated with physical buildings: bricks and mortar. The term was originally used by 19th century American novelist Herman Melville in the book Moby Dick (chapter 96). The term brick-and-mortar businesses is also a retronym, in that most shops had a physical presence before the advent of the Internet. The term is also applicable in a pre-Internet era, when contrasting businesses with physical retail presence with those that operated strictly in an order-by-mail capacity pre-Internet. History A fruit stand at a village market in Afghanistan. The history of brick and mortar businesses cannot be dated precisely, but it existed in the earliest vendor stalls in the first towns (as early as 7500 BCE), where merchants brought their agricultural produce, clay pots and handmade clothing to sell in a village market. Bricks and mortar businesses remain important in the 2010s, though many shops and services, ranging from consumer electronics shops to clothing shops and even grocery shops have begun offering online shopping. This physical presence, either of a retail shop, a customer service location with staff, where clients can go in person to ask questions about a product or service, or a service center or repair facility where customers can bring their products, has played a crucial role in providing goods and services to consumers throughout history. All large retailers in the 19th and the early to mid-20th century started off with a smaller brick and mortar presence, which increased as the businesses grew. A prime example of this is McDonald‚Äôs, a company that started with one small restaurant and now has nearly 36,000 restaurants in over 120 countries and plans to grow further; this shows the importance of having a physical presence. For many small businesses, their business model is mostly limited to a bricks and mortar model, such as a diner restaurant or a dry cleaning service. Nevertheless, even service-based businesses can use websites and \\"apps\\" to reach new customers or improve their services. For example, a dry cleaning service could use a website to let customers know of the hours and location(s) of their bricks and mortar stores. Decline Netflix, an online movie streaming website founded in 1997, is an example of how an online business has affected a B&M; businesses such as video rental stores. After Netflix and similar companies became popular, traditional DVD rental stores such as Blockbuster LLC went out of business. Customers preferred to be able to instantly watch movies and TV shows using \\"streaming\\", without having to go to a physical rental store to rent a DVD, and then return to the store to give the DVD back. \\"The rapid rise of online film streaming offered by the likes of Lovefilm and Netflix made Blockbuster's video and DVD [rental] business model practically obsolete.' There has been an increase in online retailers in the 2000s, as people are using e-commerce (online sales) to fulfill basic needs ranging from grocery shopping to book purchases. Sales through mobile devices such as tablet computers and smartphones have also risen in the 2000s: \\"While total online sales rose 18% year-on-year in December to ¬£11.1 [B], according to the latest figures [January 2014] from e-tail industry body IMRG and advisory firm Capgemini, sales via mobile devices doubled to ¬£3 [B].' The increase in households where both adults work outside the home, combined with the convenience of shopping for and buying products and services online, has decreased the number of customers going to retail outlets, as consumers can access the same information about products and services without paying for gas, parking and other costs, thus saving them time and money. \\"Today‚Äôs consumers lead busy lives and [Bricks and Mortar] shopping takes time. Often it is a [challenging] task. Consumers find researching and shopping on the Web far more convenient than brick-and-mortar visits.\\" Brick and mortar businesses are not limited to having a physical presence only, they may also have an online presence such as Tesco, who offer an online grocery service as well as a brick and mortar retail presence. Benefits The presence of brick and mortar establishments may bring many benefits to businesses; * Customer service: face-to-face customer service can be a big contributor into increasing sales of a business and improving customer satisfaction. When customers can take a product back to the store to ask staff questions or help them learn to use it, it can make customers feel more satisfied with their purchase. Research has shown that 86% of customers will pay more for a product if they have received great customer service. * Face-to-face interaction: Many consumers prefer to be able to touch products, and experience and test them out before they buy. This is often attributed to Baby Boomers, older Generation X customers and the elderly being used to a more traditional in- person approach when it comes to shopping and preferring to have a demonstration of products or services, especially when buying new technology . Other studies show, given equal prices, a 90% preference for the in-person shopping experience, including among teens, who combine social interaction with shopping. On the other hand, many of these consumers engage in showrooming: trying on clothes or otherwise examining merchandise in-store, and then buying online at cheaper prices. Drawbacks The brick and mortar approach also has various drawbacks. =New businesses and fixed costs= Fixed costs are a serious challenge for B&M; businesses. Fixed costs are payments that a business has to make for elements such as rent of a store and monthly payments for services such as a security alarm. Fixed costs stay the same for a business even if it ramps up its operations or winds down its operations during a slow period. In contrast, variable costs change as a business ramps its operations up or down. Variable costs include wages (for employees paid by the hour) and electricity for operating machinery used by the business during its operating hours. If a business increases its hours of operation, its hourly wages and electricity bill will rise, but its rent and security alarm costs will stay the same (assuming that the business does not add additional locations). Start-up companies and other small businesses typically find it hard to pay all of the fixed costs that are part of their venture. Research shows that 70% of new start up businesses fail within the first 10 years. =Inconvenient for customers with busy lifestyles= People have busier lifestyles in the 2010s, with more families having both adults working, and therefore they find it harder to find the time to physically go and shop at stores and services. As well, in many cities traffic jams and congestion on roads have made it more stressful and time-consuming to drive to physical locations to shop. Online shopping and online services, which consumers can access from an Internet-connected laptop or smartphone are more convenient for these people. With mobile devices, consumers can order take-out food, gifts and services even when they are \\"on the go\\", such as stuck sitting on a bus or waiting in an airport lounge for a plane. =Expensive and luxury products= B&M; increases the fixed cost for any business, therefore the products sold in physical shops tend to be more expensive compared to online shops. For stores selling expensive products or services in a B&M; format, customers expect beautiful window displays, fine decorating in the establishment and well-dressed salespeople who earn high commission on their sales. Some high-end hair salons and luxury car stores even offer conveniences such as free espresso and bottled water, all of which add to the overhead of selling these products and services. Online shops, even those for luxury goods, do not have to pay for high-end retail stores and salespeople., Nevertheless, high-end online stores typically incur higher costs for their online presence, because they need to have leading edge Web 2.0 functions on their website, a professionally designed site, and in some cases, staff available to respond to phone calls, e-mails and online \\"chat\\" questions. =Wider stock availability online= Products may be out stock in relatively small brick and mortar retail stores and due to limited space in small business retail stores, these establishments may only be able to carry a few types of each product. Online shops are able to have a huge amount of stock in numerous large warehouses (e.g., Amazon.com has warehouses in numerous locations from which it ships its products) which it can quickly ship out. An online store may be able to order up products from a large number of geographically dispersed warehouses, even warehouses owned and operated by third parties (e.g., smaller companies), which are connected to the large company via the Internet. =Queues= Queues (lineups and waiting rooms) are part and parcel of B&M; retail businesses, due to physical constraints and the limitations on how many staff the business can afford to hire. A physical store may only have a few salespeople to serve customers, so many customers may have to wait in line during the busiest hours. To lessen the stress of waiting, some B&M; stores provide big-screen TVs with cable TV, free coffee and newspapers; while these niceties improve the customer experience, they add to the costs of operating a B&M; establishment. On the other hand, an online virtual store in which customers select their own purchases in a virtual \\"shopping cart\\" and pay for them using e-commerce approaches may be able to serve thousands of customers at the same time. E-government Beginning in the 1990s and early 2000s, many governments in industrialised countries began to offer e-government services to citizens. Online government services are offered by a range of government departments and agencies, ranging from departments of motor vehicles (online car registration), police (paying speeding tickets online), city services (paying parking tickets online or requesting that a pothole be filled) and social services (registering for social assistance or unemployment insurance) and tax departments (paying a tax bill or submitting a tax return online). Many governments use e-services to provide online information to citizens (e.g., \\"help\\" guides, Frequently Asked Question lists, manuals for government program applicants, etc.), thus saving on the need for call centers where citizens can call to ask questions or physical service locations where citizens can come in person to ask about government forms or services. These online government services aim at two goals: reducing costs to governments and improving client service. By offering these services and information online, governments save money, because they do not have to offer as many bricks and mortar client service centers where citizens can come and fill in these forms and pay government bills. Governments offering e-services can also operate with less civil servants and thus less salary and benefits costs, as the citizens using online services are generally doing all of the administrative tasks (e.g., downloading a form, filling in a form, looking up guidance in an online \\"help\\" manual, paying fees) themselves using their home computer. E-government services also improve service for citizens who have access to a computer, Internet and an online payment method (e.g., a credit card or PayPal), because these citizens are not limited by the 9 am-5 pm or 8 am-4 pm business hours of most physical government offices, and citizens do not have to incur the costs of transportation (e.g., bus tickets, gas, parking, etc.) associated with going to a bricks and mortar location. Nevertheless, government e-services do not help all citizens, due to the digital divide; citizens who are in poverty, who are homeless or who live in rural or remote regions may not have access to high speed Internet. These citizens, as well as those who are not comfortable with computers or those who do not understand how to use them, which in practice means elderly people, are not able to benefit from e-services.

It reduces blood coagulation by converting thrombin to an anticoagulant enzyme from a procoagulant enzyme.IPR001491 Thrombomodulin Accessed January 19, 2012. Thrombomodulin is also expressed on human mesothelial cell, monocyte and a dendritic cell subset.  Genetics and structure  In humans, thrombomodulin is encoded by the THBD gene. The protein has a molecular mass of 74kDa, and consists of a single chain with six tandemly repeated EGF-like domains, a Serine/Threonine-rich spacer and a transmembrane domain. It is a member of the C-type lectin domain (CTLD) group 14 family.  Function  Thrombomodulin functions as a cofactor in the thrombin-induced activation of protein C in the anticoagulant pathway by forming a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with thrombin. This raises the speed of protein C activation thousandfold. Thrombomodulin- bound thrombin has procoagulant effect at the same time by inhibiting fibrinolysis by cleaving thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI, aka carboxypeptidase B2) into its active form. Thrombomodulin is a glycoprotein on the surface of endothelial cells that, in addition to binding thrombin, regulates C3b inactivation by factor I. Mutations in the thrombomodulin gene (THBD) have also been reported to be associated with atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS). The antigen described as BDCA-3 has turned out to be identical to thrombomodulin. Thus, it was revealed that this molecule also occurs on a very rare (0.02%) subset of human dendritic cells called MDC2. Its function on these cells is unknown.  Interactions  Thrombomodulin has been shown to interact with thrombin.

He was educated at Westminster City School in London and the University of Hertfordshire. Musical career Johnson played acoustic and electric guitars and sang on Appalachian dulcimer player Roger Nicholson's 1972 album Nonesuch for Dulcimer, credited as Robert Johnson. He went on to become a member of the successful English electric folk band Steeleye Span in 1972, after being introduced by fiddler Peter Knight. Johnson first appeared on the group's fourth album, Below the Salt, where he took lead vocals on the track \\"King Henry\\". Along with \\"King Henry\\", he introduced many of the band's better-known songs into the repertoire, such as \\"Thomas the Rhymer\\", \\"Alison Gross\\", \\"Long Lankin\\" and \\"Gaudete\\".Profile, Steeleye.freeservers.com; accessed 26 May 2017. Despite taking lead vocals on many songs, he was something of a background member. Johnson left Steeleye Span temporarily in 1977 to work on a concept album, The King of Elfland's Daughter, along with Peter Knight. However, he returned in 1980 to record Sails of Silver. After Tim Hart's departure from the band in 1980, Johnson became the sole guitarist and a more prominent member, taking on a central role for the albums Back in Line (1986) and Tempted and Tried (1989). Owing to health reasons, he left Steeleye Span in 2000, but returned the following year to record Present--The Very Best of Steeleye Span. However, his remaining health issues prevented him from touring, so he was replaced by Ken Nicol. Nevertheless, he continues to be involved with the band, contributing songwriting and vocals to their studio albums, most recently Wintersmith in 2013. Personal life Johnson is a qualified psychologist, having completed a degree with the University of Hertfordshire. He and his former wife, Jane (now divorced), have two children, Barnaby and Holly.

Like other beta blockers it is not a first line treatment for this indication.NICE Hypertension guidance Last updated 2013 It should not be used or only used with caution in people with heart failure and people with asthma. It may mask signs of low blood sugar in people with diabetes and it may mask signs of hyperthyroidism. Animal studies showed some signs of potential trouble for women who are pregnant, and it has not been tested in women who are pregnant. It is not known if penbutolol is secreted in breast milk. Side effects Penbutolol has a low frequency of side effects. These side effects include dizziness, light headedness, and nausea. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Penbutolol is able to bind to both beta-1 adrenergic receptors and beta-2 adrenergic receptors (the two subtypes), thus making it a non-selective Œ≤ blocker. Penbutolol is a sympathomimetic drug with properties allowing it to act as a partial agonist at Œ≤ adrenergic receptors. Blocking Œ≤ adrenergic receptors decreases the heart rate and cardiac output to lower arterial blood pressure. Œ≤ blockers also decrease renin levels, which ultimately results in less water being reabsorbed by the kidneys and therefore a lower blood volume and blood pressure. Penbutolol acts on the Œ≤1 adrenergic receptors in both the heart and the kidney. When Œ≤1 receptors are activated by a catecholamine, they stimulate a coupled G protein which activates adenylyl to convert adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The increase in cAMP ultimately alters the movement of calcium ions in heart muscle and increases heart rate. Penbutolol blocks this and decreases heart rate, which lowers blood pressure.Dent, M. R., Singal, T., Tappia, P. S., Sethi, R., Dhall, N. S. (2008). Œ≤-Adrenoceptor-Linked Signal Transduction Mechanisms in Congestive Heart Failure. Chapter 2, pp 27-49 in Signal transduction in the cardiovascular system in health and disease, Eds Srivastava, Ashok K., Anand-Srivastava, Madhu B. Springer Science & Business Media, 2008 The ability of penbutolol to act as a partial agonist proves useful in the prevention of bradycardia as a result of decreasing the heart rate excessively. Penbutolol binding Œ≤1 adrenergic receptors also alters kidney functions. Under normal physiological conditions, the enzyme renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which will then be converted to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal gland, causing a decrease in electrolyte and water retention, ultimately increasing water excretion and decreasing blood volume and pressure.Finkel, Richard; Clark, Michelle A.; Cubeddu, Luigi X. Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews: Pharmacology, 4th Edition Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2009. Like propanolol and pindolol, it is a serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor antagonist; this discovery by several groups in the 1980s generated excitement among those doing research on the serotonin system as such antagonists were rare at that time.Glennon RA.

The back hip circle is first used in level 2 women gymnastics. On bars, the back hip circle is usually performed in combination with a cast. To perform the skill, the gymnast rests on the bar in a front support. He casts away, returns to the bar, and travels around it, returning to a front support. A more advanced version of the back hip circle is the clear hip. In this move, the gymnast still circles backwards around the bar, but does not return to a front support.

The traditional system of binary encoding for decimal digits, known as binary-coded decimal (BCD), uses four bits to encode each digit, resulting in significant wastage of binary data bandwidth (since four bits can store 16 states and are being used to store only 10), even when using packed BCD. Densely packed decimal is a more efficient code that packs three digits into ten bits using a scheme that allows compression from, or expansion to, BCD with only two or three hardware gate delays. The densely packed decimal encoding is a refinement of Chen‚ÄìHo encoding; it gives the same compression and speed advantages, but the particular arrangement of bits used confers additional advantages: * Compression of one or two digits (into the optimal four or seven bits respectively) is achieved as a subset of the three-digit encoding. This means that arbitrary numbers of decimal digits (not just multiples of three digits) can be encoded efficiently. For example, 38 = 12 √ó 3 + 2 decimal digits can be encoded in 12 √ó 10 + 7 = 127 bits ‚Äì that is, 12 sets of three decimal digits can be encoded using 12 sets of ten binary bits and the remaining two decimal digits can be encoded using a further seven binary bits. * The subset encoding mentioned above is simply the rightmost bits of the standard three-digit encoding; the encoded value can be widened simply by adding leading 0 bits. * All seven-bit BCD numbers (0 through 79) are encoded identically by DPD. This makes conversions of common small numbers trivial. (This must break down at 80, because that requires eight bits for BCD, but the above property requires that the DPD encoding must fit into seven bits.) * The low-order bit of each digit is copied unmodified. Thus, the non- trivial portion of the encoding can be considered a conversion from three base-5 digits to seven binary bits. Further, digit-wise logical values (in which each digit is either 0 or 1) can be manipulated directly without any encoding or decoding being necessary.  History  In 1969, Theodore M. Hertz, and in 1971, Tien Chi Chen () with Irving Tze Ho () devised lossless prefix codes (referred to as Hertz and Chen‚ÄìHo encodings) which packed three decimal digits into ten binary bits using a scheme which allowed compression from or expansion to BCD with only two or three gate delays in hardware. Densely packed decimal is a refinement of this, devised by Mike F. Cowlishaw in 2002, which was incorporated into the IEEE 754-2008 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 standards for decimal floating point.  Encoding  Like Chen‚ÄìHo encoding, DPD encoding classifies each decimal digit into one of two ranges, depending on the most significant bit of the binary form: \\"small\\" digits have values 0 through 7 (binary 0000‚Äì0111), and \\"large\\" digits, 8 through 9 (binary 1000‚Äì1001). Once it is known or has been indicated that a digit is small, three more bits are still required to specify the value. If a large value has been indicated, only one bit is required to distinguish between the values 8 or 9. When encoding, the most significant bit of each of the three digits to be encoded select one of eight coding patterns for the remaining bits, according to the following table. The table shows how, on decoding, the ten bits of the coded form in columns b9 through b0 are copied into the three digits d2 through d0, and the remaining bits are filled in with constant zeros or ones. Bits b7, b4 and b0 (\`c\`, \`f\` and \`i\`) are passed through the encoding unchanged, and do not affect the meaning of the other bits. The remaining seven bits can be considered a seven-bit encoding for three base-5 digits. Bits b8 and b9 are not needed and ignored when decoding DPD groups with three large digits (marked as \\"x\\" in the last row of the table above), but are filled with zeros when encoding. The eight decimal values whose digits are all 8s or 9s have four codings each. The bits marked x in the table above are ignored on input, but will always be 0 in computed results. (The 8 √ó 3 = 24 non-standard encodings fill in the gap between 103 = 1000 and 210 = 1024.)

Lime mortar is composed of lime and an aggregate such as sand, mixed with water. The Ancient Egyptians were the first to use lime mortars. About 6,000 years ago, they used lime to plaster the pyramids at Giza. In addition, the Egyptians also incorporated various limes into their religious temples as well as their homes. Indian traditional structures built with lime mortar, which are more than 4,000 years old like Mohenjo-daro is still a heritage monument of Indus valley civilization in Pakistan.http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.843.619&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf It is one of the oldest known types of mortar also used in ancient Rome and Greece, when it largely replaced the clay and gypsum mortars common to ancient Egyptian construction. With the introduction of Portland cement during the 19th century, the use of lime mortar in new constructions gradually declined. This was largely due to the ease of use of Portland cement, its quick setting, and high compressive strength. However, the soft and porous properties of lime mortar provide certain advantages when working with softer building materials such as natural stone and terracotta. For this reason, while Portland cement continues to be commonly used in new constructions of brick and concrete construction, in the repair and restoration of brick and stone-built structures originally built using lime mortar, the use of Portland cement is not recommended.US Park Service Preservation Brief 2 Despite its enduring utility over many centuries, lime mortar's effectiveness as a building material has not been well understood; time-honoured practices were based on tradition, folklore and trade knowledge, vindicated by the vast number of old buildings that remain standing. Only during the last few decades has empirical testing provided a scientific understanding of its remarkable durability.Peter Ellis, The Analysis of Mortar: The Past 20 Years Both professionals and do-it- yourself home owners can purchase lime putty mortar (and have their historical mortar matched for both color and content) by companies that specialize in historical preservation and sell pre-mixed mortar in small batches.

Uses Lime mortar today is primarily used in the conservation of buildings originally built using lime mortar, but may be used as an alternative to ordinary portland cement. It is made principally of lime (hydraulic, or non hydraulic), water and an aggregate such as sand. Portland cement has proven to be incompatible with lime mortar because it is harder, less flexible, and impermeable. These qualities lead to premature deterioration of soft, historic bricksSickels-Taves, L. B. and Sheehan, M. S., \\"Specifying Historic Materials: The Use of Lime\\".

Print. so the traditionally, low temperature fired, lime mortars are recommended for use with existing mortar of a similar type or reconstruction of buildings using historically correct methods. In the past, lime mortar tended to be mixed on site with whatever sand was locally available. Since the sand influences the colour of the lime mortar, colours of pointing mortar can vary dramatically from district to district. Hydraulic and non-hydraulic lime Hydraulic lime sets by hydration so it can set under water. Non-hydraulic lime sets by carbonatation and so needs exposure to carbon dioxide in the air and cannot set under water or inside a thick wall. For natural hydraulic lime (NHL) mortars, the lime is obtained from limestone naturally containing a sufficient percentage of silica and/or alumina. Artificial hydraulic lime is produced by introducing specific types and quantities of additives to the source of lime during the burning process, or adding a pozzolan to non-hydraulic lime. Non- hydraulic lime is produced from a high purity source of calcium carbonate such as chalk, limestone or oyster shells. =Non-hydraulic lime= Non-hydraulic lime is primarily composed of (generally greater than 95%) calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2. Non-hydraulic lime is produced by first heating sufficiently pure calcium carbonate to between 954¬∞ and 1066 ¬∞C, driving off carbon dioxide to produce quicklime (calcium oxide). This is done in a lime kiln. The quicklime is then slaked: hydrated by being thoroughly mixed with enough water to form a slurry (lime putty), or with less water to produce dry powder. This hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide) naturally turns back into calcium carbonate by reacting with carbon dioxide in the air, the entire process being called the lime cycle. The slaking process involved in creating a lime putty is an exothermic reaction which initially creates a liquid of a creamy consistency. This is then matured for 2 to 3 months‚Äîdepending upon environmental conditions‚Äîto allow time for it to condense and mature into a lime putty. A matured lime putty is thixotropic, meaning that when a lime putty is agitated it changes from a putty into a more liquid state. This aids its use for mortars as it makes a mortar easier to work with. If left to stand following agitation a lime putty will slowly revert from a thick liquid to a putty state. As well as calcium-based limestone, dolomitic limes can be produced which are based on calcium magnesium carbonate. A frequent source of confusion regarding lime mortar stems from the similarity of the terms hydraulic and hydrated. * Hydrated lime is any lime other than quicklime, and can refer to either hydraulic (hardens under water) or non-hydraulic (does not harden under water) lime. * Lime putty is always non-hydraulic and will keep indefinitely stored under water. As the name suggests, lime putty is in the form of a putty made from just lime and water. If the quicklime is slaked with an excess of water then putty or slurry is produced. If just the right quantity of water is used, the result is a dry material (any excess water escaping as steam during heating). This is ground to make hydrated lime powder. Hydrated, non-hydraulic lime powder can be mixed with water to form lime putty. Before use putty is usually left in the absence of carbon dioxide (usually under water) to mature. Putty can be matured for as little as 24 hours or for many years; an increased maturation time improves the quality of the putty. There is an argument that a lime putty which has been matured for an extended period (over 12 months) becomes so stiff that it is difficult to work. There is some dispute as to the comparative quality of putty formed from dry hydrated lime compared with that produced as putty at the time of slaking. It is generally agreed that the latter is preferable. A hydrated lime will produce a material which is not as \\"fatty\\" and often, due to lengthy and poor storage, the resulting lime produced by hydrated lime will exhibit longer carbonatation periods as well as lower compressive strengths. Non-hydraulic lime takes longer to set and is weaker than hydraulic lime, and should not be allowed to freeze before it is well set. Although the setting process can be slow, the drying time of a lime mortar must be regulated at a slow rate to ensure a good final set. A rapidly dried lime mortar will result in a low-strength, poor-quality final mortar often displaying shrinkage cracks. In practice, lime mortars are often protected from direct sunlight and wind with damp hessian sheeting or sprayed with water to control the drying rates. But it also has the quality of autogeneous healing (self healing) where some free lime dissolves in water and is redeposited in any tiny cracks which form. Oyster Shell MortarThe large flakes of oyster shell are a signal that this is a faux shell mortar. In fact it was a very hard Portland replacement which luckily had not done much harm to the brick. In the tidewater region of Maryland and Virginia, oyster shells were used to produce quicklime during the colonial period. Similar to other materials used to produce lime, the oyster shells are burned. This can be done in a lime rick instead of a kiln. Burning shells in a rick is something that Colonial Williamsburg and the recreation of Ferry Farm have had to develop from conjecture and in-the-field learning. The rick that they constructed consists of logs set up in a circle that burn slowly, converting oysters that are contained in the wood pile to an ashy powder. An explanatory video of how the rick was built for the Ferry Farm can be found here. The burnt shell can then be slaked and turned into lime putty. Mortars using oyster shells can sometimes be identified by the presence of small bits of shell in the exposed mortar joint. In restoration masonry, the bits of shell are sometimes exaggerated to give the viewer the impression of authenticity. Unfortunately, these modern attempts often contain higher than necessary ratios of Portland cement. This can cause failures in the brick if the mortar joint is stronger than the brick elements. =Hydraulic lime= Hydraulic lime sets by reaction with water called hydration. When a stronger lime mortar is required, such as for external or structural purposes, a pozzolan can be added, which improves its compressive strength and helps to protect it from weathering damage. Pozzolans include powdered brick, heat treated clay, silica fume, fly ash, and volcanic materials. The chemical set imparted ranges from very weak to almost as strong as Portland cement. This can also assist in creating more regulated setting times of the mortar as the pozzolan will create a hydraulic set, which can be of benefit in restoration projects when time scales and ultimately costs need to be monitored and maintained. Hydraulic lime can be considered, in terms both of properties and manufacture, as part-way between non-hydraulic lime and Portland cement. The limestone used contains sufficient quantities of clay and/or silica. The resultant product will contain dicalcium silicate but unlike Portland cement not tricalcium silicate. It is slaked enough to convert the calcium oxide to calcium hydroxide but not with sufficient water to react with the dicalcium silicate. It is this dicalcium silicate which in combination with water provides the setting properties of hydraulic lime. Aluminium and magnesium also produce a hydraulic set, and some pozzolans contain these elements. There are three strength grades for natural hydraulic lime, laid down in the European Norm EN459; NHL2, NHL3.5 and NHL5. The numbers stand for the minimum compressive strength at 28 days in newtons per square millimeter (N/mm2). For example, the NHL 3.5 strength ranges from 3.5 N/mm2 (510 psi) to 10 N/mm2 (1,450 psi).\\"The Use og Lime-based Mortars in New Build\\" These are similar to the old classification of feebly hydraulic, moderately hydraulic and eminently hydraulic, and although different, some people continue to refer to them interchangeably. The terminology for hydraulic lime mortars was improved by the skilled French civil engineer Louis Vicat in the 1830s from the older system of water limes and feebly, moderately and eminently. Vicat published his work following research of the use of lime mortars whilst building bridges and roads in his work. The French company Vicat still currently produce natural cements and lime mortars. Names of lime mortars were so varied and conflicting across the European continent that the reclassification has greatly improved the understanding and use of lime mortars. Mix Traditional lime mortar is a combination of lime putty and aggregate (usually sand). A typical modern lime mortar mix would be 1 part lime putty to 3 parts washed, well graded, sharp sand. Other materials have been used as aggregate instead of sand. The theory is that the voids of empty space between the sand particles account for a 1/3 of the volume of the sand. The lime putty when mixed at a 1 to 3 ratio, fill these voids to create a compact mortar. Analysis of mortar samples from historic buildings typically indicates a higher ratio of around 1 part lime putty to 1.5 part https://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/mythmix/mythmix.htm aggregate/sand was commonly used. This equates to approximately 1 part dry quicklime to 3 parts sand. A traditional coarse plaster mix also had horse hair added for reinforcing and control of shrinkage, important when plastering to wooden laths and for base (or dubbing) coats onto uneven surfaces such as stone walls where the mortar is often applied in thicker coats to compensate for the irregular surface levels. If shrinkage and cracking of the lime mortar does occur this can be as a result of either * The sand being poorly graded or with a particle size that is too small * The mortar being applied too thickly (Thicker coats increase the possibility of shrinkage, cracking and slumping) * Too much suction from the substrate * High air temperatures or direct sunlight which force dry the mortar * High water content in the lime mortar mix * Poor quality or unmatured lime putty A common method for mixing lime mortar with powdered lime is as follows: * Gather your ingredients, sand, lime, and water * Measure out your ratio of sand to lime, for example 3 buckets of sand, and 1 bucket of lime for a 3:1 ratio. * Mix the dry ingredients thoroughly so all the sand is coated with lime, and there are neither chunks of sand or lime visible. * Reserve some portion of the dry ingredients by removing it from your mixing vessel. The amount reserved can vary, but a safe starting point is about 1/4 of the batch. This will be added in later to fine tune the dryness of the mix. * Measure out water. How much depends on how wet you want your mix to be, and how damp/wet your sand is. A good starting point is 1 quart of water per gallon of sand. * Add about 2/3 of the water to your dry ingredients and mix until even consistency. * Add the reserved dry ingredients and/or the remaining water to get a mix you like. It takes time to know what works well, and the recipe can change depending on the temperature, humidity, moisture in the sand, type of brick, and task at hand (laying brick may warrant a wetter mix, while pointing may require a drier one. * To test the mix as you are making it, you can use a trowel, or pat the mortar with your hand to see how much moisture and \\"cream\\" come to the surface. * Remember to thoroughly wet your brick prior to using lime mortar. Old brick can be extremely porous, a 4lb brick can hold a pint of water. The bricks should be saturated, but dry on the surface prior to laying or pointing. Excess water can cause the lime to run and leave streaks. =Hair reinforcement= Hair reinforcement is not found in lime mortars, but is common in lime plaster and many types of hair and other organic fibres can be found in historic plasters.Bennett, B., 2002, Lime Plaster and Render Reinforcement, Building Conservation Directory However, organic material in lime will degrade in damp environments particularly on damp external renders.\\\\--~~~~Stafford Holmes and Michael Wingate, 1997, Building with Lime, P86, IT Publications. This problem has given rise to the use of polypropylene fibres in new lime renders =Properties= * Lime mortar is not as strong in compression as Portland cement based mortar, but both are sufficiently strong for construction of non- high-rise domestic properties. * Lime mortar does not adhere as strongly to masonry as Portland cement. This is an advantage with softer types of masonry, where use of cement in many cases eventually results in cement pulling away some masonry material when it reaches the end of its life. The mortar is a sacrificial element which should be weaker than the bricks so it will crack before the bricks. It is less expensive to replace cracked mortar than cracked bricks. * Under cracking conditions, Portland cement breaks, whereas lime often produces numerous microcracks if the amount of movement is small. These microcracks recrystallise through the action of 'free lime' effectively self- healing the affected area. * Historic buildings are frequently constructed with relatively soft masonry units (e.g. soft brick and many types of stone), and minor movement in such buildings is quite common due to the nature of the foundations. This movement breaks the weakest part of the wall, and with Portland cement mortar this is usually the masonry. When lime mortar is used, the lime is the weaker element, and the mortar cracks in preference to the masonry. This results in much less damage, and is relatively simple to repair. * Lime mortar is more porous than cement mortars, and it wicks any dampness in the wall to the surface where it evaporates. Thus any salt content in the water crystallises on the lime, damaging the lime and thus saving the masonry. Cement, on the other hand, evaporates water less than soft brick, so damp issues are liable to cause salt formation and spalling on brick surfaces and consequent disintegration of bricks.Masonry: the best of Fine homebuilding.. Newtown, CT: Taunton Press, 1997. Print. 114. This damp evaporation ability is widely referred to as 'breathability'. * Lime mortar should not be used below temperatures of and takes longer to set so it should be protected from freezing for three months. Because of its faster set, hydraulic lime may not need as much time before freezing temperatures begin. Usually any dampness in the wall will cause the lime mortar to change colour, indicating the presence of moisture. The effect will create an often mottled appearance of a limewashed wall. As the moisture levels within a wall alter, so will the shade of a limewash. The darker the shade of limewash, the more pronounced this effect will become. A load of mixed lime mortar may be allowed to sit as a lump for some time, without it drying out (it may get a thin crust). When ready to use, this lump may be remixed ('knocked up') again and then used. Traditionally on building sites, prior to the use of mechanical mixers, the lime putty (slaked on site in a pit) was mixed with sand by a labourer who would \\"beat and ram\\" the mix with a \\"larry\\" (a wide hoe with large holes). This was then covered with sand and allowed to sit for a while (from days to weeks) - a process known as 'banking'. This lump was then remixed and used as necessary. This process cannot be done with Portland cement. Lime with Portland cement The combination of Portland cement and lime is used for stabilization and solidification of the ground through establishing of lime cement columns or stabilization of the entire upper mass volume. The method provides an increase in strength when it comes to vibrations, stability and settling. When building e.g. roads and railways, the method is more common and widespread (Queen Eufemias street in Central Oslo, E18 at T√∏nsberg etc.). For preservation purposes, Type N and Type O mortars are often used. A Type N mortar is 1 part Portland, 1 part Lime and 6 parts sand or other aggregate (1:1:6). A Type O mortar is 1 part Portland, 2 parts Lime and 9 parts sand or other aggregate (1:2:9). Straight lime mortar has no Portland, and 1 part Lime to 3 parts sand or other aggregate. The addition of cement or other pozzolan to decrease cure times is referred to as ‚Äúgauging.‚Äù Other than Portland, ash and brick dust have been used to gauge mortars. Spalling of brick in an 18th century chimney. The lower section is older than the upper. Note that the while the lower mortar is deteriorated, it is not as bad as the brick. For historic restoration purposes, and restoration work involving repointing or brick replacement, masons must discover the original brick and mortar and repair it with a similar material. The National Park Service provides guidance for proper masonry repointing through Preservation Brief 2. In general, Brief 2 suggests that repointing should be done with a similar or weaker mortar. Therefore, a straight lime mortar joint should be repointed in kind. Due to the popularity of Portland cement, this often is not the case. A wall system needs a balance between the mortar and brick that allows the mortar to be the weak part of the unit. When mortar is stronger than the brick, it prevents any natural movement in the wall and the faces of the brick will begin to deteriorate, a process known as spalling, the process by which the outer face of a brick degrades and can flake off or turn to powder. There is also a natural movement of water through a masonry wall. A strong Portland cement mix will prevent a free flow of water from a moist to dry area. This can cause rising damp to be trapped within the wall and create system failures. If moisture can not escape into the air, it will cause damage to a wall structure. Water freezing in the wall is another cause of spalling. In restoration work of pre-20th century structures, there should be a high ratio of lime and aggregate to Portland. This reduces the compressive strength of the mortar but allows the wall system to function better. The lime mortar acts as a wick that helps to pull water from the brick. This can help to prevent the older brick from spalling. Even when the brick is a modern, harder element, repointing with a higher ratio lime mortar may help to reduce rising damp. It may not be advisable for all consumers to use a straight lime mortar. With no Portland in the mix, there is less control over the setting of the mortar. In some cases, a freeze thaw cycle will be enough to create failure in the mortar joint. Straight lime mortar can also take a long time to fully cure and therefore work needs to be performed at a time of year where the weather conditions are conducive to the mortar setting properly. Those conditions are not only above freezing temperatures but also drier seasons. To protect the slow curing mortar from damp, a siloxane can be added to the surface. With historic structures, this may be a controversial strategy as it could have a detrimental effect to the historic fabric. The presence of Portland allows for a more stable mortar. The stability and predictability make the mixed mortar more user friendly, particularly in applications where entire wall sections are being laid. Contractors and designers may prefer mixes that contain Portland due to the increased compressive strength over a straight lime mortar. As many pre-Portland mix buildings are still standing and have original mortar, the arguments for greater compressive strength and ease of use may be more a result of current practice and a lack of understanding of older techniques.

It is the fourth in the series, being first published in 1983, though the fourteenth chronologically. Set in the summer of 1812 including the Battle of Salamanca on 22 July 1812, the story follows Sharpe and his friend Sergeant Harper involved in espionage while hunting down the sadistic and highly dangerous Colonel Philippe Leroux. Plot summary French Colonel Philippe Leroux and Captain Paul Delmas are fleeing from the King's German Legion toward Sharpe's Light Company. Leroux has extracted the identity of El Mirador, Britain's most important spy in Spain, from a priest he tortured. Leroux kills Delmas and assumes his identity and then allows himself to be captured by Sharpe and his men, knowing that the British would never exchange an imperial colonel. Sharp covets Leroux's sword, a finely crafted, superbly balanced Klingenthal sabre. As Captain Delmas, Leroux gives his parole to Major Joseph Forrest. Whilst he is being escorted back to Wellington's headquarters, he kills his escort, Ensign MacDonald, and escapes on horseback towards Salamanca. Lieutenant Colonel Windham pursues Leroux on horseback, but Leroux kills him. He gains sanctuary in one of the three French-controlled forts outside Salamanca, after Father Curtis protects him from the Salamancan populace. Sharpe confronts Curtis who explains that the Frenchman is in fact Leroux, and that he was protecting the city's population against Leroux's revenge if the city were to be recaptured by the French. Sharpe takes an instant dislike to Curtis, whom he thinks is sympathetic to the French. In Salamanca, Sharpe is introduced to the breathtakingly beautiful H√©l√®ne, la Marquesa de Casares el Grande y Melida Sadaba, and to Captain Lord Jack Spears. Wellington's army arrives at Salamanca as part of their manoeuvring with Marshal Marmont's French army. Major Michael Hogan is both disturbed and relieved when Sharpe gives him a list Leroux dropped; the list was stolen from Hogan and contains the names of many of Hogan's spies. Many of them have recently been tortured and killed by Leroux. Frustrated at his inability to bring Marmont to battle on his terms, Wellington finally sends two battalions, including the South Essex, against three French battalions in an effort to provoke Marmont, but Marmont does not rise to the bait. Following the battle, Wellington places Sharpe and the Light Company under Hogan's command (as he and his men can identify Leroux) to ensure Leroux does not escape from the French forts. The Sixth Division attempts to storm the forts by surprise, but the French have been tipped off and slaughter the attackers. Sharpe is invited to a party by La Marquesa, which had been planned to celebrate the attack's success, but decides not to attend. Nevertheless Lord Spears later persuades him to go. As he prepares to leave the party, one of the servants takes him to a private garden for a private meeting with La Marquesa. She obliquely claims to be El Mirador, and begs Sharpe to protect her from Leroux. They become lovers (her fat old husband being away suppressing a revolt in Brazil); after a while, she tells him her first name is Helena. After several days, the forts are assaulted again and quickly surrender. Sharpe and his men search the French prisoners several times, but cannot find Leroux. After searching the wounded, Sharpe allows them to be taken to the hospital in Salamanca. After Harper discovers a disemboweled French soldier who does not appear to have a full complement of intestines, Sharpe realises that Leroux has disguised himself as a French soldier with a severe stomach wound. Leaving his jacket behind (he had taken it off due to the heat), Sharpe and Harper race to the hospital, disrupting Leroux's rendezvous with a confederate who has brought a horse for him. Whilst searching the hospital, Harper discovers Leroux and a struggle ensues. Harper ends up being pushed down a staircase and knocked unconscious. Sharpe comes running and engages in a sword duel with Leroux until the blade of Sharpe's sabre is shattered. Before Leroux can kill Sharpe, a sentry comes to Sharpe's aid, and Leroux flees. Both the sentry and Sharpe fire at, but miss Leroux. Leroux shoots Sharpe in the stomach. The Light Company eventually realise that Sharpe and Harper are missing and Major Hogan is alerted. A search of the hospital finds Harper still unconscious, but Sharpe cannot be found amongst the living nor the British or French dead. When his discarded trousers are found, he is believed to have been mistaken for a dead French soldier and already buried in a mass grave. In fact, he has been taken to the death ward run by Sergeant Connolley in the dank basement. Sharpe, unrecognised, drifts in and out of consciousness, but refuses to die from a wound that is almost always fatal. After Hogan rescues Harper from provosts, the pair resume the search. They finally find Sharpe, but he is barely clinging to life. While the army moves on, Harper and Isabella (the peasant girl Harper rescued in the Battle of Badajoz) minister to Sharpe's needs. In the meantime, Hogan has assigned Lord Spears and some men to discreetly guard El Mirador. With time on his hands, Harper buys a sword and spends many hours improving it. Isabella tells him that not only has Sharpe turned the corner and is on the road to full recovery, but La Marquesa is going to have all three of them stay in one of her houses by the river. Sharpe is visited by Lord Spears and suggests that Lord Spears is protecting El Mirador. Sharpe's knowledge of this surprises Spears and makes him uncomfortable but he nevertheless confirms Sharpe's hunch. As Sharpe recuperates, Harper, now recovered and confident of Sharpe's progress, returns to the Light Company. A month later, Hogan sends Sharpe a letter telling him that the French will soon be returning to Salamanca and that he must pack and leave. That evening, Father Curtis returns Sharpe's stolen rifle. Curtis tells Sharpe that one of his correspondents in Paris has discovered that Leroux has a multi-lingual sister named H√©l√®ne. Curtis believes that this must be La Marquesa. Hogan does as well, and asks Sharpe to feed her false information that Wellington intends to speedily retreat to Portugal, while remaining with one division as rearguard to fool the French into believing otherwise. Sharpe realises that Curtis is El Mirador, not La Marquesa. Whilst hoping that she is not a French spy, he does deceive her later that evening. Sharpe, still not fully healed, rejoins Wellington's army, riding on a horse that was a gift from La Marquesa. Marmont, suspecting already that Wellington is racing for the border, has these suspicions confirmed by a message from La Marquesa and he sends his army in pursuit, enabling Wellington to spring his trap, and the Battle of Salamanca ensues. The French left is destroyed by a British cavalry charge. Marmont and his deputy are both injured, so General Clausel assumes command. The British Fourth Division (including the South Essex) attack the French centre, but are repulsed by a French counterattack by Clausel's reserves. Sharpe seeing the South Essex being pushed back and realising that they need to stay firm in order to channel the French columns into a killing ground for the Sixth Division, cannot resist joining the battle. He rides to the wavering Light Company. The Company, back under Sharpe's firm hand, stand their ground, and the French column is crushed. The French withdraw under the protection of their still undefeated right, hoping to cross the bridge at Alba de Tormes and thus escape. Wellington is delighted, believing that a Spanish garrison holds the bridge and that the French are trapped. Unbeknownst to him, however, the Spanish garrison has fled, believing that the British have been defeated, and the French retreat proceeds unopposed. Lord Spears conducts a solo charge against the fleeing French and is fatally shot. Sharpe comes to his aid. Spears is dying and he wants Sharpe to tell his sister that he died honourably and he tells Sharpe that he wants to die because he has the Black Lion (syphilis), which results in an ugly death. He tells Sharpe that he knew that H√©l√®ne was a French spy and that he had told Hogan this some time ago. Sharpe realises that he is lying and suspects that he is the traitor in the British headquarters who stole Hogan's list. He threatens to kill Spears by stabbing him in the back (which would make it seem like he was killed whilst running away). Spears relents and confesses. He had not sold out Curtis because Leroux already knew. but he did give Leroux the book in which Curtis had written down the details of all the agents in his network. Spears had been hoping that in exchange Leroux would give him a night with his sister, but instead, he gave him back his parole and promised to provide his sister with a dowry when he returned to Paris. Then, at Spears' own request, Sharpe shoots him in the head. He reports to Hogan that Leroux has Curtis's book. Sharpe, Harper and Hogan pursue the retreating French through the night in an effort to intercept Leroux. In the morning, they catch up to him, but he is able to outrun them and gains the protection of one of three French infantry squares. The French infantry subsequently ambush a British/King's German Legion cavalry charge against the French cavalry. Against extremely heavy odds, the enraged cavalry succeed in breaking the squares, although with heavy casualties. Sharpe corners Leroux. Leroux shoots at him, missing Sharpe but killing his horse. Sharpe shoots Leroux, wounding him in the leg and causing him to be thrown from his horse. Leroux refuses to fight, preferring to surrender. Sharpe forces him to fight, threatening to kill him anyway if he does not. In the ensuing sword duel, Sharpe kills Leroux and recovers Leroux's sabre and the coded book. La Marquesa is allowed to leave Salamanca, since it is not in the British interest to create a scandal involving a high-ranking Spanish aristocrat. She encounters Sharpe, and is not particularly upset when she learns that Sharpe killed her brother. Sharpe chooses to keep Harper's present, feeling it is lucky, and throws the Klingenthal into the river.

Named after L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy, the university offers programs in art, architecture, designer and visual communication. History The predecessor of the Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design, the Hungarian Royal National School of Arts and Crafts, was founded in 1880 and operated under this name until 1944. Like other European Art Colleges, it evolved from a handicraft industry school, the Model Drawing School. Its founder and first director, Guszt√°v Kelety declared the ‚Äòeducational support of a more artistic wood and furniture industry‚Äô the aim of the new institution. The spirit of the school was fundamentally influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement of Britain, as well as by Hungarian folklore. At first there was only one department, in which architectural drawing and design were taught. Goldsmithing and xylography classes started in 1883, while decorative painting and copperplate engraving classes began in 1884. The decorative sculpture class, uniting small sculpture and wood-carving, was established in 1885. In 1896, the school, which had been scattered in different parts of Budapest, moved to the new Museum of Applied Arts, and came under the directorship of Kamill Flitter. The number of registered students at that time was 120. The idea of converting the school into a college arose in the early 1940s, but the rigours of the war years prevented any steps from being taken. Following the repair of damage suffered in the Second World War, teaching resumed in March 1945, and preparations to reorganise the school continued. In 1946 the ministry decided to elevate the school‚Äôs rank; thus the College of Arts and Crafts was established. In 1950 there were already six degree courses, and the number of students in 1952 rose to 280. In 1954 parts of the College moved to the present location in Zugligeti Street, but some of the workshops remained in the Kinizsi Street annex of the Museum of Applied Arts. In 1955 another reorganisation occurred: with the termination of the theatre stage design course, four degree courses remained: interior decoration, decorative painting, decorative sculpture and textile design. The industrial design degree course was initiated in 1959. The appointment of Frigyes Pog√°ny to the head of the College in 1964 ushered in a new era of reforms, coinciding with the growing appreciation of the social role of applied arts. In 1971 the College was granted university rank, but remained a college in name. In 1982, under Istv√°n Gergely, a new series of reforms were introduced: the departments were changed into institutes, allowing students to earn college and university degrees in the incremental educational system. In the mid-1980s, the range of courses was extended with the establishment of photography, video and art management courses. The official gallery of the College, T√∂lgyfa Gal√©ra, opened its doors to the public in Henger Street in 1987. With the appointment of the renowned ceramic artist to the head of the College, uniform university training was introduced, and the departments were re-established. In 1997, because of economic restrictions, the structure of the institution was modified again. The University was accredited in 1998. Since 1999, textile designer Judit Droppa has served as president of the University. In 2002 a far-reaching development plan was devised, the first phase calling for the removal of the T√∂lgyfa Gallery from Henger Street and the renovation of the main building of the University in the same year. The current president of the University is G√°bor Kopek. In March 2006 the Hungarian University of Arts and Design announced its new name as Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design. right =Departments= *Architecture *Product Design *Silicate Design *Textile Design *Visual Communication (graphic design, video, animation, photography) Others: *Teacher Training *Manager Training *Doctoral Studies =Notable faculty and alumni= *S√°ndor Bortnyik *L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy *Istv√°n Orosz *G√°bor Megyeri *Ern≈ë Rubik, the inventor of Rubik's Cube.

Prazepam is a prodrug for desmethyldiazepam which is responsible for the therapeutic effects of prazepam.  Indications  Prazepam is indicated for the short-term treatment of anxiety. After short-term therapy, the dose is usually gradually tapered- off to reduce or avoid any withdrawal or rebound effects. Desmethyldiazepam, an active metabolite, has a very long half-life of 29 to 224 hours, which contributes to the therapeutic effects of prazepam.  Side effects  Side effects of prazepam are less profound than with other benzodiazepines. Excessive drowsiness and with longer-term use, drug dependence, are the most common side effects of prazepam. Side effects such as fatigue or \\"feeling spacey\\" can also occur but less commonly than with other benzodiazepines. Other side effects include feebleness, clumsiness or lethargy, clouded thinking and mental slowness.  Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal  Tolerance and dependence can develop with long-term use of prazepam, and upon cessation or reduction in dosage, then a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome may occur with symptoms such as tremulousness, dysphoria, psychomotor agitation, tachycardia and sweating. In severe cases, hallucinations, psychosis and seizures can occur. Withdrawal-related psychosis is generally unresponsive to antipsychotic mediations. The risk and severity of the withdrawal syndrome increases the higher the dose and the longer prazepam is taken for. Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal problems may be less severe than with other benzodiazepines, such as diazepam. It may be because tolerance is slower to develop with prazepam than with other benzodiazepines. Abrupt or over-rapid discontinuation of prazepam after long-term use, even at low dosage, may result in a protracted withdrawal syndrome. Benzodiazepines can induce serious problems of addiction, which is one of the main reasons for their use being restricted to short-term use. A survey in Senegal found that the majority of doctors believed that their training in this area was generally poor. Recommendations for national authorities to take urgent action regarding the rational use of benzodiazepines. Another study in Dakar found that almost one-fifth of doctors ignored prescription guidelines regarding short-term use of benzodiazepines, and almost three-quarters of doctors regarded their training and knowledge of benzodiazepines to be inadequate. More training regarding benzodiazepines has been recommended for doctors.  Contraindications and special caution  Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders.  Mechanism of action  Prazepam exerts its therapeutic effects primarily via modulating the benzodiazepine receptor which in turn enhances GABA function in the brain. Prazepam like other benzodiazepines has anticonvulsant properties, but its anticonvulsant properties are not as potent as other benzodiazepines when tested in animal studies.  Pharmacokinetics  Prazepam is metabolised into descyclopropylmethylprazepam (also known as desmethyldiazepam) and 3-hydroxyprazepam which is further metabolised into oxazepam. Prazepam is a prodrug for descyclopropylmethylprazepam/desmethyldiazepam (also known as norprazepam or nordazepam) which is responsible for most of the therapeutic activity of prazepam rather than prazepam itself.  Interactions  Prazepam may interact with cimetidine. Alcohol in combination with prazepam increases the adverse effects, particularly performance impairing side effects and drowsiness.  Overdose  The symptoms of an overdose of prazepam include sleepiness, agitation and ataxia. Hypotonia may also occur in severe cases. Overdoses in children typically result in more severe symptoms of overdose.  Abuse potential  Prazepam like other benzodiazepines has abuse potential and can be habit forming. However, its abuse potential may be lower than other benzodiazepines because it has a slow onset of action.  Toxicity  Animal studies have found prazepam taken during pregnancy results in delayed growth and causes reproductive abnormalities.  Trade names  Common trade names include Centrac, Centrax, Demetrin, Lysanxia, Mono Demetrin, Pozapam, Prasepine, Prazene, Reapam and Trepidan. Trade names vary depending on the country; Austria: Demetrin, Belgium: Lysanxia, France: Lysanxia, Germany: Demetrin; Mono Demetrin, Greece: Centrac, Ireland: Centrax, Italy: Prazene; Trepidan, Macedonia: Demetrin, Prazepam, Netherlands: Reapam, Portugal: Demetrin, South Africa: Demetrin, Switzerland: Demetrin, Thailand: Pozapam; Prasepine.

In addition to its research, Avondale has historical buildings, a farming equipment museum and operates as an agriculture education centre specialising in introducing primary school children to farming, and teaching of its history in Western Australia. Avondale is situated on land where the Dale River joins the Avon River northwest of Beverley. It is located on land originally granted to the first Governor of Western Australia, Captain (later Admiral Sir) James Stirling and Captain Mark Currie RN in 1836. These grants were combined in 1849 and with additional land purchases they became known as Avondale Estate, expanding to in excess of . On 4 April 1924 the remaining of Avondale were passed on to the Department of Agriculture and Food. Initially Avondale continued its involvement with the Group Settlement Scheme, it was not until 1926 that research activities commenced. During the 1930s it was to be the laboratory for Dr Harold Bennetts successful research into Bacillus ovitoxicus. As part of Western Australia's 1979 sesquicentennial celebrations a machinery museum was built and the other buildings were restored to original condition. Today, Avondale is managed by the National Trust of Western Australia and is open to the public at varying times throughout the year. Early farm years Original boundary between the properties granted to Currie and Stirling; the wall was built in 1978 In November 1835, an expedition led by Governor James Stirling joined another party led by the Surveyor General John Septimus Roe in King George Sound. Roe had made arrangement for both parties to return to the Swan River Colony via an alternative route. The route was intended to join the settlements of King George Sound, York and the Swan River Colony along with the newly established settlement of Williams. This expedition passed through the area of Avondale sighting the Dale River and a granite hill that Roe name Bald Hill on 27 December. Bald Hill was to become the primary reference point for surveying the region. In 1836, the surveyor Thomas Watson returned to area and used Bald Hill as the principal trigonometric reference. Watson was to map out a number of lots in the area including the western boundary for Beverley town site. Two of the lots surveyed were Avon location 14 with , and Avon location K with ; location 14 was given to Captain Mark Currie, Fremantle Harbour Master, while location K was given to Stirling. Stirling as Governor and Currie as harbour master were not paid salaries by the colony but given land grants as compensation for their services. In 1978, surveyors using current equipment were engaged to determine the exact location of these original holdings, and commented on the remarkable accuracy of Watson's survey 142 years before. Currie sold his grant of land to a Nicholas Carey in September 1838 for ‚Ç§330. Carey entered into a lease agreement in December with Governor Stirling for his grant, which included Carey purchasing the property at the end of the lease for ‚Ç§750 in 1846. Carey also purchased to west of location 14 he also received an additional grant of land in 1849. With all the land in the vee formed by the Avon River and the Dale River the property was now in size and was named Avondale Estate. During the late 1840s Carey moved to Guernsey leaving Avondale to be operated by an unknown caretaker. Inside the stables at Avondale Upon Carey's death in March 1889, Avondale was inherited by his 16-year-old grand nephew William Herbert deLisle. deLisle arrived and took up residence there in 1893, and assumed the land title in 1894. Avondale had been a pastoral property until deLisle's arrival, over the next ten years sections of the estate were sold off to fund its development. During this period, the house was expanded and the stable built, which included 20 horse stalls with hollow walls and an overhead loft. The hollow walls enable feed from the loft to gravitate directly to the feed bins in each stall. The remaining were sold to William James Butcher and Charles John Hunt Butcher in 1904. The brothers purchased adjoining properties adding which enlarged Avondale to . In 1908 they offered to sell Avondale to the Western Australian Government for ¬£5/10/- per acre. The Government countered with an offer of ¬£5/5/- per acre, which was accepted. Avondale was purchased in March 1910 under the Agricultural Land Purchase act for a total of ¬£51,494/12/6, equivalent to approximately A$5,500,000 in 2006. =1910 to 1924= A display in the museum Even though the Butcher brothers' farming operations continued until January 1911, the government began preparations for subdivision. John Hall was sent to Avondale in April 1910 to locate all improvements and draw subdivision lines following existing fencing where possible. His arrival sparked considerable controversy, because not only had he set up camp on the golf course but the golf club also had leased of Avondale that joined the edge of town. Investigations found that the lease was terminated when the land was sold. Hall divided Avondale into nine substantial size farms whose boundaries have remained unchanged since, the that had been occupied by the golf course was made into small lots which have since been further subdivided. Lands Department accountants calculated that the sale of the lots would return ¬£8,768/3/3 after expenses, and the estate was gazetted and land made available on 21 December 1910. Of the nine substantial lots only four were taken up as settlers were unable to pay the ¬£6 per acre price. Lot 1 was taken up by George Hancock, the father of mining magnate Lang Hancock, and George's brother Richard took up Lot 2. Lot 13 was taken up by G.W. Isbister, and Lot 4 was taken up by former Premier Sir Newton Moore, who then proceeded to London with the plans. As Agent General Newton was to offer to prospective settlers lots at Avondale, although a number telegram inquiries to ascertain availability of lots at Avondale were sent, there is no record any lots being allocated in London. The heritage listed weighbridge in foreground with the heritage listed silo behind As none of the remaining 5 substantial lots had been taken up by November 1911, it was suggested that 4 of those remaining be used for an Agricultural College with the Lands Department responsible for continuing to farm the remaining lots. This left one lot known as Drumclyer available, in 1914 a Dowerin farmer tried to lease Drumclyer after losing his property there from drought, but was unable to negotiate an acceptable rate. In December, the Hancock brothers had abandoned lots 1 & 2, Isbister had also abandoned Lot 13, although it is not known exactly when, leaving only the of Lot 4 in private hands. With the outbreak of World War I the Agricultural College plans were abandoned as well. Near the end of 1916, the Beverley community requested that Avondale be subdivided into 20 lots for returning soldiers. It was also suggested that Avondale be a nursery where soldiers are given small allotments and those that succeed are then given larger grants elsewhere in the state. In July 1918, it was decided that Avondale would have 6 lots made available for servicemen from the Beverley area and that which included the area around the homestead was to remain under control of the Lands Department. Department of Agriculture The original homestead block faced an uncertain future for many years, until it was given to the Department of Agriculture in 1924. Initially intended for the production of pure seed wheat and oats, very little was produced for several years. Avondale was used as an assembly and holding ground for dairy cattle, prior to them being sent to group settlers in the state's South West. During this period, the silo was built with a capacity of 100 tonnes; the silo is now heritage listed. The local farming community raised concerns about cattle being unsuitable for the area, while the concerns were not immediately addressed Avondale was turned towards seed production and research. The first research began in 1926; this was in the application of superphosphate its alternatives and the timing of application. Initial results were published in the Journal of Agriculture in 1927. =Research= The heritage list laboratory built for Dr Bennetts' research A Braxy-like disease originated in the Beverley-York region in 1915. Over the next 15 years it spread across most of the state's farming districts. Flock losses generally were around 5% though there were reported cases of 30% loss. In 1918 Professor Dakin of the University of Western Australia identified the disease as a toxaemia of bacterial origin but was unable to establish the source. Dr Harold Bennetts was appointed the state's first veterinary pathologist in May 1925. Bennetts commenced an immediate investigation into the disease, using alleyways and open space around the department's city offices to house the sheep needed for the research. In 1930 a field laboratory was built at Avondale; a flock of 1000 sheep were purchased to enable feed experiments. In 1931 Bennetts had identified Bacillus ovitoxicus as the cause of the disease. With this knowledge he was able to develop the infectious enterotoxaemia vaccine; for his efforts Bennetts received a CBE. The sheep populations that were required by Bennetts at Avondale also afforded additional research opportunities. From 1931 for several years experiments were conducted with the object of determining how to best produce prime export lambs. This investigated various breeds and cross breeds determining that cross-bred ewes where significantly more productive than pure-bred Merinos. In 1934, Bennetts teamed with state botanist Charles Gardner to study the toxic effect of native plants species on sheep. Gardner would collect the plants and supply them fresh to Bennetts who would then feed them to the sheep. They confirmed 24 species of plants as being poisonous, most which were from the native pea genera Gastrolobium and Oxylobium. Based on this and later research, Gardner and Bennetts published The Toxic Plants of Western Australia in 1956.The toxic plants of Western Australia, Gardner and Bennetts (1956), p. xxi During 1935, investigations into the effects of castrating male lambs with either mechanical pincers compared to using a knife, both of these methods have since been replaced with rubber elastrator rings. The experiment on 499 sheep concluded that no significant differences were observable in respect of mortality, maturity rates and meat quality. Dr Eric Underwood began his research at Avondale in the mid-1930s also utilising the sheep flocks. Underwood's initial research was into the effects of sulfur on wool growth, he followed that research with investigations into botulism in sheep during 1935. These experiments were the first of many by Underwood over the next 30 years. During the 1940s he studied the nutritional value of hay and pasture for sheep, the ongoing results from these Studies in Cereal Hay production in Western Australia were published in the Journal of Agriculture. Aquaculture as an income supplement, this display is inside the machinery shed During World War II, Avondale farm provided research into farming of linseed and flax in Western Australia, although it was not the most suitable location for growing either. Three varieties of Linseed were trialled: Riga Crown, an early maturing variety, Italian also early maturing and Walsh, a mid-season maturing variety. It was discovered that all were susceptible to cutworm with greater damage occurring later in the season; early trails of the insecticide DDT was said to show promising results in combating this. =Other efforts= In 1942 there was some pioneering in the development and use of contour banks, the equipment required a team 4 horses or two Clydesdales, a teamster and two labourers. Through the 1950s Avondale had monitored its sheep flocks as part of the research into Dwalganup strain of clover as a livestock feed and its effect on ewe fertility.Farmnote No 41/2005 Western Australian Department of Agriculture On into the 1960s and 1970s Avondale was involved with the breeding and trial of various cereal crops for use within Western Australia. Since the early 1980s Avondale has focused on environmental and sustainable farming along with farm income supplemental alternatives like marron farming. Northam in December 2005 Avondale like most Western Australian farms utilised horses and Clydesdales in particular for pulling farming equipment. Farm economics of the 1930s meant that the Clydesdales weren't retired to enjoy the governments grassy paddocks. In 1937 a letter to the Agricultural minister details the disposal of horses that were no longer useful; The letter details how the Perth Zoo is responsible for the freight and that the Minister had approved the transaction. Many Clydesdales were to follow the first two bay mares with the consignment note description \\"for lions food, freight payable by consignee\\". This practice continued until well into the 1950s until tractors replaced the use of horses in farming. Since the opening of the museum in 1978 Avondale again utilised Clydesdales for demonstrations of the old equipment these horse are sold as pets once they are incapable of working. =1976 to present= Paddock description signage; this one is currently being used for research into various Atriplex (saltbush) species for use as fodder In 1976, as part of the preparations for Western Australia's 1979 sesquicentennial celebrations, the Department of Agriculture decided to restore the historic Avondale farm to its original state to display the achievements of Western Australian farmers. In response to the announcement, farmers from around the state responded generously with donations of old machinery and equipment. Most of this machinery was restored by Department of Agriculture mechanics. In 1978 an invitation to visit and open Avondale's agricultural displays was sent to Prince Charles, this was accepted and on 16 March 1979 Avondale was officially opened with commemorative tree planting near the entrance to the farm. The farm continues its research into improving farming and farm practices under Western Australian conditions. Avondale's displays are open to the public with picnic facilities available, included in the displays are the original homestead, the stables complete with Clydesdales and a machinery shed.

Historically it has also been practiced in regions of the world with large Irish diaspora populations, such as the United States and Australia. History =Origins in Ireland= Wrestling as a competitive sport has been recorded in Ireland as far back as the second millennium BC, when it featured as one of the many athletic contests held during the annual Tailteann Games. The mythical hero C√∫chulainn boasted of his prowess in both hurling and wrestling, and was on one occasion enraged by an undead spectre mockingly suggesting that his skill in the latter area had been highly exaggerated.Sayers, William. \\"The Motif of Wrestling in Early Irish and Mongolian Epic\\". Mongolian Studies, vol. 13, 1990, pp. 153‚Äì168 Carved depictions of two figures in a recognisable wrestling clinch appear on the Market High Cross of KellsAllen, J. Romilly. Early Christian Symbolism in Great Britain and Ireland before the Thirteenth Century. Cambridge University Press, 2016, p. 235 and the ruins of a church at Kilteelhttp://www.megalithicireland.com/Kilteel%20Church.html (both 9th century AD), and wrestling matches were common features of country fairs until at least the 18th century.Moffet, William. Hesperi-Neso-Graphia: or, A description of the Western Isle in Eight Cantos. Carson and Smith, 1724, pp. 31‚Äì32 These wrestling contests were occasionally violent affairs. Participants could be and were frequently injured, sometimes fatally so, as in the case of a contest between one Thomas Costello (known locally as \\"Tumaus Loidher\\" - Thomas the Strong) and an unnamed champion in which Costello ostensibly squeezed on his opponent's harness so powerfully that it broke the man's spine. There appear to have been little or no attempts to moderate these violent aspects of wrestling from a legal point of view; as historian Edward MacLysaght noted in his account of the match, as the participant in a sporting contest Costello had little to fear in terms of official retribution.MacLysaght, Edward. Irish Life in the Seventeenth Century. Irish Academic Press, 1979. pp. 151-152. \\"The victor had, of course, no fear of immediate arrest to answer a charge of manslaughter, but found himself a popular hero.\\" These accounts of early Irish wrestling matches all describe participants taking a diverse range of grips on their opponents - from clutching at any available limb in the time of C√∫chulainn, to a backhold-style clinch on the carvings at Kells and Kilteel, to both hands holding a belt in the match between Thomas Costello and his ill-fated opponent. However, by the 18th century a new form of grip had established itself as the favoured starting hold: right hand grabbing the opponent's collar, left hand grabbing the sleeve of their jacket at the elbow. This starting position, and all its associated techniques and strategies, was to quickly emerge as the dominant framework under which Irish wrestling matches were contested. =Collar and Elbow in Ireland= In the 19th century, Collar and Elbow wrestling was one of the most widely practiced sporting activities in the country - \\"the chief physical sport of the male population from childhood to mature manhood\\". Bouts took place between local champions and challengers on a parish level, and those between the most well-known and skilled wrestlers could draw thousands of spectators from across neighbouring counties. Victory was determined by a \\"fall\\", the definition of which differed from county to county. In Kildare a wrestler was deemed to have won if he made his opponent touch the ground with any single part of his body above the knees, whereas in Dublin he was required to make three points of his opponent's body touch the ground (usually both shoulders and a hip, or both hips and a shoulder).Gunning, Paul Ignatius. Hardy Fingallians, Kildare Trippers, and 'The Divil Ye'll Rise' Scufflers: Wrestling in Modern Ireland. A Social and Cultural History of Sport in Ireland, 2016, pp. 110‚Äì121. This is a notable difference from one of the prominent rulesets under which Collar and Elbow bouts were subsequently contested in the United States, in which a wrestler was specifically required to pin his opponent for several seconds in order to win. A further significant difference between Collar and Elbow as it was practiced in Ireland and the United States is that, in its Irish incarnation, shin-kicking was routinely permitted. This, coupled with the fact that many participants wore heavy work boots, resulted in a level of injury among Irish wrestlers not usually seen among their US counterparts. Shins were frequently \\"gored and/or bruised\\" after a match, and on rare occasions outright broken. Admirers of the style nonetheless lauded its \\"eminently scientific and picturesque\\" virtues. In particular, they claimed that, since the opening stance prevented the \\"bull- like charges, flying tackles, or other onrushes\\" common in other wrestling styles, Collar and Elbow encouraged participants to develop \\"deftness, balance, and leverage allied with strength, [which permitted] a man to win by means of skill instead of sheer might and weight\\". =Collar and Elbow in the United States= As levels of Irish emigration to the United States steadily increased throughout the 17th‚Äì19th centuries, so too did the presence of the Irish cultural traditions they brought with them - including their wrestling style. New England in general, and Vermont in particular, emerged as an early stronghold of Collar and Elbow after it had been introduced by immigrants largely from County Kildare. During the US Civil War, Vermont regiments introduced the style to other units in the Army of the Potomac, and in that way it acquired immense popularity among men from other regions of the United States who might otherwise never have encountered it. By the time the Civil War ended, Collar and Elbow had emerged as one of the most common rulesets under which wrestling bouts were contested nationwide. Bouts drew large and enthusiastic crowds across the country, and purses of several hundred dollars were routinely offered for championship contests.The Cincinnati Enquirer, 1 June 1878, p. 4. \\"The wrestling match for $500 and the championship of America, between Edward Cox of Fairfield, Vt., and Henry M. Dufur of Marlboro, the champion of New England, took place at Riverside Park.\\"The Boston Globe, 12 June 1879, p. 4. \\"The long-anticipated struggle between James E. Owens of Vermont and H.M. Dufur of Marlboro at collar-and-elbow wrestling. Ed James' rules to govern, best two in three, fair falls, for $500 and the championship, drew an audience at the Howard Athenaeum, last evening, that packed the house.\\"Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 23 November 1897, p. 5. \\"Two best falls out of three to decide the contest for the World's Championship and $1000, which is now in the hands of W.E. Stevens, proprietor of Hotel Stevens, Seattle.\\" Vermont continued to remain a significant force in the Collar and Elbow world throughout, with two of the style's most notable 19th-century practitioners, Henry Moses Dufur and John McMahon, hailing from Franklin County. Practitioners of Collar and Elbow in general were colloquially referred to as \\"scufflers\\" (occasionally \\"trippers\\" in reference to the leg-centric strategies they employed), and a Collar and Elbow bout itself as \\"scuffling\\" or a \\"scuffling bee\\".Beekman, Scott. Ringside: A History of Professional Wrestling in America. Westport, Conn. : Praeger, 2006. p. 10 Rules Initially, Collar and Elbow bouts in both Ireland and the United States were governed by unwritten, often improvised codes of conduct rather than any kind of codified rules. An early attempt to standardise the competitive rules of the style was made in advance of a tournament that was scheduled to be held in St. Albans, Vermont in 1856. The tournament was ultimately cancelled due to \\"an epidemic of disease\\" in the region, however, and no record of the proposed ruleset exists. It was almost two decades later before the first widely accepted set of rules was published. These were compiled by legendary Collar and Elbow champion Henry Moses Dufur, and as such came to be colloquially known as the Dufur Rules. Among other things, they stated that wrestlers had to compete while wearing a suitably sturdy jacket, and banned the wearing of heavy footwear. They also specified the exact requirements for victory - pinning an opponent four points down (both shoulders and both hips) for a count of five seconds. The Dufur rules were closely followed by the Ed James rules, published as part of a general manual of sporting rules and regulations in 1873. These were largely the same as the Dufur rules, with the notable exception of relaxing the requirements for victory. Instead of having to pin an opponent with four points to the ground (both shoulders and both hips), wrestlers could win by pinning three points (both shoulders and a hip, or both hips and a shoulder) or by throwing their opponent square on his back - similar to the concept of ippon in judo. The Ed James rules were to act as the agreed-upon standard for the majority of Collar and Elbow bouts held in the United States in the late 19th century: Two wrestlers in the 1880s demonstrating the Collar and Elbow gripsEven in so-called \\"mixed wrestling\\" bouts where men would compete against each other in consecutive rounds under different rulesets (e.g. Catch-as-Catch-Can, Greco-Roman, and Collar and Elbow), they would specifically be required to don jackets for the Collar and Elbow rounds.The Cincinnati Enquirer, 25 March 1884, \\"Duncan Ross Again Defeats Colonel McLaughlin in a Mixed Wrestling Match in Cleveland\\", p. 2.The Sydney Morning Herald, 9 March 1885, \\"Wrestling Championship\\" p. 5. =Jackets and Harness= Although there are accounts of bouts being held in which the combatants were shirtless - particularly in rural areas during the summer months \\\\- in its standardised competitive form Collar and Elbow required both participants to wear jackets or heavy shirts that could be gripped and used to set up throwing techniques. A similar requirement exists in other Celtic styles like Cornish wrestling and Breton Gouren. At wrestling events in Dublin, a common method of issuing a challenge was to place a jacket in the centre of the ring and wait for a contender to step in and put it on. In Ireland - and in the early days in the United States - there were no standardised requirements for the durability or the length of the jacket. This occasionally led to disputes between prospective opponents when one party believed that the other's attire provided him with an unfair advantage, such as the one that occurred between Patrick Cullen and Paddy Dunne in which Dunne alleged that Cullen's long cavalry officer's coat would prevent him from seeing and defending against his leg techniques. Contests were occasionally even called off mid-bout when a jacket ripped or was otherwise unable to bear the rigours of a prolonged wrestling match. The Dufur rules of the 19th century were the first to specifically state that any jacket used for a Collar and Elbow bout had to be \\"tight-fitting, with strongly sewn seams\\". This prescription was mirrored in the Ed James rules, which also elaborated that the jacket should not reach below the wrestler's hips so that their leg attacks would be freely visible. Subsequently, a dedicated leather harness was developed to act as a potential substitute for the jacket. The invention of the harness is attributed to Homer Lane, a three-time national Collar and Elbow champion of the United States.The Times of Philadelphia, 28 November 1886. \\"How to Wrestle: Homer Lane Gives a Chapter from his Experience. The Styles of Wrestling - Collar and Elbow, Greco-Roman, and Catch-as-Catch-Can\\", p. 9 It saw somewhat frequent use in both the US and Canada, but in general the majority of Collar and Elbow bouts continued to be held using the requisite durable jackets. Techniques Since both combatants' hands were fixed in place on each other's jackets, Collar and Elbow came to be distinguished by its volume and variety of leg techniques. Scufflers would circle each other throwing rapid-fire combinations of trips, taps, kicks, and sweeps in an attempt to off-balance their opponent and send him crashing to the ground - an extended exchange of attack and defense that one historian described as \\"footsparring\\". Observers of Collar and Elbow bouts frequently remarked upon this aspect of the style, with one journalist proposing that a Collar and Elbow match between two skilled participants was really \\"a fist fight with the feet\\".The Northern Pacific Farmer (Wadena, Minnesota), 27 January 1881, p. 3. \\"The collar-and-elbow wrestle between two skilled contestants is really, so to speak, a fist fight with the feet. One would think in viewing the kicks of the mailed feet that shins would be broken like pipe-stems, but it is not often that one wrestler is permitted to get a square-toed kick upon the shins of the other, where there is science on both sides.\\" Although wrestlers' grips were fixed in place, they were nonetheless free to push, pull, and twist their opponent using their arms, and ultimately any form of takedown was permitted as long as the person executing it maintained his collar-and-elbow grips while doing so. One of the more dramatic takedowns was the flying mare - described as an explosive, high-impact throw that would send the victim's feet flying up over his head. In catch wrestlingHitchcock, Edward. Wrestling; Catch-as-Catch-Can Style. New York: American Sports Publishing Company, 1854, p. 32 and Greco-Roman wrestlingMartell, William A. Greco-Roman Wrestling. Windsor: Human Kinetics Publishers, 1993, p. 60 this is usually depicted as something akin to ippon seoi nage, but since the gripping requirements in Collar and Elbow would have rendered it impossible to grab an opponent's arm with both hands, it is more probable that, in its Collar and Elbow incarnation, the flying mare would have more closely resembled morote seoi nage instead. Decline By the early 20th century, Collar and Elbow had all but disappeared from Ireland. Writing in the Leinster Leader newspaper in 1907, local historian John Ennis directly attributed this to two significant factors - the Great Famine that resulted in the deaths of over 1 million people and the \\"unnatural exodus\\" of 1 million more seeking a better way of life, and the colonial-era Coercion Acts that limited any kind of gatherings in public space. The demographic and cultural devastation of the former coupled with the oppressive restrictions of the latter resulted in an environment in which Ireland's native wrestling style simply could not be practiced, ultimately leading to it fading from everyday life entirely. An additional significant factor was the lack of any independent, centralised sporting organisation to promote the style. A book published in 1908 by An Chomhairle N√°isi√∫nta (The National Council), referring to both wrestling and handball, noted that \\"although both these pastimes have been on the Gaelic programme since its first appearance, neither has ever received any official encouragement. Yet both are games in which Gaels have excelled[‚Ä¶] That such a wide area and so popular and meritorious a branch of athletics should have received only nominal recognition is only another instance of how partial and halting has been the management of Gaelic athletic affairs.\\" Individual efforts were made to promote Collar and Elbow bouts in Dublin in 1906, but these were \\"spontaneous and isolated\\", and the sport was entirely omitted from the largest government-organised athletics event of the period - the short-lived modern revival of the Tailteann Games held after the Irish Civil War. No records exist of any Collar and Elbow bouts being held in Ireland after the early 20th century. In the United States, the growing popularity of other grappling styles like catch wrestling and Greco-Roman resulted in Collar and Elbow being practiced less and less. The final contest for the Collar and Elbow championship of America - held between James H. McLoughlin and John McMahon - took place in 1878, with McMahon winning with two falls out of three. By 1890, Collar and Elbow was already being referred to as an \\"old time\\" sport,Swanton Courier (Swanton, Vermont), 1 August 1890, p. 3 and by the early 20th century newspaper accounts of wrestling matches were referring to \\"the ancient days when collar-and-elbow was the rule\\".The Evening World (New York, New York), 20 June 1916, p. 14. \\"Steve O' Donnell is dead - not Australian Steve, the fighter, but Bowery Boy Steve, the wrestler. He was one of the best performers in the ancient days when collar-and-elbow was the rule, and although only a lightweight used to hold such men as Homer Lane, 170 pounds, and John McMahon, 180 pounds. That was in the [18]70s.\\" =Legacy in Collegiate Wrestling= In his 1959 book Magnificent Scufflers, author Charles Morrow Wilson proposed that, even after Collar and Elbow had vanished as a standalone style, it continued to exert an influence on the strategies and techniques used in American collegiate wrestling. He specifically highlighted the \\"foot and leg plays, beginning with foot trips, the heel blocks, and the forward leg trips and working upwards to hip rolls\\" as \\"obvious but not deliberate borrowings from Collar and Elbow\\", and attributed them to the technical innovations introduced by Oklahoma coach Edward C. Gallagher. Neither of Gallagher's self-penned technique manuals, Amateur Wrestling (1925) and Wrestling (1939), mention Collar and Elbow in any way (apart from a lone reference where the term \\"collar and elbow\\" is used to describe a single collar tie), but it does mention \\"folk style\\", a common nickname for collar-and-elbow in the US at the time, as well as \\"Side-Hold\\", which collar-and-elbow was often misnamed as in that time period. Modern revival A Collar and Elbow wrestling bout between two participants in 2019 In August 2019, a series of Collar and Elbow bouts were held in Heidelberg, Germany. The ruleset for these bouts was based on the Dufur Rules and the Ed James rules, with several modifications made to ensure compatibility with a modern tournament format. Most notably, individual bouts were limited to a maximum of 5 minutes' duration, in contrast to historical Collar and Elbow bouts which were entirely open-ended and routinely lasted several hours. Cincinnati Enquirer, 1 June 1878, p4. \\"Finally, after an exciting struggle, Dufur succeeded in getting a fair fall on Cox, and was announced the winner amid loud cheering. The match lasted two hours and thirty-two minutes.\\"The Sun (New York, New York), 19 April 1890, p. 4. \\"The Sweeney-Deso collar-and-elbow wrestling match was decided at the Globe Athletic Club, Sweeney winning two falls after three and one-half hours of scientific work.\\"St. Louis Globe- Democrat, 27 March 1876, p. 1. \\"Time was called at 8:40pm when both wrestlers advanced to the center of the carpeted stage[...] At 10:25pm they resumed, and McLaughling went down[...] When they again grasped, the timer's watch pointed to 11:05pm[...] After a good deal of backing and filling, which continued up to one o'clock am, the disputants came to terms.\\" They also only had a two- shoulder pin requirement, whereas one of the more defining characteristics of Irish Collar and Elbow was having a 3 or 4 point pin requirement. Subsequently, matches based on the same modern ruleset have been held in the United States.

From 1430 onwards he was almost blind and in 1435 deprived of power by his wife and her advisors. In the following year he died, in Heidelberg, and was succeeded by his son Louis IV. Family and children Louis III was married twice. Firstly, he married on 6 July 1402 Blanche of England (1392 - 21 May 1409), daughter of King Henry IV of England and Mary de Bohun. They had one son Ruprecht (22 May 1406 - 20 May 1426). This marriage brought the Palatine Crown into the hands of the Wittelsbach. Secondly, he married on 30 November 1417 Matilda of Savoy, daughter of Amadeo, Prince of Achaea. They had five children: # Mathilde (7 March 1419 - 1 October 1482), married: ## in 1434 to Count Louis I of W√ºrttemberg ## in 1452 to Duke Albrecht VI of Austria # Louis IV, Elector Palatine (1 January 1424 - 13 August 1449) # Frederick I, Elector Palatine (1 August 1425 - 12 December 1476) # Rupprecht (27 February 1427 - 26 July 1480), Prince-elector archbishop of Cologne # Margarete (ca. 1428 - 23 November 1466), a nun at Liebenau monastery References Sources   External links * genealogie- mittelalter.de * Biography Wittelsbach, Louis III, Elector Palatine of the Rhine Wittelsbach, Louis III, Elector Palatine of the Rhin House of Wittelsbach Electors of the Palatinate Burials at the Church of the Holy Spirit (Heidelberg) Sons of kings ","title":"Louis III, Elector Palatine"},{"id":"4036898","text":"Ueli Kestenholz (born 10 May 1975) is a Swiss snowboarder and Speedriding pioneer.

Powell, Clarke and Michelot, under the name The Three Bosses, had played together often in Paris since Powell moved there in 1959. The album was remastered by Rudy Van Gelder in 2003 and released as part of Blue Note's RVG Edition series.

Tourism can involve primary transportation to the general location, local transportation, accommodations, entertainment, recreation, nourishment and shopping. It can be related to travel for leisure, business and what is called VFR (visiting friends and relatives). There is now broad consensus that tourism development should be sustainable; however, the question of how to achieve this remains an object of debate.Peeters P., G√∂ssling S., Ceron J.P., Dubois G., Patterson T., Richardson R.B., Studies E. (2004). The Eco-efficiency of Tourism. Without travel there is no tourism, so the concept of sustainable tourism is tightly linked to a concept of sustainable mobility. Two relevant considerations are tourism's reliance on fossil fuels and tourism's effect on climate change. 72 percent of tourism's CO2 emissions come from transportation, 24 percent from accommodations, and 4 percent from local activities. Aviation accounts for 55% of those transportation CO2 emissions (or 40% of tourism's total). However, when considering the impact of all greenhouse gas emissions, of condensation trails and induced cirrus clouds, aviation alone could account for up to 75% of tourism's climate impact. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) considers an annual increase in aviation fuel efficiency of 2 percent per year through 2050 to be realistic. However, both Airbus and Boeing expect the passenger-kilometers of air transport to increase by about 5 percent yearly through at least 2020, overwhelming any efficiency gains. By 2050, with other economic sectors having greatly reduced their CO2 emissions, tourism is likely to be generating 40 percent of global carbon emissions.Cohen S., Higham J.E., Peeters P., Gossling S. (2014). Why tourism mobility behaviors must change. Ch. 1 in: Understanding and Governing Sustainable Tourism Mobility: Psychological and Behavioural Approaches. The main cause is an increase in the average distance traveled by tourists, which for many years has been increasing at a faster rate than the number of trips taken.Cohen S., Higham J., Cavaliere C. (2011). Binge flying: Behavioural addiction and climate change. Annals of Tourism Research.G√∂ssling S., Ceron J.P., Dubois G., Hall C.M., G√∂ssling I.S., Upham P., Earthscan L. (2009). Hypermobile travellers . Chapter 6 in: Climate Change and Aviation: Issues, Challenges and Solutions. \\"Sustainable transportation is now established as the critical issue confronting a global tourism industry that is palpably unsustainable, and aviation lies at the heart of this issue.\\" Social & economic aspects Global economists forecast continuing international tourism growth, the amount depending on the location. As one of the world's largest and fastest-growing industries, this continuous growth will place great stress on remaining biologically diverse habitats and Indigenous cultures, which are often used to support mass tourism. Tourists who promote sustainable tourism are sensitive to these dangers and seek to protect tourist destinations, and to protect tourism as an industry. Sustainable tourists can reduce the impact of tourism in many ways: *informing themselves of the culture, politics, and economy of the communities visited *anticipating and respecting local cultures, expectations, and assumptions *supporting the integrity of local cultures by favoring businesses which conserve cultural heritage and traditional values *supporting local economies by purchasing local goods and participating with small, local businesses *conserving resources by seeking out businesses that are environmentally conscious, and by using the least possible amount of non- renewable resources Increasingly, destinations and tourism operations are endorsing and following \\"responsible tourism\\" as a pathway towards sustainable tourism. Responsible tourism and sustainable tourism have an identical goal, that of sustainable development. The pillars of responsible tourism are therefore the same as those of sustainable tourism ‚Äì environmental integrity, social justice, and economic development. The major difference between the two is that, in responsible tourism, individuals, organizations, and businesses are asked to take responsibility for their actions and the impacts of their actions. This shift in emphasis has taken place because some stakeholders feel that insufficient progress towards realizing sustainable tourism has been made since the Earth Summit in Rio. This is partly because everyone has been expecting others to behave in a sustainable manner. The emphasis on responsibility in responsible tourism means that everyone involved in tourism ‚Äì government, product, and service owners and operators, transport operators, community services, NGOs and Community-based organization (CBOs), tourists, local communities, industry associations ‚Äì are responsible for achieving the goals of responsible tourism. =Stakeholders= Stakeholders of sustainable tourism play a role in continuing this form of tourism. This can include organizations as well as individuals, to be specific, ECOFIN. \\"A stakeholder in the tourism industry is deemed to be anyone who is impacted by development positively or negatively, and as a result, it reduces potential conflict between the tourists and host community by involving the latter in shaping the way in which tourism develops. The Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC) serves as the international body for fostering increased knowledge and understanding of sustainable tourism practices, promoting the adoption of universal sustainable tourism principles, and building demand for sustainable travel. It has a number of programs including the setting of international standards for accreditation agencies (the organizations that would inspect a tourism product, and certify them as a sustainable company). Governments The values and ulterior motives of governments often need to be taken into account when assessing the motives for sustainable tourism. One important factor to consider in any ecologically sensitive or remote area or an area new to tourism is that of carrying capacity. This is the capacity of tourists of visitors an area can sustainably tolerate without damaging the environment or culture of the surrounding area. This can be altered and revised in time and with changing perceptions and values. For example, originally the sustainable carrying capacity of the Galapagos Islands was set at 12,000 visitors per annum but was later changed by the Ecuadorian government to 50,000 for economic reasons and objectives. Non-governmental organizations Non-governmental organizations are one of the stakeholders in advocating sustainable tourism. Their roles can range from spearheading sustainable tourism practices to simply doing research. University research teams and scientists can be tapped to aid in the process of planning. Such solicitation of research can be observed in the planning of C√°t B√† National Park in Vietnam. Dive resort operators in Bunaken National Park, Indonesia, play a crucial role by developing exclusive zones for diving and fishing respectively, such that both tourists and locals can benefit from the venture. Large conventions, meetings and other major organized events drive the travel, tourism, and hospitality industry. Cities and convention centers compete to attract such commerce, commerce which has heavy impacts on resource use and the environment. Major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games, present special problems regarding environmental burdens and degradation.Malhado A., de Araujo L., Rothfuss R. (2014). The attitude-behavior gap and the role of information in influencing sustainable mobility in mega-events. Ch. 7 in: Understanding and Governing Sustainable Tourism Mobility: Psychological and Behavioural Approaches. But burdens imposed by the regular convention industry can be vastly more significant. Green conventions and events are a new but growing sector and marketing point within the convention and hospitality industry. More environmentally aware organizations, corporations, and government agencies are now seeking more sustainable event practices, greener hotels, restaurants and convention venues, and more energy-efficient or climate-neutral travel and ground transportation. However, the convention trip not taken can be the most sustainable option: \\"With most international conferences having hundreds if not thousands of participants, and the bulk of these usually traveling by plane, conference travel is an area where significant reductions in air-travel-related GHG emissions could be made. ... This does not mean non-attendance\\" (Reay, 2004), since modern Internet communications are now ubiquitous and remote audio/visual participation.Reay DS (2004). New Directions: Flying in the face of the climate change convention. Atmospheric Environment (38:5, p.793-794). For example, by 2003 Access Grid technology had already successfully hosted several international conferences. A particular example is the large American Geophysical Union's annual meeting, which has used live streaming for several years. This provides live streams and recordings of keynotes, named lectures, and oral sessions, and provides opportunities to submit questions and interact with authors and peers.AGU Fall Meeting FAQs. See the Virtual Options section. Following the live-stream, the recording of each session is posted online within 24 hours. Some convention centers have begun to take direct action in reducing the impact of the conventions they host. One example is the Moscone Center in San Francisco, which has a very aggressive recycling program, a large solar power system, and other programs aimed at reducing impact and increasing efficiency. Local Communities Local communities benefit from sustainable tourism through economic development, job creation, and infrastructure development. Tourism revenues bring economic growth and prosperity to attractive tourist destinations which can raise the standard of living in destination communities. Sustainable tourism operators commit themselves to create jobs for local community members. An increase in tourism revenue to an area acts as a driver for the development of increased infrastructure. As tourist demands increase in a destination, a more robust infrastructure is needed to support the needs of both the tourism industry and the local community.McCool, S. F., Moisey, R. N. (2001). Integrating environmental and social concerns over tourism development. [In:] S. F. McCool & R. N. Moisey (eds.), Tourism, recreation, and sustainability: linking culture and the environment (pp. 17-20). CABI Publishing: Oxon A 2009 study of rural operators throughout the province of British Columbia, Canada found \\"an overall strong 'pro- sustainability' attitude among respondents. Dominant barriers identified were lack of available money to invest, lack of incentive programs, other business priorities, and limited access to suppliers of sustainable products, with the most common recommendation being the need for incentive programs to encourage businesses to become more sustainable.\\" Sustainable tourism in Developing Nations 17px Playlist =Expansion of Tourism in the LEDCs= The renewed emphasis on outward-orientated growth which accompanied the rise in neoliberal development strategies in the 1990s in the south also focused attention on international tourism as an import potential growth sector for many countries, particularly in Less Economically Developed Countries (LEDCs) as many of the world's most beautiful and 'untouched' places are located in the Third World. Prior to the 1960s studies tended to assume that the extension of the tourism industry to LEDCs was a good thing. In the 1970s this changed as academics started to take a much more negative view on tourism's consequences, particularly criticizing the industry as an effective contributor towards development. International tourism is a volatile industry with visitors quick to abandon destinations that were formerly popular because of threats to health or security. =Problems with sustainable tourism in Developing Nations= Displacement and Resettlement In places where there was no tourism prior to First World companies' arrival, displacement and resettlement of local communities is a common issue. For example, the Maasai tribes in Tanzania have been a victim of this problem. After the second World War, First World conservationists moved into the areas where the Maasai tribes lived, with the intent to make such areas accessible to tourists and to preserve the areas' natural beauty and ecology. This was often achieved through establishing national parks and conservation areas (Monbiot 1994; Olerokonga, 1992:7). It has been claimed that Maasai activities did not threaten the wildlife and the First World knowledge was blurred by \\"colonial disdain\\" and misunderstandings of savannah wildlife. As the Maasai have been displaced, the area within the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) has been adapted to allow easier access for tourists through the construction of campsites and tracks, as well as the removal of stone objects such as stones for souvenirs. Many critics view the extractive nature of this type of \\"sustainable tourism\\" as an oxymoron, as it is fundamentally unable to continue indefinitely. True and perfect sustainability is likely impossible in all but the most favorable circumstances, as the interests of equity, economy, and ecology often conflict with one another and require tradeoffs. It is a reality that many things are done in the name of sustainability are actually masking the desire to allow extra profits. There is often alienation of local populations from the tourists. =Environmental Impacts= \\"The environmental sustainability focuses on the overall viability and health of ecological systems. Natural resource degradation, pollution, and loss of biodiversity are detrimental because they increase vulnerability, undermine system health, and reduce resilience. This aspect of sustainability has been the most often discussed through the literature by numerous authors such as Hall, C. M. & Lew A.A. (1998), Hall, D. (2000), Weaver (2006), and many others.\\" Coastal tourism Many coastal areas are experiencing particular pressure from growth in lifestyles and growing numbers of tourists. Coastal environments are limited in extent consisting of only a narrow strip along the edge of the ocean. Coastal areas are often the first environments to experience the detrimental impacts of tourism. A detailed study of the impact on coastal areas, with reference to western India can be an example. The inevitable change is on the horizon as holiday destinations put more effort into sustainable tourism. Planning and management controls can reduce the impact on coastal environments and ensure that investment into tourism products supports sustainable coastal tourism.Australian Sustainable Coastal Tourism Policy Some studies have led to interesting conceptual models applicable to coastal tourism. The 'inverted funnel model' and the 'embedded model' (Jacob, S. 2008) can be metaphors for understanding the interplay of different stake-holders like government, local community, tourists, and business community in developing tourist destinations. Mountain tourism Mount Everest attracts many tourist climbers wanting to summit the peak of the highest mountain in the world each year. Everest is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Over the years, carelessness and excessive consumption of resources by mountaineers, as well as overgrazing by livestock, have damaged the habitats of snow leopards, lesser pandas, Tibetan bears, and scores of bird species. To counteract past abuses, various reforestation programs have been carried out by local communities and the Nepalese government. Expeditions have removed supplies and equipment left by climbers on Everest's slopes, including hundreds of oxygen containers. A large quantity of the litter of past climbers‚Äîtons of items such as tents, cans, crampons, and human waste‚Äîhas been hauled down from the mountain and recycled or discarded. However, the bodies of most of the more than 260 climbers who have died on Everest (notably on its upper slopes) have not been removed, as they are unreachable or‚Äîfor those that are accessible‚Äîtheir weight makes carrying them down extremely difficult. Notable in the cleanup endeavour have been the efforts of the Eco Everest Expeditions, the first of which was organized in 2008 to commemorate the death that January of Everest-climbing pioneer Sir Edmund Hillary. Those expeditions also have publicized ecological issues (in particular, concerns about the effects of climate change in the region through observations that the Khumbu Icefall has been melting). Small Island tourism Small Islands are especially affected and often depend on tourism, as this industry makes up anywhere from 40% to 75% of the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) for various islands including Barbados, Aruba, Isle of Man, and Anguilla. Mass tourism tends to put a strain on fragile island ecosystems and the natural resources it provides. Studies have shown that early practices of tourism were unsustainable and took a toll on environmental factors, hurting the natural landscapes that originally drew in the tourists. For example, in Barbados, beaches are the main attraction and have been eroded and destroyed over the years. This is due to inefficient political decisions and policies along with irresponsible tourist activity, such as reckless driving and waste disposal, damaging coastal and marine environments. Such practices also altered physical features of the landscape and caused a loss in biodiversity, leading to the disruption of ecosystems. Many other islands faced environmental damage such as Isle of Man and Samoa. However, visitors are attracted to the less industrial scene of these islands, and according to a survey by Canavan, over 80% of the people enjoyed the natural landscape when they visited, many commenting that they wanted to protect and save the wildlife in the area. Many tourists have turned to practices of sustainable and eco-tourism in an attempt to save the nature they enjoy in these locations, while some political entities try to enforce this in an attempt to keep tourism in their island afloat. Additionally, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14 has a target to increase the economic benefits of marine resources to Small Island developing States and least developed countries through sustainable tourism. =Sustainable tourism as part of a development strategy= Third World countries are especially interested in international tourism, and many believe it brings countries a large selection of economic benefits including employment opportunities, small business development, and increased in payments of foreign exchange. Many assume that more money is gained through developing luxury goods and services in spite of the fact that this increases a countries dependency on imported products, foreign investments and expatriate skills. This classic 'trickle down' financial strategy rarely makes its way down to brings its benefits down to small businesses. It has been said that the economic benefits of large-scale tourism are not doubted but that the backpacker or budget traveler sector is often neglected as a potential growth sector by Third World governments. This sector brings significant non-economic benefits which could help to empower and educate the communities involved in this sector. \\"Aiming 'low' builds upon the skills of the local population, promotes self-reliance, and develops the confidence of community members in dealing with outsiders, all signs of empowerment\\" and all of which aid in the overall development of a nation. =Improvements to Sustainable Tourism in the Third World= Management of Sustainable Tourism There has been the promotion of sustainable tourism practices surrounding the management of tourist locations by locals or the community. This form of tourism is based on the premise that the people living next to a resource are the ones best suited to protecting it. This means that the tourism activities and businesses are developed and operated by local community members, and certainly with their consent and support. Sustainable tourism typically involves the conservation of resources that are capitalized upon for tourism purposes. Locals run the businesses and are responsible for promoting the conservation messages to protect their environment.https://www.ecotourism.org/news/community-based- tourism-tool-sustainable-development Community-based sustainable tourism (CBST) associates the success of the sustainability of the ecotourism location to the management practices of the communities who are directly or indirectly dependent on the location for their livelihoods. A salient feature of CBST is that local knowledge is usually utilized alongside wide general frameworks of ecotourism business models. This allows the participation of locals at the management level and typically allows a more intimate understanding of the environment. The use of local knowledge also means an easier entry level into a tourism industry for locals whose jobs or livelihoods are affected by the use of their environment as tourism locations. Environmentally sustainable development crucially depends on the presence of local support for a project. It has also been noted that in order for success projects must provide direct benefits for the local community. However, recent research has found that economic linkages generated by CBST may only be sporadic, and that the linkages with agriculture are negatively affected by seasonality and by the small scale of the cultivated areas. This means that CBST may only have small- scale positive effects for these communities. It has also been said that partnerships between governments and tourism agencies with smaller communities are not particularly effective because of the disparity in aims between the two groups, i.e. true sustainability versus mass tourism for maximum profit. In Honduras, such a divergence can be demonstrated where consultants from the World Bank and officials from the Institute of tourism wanted to set up a selection of 5-star hotels near various ecotourism destinations. But another operating approach in the region by USAID and APROECOH (an ecotourism association) promotes community-based efforts which have trained many local Hondurans. Mader concluded that the Grassroot organizations were more successful in Honduras. =Confusion surrounding Governmental Management of Sustainable Tourism= There has been some discussion regarding the told of inter-governmental organizations and the development of sustainable tourism practices in the third world. In Mowforth and Munt's book 'Tourism and Sustainability: New Tourism in the Third World, they criticized a document that was written by the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), the World Tourism Organisation, and the Earth Council, which was included in Agenda 21. It was entitled 'Agenda 21 for the Travel and Tourism Industry: Towards Environmentally Sustainable Development'. Mowforth and Munt commented on the language used to describe the environment and local culture in such documents because the preservation of the environment and local culture are the two main objectives when practicing sustainable tourism. They pointed out that some of the keywords used were 'core asset', 'core product', 'product quality' and 'preserve'. They argued that the treatment of the environment as a marketable product was clear and that such documents provide a good list of advice for Third World governments regarding sustainable tourism but do not actually provide the resources to incorporate them into the development of their tourism industries. It is arguments such as these that postulate that there is a gap between the advice given by non-governmental or inter-governmental organizations to Third World governments and what can actually be brought to realization. These arguments try and persuade readers that documents like the one released by the WTTC that the development of sustainable tourism actually 'bypasses the interests of local people'. =Responsible tourism= There are many definitions and understandings of responsible tourism. According to the Center for Responsible Tourism, responsible tourism can be defined as, \\"tourism that maximizes the benefits to local communities, minimizes negative social or environmental impacts, and helps local people conserve fragile cultures and habitats or species.\\" Responsible tourism incorporates not only responsible for the physical environment, but also an incorporation of awareness for the economic and social interactions whereas, sustainable tourism focuses more on the environmental impacts.Leslie, David (2012). Responsible Tourism: Concepts Theory and Practice. Cambridge, MA: CABI. pp. 1‚Äì17. . Responsible tourism is regarded as a behavior. It is more than a form of tourism as it represents an approach to engaging with tourism, be that as a tourist, a business, locals at a destination, or any other tourism stakeholder. It emphasizes that all stakeholders are responsible for the kind of tourism they develop or engage in. This ensures that the tourism service providers and purchasers or consumers are held accountable. Whilst different groups will see responsibility in different ways, the shared understanding is that responsible tourism should entail an improvement in tourism. Tourism should become ‚Äòbetter‚Äô as a result of the responsible tourism approach Within the notion of betterment resides the acknowledgment that conflicting interests need to be balanced. However, the objective is to create better places for people to live in and to visit. Importantly, there is no blueprint for responsible tourism: what is deemed responsible may differ depending on places and cultures. Responsible Tourism is an aspiration that can be realized in different ways in different originating markets and in the diverse destinations of the world (Goodwin, 2016). The concept of responsible tourism emerged following the environmental awareness that rose out of the 1960s and 70s amidst a growing phenomenon of ‚Äúmass tourism‚Äù. The European Travel Commission in 1973 and a multilateral initiative to instate environmentally sound tourism and development was advanced. The United Nations specialized agency called the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), highlights the link between tourism and development in aims of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Given the dramatic increase in tourism, the report strongly promotes responsible tourism.World Tourism Organization (UNWTO); United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) (2017). \\"Tourism and the Sustainable Development Goals ‚Äì Journey to 2030\\". Madrid: 1‚Äì108. Sustainable tourism is a part of Sustainable Development Goal 12 and is measured with Target 12.b \\"Develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products\\". United Nations (2017) Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 6 July 2017, Work of the Statistical Commission pertaining to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (A/RES/71/313) UNWTO is the custodian agency for this target. Given the local-based approach of Responsible Tourism, it can also incorporate local populations into the decision making and tourism planning process.Haywood, K. Michael (June 1988). \\"Responsible and responsive tourism planning in the community\\". Tourism Management. 9: 105‚Äì118. While further research is needed to understand the impacts of responsible tourism, a study conducted in 2017 found that well-managed responsible tourism practices were beneficial to local communities.Mathew, Paul V.; Sreejesh, S. (July 2016). \\"Impact of responsible tourism on destination sustainability and quality of life of community in tourism destinations\\". Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management. 31: 83‚Äì89 ‚Äì via Elsevier Science Direct. Focusing in particular on businesses, according to the Cape Town Declaration on Responsible Tourism (2014), it will have the following characteristics: * minimizes negative economic, environmental, and social impacts *generates greater economic benefits for local people and enhances the well-being of host communities, improves working conditions and access to the industry *involves local people in decisions that affect their lives and life chances *makes positive contributions to the conservation of natural and cultural heritage, to the maintenance of the world's diversity *provides more enjoyable experiences for tourists through more meaningful connections with local people, and a greater understanding of local cultural, social, and environmental issues *provides access for people with disabilities and *is culturally sensitive, engenders respect between tourists and hosts, and builds local pride and confidence. While widely acclaimed, responsible tourism has also been critiqued. Studies have shown that the degree to which individuals engage in responsible tourism is contingent upon their engagement socially. Meaning, tourist behaviors will fluctuate depending on the range of social engagement that each tourist chooses to take part in.Diallo, Mbaye Fall; Diop- Sall, Fatou; Leroux, Erick; Valette-Florence, Pierre (2015). \\"Responsible tourist behaviour: The role of social engagement\\". Recherche et Applications en Marketing (English Edition). 3: 85‚Äì104 ‚Äì via SAGE. A study regarding responsible tourists behavior concludes that it is not only a personal behavior of tourists that shape outcomes, but also a reflection of mechanisms put in place by governments. Other research has put into question the promise that tourism even responsible tourism is inline with UN Sustainable Development Goals given the difficulties in measuring such impact.Ferguson, Lucy; Moreno Alarc√≥n, Daniela (September 2014). \\"Gender and sustainable tourism: reflections on theory and practice\\". Journal of Sustainable Tourism. 23: 401‚Äì416 ‚Äì via Taylor & Francis. Some argue that actually detracts attention from the wider issues surrounding tourism that are in need of regulation, such as the number of visitors and environmental impact.Anita, Pelumarom. \\"The Politics of Tourism and Poverty Reduction.\\" Responsible Tourism.

Tourism Management: 91‚Äì16. =Humane tourism= Humane tourism is part of the movement of responsible tourism. The idea is to empower local communities through travel related businesses around the world, first and foremost in developing countries. The idea of humane travel or humane tourism is to connect travelers from Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand seeking new adventures and authentic experiences directly, to local businesses in the specific locations they wish to visit ‚Äì thus, giving economic advantages to local businesses and giving travelers authentic and truly unique travel experiences. Humane travel or humane tourism focuses on the people, the local community. The idea is to enable travelers to experience the world through the eyes of its local people while contributing directly to those people, ensuring that tourist dollars benefit the local community directly. Humane tourism is about giving opportunity to the local people, empower them, enable them to enjoy the fruits of tourism directly. The Internet is changing tourism. More and more travelers are planning their travels and vacations via the net. The Internet enables people to cut off commissions. The traveler can search for new destinations to visit, talk, or read about other people's experience, and buy the services directly. The Internet platform can encourage local people to start new businesses and existing small businesses will begin to promote themselves through the net and receive the economic advantages of this directly in their communities. The world is now in a new tourism age, with globalization and the Internet playing a key role. Humane tourism is part of Responsible tourism. The concept of Responsible Tourism originated in the work of Jost Krippendorf in The Holiday Makers1987, Jost Krippendorf, Holiday Makers, , , 1987 called for ‚Äúrebellious tourists and rebellious locals‚Äù to create new forms of tourism. His vision was ‚Äúto develop and promote new forms of tourism, which will bring the greatest possible benefit to all the participants ‚Äì travelers, the host population and the tourist business, without causing intolerable ecological and social damage.‚Äù As one can see he already talked, back in the 80s about benefits for the host population and used the term human tourism. Humane travel focuses on that host local population. The South African national tourism policy (1996)available at: http://www.haroldgoodwin.info/resources/Explanatory%20Note.pdf used the term \\"responsible tourism\\" and mentioned the well-being of the local community as a main factor. The Cape Town Declaration on Responsible Tourism in Destinations,available at: agreed in 2002, that Responsible Tourism is about ‚Äúmaking better places for people to live in and better places for people to visit.‚Äù The declaration focused on \\"places\\" but did mention the local population. From the Rio summit or earth summit on 1992Earth Summit until the UN Commission on Sustainable Development in 1999,Commission on Sustainable Development the main focus of the tourism industry was the earth, the planet, the places, \\"green\\" or \\"eco\\" tourism. Now there is a trend to include the local population. This trend or branch of responsible tourism is called humane tourism or humane travel. =Responsible hospitality= As with the view of responsible tourism, responsible hospitality is essentially about creating better places for people to live in, and better places for people to visit. This does not mean all forms of hospitality are also forms of tourism although hospitality is the largest sector of the tourism industry. As such we should not be surprised at overlaps between responsible hospitality and responsible tourism. In the instance where the place of permanent residence is also the place where the hospitality service is consumed, such as a meal being consumed in a local restaurant, this does not obviate the requirement to improve the place of residence. As such, the essence of Responsible Hospitality is not contingent upon touristic forms of hospitality. While Friedman (1962) famously argued that, admittedly within legal parameters, the sole responsibility of business was to generate profit for shareholders the idea that businesses‚Äô responsibility extends beyond this has existed for decades and is most frequently encountered in the concept of corporate social responsibility. There are numerous ways businesses can and do engage in activities that are not intended to benefit shareholders and management, at least not in the short term. However, often acts of corporate social responsibility are undertaken because of the perceived benefit to business. Usually in hospitality this relates to the cost reductions associated with improved energy efficiency but may also relate to, for example, the rise in ethical consumerism and the view that being seen to be a responsible business is beneficial to revenue growth. As per the Cape Town Declaration on Responsible Tourism, responsible hospitality is culturally sensitive. Instead of then calling for the unachievable, responsible hospitality simply makes the case for more responsible forms of hospitality, hospitality that benefits locals first, and visitors second. Certainly, all forms of hospitality can be improved and managed so that negative impacts are minimized whilst striving for maximization of positive impacts on the environment.

They were on Havoc Records.  History  In late 2000, guitarist Bill Chamberlain (of Mankind?, The Pist, and React) quit React and moved from Connecticut to Pittsburgh to start a band with guitarist/vocalist Eric Good and bassist Corey Lyons of Aus-Rotten. Together with drummer Ron Wingrove, they began to practice in Corey, Eric, and Bill's basement; played local shows and a few weekend tours; and recorded a demo. During that time, Aus-Rotten broke up and Chamberlain also formed Behind Enemy Lines with former Aus-Rotten vocalist Dave Trenga. In the spring of 2001, Wingrove was struck by a pickup truck while riding his bike in Pittsburgh and sustained brain damage. This left him unable to play drums for some time, and the band decided to replace him. Wingrove would later return to his hometown of Uniontown, Pennsylvania, where he would participate in several bands. After a hiatus, drummer Greg Mairs (Submachine, Short Dark Strangers) joined the band. This was supposed to be a temporary solution while the band found another, less busy, drummer, but Mairs remained and became an integral part of the band. With Mairs, Caustic Christ recorded their first seven-inch record, which was released on Havoc Records, as were all of their subsequent releases. They toured the United States extensively with bands like Subhumans and Municipal Waste and were interviewed in Maximum RocknRoll, HeartattaCk, Suburban Voice, and numerous other punk zines. In 2006, they toured Europe. Local favorites, the band performed frequently at Mr. Roboto Project, a venue then in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania. Live at Brandon Ferrell memorial/LBug benefit in 2016 (at Hardywood in Richmond, Virginia) Caustic Christ disbanded following their last show, on May 5, 2009.. However, in 2015, the band reunited to play two shows as part of the annual Skull Fest in Pittsburgh. And in 2016, the band played a benefit in Richmond, Virginia, for the family of Brandon Ferrell alongside Municipal Waste, Career Suicide, Night Birds, Blood Presure, and a reunited Double Negative.

A horse ‚Äì an erect-stanced unguligrade quadruped ‚Äì with a galloping gait. A 2006 animation of 1887 photos by Eadweard Muybridge Terrestrial locomotion has evolved as animals adapted from aquatic to terrestrial environments. Locomotion on land raises different problems than that in water, with reduced friction being replaced by the effects of gravity. As viewed from evolutionary taxonomy, there are three basic forms of animal locomotion in the terrestrial environment: *legged ‚Äì moving by using appendages *limbless locomotion ‚Äì moving without legs, primarily using the body itself as a propulsive structure. *rolling ‚Äì rotating the body over the substrate Some terrains and terrestrial surfaces permit or demand alternative locomotive styles. A sliding component to locomotion becomes possible on slippery surfaces (such as ice and snow), where location is aided by potential energy, or on loose surfaces (such as sand or scree), where friction is low but purchase (traction) is difficult. Humans, especially, have adapted to sliding over terrestrial snowpack and terrestrial ice by means of ice skates, snow skis, and toboggans. Aquatic animals adapted to polar climates, such as ice seals and penguins also take advantage of the slipperiness of ice and snow as part of their locomotion repertoire. Beavers are known to take advantage of a mud slick known as a \\"beaver slide\\" over a short distance when passing from land into a lake or pond. Human locomotion in mud is improved through the use of cleats. Some snakes use an unusual method of movement known as sidewinding on sand or loose soil. Animals caught in terrestrial mudflows are subject to involuntary locomotion; this may be beneficial to the distribution of species with limited locomotive range under their own power. There is less opportunity for passive locomotion on land than by sea or air, though parasitism (hitchhiking) is available toward this end, as in all other habitats. Many species of monkeys and apes use a form of arboreal locomotion known as brachiation, with forelimbs as the prime mover. Some elements of the gymnastic sport of uneven bars resemble brachiation, but most adult humans do not have the upper body strength required to sustain brachiation. Many other species of arboreal animal with tails will incorporate their tails into the locomotion repertoire, if only as a minor component of their suspensory behaviors. Locomotion on irregular, steep surfaces require agility and dynamic balance known as sure-footedness. Mountain goats are famed for navigating vertiginous mountainsides where the least misstep could lead to a fatal fall. Many species of animals must sometimes locomote while safely conveying their young. Most often this task is performed by adult females. Some species are specially adapted to conveying their young without occupying their limbs, such as marsupials with their special pouch. In other species, the young are carried on the mother's back, and the offspring have instinctual clinging behaviours. Many species incorporate specialized transportation behaviours as a component of their locomotion repertoire, such as the dung beetle when rolling a ball of dung, which combines both rolling and limb-based elements. The remainder of this article focuses on the anatomical and physiological distinctions involving terrestrial locomotion from the taxonomic perspective. Legged locomotion Movement on appendages is the most common form of terrestrial locomotion, it is the basic form of locomotion of two major groups with many terrestrial members, the vertebrates and the arthropods. Important aspects of legged locomotion are posture (the way the body is supported by the legs), the number of legs, and the functional structure of the leg and foot. There are also many gaits, ways of moving the legs to locomote, such as walking, running, or jumping. =Posture= Hip joints and hindlimb postures. Appendages can be used for movement in a lot of ways: the posture, the way the body is supported by the legs, is an important aspect. There are three main waysCharig, A.J. (1972) The evolution of the archosaur pelvis and hind-limb: an explanation in functional terms. In Studies in Vertebrate Evolution (eds K.A. Joysey and T.S. Kemp). Oliver & Boyd, Edinburgh, pp. 121‚Äì55. in which vertebrates support themselves with their legs ‚Äì sprawling, semi-erect, and fully erect. Some animals may use different postures in different circumstances, depending on the posture's mechanical advantages. There is no detectable difference in energetic cost between stances. The \\"sprawling\\" posture is the most primitive, and is the original limb posture from which the others evolved. The upper limbs are typically held horizontally, while the lower limbs are vertical, though upper limb angle may be substantially increased in large animals. The body may drag along the ground, as in salamanders, or may be substantially elevated, as in monitor lizards. This posture is typically associated with trotting gaits, and the body flexes from side-to-side during movement to increase step length. All limbed reptiles and salamanders use this posture, as does the platypus and several species of frogs that walk. Unusual examples can be found among amphibious fish, such as the mudskipper, which drag themselves across land on their sturdy fins. Among the invertebrates, most arthropods ‚Äì which includes the most diverse group of animals, the insects ‚Äì have a stance best described as sprawling. There is also anecdotal evidence that some octopus species (such as the genus Pinnoctopus) can also drag themselves across land a short distance by hauling their body along by their tentacles (for example to pursue prey between rockpools) ‚Äì there may be video evidence of this. The semi-erect posture is more accurately interpreted as an extremely elevated sprawling posture. This mode of locomotion is typically found in large lizards such as monitor lizards and tegus. Mammals and birds typically have a fully erect posture, though each evolved it independently. In these groups the legs are placed beneath the body. This is often linked with the evolution of endothermy, as it avoids Carrier's constraint and thus allows prolonged periods of activity.Bakker 1988 The fully erect stance is not necessarily the \\"most-evolved\\" stance; evidence suggests that crocodilians evolved a semi-erect stance in their forelimbs from ancestors with fully erect stance as a result of adapting to a mostly aquatic lifestyle,Reilly, Stephen M. and Elias, Jason A. 1998, Locomotion in alligator mississippiensis: kinematic effects of speed and posture and their relevance to the sprawling-to-erect paradigm, J. Exp. Biol. 201,2559-2574. though their hindlimbs are still held fully erect. For example, the mesozoic prehistoric crocodilian Erpetosuchus is believed to have had a fully erect stance and been terrestrial. =Number of legs= The velvet worm (Onychophora) The number of locomotory appendages varies much between animals, and sometimes the same animal may use different numbers of its legs in different circumstances. The best contender for unipedal movement is the springtail, which while normally hexapedal, hurls itself away from danger using its furcula, a tail-like forked rod that can be rapidly unfurled from the underside of its body. A number of species move and stand on two legs, that is, they are bipedal. The group that is exclusively bipedal is the birds, which have either an alternating or a hopping gait. There are also a number of bipedal mammals. Most of these move by hopping - including the macropods such as kangaroos and various jumping rodents. Only a few mammals such as humans and the ground pangolin commonly show an alternating bipedal gait. Cockroaches and some lizards may also run on their two hind legs. With the exception of the birds, terrestrial vertebrate groups with legs are mostly quadrupedal - the mammals, reptiles, and the amphibians usually move on four legs. There are many quadrupedal gaits. The most diverse group of animals on earth, the insects, are included in a larger taxon known as hexapods, most of which are hexapedal, walking and standing on six legs. Exceptions among the insects include praying mantises and water scorpions, which are quadrupeds with their front two legs modified for grasping, some butterflies such as the Lycaenidae (blues and hairstreaks) which use only four legs, and some kinds of insect larvae that may have no legs (e.g., maggots), or additional prolegs (e.g., caterpillars). Spiders and many of their relatives move on eight legs ‚Äì they are octopedal. However, some creatures move on many more legs. Terrestrial crustaceans may have a fair number ‚Äì woodlice having fourteen legs. Also, as previously mentioned, some insect larvae such as caterpillars and sawfly larvae have up to five (caterpillars) or nine (sawflies) additional fleshy prolegs in addition to the six legs normal for insects. Some species of invertebrate have even more legs, the unusual velvet worm having stubby legs under the length of its body, with around several dozen pairs of legs. Centipedes have one pair of legs per body segment, with typically around 50 legs, but some species have over 200. The terrestrial animals with the most legs are the millipedes. They have two pairs of legs per body segment, with common species having between 80 and 400 legs overall - with the rare species Illacme plenipes having up to 750 legs. Animals with many legs typically move them in metachronal rhythm, which gives the appearance of waves of motion travelling forwards along their rows of legs. =Leg and foot structure= The legs of tetrapods, the main group of terrestrial vertebrates, have internal bones, with externally attached muscles for movement, and the basic form has three key joints: the shoulder joint, the knee joint, and the ankle joint, at which the foot is attached. Within this form there is much variation in structure and shape. An alternative form of vertebrate 'leg' to the tetrapod leg is the fins found on amphibious fish. Also a few tetrapods, such as the macropods, have adapted their tails as additional locomotory appendages. The fundamental form of the vertebrate foot has five digits, however some animals have fused digits, giving them less, and some early tetrapods had more; Acanthostega had eight toes. Feet have evolved many forms depending on the animal's needs. One key variation is where on the foot the animal's weight is placed. Some vertebrates: amphibians, reptiles, and some mammals such as humans, bears, and rodents, are plantigrade. This means the weight of the body is placed on the heel of the foot, giving it strength and stability. Most mammals, such as cats and dogs are digitigrade, walking on their toes, giving them what many people mistake as a ‚Äúbackward knee‚Äù, which is really their ankle. The extension of the joint helps store momentum and acts as a spring, allowing digitigrade creatures more speed. Digitigrade mammals are also often adept at quiet movement. Birds are also digitigrade. Hooved mammals are known as ungulates, walking on the fused tips of their fingers and toes. This can vary from odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, pigs, and a few wild African ungulates, to even-toed ungulates, such as cows, deer, and goats. Mammals whose limbs have adapted to grab objects have what are called prehensile limbs. This term can be attributed to front limbs as well as tails for animals such as monkeys and some rodents. All animals that have prehensile front limbs are plantigrade, even if their ankle joint looks extended (squirrels are a good example). Among terrestrial invertebrates there are a number of leg forms. The arthropod legs are jointed and supported by hard external armor, with the muscles attached to the internal surface of this exoskeleton. The other group of legged terrestrial invertebrates, the velvet worms, have soft stumpy legs supported by a hydrostatic skeleton. The prolegs that some caterpillars have in addition to their six more-standard arthropod legs have a similar form to those of velvet worms, and suggest a distant shared ancestry. =Gaits= A jumping kangaroo. A walking hamster. Animals show a vast range of gaits, the order that they place and lift their appendages in locomotion. Gaits can be grouped into categories according to their patterns of support sequence. For quadrupeds, there are three main categories: walking gaits, running gaits, and leaping gaits. In one system (relating to horses), there are 60 discrete patterns: 37 walking gaits, 14 running gaits, and 9 leaping gaits. Walking is the most common gait, where some feet are on the ground at any given time, and found in almost all legged animals. In an informal sense, running is considered to occur when at some points in the stride all feet are off the ground in a moment of suspension. Technically, however, moments of suspension occur in both running gaits (such as trot) and leaping gaits (such as canter and gallop). Gaits involving one or more moments of suspension can be found in many animals, and compared to walking they are faster but more energetically costly forms of locomotion. Animals will use different gaits for different speeds, terrain, and situations. For example, horses show four natural gaits, the slowest horse gait is the walk, then there are three faster gaits which, from slowest to fastest, are the trot, the canter, and the gallop. Animals may also have unusual gaits that are used occasionally, such as for moving sideways or backwards. For example, the main human gaits are bipedal walking and running, but they employ many other gaits occasionally, including a four- legged crawl in tight spaces. In walking, and for many animals running, the motion of legs on either side of the body alternates, i.e. is out of phase. Other animals, such as a horse when galloping, or an inchworm, alternate between their front and back legs. In saltation (hopping) all legs move together, instead of alternating. As a main means of locomotion, this is usually found in bipeds, or semi-bipeds. Among the mammals saltation is commonly used among kangaroos and their relatives, jerboas, springhares, kangaroo rats, hopping mice, gerbils, and sportive lemurs. Certain tendons in the hind legs of kangaroos are very elastic, allowing kangaroos to effectively bounce along conserving energy from hop to hop, making saltation a very energy efficient way to move around in their nutrient poor environment. Saltation is also used by many small birds, frogs, fleas, crickets, grasshoppers, and water fleas (a small planktonic crustacean). Most animals move in the direction of their head. However, there are some exceptions. Crabs move sideways, and naked mole rats, which live in tight tunnels and can move backward or forward with equal facility. Crayfish can move backward much faster than they can move forward. Gait analysis is the study of gait in humans and other animals. This may involve videoing subjects with markers on particular anatomical landmarks and measuring the forces of their footfall using floor transducers (strain gauges). Skin electrodes may also be used to measure muscle activity. Limbless locomotion Helix pomatia crawling over razor blades. Terrestrial gastropods crawl on a layer of mucus. This adhesive locomotion allows them to crawl over sharp objects. There are a number of terrestrial and amphibious limbless vertebrates and invertebrates. These animals, due to lack of appendages, use their bodies to generate propulsive force. These movements are sometimes referred to as \\"slithering\\" or \\"crawling\\", although neither are formally used in the scientific literature and the latter term is also used for some animals moving on all four limbs. All limbless animals come from cold-blooded groups; there are no endothermic limbless animals, i.e. there are no limbless birds or mammals. =Lower body surface= Where the foot is important to the legged mammal, for limbless animals the underside of the body is important. Some animals such as snakes or legless lizards move on their smooth dry underside. Other animals have various features that aid movement. Molluscs such as slugs and snails move on a layer of mucus that is secreted from their underside, reducing friction and protecting from injury when moving over sharp objects. Earthworms have small bristles (setae) that hook into the substrate and help them move. Some animals, such as leeches, have suction cups on either end of the body allowing two anchor movement. =Type of movement= Some limbless animals, such as leeches, have suction cups on either end of their body, which allow them to move by anchoring the rear end and then moving forward the front end, which is then anchored and then the back end is pulled in, and so on. This is known as two-anchor movement. A legged animal, the inchworm, also moves like this, clasping with appendages at either end of its body. Limbless animals can also move using pedal locomotary waves, rippling the underside of the body. This is the main method used by molluscs such as slugs and snails, and also large flatworms, some other worms, and even earless seals. The waves may move in the opposite direction to motion, known as retrograde waves, or in the same direction as motion, known as direct waves. Earthworms move by retrograde waves alternatively swelling and contracting down the length of their body, the swollen sections being held in place using setae. Aquatic molluscs such as limpets, which are sometimes out of the water, tend to move using retrograde waves. However, terrestrial molluscs such as slugs and snails tend to use direct waves. Lugworms and seals also use direct waves. Most snakes move using lateral undulation where a lateral wave travels down the snake's body in the opposite direction to the snake's motion and pushes the snake off irregularities in the ground. This mode of locomotion requires these irregularities to function. Another form of locomotion, rectilinear locomotion, is used at times by some snakes, especially large ones such as pythons and boa. Here large scales on the underside of the body, known as scutes are used to push backwards and downwards. This is effective on a flat surface and is used for slow, silent movement, such as when stalking prey. Snakes use concertina locomotion for moving slowly in tunnels, here the snake alternates in bracing parts of its body on it surrounds. Finally the caenophidian snakes use the fast and unusual method of movement known as sidewinding on sand or loose soil. The snake cycles through throwing the front part of its body in the direction of motion and bringing the back part of its body into line crosswise. Rolling The pangolin Manis temminckii in defensive position. Although animals have never evolved wheels for locomotion, a small number of animals will move at times by rolling their whole body. Rolling animals can be divided into those that roll under the force of gravity or wind and those that roll using their own power. =Gravity or wind assisted= The web-toed salamander, a salamander, lives on steep hills in the Sierra Nevada mountains. When disturbed or startled it coils itself up into a ball, often causing it to roll downhill.Garc√≠a-Par√≠s, M. & Deban, S. M. 1995. A novel antipredator mechanism in salamanders: rolling escape in Hydromantes platycephalus. Journal of Herpetology 29, 149-151. The pebble toad (Oreophrynella nigra) lives atop tepui in the Guiana highlands of South America. When threatened, often by tarantulas, it rolls into ball, and typically being on an incline, rolls away under gravity like a loose pebble. Namib wheeling spiders (Carparachne spp.), found in the Namib desert, will actively roll down sand dunes. This action can be used to successfully escape predators such as the Pompilidae tarantula wasps, which lay their eggs in a paralyzed spider for their larvae to feed on when they hatch. The spiders flip their body sideways and then cartwheel over their bent legs. The rotation is fast, the golden wheel spider (Carparachne aureoflava) moving up to 20 revolutions per second, moving the spider at 1 metre per second.Philip Ball. Material Witness: Rollobots. Nature Materials 6, 261 (2007). . Abstract Coastal tiger beetle larvae when threatened can flick themselves into the air and curl their bodies to form a wheels, which the wind blows, often uphill, as far as 25 m and as fast as . The also may have some ability to steer themselves in this state. Discover magazine: Beetle turns itself into a wheel 25 March 2011. Pangolins, a type of mammal covered in thick scales, roll into a tight ball when threatened. Pangolins have been reported to roll away from danger, by both gravity and self-powered methods. A pangolin in hill country in Sumatra, to flee from the researcher, ran to the edge of a slope and curled into a ball to roll down the slope, crashing through the vegetation, and covering an estimated 30 metres or more in 10 seconds. =Self-powered= Caterpillars of the mother-of-pearl moth, Pleuroptya ruralis, when attacked, will touch their heads to their tails and roll backwards, up to 5 revolutions at about 40 cm per second, which is about 40 times its normal speed. Nannosquilla decemspinosa, a species of long-bodied, short-legged mantis shrimp, lives in shallow sandy areas along the Pacific coast of Central and South America. When stranded by a low tide the 3 cm stomatopod lies on its back and performs backwards somersaults over and over. The animal moves up to 2 meters at a time by rolling 20‚Äì40 times, with speeds of around 72 revolutions per minute. That is 1.5 body lengths per second (3.5 cm/s). Researchers estimate that the stomatopod acts as a true wheel around 40% of the time during this series of rolls. The remaining 60% of the time it has to \\"jumpstart\\" a roll by using its body to thrust itself upwards and forwards. Pangolins have also been reported to roll away from danger by self-powered methods. Witnessed by a lion researcher in the Serengeti in Africa, a group of lions surrounded a pangolin, but could not get purchase on it when it rolled into a ball, and so the lions sat around it waiting and dozing. Surrounded by lions, it would unroll itself slightly and give itself a push to roll some distance, until by doing this multiple times it could get far enough away from the lions to be safe. Moving like this would allow a pangolin to cover distance while still remaining in a protective armoured ball. Moroccan flic- flac spiders, if provoked or threatened, can escape by doubling their normal walking speed using forward or backward flips similar to acrobatic flic-flac movements. Limits and extremes The fastest terrestrial animal is the cheetah, which can attain maximal sprint speeds of approximately 104 km/h (64 mph). The fastest running lizard is the black iguana, which has been recorded moving at speed of up to 34.9 km/h (21.7 mph).

This method was designed by Cornish and Clarke to assist in thinking about situational crime prevention. The rational choice theory has sprung from older and more experimental collections of hypotheses surrounding what has been essential, the empirical findings from many scientific investigations into the workings of human nature. The conceiving and semblance of these social models which are hugely applicable to the methodology expressed through the function of microeconomics within society are also similarly placed to demonstrate that a sizable amount of data is collated using behavioural techniques which are tweaked and made adjustable in order to ensure compatibility with the spontaneous motivational drives displayed by the consumer. Elements The theory is related to earlier drift theory (David Matza, Delinquency and Drift, 1964) where people use the techniques of neutralization to drift in and out of delinquent behaviour, and systematic crime theory (an aspect of social disorganization theory developed by the Chicago School), where Edwin Sutherland proposed that the failure of families and extended kin groups expands the realm of relationships no longer controlled by the community, and undermines governmental controls. This leads to persistent \\"systematic\\" crime and delinquency. He also believed that such disorganization causes and reinforces the cultural traditions and cultural conflicts that support antisocial activity. The systematic quality of the behaviour was a reference to repetitive, patterned or organized offending as opposed to random events. He depicted the law-abiding culture as dominant and more extensive than alternative criminogenic cultural views and capable of overcoming systematic crime if organized for that purpose. In a similar vein, developed the routine activity theory which focuses on the characteristics of crime rather than the characteristics of the offender. This is one of the main theories of environmental criminology as an aspect of crime prevention theory. It states that for a crime to occur, three elements must be present, i.e. there must be: *an available and suitable target; *a motivated offender; and *no authority figure to prevent the crime from happening. Routine activity theory relates the pattern of offending to the everyday patterns of social interaction. Between 1960 and 1980, women left the home to work which led to social disorganization, i.e. the routine of leaving the home unattended and without an authority figure increased probability of criminal activity. The theory is supplemented by the crime triangle or the problem analysis triangle which is used in the analysis both of a crime problem by reference to the three parameters of victim, location, and offender, and of an intervention strategy by reference to the parameters of target/victim, location and absence of a capable guardian with the latter helping to think more constructively about responses as well as analysis. The theory avoids speculation about the source of the offenders‚Äô motivation, which distinguishes it immediately from most other criminological theories. =Support for theory= Many features of rational choice perspective make it particularly suitable to serve as a criminological ‚Äúmetatheory‚Äù with a broad role in the explanation for a variety of criminological phenomena. Since rational choice can explain many different components; it is broad enough to be applied not only to crime but everyday life circumstances. Studies involve offenders being interviewed on motives, methods and target choices. Research involves burglars (Walsh, 1980; Maguire 1982; Cromwell et al., 1991) bank and commercial robbers (New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research, 1987; Nugent et al., 1989) and offenders using violence (Morrison and O‚Äô Donnell, 1996). The rational choice perspective has provided a framework under which to organize such information so that individual studies produce more general benefits. Rational choice theory insists that crime is calculated and deliberate. All criminals are rational actors who practice conscious decision making, that simultaneously work towards gaining the maximum benefits of their present situation. Another aspect of rational choice theory is the fact that many offenders make decisions based on bounded/limited rationality. =Bounded/limited rationality= Ideas of limited rationality emphasize the extent to which individuals and groups simplify a decision because of the difficulties of anticipating or considering all alternatives and all information. Bounded rationality relates to two aspects, one part arising from cognitive limitations and the other from extremes in emotional arousal. Sometimes emotional arousal at the moment of a crime can be acute, therefore would be offenders find themselves out of control, and rational considerations are far less salient. Crime therefore can be influenced by opportunity. Opportunity of a crime can be related to cost benefits, socioeconomic status, risk of detection, dependent on situational context, type of offence and access to external benefits. In addition, opportunities are dependent on the individual‚Äôs current surroundings and consequential factors. This theory better explains instrumental crimes rather than expressive crimes. Instrumental crimes involve planning and weighing the risks with a rational mind. An example of an instrumental crime can include: tax evasion, traffic violations, drinking and driving, corporate crime, larceny and sexual assault. On the other hand, expressive crime includes crimes involving emotion and lack of rational thinking without being concerned of future consequences. Expressive crimes can include: non pre-meditated murder such as manslaughter, and assault. As a result, punishment is only effective in deterring instrumental crime rather than expressive crime. In 2000, O‚ÄôGrady et al. performed a study which examined the illegal sale of tobacco products to underage youth. With the use of a rational mind merchants and clerks weigh out the cost benefits and risk factors which are involved in selling cigarettes to underage youth. Due to the minimal risk of police patrol after 5pm, merchants and clerks felt a diminished sense of risk, therefore allowing them to sell their products illegally to underage youth. According to the three main critiques of rational choice theory include: * Assumes that all individuals have the capacity to make rational decisions * The theory does not explain why the burden of responsibility is excused from young offenders as opposed to adult offenders * This theory contradicts the Canadian Criminal Justice System. This theory does not support the idea that all individuals are rational actors because of cognitive inability. An example of individuals who lack a rational mind include those who are Not Criminally Responsible on Account Due to Mental Disorder (NCRMD).  Routine activity theory  Routine activity theory a sub-field of rational choice criminology, developed by Marcus Felson and Lawrence Cohen. Routine activity theory says that crime is normal and depends on the opportunities available. If a target is not protected enough, if it is worth the reward, crime will happen. Crime does not need hardened offenders, super-predators, convicted felons or wicked people, just an opportunity. The basic premise of routine activity theory is that most crimes are petty theft and unreported to the police. Crime is not spectacular or dramatic. It is mundane and happens all the time. Another premise is that crime is relatively unaffected by social causes such as poverty, inequality, unemployment. For instance, after World War II, the economy of Western countries was booming, and the welfare states were expanding. Crime rose significantly. According to Felson and Cohen, this is because the prosperity of contemporary society offers so much opportunities of crime: there is much more to steal. Routine activity theory is controversial among sociologists who believe in the social causes of crime. But several types of crime are very well explained by routine activity theory: * copyright infringement related to peer-to-peer file sharing * employee theft (internal theft) * corporate crime Situational crime prevention The main creation of the rational choice theory was to aide and give focus to situational crime prevention. Situational crime prevention comprises opportunity-reducing measures that are directed at highly specific forms of crime; involves management, design or manipulation of the immediate environment systematically and permanently; makes crime more difficult and risky or less rewarding and excusable as judged by a wide range of offenders. Rather than simply responding to crime after the fact, recent attention to crime prevention has focused on specific ways in which to modify the physical and social environment. Changes to the physical environment have included such measures as better streetscape and building design, improved lighting in public spaces, installations of deadlocks and alarms, property marking and identification, and traffic calming and creation of green belts. Attempts have been made to extend the range of surveillance of local neighborhood activities, involving such measures as establishment of neighborhood watch committees, employment of private security guards in residences and businesses, antiracist/antifascist organizations and community watch committees to prevent police harassment. Directing enhanced citizen participation programs are not crime-centered would include for example sports and recreation programs, needle exchange programs and AIDS counseling, local employment initiatives funded by government grants and campaigns against poverty and unemployment. Emotions It is argued that there are three important roles of emotions within a rational choice theory of crime. First the people‚Äôs state of emotionality is an important context on which rational conduct rests. Second is the ‚Äúsneaky thrill‚Äù of minor property crime also might operate more generally such that the anticipated emotional consequences of criminal conduct is one of the benefits or utilities (‚Äúthrills‚Äù) that are weighed in the process of rational decision making. Third as a sizable amount of research can attest, the anticipated emotional costs associated with criminal behavior might serve to effectively reduce the likelihood of such behavior. Emotions are a central part of the psychological process of motivation as they heighten the saliency of certain desires, wants, and outcomes and thus energize people to pursue them. Too little emotional intensity and performance suffers from insufficient physical and mental arousal, while too much emotional intensity causes the person to be so aroused that thinking and physical self-control become disorganized. If an offender gets angry easily it is highly probable they won‚Äôt think twice about assaulting someone than an individual who is level headed. Negative emotions can hinder rationality thus leading one to use bounded/limited rationality or make an impulsive move towards a criminal action.

(April 6, 2012) a state in the northern Shan states of Myanmar, was formerly the chief state of the Wa people. It is a mountainous territory, including the valleys of the Salween and its tributary the Nam Hka. It had an approximate area of 7770 km¬≤ and its estimated population in 1911 was 40,000. Mang Lon state extended from about 21¬∞ 30‚Ä≤ to 23¬∞ N., or for 100 miles, along the river Salween, which divided the state into East and West Mang Lon. The inhabitants of East Manglon were Was, while West Manglon was mostly inhabited by Shan people.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1911) History Nothing is known about the history of Manglon before the nineteenth century. The area had been a kingdom named Jambularattha according to legend. The first Sawbwa of Manglon was Ta Ang, a Wa leader who became tributary to Hsenwi State in 1814, retaining his hold over the territory. The eastern part of the state was often raided by Wa chiefs of the neighbouring independent Wa States.Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 17, p. 179. The capital, Takut, was located NE of Pangyang and was perched on a hilltop 6000 feet above sea level. The Sawbwa was a Wa who adopted the style of the Shan rulers. He had control over two substates, Mot Hai to the north and Maw Hpa to the south. The Wa of Mang Lon had given up headhunting, and many professed Buddhism. Traditionally the adjacent Wa States had been administered by a Sawbwa, a Shan hereditary chief who resided in Mang Lon. In the second half of the 19th century the British authorities in Burma judged the Wa territory remote and of difficult access and, excepting Mang Lon, they left the Wa States without administration, its border with China undefined. That situation suited the Wa well, for throughout their history they had consistently preferred being left alone.N Ganesan & Kyaw Yin Hlaing eds. Myanmar: State, Society and Ethnicity, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, February 1, 2007, page 269 There were few Wa in West Mang Lon, where Shans formed the chief population, but there were Palaungs, Chinese and Yanglam, besides Lahu. The bulk of the population in East Mang Lon was Wa, but there were Shans in the valley areas. Both portions were very hilly; the only flat land being along the banks of streams in the valleys, and here the Shans were settled. There were prosperous settlements and bazaars at Nawng Hkam and Mong Kao in West Mang Lon. =Rulers= The rulers of Manglon bore the title of Saopha.

The league said its sole focus was on whether Favre violated workplace conduct policy, not to \\"make judgments about the appropriateness of personal relationships.\\"head Favre admitted to sending voicemails, but not images to Sterger.\\"EXCLUSIVE: Jenn Sterger Demanding Photos Be Removed From Website\\" March 19, 2011, Radar Online He was later fined $50,000 for \\"failure to cooperate\\" with the investigation. The NFL stated that it \\"could not conclude\\" that Favre had violated the personal conduct policy, and that there was not sufficient evidence to establish if Favre had sent the photos. Personal life On December 23, 2016, Sterger became engaged to baseball player Cody Decker. On January 19, 2018, Sterger married Decker.

Henrik Rehr, who took over the strip in 1989, uses the signature \\"Rehr.Mik\\". Ferd'nand was a Danish pantomime comic notable for its lack of word balloons and captions and its longevity (over seven decades). It was first published in 1937 and is still published regularly in several countries around the globe. Background Ferd'nand was first published in 1937 by the Presse-Illustrations-Bureau of Copenhagen. Created by Henning Dahl Mikkelsen, Ferd'nand features the adventures of the title character, his unnamed wife, unnamed son and family dog. Like Carl Anderson's Henry and Otto Soglow's The Little King, there is no dialogue in the strip, although there is the rare exception. While the characters usually speak via the occasional set of exclamation points or question marks, Ferd'nand has been seen to say \\"Africa,\\" \\"Paris,\\" and even with a word balloon, \\"Ok, James.\\" This enabled the strip to achieve a wide distribution throughout Europe and, starting November 10, 1947, in the United States via United Feature Syndicate. Since Ferd'nand is pantomime, translation is not a problem, so the strip has been published in 30 countries. Author Mikkelsen, or \\"Mik\\" as he preferred to be known, moved to the United States in 1946, becoming a citizen in 1954. Mikkelsen turned over the strip to others, including Frank Thomas (no relation to Disney's Frank Thomas) for a time from 1955 until the mid-1960s. He then drew it until his death in 1982, after which Al Plastino, drew it until 1989. Plastino's strips were signed \\"Al + Mik\\". Henrik Rehr, a Danish illustrator and painter, took over the strip in 1989, and was the final author. Rehr's strips are signed \\"Rehr.Mik\\". Characters and story The main character, presumably named Ferd'nand, is a round, mustachioed, middle-aged father and husband, recognized by his conical hat. Ferd'nand's son sports a similar hat, while his wife and dog are rather unremarkable in appearance. Ferd'nand's father also appeared in one strip, looking and being dressed like his son except for the white hair and mustache and wearing eyeglasses. Unlike most strips, Ferd'nand lacks basic continuity or any cast of recurring characters other than the immediate Ferd'nand family. Ferd'nand himself has been seen working in nearly every occupation and in any location imaginable. Similarly, each strip stands alone; no story spans multiple strips. This lends a rather fantasy-like, ephemeral air to the strip. Films Two Ferd'nand animated cartoons were produced, both directed by H. Dahl Mikkelsen: * Ferd'nand p√• fisketur (Ferd'nand's fishing trip) (1944) * Ferd'nand p√• bj√∏rnejagt (Ferd'nand's bear hunting) (1945) End New entries of \\"Ferd'nand\\" are no longer being published. The strip ended its run on January 8, 2012 (although Yahoo has now re-dated that strip May 6, 2012). References External links *Ferd'nand at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

Ende is located on the southern coast of Flores Island. The city has a population of 60,000 residents which makes it the second largest city on the island after Maumere. History Ende was the site of a kingdom that existed around the end of 18th century. The people of the area therefore known as Lio-Ende people. For many decades Ende has been a center of government, trade, education, and political activities. Rebellion against the Dutch was led by a certain Nipa Do known as the wars of Watu Api and Mari Longa (1916-1917). In 1934, the nationalist leader, Sukarno, who later became Indonesia's first president was exiled to eastern Indonesia by the Dutch colonial government. Attractions Christ the King Cathedral in Ende The Bung Karno Museum is the old house occupied by Sukarno during his years of exile in Ende. Most of the old furniture are still there. While he was exiled in Ende, Sukarno wrote and held several plays, together with Tonel Kelimutu Theatre Group. Among the plays were Rendorua Ola Nggera Nusa (Rendo that stirred the archipelago) and Doctor Satan, a revision on the story of Dr. Frankenstein. Near the football field in Ende stands a big breadfruit tree. Under the tree, Sukarno often sat, working on political ideas to lead Indonesia to independence. Those reflections contributed to the opening of Pancasila concept, which is now the state philosophy of Indonesia. From here Pancasila was born. Today, the Pancasila Birth Monument stands on this place.Deanna Ramsay, 'A visit to Sukarno's Ende', The Jakarta Post, 9 May 2011.

Another attraction is Christ the King Cathedral, which is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ende. The well-known tourist spot of Mount Kelimutu with three coloured volcanic lakes is about 50 km to the east of Ende. While in Ende there is an opportunity to tryout the local type of coffee 'Kopi Ende'. Coffee beans and ginger toasted together and brewed as normal. Transportation The city is served by H.

The film was written by Mark Verheiden. It had a theatrical release in October 2008, followed by DVD and Blu-ray releases on February 10, 2009. Although Sam Raimi, with whom Bruce frequently collaborates, is not involved with this production, much of the film is in the vein of the Evil Dead series. Ted Raimi (Sam's brother), also a frequent collaborator, appears in this film. Campbell has shown several minutes of the movie during some of his campus lectures, as well as a few public screenings, including showings at the sixth annual Ashland Independent Film Festival, CineVegas and the 11th annual East Lansing Film Festival. A trailer was released for the film, as well, and is available on various websites. A screening was held at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema. Tickets for the show sold out in less than two minutes, breaking the previous Alamo ticket sellout record, which was also set by a Bruce Campbell appearance at the theater in 1998.  Plot  In the mining town of Gold Lick, Oregon, Jeff (Taylor Sharpe), a young fan of B-movie actor Bruce Campbell, and his friend Clayton (Logan Martin) go out to a cemetery to meet two girls, Big Debbie (Ariel Badenhop) and Little Debbie (Ali Akay). Jeff removes a medallion off the mausoleum, unleashing the Chinese god of the dead, Guan Di (James Peck), who kills Clayton and the Debbies while Jeff flees. Meanwhile, Bruce Campbell is finishing filming for the fictional Cave Alien II, and is promised a birthday surprise from his agent, Mills Toddner (Ted Raimi). Bruce meets Jeff, who kidnaps Campbell and takes him to Gold Lick in hopes that his hero can save the town from Guan Di. Upon arrival, Bruce assumes this is his birthday surprise from Mills, and thinks it is all a movie, despite a lack of cameras and a script, and agrees to \\"help\\". He learns about Guan-Di in the town's hall, and during a dinner party, Bruce gets on the good side of Jeff's mother, Kelly (Grace Thorsen), who had initially been irritated by Bruce's behavior. After gearing up at Gold Lick's gun shop, Bruce and many citizens of Gold Lick go out into the woods to take on Guan Di, which Bruce still thinks is part of a movie. Bruce then finds out that it is all real and flees Gold Lick, angering the townspeople, disappointing Kelly, and upsetting Jeff. As part of a running gag, an Italian painter (also played by Ted Raimi) constantly repaints the population sign every time someone dies, including himself. Bruce returns to his caravan to find that everyone, including his own dog, hates him a lot. He has a restraining order placed upon him by his ex-wife, Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss), and finds that his \\"surprise birthday present\\" from Mills was just a singing prostitute named Kasey (Janelle Farber). Bruce is then called by Jeff, who informs him that he is going to take on Guan Di alone in spite of Bruce's retreat. Kasey takes Bruce back to Gold Lick, where he is treated with contempt and tries to reconcile with Kelly. To rescue Jeff, they both drive to the old cemetery, in which they set up dynamite at the mausoleum and try to lure Guan Di inside with one of Jeff's cardboard cut-outs of Bruce, for which Guan Di does not fall. After kissing Kelly, Bruce decides to sacrifice himself (with bean curd playing a significant role in luring Guan Di) and the dynamite is blown up. He emerges from the debris alive, and hangs the medallion back onto the mausoleum wall to ease the spirit. Guan Di then also comes back to life, and at the last minute, as revealed, the whole scenario was a movie. Bruce argues with Ted Raimi about the cliche ending and turns it into a happy ending, which involves Bruce and Kelly married, living in a nice house with their son, Jeff, who is accepted into Harvard University. After the movie ends, Bruce asks, \\"What could be a better ending than that?\\", after which Guan Di appears and attacks Bruce.

One positive review came from Nick Rogers of Suite101.com, saying, \\"My Name is Bruce won't give you sugar, baby. Not on its budget. But Splenda works fine as a substitute for this Kool-Aid, which Campbell knows fans will happily drink. A little bit of purposefully lousy filmmaking winds up going a long way.\\" One negative review came from Felix Vasquez Jr. of Cinema Crazed, calling it \\"Smug, silly, and forgettable, this vanity project wants to be the next cult hit, but really is just another vehicle for Bruce Campbell.\\" =Home media= The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on February 10, 2009. Sequel Richardson said that a sequel, titled My Name is Still Bruce, is in the works. Dark Horse Entertainment and Image Entertainment will distribute both films. The title for the second film has since been changed to Bruce vs. Frankenstein. In a message sent in January, 2010, to Ain't It Cool News, Campbell officially announced the sequel, stating that \\"principal photography begins this fall in Oregon.\\" In April, Ted Raimi confirmed that he would be involved with the project. Campbell declared himself the director, saying, \\"no one will volunteer, so it's me.\\" Adaptation In September 2008, Dark Horse Comics published a single-issue comic-book adaptation of the movie. The script was adapted by Milton Freewater, Jr., and the art was by Cliff Richards.

He served from 1 May to 27 May 1947.. His older brother was the noted poet Santiago Arguello Barreto. A member of the Nationalist Liberal Party, his presidency was cut short by a Coup d'√©tat orchestrated by the Commander of the National Guard, General Anastasio Somoza Garc√≠a. Life and political race Leonardo Arg√ºello was born in Le√≥n, Nicaragua. Working as a doctor in Leon, he entered Liberal Party politics in 1912. He participated in the Constitutionalist War of 1926. He served as President of the lower chamber of the National Congress of Nicaragua, and as Minister of Public Education, Interior and Foreign Affairs. He was also a writer and diplomat. In the elections of 1936, he ran for president and lost to General Somoza. To the surprise of many, Somoza proposed that Arg√ºello should be the candidate for the Liberal Party in the elections of 1947, and did not run for president himself. The elections were widely believed to be rigged, and one of the conditions for Arg√ºello‚Äôs victory was reputedly the maintenance of Somoza as Commander-in-Chief of the National Guard. Presidency of the Republic On 1 May 1947, during his inauguration before the Congress of the Republic, Arg√ºello made a speech in opposition to the wishes of Gen. Somoza. In a part of his message he said: I will not be, by the way, a simple figurehead. From that day on, disputes arose between Dr. Arg√ºello and Gen. Somoza. The excesses of the National Guard were denounced for the first time. The government published a list of the properties acquired by Somoza during his presidency. There were even rumours that president Arg√ºello, without taking into account the Commander of the National Guard, had attempted to ally with factions of the military who were dissatisfied with Somoza, in particular with the young Aguirre Baca brothers, Francisco and Horacio. Nicaraguans found it ironic that until May 1, 1947, the date of Arguello‚Äôs becoming President, Francisco Aguirre had been President Somoza‚Äôs most trusted and feared military aid and confidant. These acts by Arguello and Francisco Aguirre infuriated Somoza, who hoped to have the absolute control of the country. The very same Congress that heard Arguello‚Äôs Ignaugural Address, declared him unable to govern three weeks later. Exile and coup d'√©tat On 26 May 1947 general Somoza led a coup d'√©tat against the government, accusing it of conspiring to remove him as commander of the National Guard. The Congress declared that Arg√ºello was unable to govern and removed him of the position, accusing him of attempting to undermine army discipline. The Assembly nominated Benjam√≠n Lacayo, a puppet of Somoza, to succeed Arg√ºello. Arguello fled to the Embassy of Mexico, after less than 4 weeks into his mandate. He remained there 6 months, until finally moving to Mexico without resigning the position of President of the Republic. The Aguirre Baca brothers, from their part, took up diplomatic refuge at the Embassy of Panama, and fled to that country, before finally moving to Caracas, Venezuela, then finally settling in the United States. President Arguello died of an illness shortly after arriving in Mexico City on 15 December 1947. He is buried in Mexico City. He was a cousin of Mar√≠a Arg√ºello Manning, wife of Juan Bautista Sacasa Sacasa, 63rd President of Nicaragua.
