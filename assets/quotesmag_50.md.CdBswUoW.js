This conductive path closes a phantom loop circuit to discharge or neutralize the static electricity that can build up on a spacecraft. Space contains regions with varying concentrations of charged particles such as the plasma sheet, and a static charge builds up as the spacecraft moves between these regions, or as the electrical potential varies within such a region.

The lighthouse was constructed in 1802 and commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson. The lighthouse has had three keeper's houses: the original house of 1802 was rebuilt in 1851 and then again in 1871. The 1871 keeper's house survived to 1976, when it was destroyed by fire; the Coast Guard repaired and automated the lighthouse two years later. A volunteer group, the Faulkner's Light Brigade, has undertaken the restoration and preservation of the lighthouse since 1991, completing the last major restoration work in March 2011. Access to Falkner Island and the light is restricted during the nesting season of the roseate terns from May to August yearly. The Falkner Island Lighthouse, as the second oldest extant lighthouse in Connecticut, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Falkner Island  Falker Island is a crescent-shaped island located three and a half miles offshore of Guilford, Connecticut. The island has had several owners including Andrew Leete in the 1600s. In 1715, Caleb and Ebenezer Stone purchased the island, which remained in the Stone family until 1801. In 1800, Noah Stone sold it to a distant relative, Medad Stone, for $158.34. On May 12, 1801, Medad Stone sold the island to the government for $325. Joel Henderson, a historian, notes that Medad Stone and the government were likely openly communicating about the island. The United States Congress had appropriated $6000 in March 1801 for the lighthouse, prior to the government's acquisition of the property. Construction 1904 postcard The Falkner Island Lighthouse was commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson in 1802. It was constructed and completed by Abisha Woodward in 1802. Woodward also built New London Harbor Light in 1801 and the Black Rock Harbor Light in 1808. Falkner Island Lighthouse cost $5977.62 to build, according to the United States government. The octagonal tower was made of brownstone lined with brick, and it originally had a spiral wooden staircase that led outside to the lantern room. This staircase was an unusual and distinguishing characteristic of the Falkner Island Light. The original fixed light used twelve lamps and reflectors on two stacked tables. It was replaced in 1840, at a cost of $2842.00, with a lantern that used nine lamps and sixteen-inch reflectors. A cast iron spiral staircase was installed in a major renovation in 1871. Originally, the keeper's house had eight rooms, but it deteriorated and was rebuilt in 1858. When rebuilt it was one-and-a-half stories high and had three bedrooms, a kitchen, dining and sitting rooms. Construction quality was poor, allowing snow to enter the house during the winter through gaps in the walls and roof. In 1871, it was rebuilt by the United States Coast Guard as a three-story house, which remained until it was destroyed by fire on March 15, 1976. The fire also scorched the adjacent lighthouse. In the Spring 2002 edition of The Octagon, the keeper's house was said to be a two-story house with eleven rooms.  Service  During the War of 1812, the British forces landed on the island and told the keeper's wife, Thankful Stone, that they had nothing to fear as long as they kept the light burning. Later, the keeper, Solomon Stone, had to put the light out per order of the New London customs inspector. The British threatened to blow up the lighthouse, and Stone got an order to relight the lighthouse. In 1856, the light was upgraded from the twelve lamps to a fourth-order Fresnel lens. The light's new characteristic was a fixed light with a flash every two seconds. Around 1976, a GE 1000-watt bulb was used. When the lighthouse was repaired after the fire and automated in 1978, a modern optic replaced the Fresnel lens. The lighthouse currently uses a VRB-25 lens. The lighthouse switched to solar power in 1988. The light's characteristic is a flash of white light every ten seconds. It continues to operate as a navigational aid to the nearby Intracoastal Waterway. Falkner Island Light was chosen for fog-signal experiments in 1865 and in 1902. In 1865, Joseph Henry of the Smithsonian Institution, the Chairman of the Lighthouse Board, set up bells and whistles and tested the distances they could be heard. In 1879, a steam fog whistle was installed at the cost of $5000. In 1902, an air siren was installed and powered by two 16¬Ω horsepower engines and used in an experiment in sound penetration. In 1934, a Leslie-Tyfon trumpet was installed.  Restoration  After the fire in 1976, vandals caused additional damage that resulted in the windows being bricked up and a steel door installed. Restoration and preservation of the light is done through the volunteer \\"Faulkner's Light Brigade\\", which formed in 1991. In 1997, Walter Sedovic was selected by a Lighthouse Restoration Committee to perform the restoration of the lighthouse. Completed in 1999, the restorations included painting the interior and exterior, replacing the door and a new entry deck made of Pau Lope wood. The lighthouse has been threatened by erosion for decades. In the 1930s, as a response to the erosion, a breakwater was constructed to protect the boat landing area. In 1996, the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation and the National Trust for Historic Preservation assisted the task of obtaining funding for a $4.5 million erosion-control project. The funds were approved in 1998 with the help of Connecticut Senators, Joseph Lieberman and Christopher Dodd and New Haven's Congressional Representative Rosa DeLauro. In 2001, the construction of a stone wall and creation of a buffer zone was completed. The second phase of the project calls for protective revetment on the south side of the island. The 33-foot cast iron spiral staircase from 1871 was repaired and restored for the cost of $15,724. The work was done by Conservation Services and they uncovered and preserved the numbering of the stairs. In October 2010, a major restoration project repainted the tower and lantern, installed ventilated steel doors, restored the original weathervane and repaired the 12-pane casement window on the west wall of the lighthouse. The work was completed in March 2011 after it was suspended due to poor weather in December 2010; the total cost was $121,000.  Importance  Falkner Island Light is the second oldest extant lighthouse in Connecticut and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 29, 1990. The Town of Guilford proclaimed that September 7, 2002, would be \\"Faulkner's Island Light Day\\" to honor the 200th birthday of the lighthouse. Falkner Island Light is home to one of the world's largest breeding colonies of the endangered roseate tern; the nesting season is May through August. Access to Falkner Island and the light is restricted during the nesting season of the roseate terns.  Notes  *Lighthouse Friends lists the tower as being tall.

The Club offers a variety of sporting and social programs including aquatics, cricket, croquet, curling, figure skating, fitness classes, lawn bowling, squash and tennis. The Club also provides additional services including daycare, children's camps, health services, and social events for adults and children. History The history of Toronto Cricket Skating and Curling Club dates back to 1827, when the Toronto Cricket Club was founded. The Toronto Curling Club was organized in 1836 and the Toronto Skating Club sometime in the mid-eighteen hundreds. In 1957 these three clubs amalgamated into the athletic and social club it is today. The merger was seen as beneficial for the memberships of all the clubs. The Toronto Cricket Club had struggled financially since the 1930s; the Toronto Skating Club had outgrown its premises on Dupont Street and both operated on a seasonal basis. By joining forces the new club could remain open all year-round. After months of negotiations and careful planning by both clubs another proposal came forward. The Toronto ‚Äì Victoria Curling and Bowling Club was looking for a new facility after the Club's property was expropriated by the expanding University of Toronto. On April 10, 1957, the membership voted unanimously to further the recent merge with the third club and call the new entity the Toronto Cricket Skating and Curling Club. Amalgamation was a bold step. With its success, a proud tradition of sporting excellence was not only maintained, it thrived. The Toronto Cricket Skating and Curling Club hosted such prestigious international events such as the North American Skating Championships, The Davis Cup and the Sahara Cup. Brier champions trained at the Club, as did renowned skaters like Barbara Ann Scott and Toller Cranston. In the 60 years since amalgamation, the Club's membership has nearly doubled, and the regulations and facilities have evolved to meet the changing tastes of each generation. What has not changed is the original vision and pursuit of excellence that was at the heart of the Toronto Cricket Skating and Curling Club in 1957.  Athletics  Toronto Cricket Skating and Curling Club is perhaps best known for its figure skating programme that is run by Olympic skaters Brian Orser and Tracy Wilson. The two have coached many elite-level skaters to national, international, world and Olympic titles including skaters such as Yuna Kim (2009 & 2013 World Champion, 2010 Olympic Champion, 2014 Olympic Silver medallist), Gabrielle Daleman (2018 Olympic Team Gold medallist), Evgenia Medvedeva (2018 double Olympic Silver medallist, 2016 & 2017 World Champion), Yuzuru Hanyu (2014 & 2017 World Champion and 2014 & 2018 Olympic Champion) and Javier Fernandez (2015 & 2016 World Champion and 2018 Olympic Bronze medallist). The Toronto Cricket Skating and Curling Club hosts a number of other sports that include: * Aquatics * Cricket * Croquet * Curling * Fitness * Lawn Bowling * Skating * Squash * Tennis All athletics include leagues, clinics, lessons and free play for members of the club.

Almanzor actually had all power in his hands but nominally recognized the suzerainty of the caliph. His son and successor Abd al-Malik al-Muzaffar acted in the same way. His originally Christian mother was Abda (born Urraca), daughter of Sancho II of Pamplona, after whom he was named; Sanchuelo () being the diminutive of Sancho; because he looked like his Christian grandfather. In or about 997, the Kingdom of Pamplona attacked Calatayud and in revenge Almanzor ordered the beheading of 50 Pamplonan captives. According to Ibn Darray, Sanchuelo himself beheaded his uncle, perhaps Gonzalo S√°nchez of Aragon. When Abd al-Malik died, his younger brother Abd al-Rahman succeeded him on 20 October 1008. He used his great influence and forced the weak caliph to designate him as his heir (November 1008). The population of C√≥rdoba responded angrily to this development. They had already disliked the rule of Almanzor because he had recruited many Berber mercenaries for his protection. Abd ar-Rahman was also accused of poisoning his brother, Abd al-Malik. When Abd al-Rahman went on an expedition against King Alfonso V of Le√≥n (February 1009), the citizens of C√≥rdoba rose against him. They were led by Muhammad II al-Mahdi, a member of the Umayyad dynasty. Muhammad II al-Mahdi removed his relative Hisham II from the throne, became the new caliph and destroyed Abd al-Rahman's residence, al-Madina al-Zahira (\\"the flourishing city\\"). On receiving this news Abd al-Rahman returned to C√≥rdoba, but his troops abandoned him. He was arrested and later assassinated on the orders of al- Mahdi.  References  * E.

Political impact British casualties in Afghanistan have had a major political impact, although not as significant as the impact of British casualties in Iraq. This is mainly because the three main British political parties (Labour, Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats) all support British operations in the country.Lib Dems website However British casualties in the middle of 2006 did lead to the government's decision to reinforce the British contingent. Toward the end of 2008 the numbers of troops being killed or seriously injured while travelling in lightly armoured Snatch Land Rovers in both Iraq and Afghanistan raised questions in the United Kingdom Parliament about the suitability of the vehicles for use in these theatres.Snatch Land Rover‚ÄîThe controversy Members of the public and families of killed and injured servicemen have campaigned about perceived problems with these vehicles including an online petition to the office of the Prime Minister.

Previously, every airline had its own system, which made the sharing and aggregation of flight delay information difficult. IATA standardised the flight delay reporting format by using codes that attribute cause and responsibility for the delay; this supports aviation administration and logistics and helps to define any penalties arising. These codes are used in movement messages sent electronically by SITA from the departure airport to the destination airport and also in the internal administration of the airlines, airports and ground handling agents. An aircraft held on the ground incurs costs, consequently airlines plan operations to minimise ground time. It is common practice for airlines and aircraft ground handling to have contracts based on a bonus-malus system, penalising the causative agent for delays caused. Delay code properties cover nine category sets for delay. Each category set can be described using either a two digit number code or a two letter alpha code; most airlines use the numeric format but some prefer the alpha. Messaging standards, such as the AHM 780 Aircraft Movement Message specification, specify that only the numeric codes should be used. Many airlines further subdivide the IATA codes with an additional character, for more granular delay analysis, but these are not standardized. In the AHM 780 specification, the two-character numeric-only codes are sent in the DL and EDL elements along with the time assigned to each code (e.g. DL31/62/0005/0015 showing reason 31 5mins and reason 62 15 minutes), and the three-character alphanumeric codes are sent in the DLA element (e.g. DLA31C/62A// showing subreason C for code 31 and subreason A for code 62).  Delay Codes starting with 0 (internal)  Delay codes starting with 0 are used for internal airline purposes. Airlines are free to define these codes and to determine particular application fields. However the following codes are standard, even if some airlines do not use them and create their own customized delay codes: * 00-05: These codes are left blank so that each airline may develop codes specifically to meet their own individual requirements, e.g., 03: \\"Three-class system\\" moving curtain. * 06 (OA): No gate/stand availability due to own airline activity * 07: Aircraft connection by maintenance * 08: Aircraft connection by miscellaneous, traffic, marketing flight operations, ground handling, cabin services, etc. * 09 (SG): Scheduled ground time less than declared minimum ground time  Delay Codes starting with 1 (passenger/baggage)  These Codes are used to describe delays caused by Passenger and Baggage handling. * 11 (PD): Late check-in, acceptance of passengers after

It houses a number of historical optical telescopes, including the Lockyer Telescope, and is operated by Norman Lockyer Observatory Society (NLOS).  History  The observatory was founded by Joseph Norman Lockyer in 1912 when he retired to Sidmouth following the closure of the South Kensington Observatory, of which Lockyer was Director. Originally known as Hill Observatory, the observatory was renamed Norman Lockyer Observatory after his death in 1920. Mary Thomasina Browne, a.k.a \\"Lady Lockyer\\", took a strong interest in the observatory and made gifts to it. She was elected to the Royal Astronomical Society in 1923. The Observatory's historic instruments are associated with Lockyer's pioneering work on star temperature which led to theories of stellar evolution and the foundation of astrophysics. The facility was operated by the University of Exeter between 1948 and 1984. In 1984 East Devon District Council became the owner/trustee of the observatory and after a period of renovation leased it to Norman Lockyer Observatory Society (NLOS) in 1995. An exhibition area and 60-seat planetarium was added in 1996 and a 100-seat convention center for lectures and academic conferences added in 2005. The Connaught Dome, which incorporates 'Lockyer Technology Centre' (the observatory's radio astronomy facility), was opened in 2012. The observatory is staffed by volunteers, and regularly open to the public on published afternoons and evenings.  Instruments  The observatory provides modern telescopes with computer enhanced imaging, maintains some of the nation's most historic astronomical instruments and enjoys a relatively dark night sky with a southerly aspect across the sea. There are five domes: * 'Mond', housing the 6¬º-inch Lockyer Telescope. Built in 1871, this optical refractor telescope is on a German equatorial mount. Norman Lockyer used the objective lens from this telescope to discover helium in 1868 (before the lens was used in the telescope). * 'Kensington', housing the Kensington Telescope. Built in 1881 for the Solar Physics Observatory, London, this dual refractor telescope has a 10\\" tube for observation and 9\\" tube with attached prism and plate glass camera for spectroscopy. * 'McClean', housing the McClean Telescope, donated to the observatory by Francis McClean in 1912. Built in 1897, it is a Grubb dual refractor consisting of a 12\\" tube and attachment for a plate glass camera, and a 10\\" tube for observing. Associated with this telescope is the Cooke Siderostat which projects the Sun's optical spectrum and Fraunhofer absorption lines within the Dome annex. * 'Connaught', housing a 20\\" reflector and the observatory's radio astronomy facility (Lockyer Technology Centre). * 'Victoria', housing a 12\\" reflector. The observatory is particularly well situated for spectral analysis in astronomy, which requires a clear sky over the whole optical spectrum, as it enjoys a relatively \\"clean\\" sky to the east and south across the sea. The atmosphere is usually free of air pollution and light pollution and, as the sea has a uniform temperature, the air is also free of rising currents which can distort optical images. The observatory is active in both optical and radio astronomy and has an astro imaging group, a technology group, a meteorology and weather satellite facility and a science history group. The observatory's radio call sign is 'GB2NLO' for special events at the observatory. It cooperates with undergraduate courses of the University of Exeter, the University of Plymouth and the Open Universities, and is available for scientific and educational development projects. The observatory is home to the annual South West Astronomy Fair on the second Saturday in August. The observatory celebrated its centenary in 2012, with commemorative events throughout the year, as well as the openings of the Connaught Dome (20\\" reflector) and Lockyer Technology Centre by Brian May. The observatory holds a library, including glass spectral plates. An archive of Lockyer's papers is held at the University of Exeter.  Society  The observatory is home to the astronomical society \\"Norman Lockyer Observatory Society (NLOS)\\", founded in 1995. It is a registered charity with the principal activities of promoting the public understanding of science, technology and astronomy and supporting science education in schools and universities. The facility is financed solely by its membership, private donations and income derived from Public Open Days. No funding is received from national or local government agencies nor does it receive ongoing grants from any organisation.

She survived the war but was given as a war reparation to the Hellenic Navy in 1947. She was renamed Elli and served until 1964. Design Eugenio di Savoia was part of the fourth group of Condottieri-class light cruisers, also known as the Duca d'Aosta class. The design of the Duca d'Aosta class was based on the Montecuccoli class, with a slight increase in size and a significant increase in armour. The machinery was also re-arranged. Eugenio di Savoia was built by Ansaldo, Genoa, and named after Prince Eugene of Savoy. Career As results of the pact between Franco and Mussolini during the Spanish Civil War, on 13 February 1937, the ship went into action off the coast of Barcelona, Spain, bombarding the city and causing 18 deaths. The cruiser joined the 7th cruiser division and went on a circumnavigation of the globe with her sister ship in 1938-39, returning to La Spezia in March 1939. During World War II she fought in the following actions: * Battle of Punta Stilo * Operation Harpoon (1942) - the battle in which she crippled , later finished off by a torpedo bomber. * Operation Pedestal She was hit during an air strike carried out by Liberator bombers while berthed in Napoli on 4 December 1942.

The ship became the headquarters for the Commander in Chief of the Hellenic Fleet. Although Elli did not carry a pennant number, NATO archives of the period use pennant number initially C92 and after 1962 C24. The ship was moved to Souda Bay (Crete) in 1959 where she was used as headquarters to the Admiral C-in-C of Cretan and Ionian seas.\\"Elli II ex Eugenio di Savoia\\" Hellenic Navy, Retrieved: 18 January 2013. She also served for state visits of King Paul to Constantinople in June 1952, Yugoslavia in September 1955, Toulon, France in June 1956, and Lebanon in May 1958. In 1959 she was moved to Souda Bay, Crete, where she was used as headquarters of the Ionian and Cretan Seas Command. Decommissioned in 1965, she was used as a naval prison ship. Certain naval personnel were detained there during the 1967-1974 junta because of their resistance activities. She was auctioned off in 1973.

The family moved to Milan around 1585 with the help of the rich art collector Pirro Visconti. He began as a sculptor in the Cathedral and in the Milanese church of Santa Maria presso San Celso. In 1610 he painted six of the Quadroni, large canvases celebrating Saint Charles Borromeo. Among his many altarpieces are the Circumcision (c.1616) now in Galleria Estense, Modena, and the Last Supper (1616) for Convent associated with the Basilica della Santissima Annunziata del Vastato in Genoa. He also painted the Scourging of Christ. He worked with Giovanni Battista Crespi (il Cerano) and Pier Francesco Mazzucchelli (il Morazzone) following the directions of Cardinal Federico Borromeo, patron of the arts and cousin of Charles Borromeo. He also painted small religious canvases for rich families, in Milan and in Genoa, where he saw the works of Rubens. His style shows the influence of Bolognese mannerism and Venetian colorism and marks the beginning of the Baroque.

They are significant as revealing the development of linear perspective in early Italian Renaissance painting, and are unusual as a major secular commission. The paintings are in egg tempera on wooden panels, each over 3 metres long. According to the National Gallery, London,Paolo Uccello The Battle of San Romano NG583 the panels were commissioned by a member of the Bartolini Salimbeni family in Florence sometime between 1435 and 1460. The paintings were much admired in the 15th century; Lorenzo de' Medici so coveted them that he purchased one and had the remaining two forcibly removed to the Palazzo Medici.

Similar to that of a tapestry, the landscape rises up in a picture plane as opposed to receding deeply into space. This illusion of a backdrop and a perspective theme resembling a stage, depicts the war as a theatrical ceremony. The three paintings were designed to be hung high on three different walls of a room, and the perspective designed with that height in mind, which accounts for many apparent anomalies in the perspective when seen in photos or at normal gallery height. Many areas of the paintings were covered with gold and silver leaf. While the gold leaf, such as that found on the decorations of the bridles, has remained bright, the silver leaf, found particularly on the armour of the soldiers, has oxidized to a dull grey or black. The original impression of the burnished silver would have been dazzling. All of the paintings, especially that in the Louvre, have suffered from time and early restoration, and many areas have lost their modelling. The panels were a subject in the BBC series The Private Life of a Masterpiece (2005). References in popular culture The dark horse in the Louvre panel, mounted by Micheletto Attendolo, can be seen painted in a tapestry, in the first segment (\\"Metzengerstein\\") of the 1968 omnibus film Spirits of the Dead.

Breeding The sire of Dark Ronald, Bay Ronald, was a moderate handicap racehorse and a useful sire. He produced two other notable sons: Bayardo and Macdonald II. Bayardo went on to be one of the greatest runners of his time, and a sire of two English Triple Crown winners. Macdonald II was a very successful runner in France. Bay Ronald also sired the filly Rondeau, the dam of the very significant sire Teddy (that sired, among others, Athelstan, Ortello, Sir Gallahad III, Case Ace, and Sun Teddy). His dam, Darkie, was a poor performer on the turf with only two placings, both as a two-year-old. Foaled in 1905, Dark Ronald was purchased at the Doncaster sales as a yearling for 1,300 guineas, by breeder Sir Abe Bailey. Racing record At age two, Dark Ronald had two starts, winning his first in the five-furlong Hurst Park Foal Plate, and finishing second in the Lingfield Park Foal Plate. In the latter, he pulled up lame. Both front tendons were fired, and he was rested for two years at Sir Bailey's farm in South Africa. Returning to England as a four-year-old, he ran in the Newbury Spring Cup, finishing unplaced. Following this, he had better success, winning the next three races in which he ran: the 10-furlong Durham Plate, the seven-furlong Royal Hunt Cup, and the 12-furlong Princess of Wales's Stakes. He finished third in his next race, the Doncaster Cup, but yet again came back lame. His owner decided to retire him for breeding.

His first crop included the great racehorse and sire Son-in-Law and Ambassador IV, later sent to the United States, where he had a great influence on the American breeding industry. In his second crop, his get included Vaucluse. However, his foals were not promising, and when the German National Stud at Graditz offered the great sum of ¬£25,000 for the stallion, his owner was happy to sell him.

Fagor was Spain's largest consumer appliance company and the fifth largest electrical appliance company in Europe, manufacturing a wide range of domestic appliances, including washing machines, refrigerators and ovens.. History Fagor Electrodom√©sticos was the world's biggest industrial worker cooperative for decades, the flagship of the Mondragon Corporation, the world's largest workers' co-operative. It started in 1956 in a small workshop in Mondrag√≥n, Spain. From the Spanish market, it expanded internationally to North Africa and Latin America in the late 1980s. From 1996 to 2001, Fagor formed joint ventures with international companies. In 1999, Fagor acquired Wrozamet in Poland. The acquisition of Brandt Electrom√©nager in 2005 made it the leader in household appliances in France. Among European manufacturers, it ranked fifth after Electrolux, Whirlpool, Bosch Siemens and Merloni. The employees of the foreign acquisitions were not offered ownership. Besides, about 15% of the workers in the parent company were temporary employees without ownership rights. In 2006, it had eight production plants in Spain, four in France, one in Poland, one in Italy, three in China and one in Morocco). Its 1,729-million-euro sales were 6% of the European market. The total workforce was 10,543 employees. The buying of Brandt and other growth was financed through borrowing as capital markets were not available. When the Spanish housing crisis struck in 2008, the main market for Fagor appliances collapsed. Increased Asian competition could not be countered in spite of austerity measures, liquidity injections and staff relocation. On October 16, 2013, Fagor Electrodom√©sticos filed for protection from creditors while it tried to refinance and renegotiate its ‚Ç¨1.1 billion of debt under Spanish law, after suffering heavy losses during the European financial crisis.https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/16/spain-fagor- idUSL6N0I61WA20131016https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise- network/2013/nov/15/spanish-co-op-workers-occupy-plant On November 6, 2013, Fagor Brandt, the French subsidiary of the Spanish appliance manufacturing group, which employed 1,920 people, announced its bankruptcy and was placed under receivership in early 2014, before being divested and taken over by the Algerian conglomerate Cevital Group.http://www.euromonitor.com/consumer- appliances-in- france/reporthttp://www.liberation.fr/economie/2013/11/06/fagorbrandt-journee- cruciale-pour-les-salaries-avec-la-reunion-du-cce_944945 Later Fagor Electrodom√©sticos officially announced its bankruptcy as well and has been taken over by Spanish appliance manufacturer CATA Electrodom√©sticos (CNA Group) in autumn 2014, adding 155 new jobs.\\"Catalan company Cata buys bankrupt domestic appliance business Fagor \\", published 29 July 2014.\\"CNA Group announces the acquisition of the production units of Fagor\\" , published 5th of November 2014.

One of the factors in the fall of Fagor has been the human resources policy. Relatives of workers were given preference. The new workers did not acquire the cooperative mindset and were submitted to Taylorist methods. The disengagement led to absenteeism beyond the usual in Spanish private companies, and unusually higher among the younger workers. This was paradoxical for a worker-owned company. A reverse dominance hierarchy formed and decisions like offshoring production to the cheaper wage workers were not taken by worker-owners.  Structure and global business Mondragon Corporation comprises, 122 industrial companies, 6 financial organizations, 14 retailers, 4 research centers, 1 university, 14 insurance companies, and international trade services. It has a assets of 24.72b Euro (2014), a revenue of 12.1b Euro (2015), and a workforce of 69,000. The corporation is divided into three main divisions: finance, retail, and industrial. Major international expansion has increased Fagor's workforce to 6,074. It has factories in Europe, America, and Africa. It also has 13 worldwide subsidiaries and sales networks in 80 countries in 5 continents. The purchase of the Brandt Group in 2005 made Fagor one of the largest appliance manufacturers in Europe.

It is just seven miles (eleven kilometers) long, and has a drainage basin of five square miles (thirteen square kilometers), joining Kings Bay to the Gulf of Mexico. The river's significance is in the thirty natural springs that add an average of 300 million gallons (1,135 million liters) of warm water to the river every day. These springs include Three Sisters Springs. The warm water in the river attracts large numbers of manatees, and Kings Bay, at the head of the river and the location of 28 of the springs, harbors approximately 350 manatees during the winter. Some biologists consider Crystal River to be the most important refuge for manatees in the United States. In the first half of the 19th century Crystal River was known as Weewahiiaca (), believed to be from the Creek language words wewa, meaning \\"water\\", and haiyayaka, meaning \\"clear\\". The city of Crystal River is located on the river. The Crystal River Energy Complex, which consists of four coal-burning power plants and the Crystal River 3 Nuclear Generating Station, is located near the mouth of the river. The Crystal River Archaeological State Park is located on the river. Kings Bay Kings bay is Crystal River's headwater, or point of origin, and is fed by a number of springs that produce a constant temperature of 72 ¬∞F all year round. The 72¬∞ water attracts hundreds upon hundreds of manatees during the winter months looking to escape the cold water of the Gulf of Mexico. The springs in Kings Bay provide a habitat for 15 to 20 percent of the overall US manatee population. Problems in Crystal River Recent studies have shown the nitrate level of Crystal River and Kings Bay has been on the rise. Historical water quality data from the early 1900s show that nitrate concentrations were 20 times lower than they are now. The main source of the nitrogen and phosphorus is ground water discharge from area springs and the overuse of inorganic fertilizers. Lyngbya, a cyanobacteria, has been a problem in Kings Bay and Crystal River. It can be toxic to manatees, can cause many health issues in humans, and harmful to Crystal Rivers tourism. So far over 1,000 tons of Lyngbya have been removed with mechanical harvesters and raking. Removing Lyngbya mats does not help the regrowth of native grasses, and if you replant the native grasses it will most likely not succeed due to grazing of manatees. Introduced exotic aquatic plants have been an issue for Crystal River/Kings Bay since the 1960s. Hydrilla and Eurasion watermilfoil have been the main concern. The plants make it difficult for boaters to navigate by getting stuck in the propeller. Kings Bay Phyto-Remediation Demonstration Project A project has been underway in Kings Bay (Crystal River) since 2012 to use water hyacinth and water lettuce to improve the water quality and reduce algae growth. Even though water hyacinth is an exotic plant and has been a problem in the past, they have re-introduced them in PVC corrals where the hyacinth would filter out the toxins and kill off phytoplankton algae that are making the water green. The PVC corrals are necessary due to the fact that manatees love to graze on this aquatic plant. The Kings Bay Adaptive Management Group (KBAM) heads this project.  References  * Henry, Tom. 1990.

Bob 'Bobaloo' Lewis, who would later gain fame as one of the ‚ÄúAll Americans‚Äù on 77 WABC Radio in New York City, was one of the original DJs on WBIC. WLIX (1967‚Äì1980s) In June 1967, the station was purchased by Long Island Broadcasting Corporation, owned by marketer, former Mutual Broadcasting System chairman and would-be politician Malcolm E. Smith Jr.. The call letters were changed to WLIX effective June 26, 1967. By the early 1970s, it broadcast an automated \\"beautiful music\\" format, and on Sunday mornings an Italian-American music program hosted by Joe Rotolo. Sometime in the mid-1970s, it changed to Christian programming, still as WLIX. In 1981, this station was featured on the NBC series Real People, which was a cross between a newsmagazine and what can now be called reality television. In 1983, it was permitted to broadcast after dark, at reduced power. WLUX (1990s) In the mid-1990s, it was WLUX with a pop standards format.

It was opened in stages from 1894 and opened up new journey opportunities for passengers and enabled the Caledonian Railway to access docks and industrial locations on the north bank of the River Clyde. An intensive and popular train service was operated, but the long tunnel sections with frequent steam trains were smoky and heartily disliked. The network paralleled the North British Railway routes in the area, and after nationalisation of the railways the line declined and was closed in stages from 1959 to 1964. In 1979 the central part of the route was reopened as an electrically operated passenger railway, the Argyle Line; this was greatly popular and enhanced connecting routes to west and east made this a valuable link through the city once more. The Argyle Line section is in heavy use today, but the other parts remain closed. History First main lines in Glasgow System map of the Glasgow Central Railway In 1845 the Caledonian Railway was authorised to build its line from Glasgow and Edinburgh to Carlisle. This was a main line railway, with no thought of local travel within the cities. By acquiring interests in other lines, the Caledonian soon had three terminal stations in Glasgow: Buchanan Street, South Side, and Bridge Street. None of these was very convenient to the city centre for passengers, and goods to and from shipping on the River Clyde was carted through the streets. The Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway (E&GR;) terminated at Queen Street, a cramped terminal convenient for the city but with no access to the quays. The Caledonian set about getting access to the Clyde at Broomielaw by sponsoring the nominally independent General Terminus and Glasgow Harbour Railway which constructed berthing a short distance downstream from Glasgow Bridge on the south side, and built a railway to it from Gushetfaulds (Larkfield Junction). The construction was finished by December 1848 but it connected to the Clydesdale Junction Railway which was only completed the following year. The General Terminus represented considerable progress in bulk handling of minerals, but it was still limited in capacity, as the vessels had to lie alongside the bank, and the improvements to the navigation of the Clyde had not yet been completed. Nonetheless the General Terminus had an effective monopoly of rail-borne export of minerals for many years. At this period the rapid industrialisation of Glasgow led to an influx of workers into the city centre: Glasgow became \\"the second city of the British Empire\\"W A C Smith and Paul Anderson, An Illustrated History of Glasgow's Railways, Irwell Press, Caernarfon, 1993, and the more affluent moved to suburbs: Charing Cross, Hillhead and the Botanic Gardens area. There was still no recognisable suburban railway. In 1858 the Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway (GD&HR;) opened its line from the E&GR; at Cowlairs, on the north-east of Glasgow, looping round to the north and running north of the Clyde to Dumbarton and on to Helensburgh. The circuit round the north of Glasgow was a roundabout route but it succeeded in connecting DunbartonshireAt the time the common spelling was Dumbartonshire and some railways used that spelling in their titles. into the railway network. The company was absorbed by the E&GR; in 1862 and the E&GR; was itself absorbed to form the North British Railway in 1865. Accordingly, the Caledonian was losing out to a bitter competitor.John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, In 1870 the City of Glasgow Union Railway bridged the Clyde and the so-called \\"bus trains\\", frequent services with closely spaced stops, were instituted. The City Union Line was a joint scheme between the NBR and the Glasgow and South Western Railway, another competitor. North Clyde developments From 1872 the Clyde Trustees undertook an ambitious project to build a large dock at Stobcross, on marshland on the north bank downstream. This became the Queen's Dock, and it opened in 1874.John Riddell, The Clyde, The Fairlie Press, Fairlie, 1988, The North British Railway built a connecting line to it, leaving the GD&HR; line at Maryhill and running south and then east. It took a wide circuit to reach Stobcross because of contours and housing development. This was the Stobcross Railway. Traffic started on 20 October 1870, and it formed an important goods artery for NBR. The Caledonian Railway were granted running powers to reach the dock from Sighthill, a long and difficult transit over NBR tracks, and the NBR placed every obstacle in the way of the Caledonian. Next the NBR sponsored another nominally independent company, the Glasgow, Yoker and Clydebank Railway, which left the GD&HR; line near Jordanhill and ran to industrial locations, especially shipyards, on the Clyde. It opened in 1882. Finally the Glasgow City and District Railway was promoted, also by the NBR, to build a through east to west sub-surface line connecting the Coatbridge line and the Dumbarton line. It opened in 1886 and although expensive to construct, it was an immediate success. The North British Railway now had a decent suburban network in Glasgow and on the North bank of the Clyde, and the Caledonian had almost nothing. The Glasgow Central Railway The Caledonian clearly had to do something, and an independent engineer, Charles Forman, proposed a solution: a Glasgow Central Railway should be built on an east-west axis, connecting Maryhill in the north west of the city with Dalmarnock, on a short branch from Rutherglen on the main line, in the south east. It would run through the city centre south of the NBR line and have station facilities at the Caledonian's Glasgow Central terminal, as well as giving direct access to Stobcross and the Queen's Dock, still an important dock area. The Caledonian thought this was a good idea, and encouraged the development of the scheme. At this time the line that became the Liverpool Overhead Railway was being designed. The solution of building an urban railway over the streets in the central area seemed attractive and relatively cheap, and on that basis the Glasgow Central Railway obtained Parliamentary authorisation on 10 August 1888.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959David Ross, The Caledonian: Scotland's Imperial Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, Business interests and public opinion in Glasgow only now realised what was being proposed, and a considerable outcry; so vehement was it that the Caledonian reconsidered, and a further Act was sought and obtained the following year, altering the plan to a sub-surface line like the NBR line. Getting the Act was one thing, but the detailed engineering of a sub-surface railway through the centre of the city, with large buildings that could not be disturbed, was daunting. The Caledonian decided to take the work into its own hands, still employing the engineering firm that conceived the scheme, and the Company was absorbed on 31 May 1890. No physical work had started at that time. Notwithstanding the difficulties, the idea of the line was so attractive that a branch was proposed, running from Bridgeton Cross via Tollcross to Carmyle (on the Caledonian's Rutherglen and Coatbridge line and on to Newton on the main line. This extension, often informally referred to as the Tollcross line, was authorised by Act of Parliament on 25 July 1890. The first sod was cut on 11 June 1890 by Master J. B. Montgomerie Fleming, son of J. B. Fleming of Kelvinside. Construction was prodigiously difficult: five out of seven miles were underground; and the city authorities were now alerted to the need to demand proper respect for the aesthetics of the city streets, and they paid close attention to the plans and practices of the Company. The new Botanic Gardens was of especial architectural interest as a result. The Caledonian issued ¬£950,000 of special stock to fund the construction. Opening Finally construction was entering the final stages. The section from Maryhill to Stobcross opened to mineral traffic (to Queens Dock) on 26 November 1894. (The Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire opened from Maryhill to Balornock Junction on the same day.) Passenger trains started to run from Rutherglen to Glasgow Cross on 1 November 1895, and the entire line opened to all traffic on 10 August 1896. 130 trains passed through the line each way. Central Station had two island platforms, and four through tracks. The Tollcross section opened throughout on 1 February 1897. Goods traffic was hugely important at the time, and was considerably simplified: instead of using running powers over the NBR from Sighthill to Stobcross, the trains could now run through the Central line, or alternatively via the Possil line of the L&DR.; Early electrification proposals Except at the extremities, the line ran through continuous tunnels and was operated by steam trains. (Some locomotives were fitted with condensing equipment.) 130 passenger trains ran each way daily, and heavy mineral traffic to Stobcross used the route. The ventilation and lighting of the subsurface stations were poor, and the environment attracted much criticism. At this time technical development suggested that electric traction might be feasible. The Central London Railway was being constructed on that system (it opened in 1900) and of course street tramcars had been using electricity, not without problems at first. The Caledonian decided to electrify the line, and electrification of the Glasgow Central Railway, the Tollcross line, and other railways was authorised by Parliament on 2 August 1898. As well as the immaturity of the technology there were some practical problems, chiefly the heavy mineral traffic which would have required an engine change on approaching the line and again at Stobcross. Having secured the powers, the Caledonian did not proceed with the idea, and the powers lapsed.Jim Summers, Signalling the Caledonian, Lightmoor Press, Lydney, 2014, Connections at the west end The eastern end of the proposed railway fed into the Caledonian network towards Hamilton, Motherwell and Coatbridge. At the western end, it fed to the Queen's Dock at Stobcross, and to the important suburb at Maryhill, and also to nearby Dawsholm. Dawsholm was almost entirely industrial; for many years there had been an important textile printing works thereAlexander Thomson, Random Notes and Rambling Recollections of Drydock, the Dock, Or Kelvindock, All Now Known by the More Modern Name of Maryhill, 1750-1894, Kerr & Richardson, Maryhill, 1895 and a large Corporation gasworks had been established there in 1871 and much extended later.Canmore, Glasgow, Skaethorn Road, Dawsholm Gasworks, web page at http://canmore.org.uk/site/44130/glasgow-skaethorn-road-dawsholm- gasworks, the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland Much supplementary industry, including a chemical works, was being established there. Dawsholm only lasted until 1908 as a passenger station, but it developed in its industrial significance, and the Caledonian built a six- road engine shed there which serviced most of the Central Railway's traction needs. Concurrently with the construction of the Glasgow Central Railway, the Caledonian was encouraging the promotion and building of the Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Railway. (The Company used the spelling Dumbartonshire, although later usage for the county adopted a spelling with the letter \\"n\\".) This was to link Balloch and Dumbarton with the north shore of the River Clyde to the Central line. The connection was at Stobcross, and also to a new through station at Maryhill continuing on to Possil and a junction at Balornock on the Caledonian main line from Buchanan Street. The route taken by the L&DR; incorporated a large area of newly established heavy industry on North Clydeside and served rapidly developing residential areas. The Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire line opened progressively in the years 1894 to 1896, and with the Central line was operated as an integral part of the Caledonian Railway: at last the Caledonian had secured a suburban network in the north and west of Glasgow. Post-war decline From the outset, the Central Railway was found to be unattractive for passengers; the smoky atmosphere, and the dirty condition of the station and the trains were constantly commented upon. Street tramcars by contrast were frequent, clean, and had stops close to city destinations that the railway could not always match. The railways were nationalised in 1948, and the duplication of lines for passengers and goods was a disadvantage, now that competition was irrelevant. Some individual stations had already been closed. The line was closed to passengers between Maryhill and Stobcross on 2 November 1959, although goods and mineral traffic continued from the Possil line via Maryhill to the Queen's Dock until 14 August 1960; after that date a service to Kelvinbridge continued until 6 July 1964. The NBR route to Helensburgh was selected for modernisation, and the route was electrified in 1960, causing a revolution in passenger convenience. This only exaggerated the negative perception of the Central Railway, and on 5 October 1964 the Central Railway network was closed to passenger traffic. The Possil line lost its goods traffic as well, as it simply paralleled the NBR route. A short section serving Tollcross from Carmyle was the only remnant, for goods trains, lasting until 4 April 1966. Argyle Line For some years, therefore, the line lay unused. Then in the 1970s the Glasgow political mood shifted in favour of rail transport. The Greater Glasgow Passenger Transport Authority decided to fund reopening of part of the Central Railway, as a passenger link line from a junction near Partick on the NBR electric line to Rutherglen. Financial authority was given in 1974, and on 1 November 1979 the new Argyle Line, as it was named, was officially opened. Public services started on 5 November 1979. The diverging junction at Partick leading to the Argyle Line was made a grade- separated junction: eastbound trains dived under the NBR line and converged with the westbound line at Stobcross, renamed Finnieston (and later renamed Exhibition Centre.) A new station was provided at Argyle Street; the platforms are below the centre of the street, and at the time it had not been pedestrianised. Accordingly, the access from the island platform descends to cross under the track, before rising to a street level building at the side of the street. The Argyle line was a considerable success, and trains ran through from the Hamilton Circle and from Lanark, although the Lanark train was re- diverted to its previous route from Rutherglen to Glasgow Central high level station in 2013. There is a frequency of typically eight trains an hour through the line each way, operated by Abellio ScotRail. Signalling The signalling in the long and difficult tunnel section was conventional, using the Tyers Lock and Block system, but the signals themselves had no semaphore arms; instead they had a rising spectacle plate that exhibited the usual night time oil lamp colours to drivers. This subjected the Caledonian and its successor railway to criticism, as the smoky tunnel conditions, coupled with commonplace bunker-first running, led to difficulty for drivers. The intensive train service and the occasional failure of the lock and block system seems to have encouraged signalmen to adopt irregular practices to deal with the failures. The purpose of the lock and block system is to prevent signalmen from accepting a train until a preceding train has passed and the signals restored to danger. Collisions resulted from the irregular practice when a train failed in section and signalmen assumed that it had in fact had passed unnoticed, and irregularly released the system. A remarkable innovation with a form of power signalling was installed at Stobcross. The station was in a very cramped site already heavily built up. At the east end, where the line emerged from the tunnel section, there was a sharp curve and a signal box had to be located there: \\"Stobcross East\\". At the location where the signal box had to be located to allow the signalman to observe the passage and location of trains, there was inadequate space for a conventional box. The solution adopted was to build a master-and-slave system: a manned signal box was placed where visibility of trains was convenient, and a dependent box with full interlocking was placed in a convenient space, but where visibility was poor. The latter box was normally unstaffed, and it was operated by hydraulic power from the staffed box, which contained the block instruments. The innovation was not a success, and in 1909 it was replaced by a conventional signalbox arrangement. Some of the signals in the tunnel section were disc signals and some semaphore signals at stations between the tunnels had foreshortened arms. In 1956 modern colour light signalling was installed on the line, controlled from Stobcross and Bridgeton, with track circuit control intermediately. This enabled the closure of boxes at Dalmarnock, Glasgow Green, Glasgow Cross, Glasgow Central, Anderston Cross and Partick Central No.2. Each signal had an electric detonator placer.Railway Magazine September 1957 pp. 609-612 Accidents The special conditions of intensive working in the tunnel sections made the task difficult. Signalmen and drivers were under pressure to work the heavy train service efficiently, in the most challenging of conditions. To avoid stopping passenger trains in tunnel sections, a relaxation of the rules was in force permitting the clearance of the home signal (protecting entry to a station area) without bringing the train quite or nearly to a stand. The consequence of this was that drivers rarely encountered any home signal at danger, and some were accustomed to fail to look out for it. Many of the signals were of miniature arm or disc type, and the tunnel signals were oil lamps of inconsistent performance. Bunker-first or tender first running and the smoky tunnel conditions made signal spotting difficult. Out of sequence running and the heavy running of special goods and excursion trains added to the signalmen's load. A rear-end collision took place near Anderston Cross in 1900. A signalman irregularly used a cancelling key, which negated the controls of the lock-and-block system, and he allowed a second train into the section.Board of Trade, Accident Returns: Extract for the Accident at Anderston Cross on 25th August 1900, 1900 In 1939 a side- swiping collision took place at Stobcross. Two trains had been simultaneously accepted up to the converging junction from the west; this was improper as there was no overlap available. One of the trains overran the home signal which was at danger.Ministry of Transport, Report on the Accident at Stobcross West Junction on 22nd February 1939, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1939 In 1949 a rear-end collision took place at Glasgow Cross; a passenger train driven by an experienced driver ran through several stop signals standing at danger; low standards of attention to signalling equipment maintenance were exposed, and it was clear that drivers were used to running through the line without being able to see many of the signals.Ministry of Transport, Report on the Accident which occurred on 31st January 1949, at Glasgow Cross in the Scottish Region British Railways, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1949 In 1951 a rear-end collision took place at Stobcross; a signalman worked the block instruments irregularly, and there were two wrong-side defects in the lock and block system that enabled this.Ministry of Transport, Report on the Collision which occurred on 9th June 1951 at Stobcross in the Scottish Region British Railways, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1951 In 1952 a rear-end collision took place at Bridgeton Cross; a train stalled in the section and a signalman thought the train had passed and that the Lock-and-Block apparatus had failed; he improperly released the lock and signalled a following train through.Ministry of Transport, Report on the Collision which occurred on 18th August 1952 between Dalmarnock and Bridgeton Cross in the Scottish Region British Railways, 1952, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1953 Topography Original line For much of its route the line was in a shallow cut-and- cover tunnel, and gradients were imposed by the road levels.

Wamphray is the name of the surrounding parish and of the Wamphray Water, which flows south-west through the Wamphray Glen to join the River Annan near the small village, or hamlet, of Newton. History The village is near the A74(M) motorway, near Annandale Water, roughly halfway between Moffat and Lockerbie, and has for centuries been close to the direct Glasgow to Carlisle route, which around 1776 was made into a turnpike road suitable for mail coaches travelling between England and Glasgow. Newton is on the main railway line south from Glasgow, and from about 1847 had its own station called Wamphray, but this closed in the 1960s. Newton Wamphray primary school has been closed for several years, local children generally go to primary school in Lockerbie. The old school building now lies largely abandoned while the nature of its ownership is investigated. The old manse near the 1834 church has become a hotel; the historic church has been used for regular services over the past few years. There are various historic and pre-historic sites near Newton Wamphray, including standing stones and the remains of a motte-and-bailey. A feud between local reiving families in the 16th century is remembered in the ballad, The Lads of Wamphray. One of the more prominent local residents was John Brown of Wamphray, or \\"John Broun of Wamfrey\\", a Church of Scotland theologian who served as the minister of the local parish during the mid-17th century. He removed to Wamphray to begin serving the parish at an unknown date (estimates vary from 1637 until 1655) and remained in residence until 1662, when he was imprisoned and later exiled to the Netherlands for his public opposition to the royal imposition of bishops on the Church.Dictionary of Scottish Church History and Theology. Nigel M. de S. Cameron, organizing ed. Downers Grove: InterVarsity P, 1993, 98. Before the 20th century the village was sometimes called Newton, or Newtoun, of Wamphray, and described as being in Annandale. Newton suggests \\"new village or farmstead\\", a placename derived from Old English niwe (new) + tun (farm). Scots toun meant a farm settlement before it came to mean a 'town'. The etymology of Wamphray is uncertain; some suggestions link 'Wam' to Gaelic Uamh (cave). Older spellings include Wamfry or Wamfray.

According to Paul the Deacon's Historia Langobardorum, he was raised among the Lombards, with whom he entered the Italian peninsula in 569. He eventually joined the Byzantine army to fight against them, becoming an important ally of both Emperor and Pope. After Faroald, the Lombard duke of Spoleto, captured Classis, the port of Ravenna, Droctulf recaptured it for the Empire in 575‚Äì76. He was briefly imprisoned (Paul refers to a captivitas), but was released to the Empire and served as the commander (dux, duke) of the Byzantine post of Brescello (Reggio nell'Emilia), which guarded a bridge over the river Po leading to Classis, from around 584. Between 584 and 590, he warred extensively against Authari, king of the Lombards, who eventually forced him to retreat to Ravenna while the region of Brescello was taken by the Lombards and the walls of the city razed to the ground. After his failure in Italy, Droctulf was called to the Balkans and Thrace to fend off the army of Slavs and Avars then besieging Adrianople (586).

It is now a Scheduled Monument and a 7.8 hectare biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. It formed a boundary of the late Anglo- Saxon, pre-Norman administrative division of Flendish Hundred. History The dyke is a seven-metre-high linear bank and ditch which ran from Fulbourn to Balsham. Most of it survives and is now a footpath. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Anglo-Saxon weapons and burials were found, and the dyke was thought to have been built in the seventh century as a defence of the Kingdom of East Anglia in its wars with Mercia. An excavation in 1991 established that it had been built in several phases, the first between 330 and 510, and the last between 450 and 620. It is now believed most likely to have been built by early Anglo-Saxon settlers in the fifth century as a defence against Romano-British attempts to recover their territory. At Mutlow Hill the dyke runs through a Bronze Age barrow, which was reused in the Roman period as a temple.  Construction  Fleam Dyke is one of four substantial earthworks, each a high bank with a ditch on its southwest side, running across the chalk downland ridge that carries the Icknield Way (and the Roman road Street Way) across south Cambridgeshire. The others are Devil's Dyke, Brent Ditch and Bran Ditch. Icknield Way was of huge historical importance. It is certainly a pre-Roman path often claimed as the oldest in England and was later named one of the \\"Four Highways\\" of medieval England on which travellers had royal protection. To that extent, Fleam Dyke, Flendish Hundred and Fulbourn have their place in history. Ecology Fleam Dyke is one of 286 sites selected by Charles Rothschild in 1912 to 1915 as wildlife sites \\"worthy of preservation\\" in Britain and Ireland. The steep banks of the earthwork have species-rich chalk grassland, a rare habitat in the county. The dyke, which is maintained by grass cutting, is the only Cambridgeshire site for the common juniper. The Harcamlow Way long distance footpath runs through the site.

They mix the rich Belgian brass band (HaFaBra) tradition with characteristic topsy-turvy creativity. Biography Their earliest gig took place in 1997, when they performed a composition by Peter Vermeersch to accompany a circus act by De Circusplaneet during the Oorsmeer festival. They also performed on the song Porqu√© te Vas by A Group, Peter Vermeersch' avant- garde pop band. Wider attention came thanks to the Flemish radio station Radio 1, where they performed on the show Levende Lijven. The entire gig was recorded and later released under the title Live at the Beursschouwburg 1999, containing compositions by Peter Vermeersch and covers of jazz numbers. Unfortunately the Viakra label that released this CD went bankrupt, preventing a wide distribution. This prompted Peter Vermeersch to found his own record company, Zonk!Records. The year 2000 was a busy one, with a Belgian tour, a new appearance in the last broadcast of the Levende Lijven radio show, and the first release on Zonk!Records: Bonk. The track list contains new and old compositions by Vermeersch and other members of the big band, but ends with two covers of songs by The Residents. FES also played in the theatre play Larf by Josse De Pauw, the music of this performance being released the same year. Meanwhile Peter Vermeersch also composed the music for Minoes, a children's movie by Dutch film director Vincent Bal on a story by Annie M.G. Schmidt (released in 2001). In 2002, the Flat Earth Society was the house band of the Brugge2002 festival, where they participated in the Benenwerk project, turning the centre of the city of Bruges into a large ballroom. Trap became the second regular studio recording, and in August the Flat Earth Society premiered their Louis Armstrong project The Armstrong Mutations at the last night of the free Brussels festival Boterhammen in de Stad. A tour and a CD release followed in 2003. Meanwhile Peter Vermeersch was also commissioned by Gerard Mortier to write a big band opera on the libretto Heliogabal by Thomas Jonigk, with stage directions by Roy Faudr√©. The opera premiered on May 8, 2003 in Duisburg during the Ruhr Triennale festival. In 2005, the opera toured Belgium in a new setting provided by Josse De Pauw. In 2003 Peter had met with jazz composer and pianist Uri Caine, and the two decided to work together. Old compositions were re-orchestrated and new pieces were written. FES toured with Uri Caine in 2004. International success was now assured, and FES was able to sign distribution deals with Ipecac, who released the compilation FESisms, and later with Crammed Discs who released Psychoscout in 2006 and Cheer Me, Perverts! in 2009. In May 2011 they toured the USA for the first time in their career. Starting in Tampa, they went from Washington and Philadelphia to New York, where they performed at the Lincoln Center and the Museum of the Moving Image.

The film deals openly, and sometimes graphically, with zoophilia. It features both real and simulated animal killings and coprophagia, and has been labeled obscene by many sources, notably by the OFLC of Australia. The film was banned in Australia by the Australian Classification Board in the mid 1970s with two failed attempts, according to the Australian Classification Board. The film went before the Australian Classification Board on 1 April 1977, and was banned again for the third time. The ban status on the film in Australia has remained largely unchanged since then, due to in part that the film violates Australian obscenity laws. Plot The film follows a man, who has an intellectual or mental disorder, living alone on a farm in rural Belgium. He demonstrates bizarre behavior from the beginning, such as fastening doll's heads to pigeons, collecting his feces in glass jars and beheading a hen for his own amusement. He is also obsessed with a sow who lives on the farm. We see him gleefully rolling around in the manure with the sow, and then he rapes her, which his behavior suggests he sees as an intimate and mutually agreeable act. Later, the sow gives birth to a litter of piglets. The man attempts to spoon-feed milk to the piglets, but the piglets prefer to drink directly from the milk bowl. In general, the piglets prefer their mother's company, repeatedly scorning the man's advances. Taking this rejection as an unforgivable personal slight, the man hangs the piglets and leaves their bodies strung up in the open. When the sow discovers the remains of the piglets, she runs madly around the farm squealing. The sow slips into a deep patch in the mud and drowns there. The man searches for the sow, and becomes visibly distraught when he discovers her dead. He drags the body from the mud, buries it on the farm grounds, and crudely attempts to bury himself on a patch of ground nearby. He gets up, and his grief turns to rage. He rushes around the farm scattering and smashing his belongings from the house, including his jars of waste. He prepares and vigorously consumes a \\"tea\\" made of feces and urine, determinedly climbs a ladder in the barn and hangs himself with a rope. In the final scene is his spirit floating skyward. Cast * Dominique Garny as man Distribution Better known by the English title Wedding Trough, the film has never had an official theater release, but has been shown in film festivals around the world, notably at the Perth International Film Festival in 1975, with the screening upsetting Australian censors. Because there was no official theatrical, VHS, or until recently DVD release, Wedding Trough is one of the most obscure movies that is not a lost film. Its last film festival appearance was at the 61st Locarno International Film Festival in \\"Tribute to the Royal Belgian Cin√©math√®que / Experimental film Competitions of Knokke le Zoute\\". German video distributor Camera Obscura and Swedish distributor Njuta Films each released the film on DVD. Censorship in Australia In Australia, the Perth International Film Festival scheduled a screening of Vase de Noces in 1975. At the time, film festival submissions did not require approval from Australian censors, however the Western Australian government pressured censors to review the film before the screening. The censors did so, and subsequently refused to classify the film on grounds of obscenity. Festival chairman David Roe and director Thierry Z√©no appealed to the censors to reconsider. Their appeal was successful, and the film was shown in the festival after all. The Western Australian Government was not happy that the festival went ahead with the screening, and this incident created a precedent for animosity between the two groups for years to come.Solo f√ºr Licht ‚Äì Vase de noces. The government of Western Australian urged the Perth Film Festival to discontinue their plans to screen Nagisa Oshima's In the Realm of the Senses, threatening that future festivals would be subject to thorough censorial review in advance, if they went ahead with the screening. As a result of this pressure, the Perth Film Festival decided not to screen Oshima's film. Film festivals in Melbourne and Sydney went on to screen In the Realm of the Senses without incident. On 17 December 1976, Vase de Noces went before the Australian censors again, and again received a judgment of \\"refused classification\\". A third such attempt was made a third time on 1 April 1977. But, the Australian censors rejected the film once again, effectively banning its reproduction and dissemination throughout Australia. The film remains banned throughout Australia to this day, and even after more than 40 years of being banned nationwide in the country, this ruling has not been successfully appealed since.

Hawthorne originally planned a lengthy work about Brand, but completed only this piece. Hawthorne's inspiration was a lime kiln he saw burning while climbing Mount Greylock. Plot A lime-burner named Bartram and his son hear a disturbing roar of laughter echo through the twilight in the hills. Soon thereafter, Ethan Brand arrives at the lime kiln and is questioned by Bartram. Brand says that he used to keep the very same kiln before he went off in search of the \\"unpardonable sin\\", which he claims to have found. When asked what the unpardonable sin is, Brand replies, ‚ÄúIt is a sin that grew within my own breast. A sin that grew nowhere else! The sin of an intellect that triumphed over the sense of brotherhood with man and reverence for God, and sacrificed everything to its own mighty claims! The only sin that deserves a recompense of immortal agony! Freely, were it to do again, would I incur the guilt. Unshrinkingly I accept the retribution!\\" Bartram doesn't understand, and mutters to himself that Brand is a mad man. A group of townspeople arrive at the scene to gawk at Brand. In the course of his interactions with them, Brand is disturbed by their coarse behavior and begins to doubt whether he really found the unpardonable sin. When the townspeople compare Brand to another so called \\"madman\\" named Humphrey, Brand recalls a victim of his search, Esther (Humphrey's daughter), who left the province to become a circus performer and who subsequently became the subject of Brand's psychological experiment. Brand remembers that the research, \\"wasted, absorbed, and perhaps annihilated her soul, in the process,\\" and so he is again convinced that he found the \\"unpardonable sin\\". The Wandering Jew, carrying a diorama on his back, joins the assembled near the kiln after dusk. The children of the town flock to the Jew to see his images. When Brand looks into the diorama, he sees something that disturbs him. He orders the Jew to get into the furnace or leave. A village dog chases his own tail. The villagers head home, and Brand is left with Bartram and his son. Brand offers to tend the fire overnight, so Batram and the boy go home. Brand decides that his \\"task is done, and well done,\\" and he climbs into the furnace to his death. Bartram and his son, after a night of fitful sleep and dreams full of maniacal laughter, awake to find the landscape populated by heavenly atmospheric phenomena. When they realize that Brand is gone, and that \\"the sky and the mountains all seem glad of it,\\" they look into the lime kiln and find Brand's skeleton, transformed into lime. Inside the rib cage is a chunk of lime in the shape of a human heart. Bartram pokes the fragile artifacts and they crumble to dust. Composition and publication history Mount Greylock, 2007 In the summer of 1838, Hawthorne had visited North Adams, Massachusetts and climbed Mount Greylock several times. His experiences here, especially a walk he took at midnight where he saw a burning lime kiln, inspired this story, originally titled \\"The Unpardonable Sin\\".Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 54. Hawthorne had not written tales since 1844 when he wrote \\"Ethan Brand\\" in the winter of 1848‚Äì1849.Miller, Edwin Haviland. Salem is my Dwelling Place: A Life of Nathaniel Hawthorne. Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1991: 263. He admitted he had difficulty writing it. He wrote: Hawthorne had planned a lengthy tale about Brand's life and his travels in search of the \\"Unpardonable Sin\\" but published only this, most of which would have formed the climactic chapter.

MCX Raptor, an underbone from the Philippines. Honda Winner, an underbone with 150 cc engine displacement. An underbone is a type of motorcycle that uses structural tube framing with an overlay of plastic or non-structural body panels and contrasts with monocoque or unibody designs where pressed steel serves both as the vehicle's structure and bodywork. Outside Asia, the term underbone is commonly misunderstood to refer to any lightweight motorcycle that uses the construction type, known colloquially as step-throughs, mopeds or scooters. An underbone motorcycle may share its fuel tank position and tube framing, along with fitted bodywork and splash guards with a scooter while the wheel dimensions, engine layouts, and power transmission are similar with conventional motorcycles. Unlike motor scooters, underbones are mostly popular in Asia, particularly in Southeast Asia, Middle East, Taiwan, China and North Korea, in Latin America, as well as in some parts of Eastern Europe, Greece and Russia. In Indonesia, the fourth most populous country in the world, and the largest country in SE Asia, almost half the population have a motorcycle (120 million in 2018, compared to 16 million carsIndonesian: Growth of Motorized Vehicles According to Types, 1949-2018, Indonesian Statistics Bureau.). Design The appearance and frame of an underbone are quite different from that of a standard motorcycle, but the powertrain is functionally almost identical. The underbone engine is positioned between the rider's feet but the rear wheel is driven by a regular motorcycle secondary chain drive. Styling considerations only mean that the chain-driven nature of the machine tends to be concealed under sheet-metal covers to a greater extent than that of motorcycles. Plastic panels and covers are widely used on modern underbones, such as a Suzuki FX125 A Suzuki FX125 with covers removed An early underbone design: the Honda Super Cub, the most produced motor vehicle ever. In only one significant respect does the underbone differ from the conventional motorcycle - there is no frame member or fuel tank between the seat base and the headstock. Generally, the fuel tank is located under the seat. The underbone arrangement improves the ease of mounting and dismounting and contributes to the cross-gender appeal of the layout as an around-town shopping and commuter vehicle. The engine displacement of a typical underbone motorcycle is generally between 50 cc and up to about 150 cc, though much larger ones are available. Currently, production underbone model with the largest engine displacement is the SYM VF3i, which is powered by a fuel-injected 183 cc SOHC 4-valve water-cooled engine. Historically, underbones led the way in semi-automatic transmissions and indicator systems. In other respects, the technical sophistication of underbones tended to lag those of larger motorcycles, but nowadays they are increasingly equipped with similar electronic ignition, fuel injection, etc. Underbones may have spoked or alloy wheels which are spindle mounted and usually sized to fit small conventional motorcycles frames. These provide much better road-holding and braking than scooters, though it does make repairs (such as punctures) more difficult to repair. Underbones generally features a three- to six-speed sequential gearbox, either with an automatic clutch, usually a centrifugal clutch, or a conventional manual hand-lever clutch. Depending on whether the motorcycle has a manual hand-lever clutch or an automatic centrifugal clutch, will determine whether the motorcycle transmission uses a semi-automatic transmission (automatic clutch) or a manual transmission. It is then coupled to sprocket and chain drive to transmit power to the rear wheel. There are some exceptions to this, such as the Yamaha Nouvo, the Piaggio Liberty, and the Yamaha Lexam. Although the similar design of an underbone motorcycle, it has a CVT transmission and therefore has no gears for the rider to select and may be considered as scooters. Origins The Heinkel Perle was introduced in 1954, four years before the Honda Super Cub The underbone concept can be seen in some of the European mopeds of the early 1950s, including the NSU Quickly and the Heinkel Perle. The spine- framed, plastic-faired Honda Super Cub is the most produced motor vehicle of all time. Production of the Super Cub began in 1958, surpassing 60 million units in April 2008, and continuing to be made in several countries around the world .Honda Press Release 21 May 2008 Cumulative Global Production of Cub Series Motorcycles Reaches 60 Million Units. Other names and derivations In Malaysia and Singapore this vehicle is commonly known as Kapcai or Kapchai, a slang word derived from Cantonese, being a combination of the word \\"Cub\\" from the word Honda Cub and \\"‰ªî\\" in Chinese. In Cantonese, \\"‰ªî\\" (pronounced \\"jai\\", or in pinyin \\"zai\\") means \\"little\\" (or its derivatives, e.g. \\"small\\", \\"mini\\", etc.). Therefore,\\"kapchai\\" literally means a \\"Little Cub\\". With Honda being a very popular brand in Malaysia, all underbone motorbikes have come to be called \\"kapchai\\". In Indonesia, it is called \\"motor bebek\\" (literally means \\"duck bike\\"). In Greece is known as Papi or Papaki, a slang that also means duck. A variation on the underbone concept known as the \\"maxi-scooter\\" or \\"touring scooter\\" is popular in the West. These are much larger than the underbones known to the Asian market and vary in size from the early Honda Helix with 250 cc to the 850 cc Gilera GP800. Many current versions are between 400 cc and 650 cc, including the Honda Silver Wing with 582 cc, the Suzuki Burgman with 400 cc or 638 cc, the Yamaha Majesty 400 with 395 cc, and the Yamaha T-Max 500 with 499 cc. Underbones of conventional size are popular in Western Europe and marketed alongside conventional scooters. They are sometimes referred to as scooters, despite the design difference between underbones and conventional scooters. Storage  Yamaha Nouvo's helmet storage compartment. Underbone motorcycles often come with storage, and this may vary between markets. In Southeast Asia, there is commonly a steel basket provided as there is none under the seat, as this is the placement of the fuel tank. Some underbones have a lockable storage compartment under the seat. Some have a hook in the area between the rider's knees for a shopping bag. Another storage capacity may be provided in a top box, detachable in some cases. Manufacturers The market for underbone motorcycles is dominated by Japanese manufacturers, though many of them are built-in factories elsewhere, including China and Taiwan. In other cases, manufacturers have violated copyright and illegally copied the models of Japanese manufacturers. The Honda Cub, Honda Wave series, and Yamaha Lagenda series are amongst the most copied. MZ Motorrad currently produces underbone models in Malaysia by their main shareholder, Hong Leong Group which is also the sole distributor of Yamaha motorcycle in Malaysia and Singapore. Mforce Bikes Holdings Sdn Bhd also producing underbone motorcycle under Benelli Motorcycle. The major underbone manufacturers are as follows: * China: Haojue, Zongshen, Lifan. * Malaysia: Modenas, Momos Motor (rebadge of Cagiva), Naza Bikers (rebadge of Zongshen), Demak and Mforce Bikes Holdings. * Germany: MZ Motorrad * India: TVS Motors (underbone versions are available in Indonesia and the Philippines) * Indonesia: Kanzen, Binter rebadge of Kawasaki * Italy: Cagiva, Piaggio, Benelli * Japan: Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki, Kawasaki * Philippines: LuckyStar Motorcycles, MCX Motor (Phils.), Blaze Motortech, Sunriser, RUSI, * South Korea: Daelim Motor Company * Taiwan: Kymco, SYM Motors * Thailand: Tiger Motor Co. Ltd * Mexico: Italika Culture Underbones parked in Hanoi Underbones are very popular in Southeast Asia. There is a demand for aftermarket and tuner parts. Many enthusiasts modify their underbones either for a show (such as installing small sound systems, neon lights and custom paint jobs) or for performance (like increasing the engine power and fine- tuning the suspension). Riding gear may not even extend to wearing shoes and long pants for safety. Illegal underbone drag racing has become popular in countries such as the Philippines and Malaysia, and poses safety issues for the commuting public as well as the riders themselves, as underbones offer little protection in the event of crashes. The most popular underbone for these purposes is the Honda XRM, Suzuki Raider 150 and the Honda Wave, although similar models from Kawasaki and Yamaha are also frequently used. In Singapore and Malaysia, it is not uncommon to see old bicycles customized with parts found on an underbone motorcycle, a growing trend popular with the youth. Racing Underbone motorcycle racing are one of the most popular motorcycle racing class in Southeastern Asia region, which uses a modified version of road-legal, production-based underbone motorcycle available for purchase in public, mostly manufactured by Yamaha, Honda, and Suzuki. Underbone racing popularity is mostly influenced by their wide variety of racing classes, race track limitations, and fairly cheaper cost of parts and development compared to sport motorcycle classes. Underbone racing class may be further categorized into the engine cycle, engine displacement, engine layout, fuel delivery systems, allowable modifications and restrictions, time brackets (in drag racing), and the riders skill level. These categories are then regulated by the country's motorcycle racing governing body, from which national racing series may be organized. One of the most popular categories is the 150cc four-stroke fuel-injected class and may have engine power output ranging from 24 to 32 horsepower and can reach up to 180 km/h. Most of the motorcycle competing in this class are Yamaha T-150, Honda RS150R, and Suzuki Raider 150. Notable underbone road racing series in Southeast Asia countries are Malaysian Cub Prix and Indonesian Oneprix and MotoPrix Series. The highest level for underbone road racing class is held by Asia Road Racing Championship under UB150 class, from which only production underbone motorcycle with a maximum of 150cc engine displacement may compete in this class, hence the name. Only Yamaha and Honda motorcycles compete in this class with teams from various Asian countries. Underbone racing series in lower divisions on each country may also be organized to encourage new teams and riders to develop and prepare for national racing series. In Malaysia, the underbone racing series was created in partnership with the government of Malaysia's Ministry of Youth and Culture in 2012 to encourage youth to race in a controlled track environment rather than on the streets. It was designed to have a lower cost of entry than existing underbone series, such as the Malaysian Cub Prix.

It extends from the Mersey Valley in the north to the Shropshire Hills in the south, bounded by the hills of North Wales to the west and the foothills of the Pennines to the north-east. The Wirral Peninsula lies to the north-west whilst the plain merges with the South Lancashire Plain in the embayment occupied by Manchester to the north. In detail, the plain comprises two areas with distinct characters, the one to the west of the Mid Cheshire Ridge and the other, larger part, to its east. The plain is the surface expression of the Cheshire Basin, a deep sedimentary basin that extends north into Lancashire and south into Shropshire. It assumed its current form as the ice-sheets of the last glacial period melted away between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago leaving behind a thick cover of glacial till and extensive tracts of glacio-fluvial sand and gravel. The primary agricultural use of the Cheshire Plain is dairy farming, creating the general appearance of enclosed hedgerow fields. Meteorologists use the term Cheshire Gap when referring to the lowlands of the Cheshire Plain, providing as they do a passage between the Clwydian Hills, in Wales on the one hand and the Peak District and South Pennines on the other.

It is endemic to six of the Visayan Islands (Cebu, Negros, Panay, Masbate, Guimaras, and Siquijor) in the central Philippines. It is known by many names in the region (depending on the island and linguistic group) with most translating into 'wild pig': baboy ihalas ('wild pig' in Cebuano and Hiligaynon), baboy talonon ('forest pig' in Hiligaynon), and baboy sulop ('dark pig' in Cebuano) The Visayan warty pig is critically endangered due to habitat loss and hunting. It is believed to be extinct in four of the islands in its original native range, with only small surviving populations in Negros and Panay. Due to the small numbers of remaining Visayan warty pigs in the wild, little is known of their behaviors or characteristics outside of captivity. In 2012 the Negros Interior Biodiversity Expedition undertook camera trapping in the Northern Negros Natural Park and gained the first photos taken in the wild of the Visayan warty pig.  Distribution  A pair of Visayan Warty Pigs photographed at a wallow on the island of Negros in the Philippines. The Visayan warty pig is endemic to six islands in the Philippines: Cebu, Negros, Panay, Masbate, Guimaras, and Siquijor. However, only Negros and Panay have documented remaining populations of Visayan warty pigs. It is believed to be extinct in all the other islands, although there is a possibility of some surviving populations in Masbate. Subspecies The species includes the following subspecies: * Cebu warty pig (Sus cebifrons cebifrons) (believed to be extinct) * Negros warty pig (Sus cebifrons negrinus). There are two separate remaining populations of S. c. negrinus ‚Äì on the islands of Negros and Panay, respectively. Both populations have been physically and genetically isolated since the last ice age (c. 12,000 yrs).  Physical characteristics  227x227px The Visayan warty pig receives its name from the three pairs of fleshy \\"warts\\" present on the visage of the boar. Biologists speculate that the reason for the warts is to assist as a natural defense against the tusks of rival pigs during a fight. The boars also grow stiff spiky hair.  Behavior and diet  Visayan warty pigs tend to live in groups of four to six. The diet of the pig mainly consists of roots, tubers, and fruits that can be found in the forest. They may also eat cultivated crops. Since approximately 95% of their natural habitat has been cleared by local farmers who cut down the forest to plant crops, the propensity of the pigs to eat cultivated crops has risen dramatically. Because the land that is cleared for farming is often unproductive after a few years, the food sources of the Visayan warty pig are extremely limited, a factor that has contributed significantly to the pig's dwindling numbers. Visayan warty pigs were the first pig species ever to be recorded using tools for digging at a French zoo.  Reproduction  224x224px Visayan warty pig piglets are often seen during the dry season between the months of January and March in their native habitat of the western Visayan Islands. The mean number of piglets is three to four per litter. Conservation The biggest threat to the Visayan warty pig is habitat loss caused by commercial logging and slash-and-burn farming. In total, it is extinct in 98% of its original native range due to loss of forest cover. They are also hunted for food; and by farmers who see them as pests since they can damage crops when foraging. Visayan warty pigs are also vulnerable to genetic contamination, as they readily hybridize with feral domestic pigs. Breeding programs The current conservation program for S. c. negrinus includes successful breeding programs at the Rotterdam Zoo for pigs of Negros origin, and at the San Diego Zoo for pigs of Panay origin. Captive populations In addition to a few other conservation programs in the Philippines, the Crocolandia Foundation and the Negros Forests and Ecological Foundation both have this species in captivity. In Europe, 31 zoos ‚Äì Rotterdam Zoo, Planckendael Zoo, Poznan Zoo, Colchester Zoo, Chester Zoo, Belfast Zoo, Edinburgh Zoo, Blackbrook Zoological Park, Dƒõƒç√≠n Zoo, Ostrava Zoo, Newquay Zoo, Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens, and Parken Zoo in Eskilstuna, among others ‚Äì maintain the Negros Island variety of this species. Moreover, several zoos in the United States also maintain the species. The San Diego Zoo was the first zoo outside the Philippines to keep and breed Visayan warty pigs. Elsewhere in North America, zoos in Seattle, Los Angeles, Portland, Phoenix, Tucson, Miami, Tampa, Saint Louis, Attleboro, Melbourne, Gainesville, Jacksonville, Boise and Minnesota have also kept the species. The Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium have acquired the species and they went on-show to the public in June 2015. The Austin Zoo also exhibits this species.

Hagiography Everald Hanse was born in Northamptonshire and educated at Cambridge. He was soon presented to a good living. His brother William, who had become a priest in April 1579 tried to convert him, but in vain until a sharp attack of illness made him enter into himself. He then resigned his rich preferments, and went over to Reims in northern France (1580‚Äì1581). He was ordained 25 March 1581 and returned, but his ministry was very short. Monks of Ramsgate. ‚ÄúEverard Hanse‚Äù. Book of Saints, 1921. CatholicSaints.Info. 27 January 2013 In July he was visiting in disguise some Catholic prisoners in the Marshalsea, when the keeper noticed that his shoes were of a foreign make. He was closely examined, and his priesthood was discovered. As yet there was no law against priests, and to satisfy the hypocritical professions of the persecutors, it was necessary to find some treason of which he was guilty. He was asked in court at the Newgate Sessions, what he thought of the pope's authority, and on his admitting that he believed him \\"to have the same authority now as he had a hundred years before\\", he was further asked whether the pope had not erred (i.e. sinned) in declaring queen Elizabeth I excommunicated, to which he answered, \\"I hope not.\\" His words were at once written down as his indictment, and when he was further asked whether he wished others to believe as he did, he said \\"I would have all to believe the Catholic faith as I do.\\" A second count was then added that he desired to make others also traitors like himself. He was at once found guilty of \\"persuasion\\" which was high treason by Elizabeth. He was therefore in due course sentenced and executed at Tyburn on 31 July 1581.Pollen, John Hungerford. \\"Blessed Everald Hanse.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 7.

The martyr's last words were \\"O happy day!\\" and his constancy throughout \\"was a matter of great edification to the good\\".

He is noted for producing the most detailed ethnographic picture of the cultures of Native Americans in California to come out of the missionary period, an account that \\"...for his time and profession, is liberal and enlightened\\" (Kroeber).Kroeber, Alfred. 1959. p.282 Life Born at Llucmajor on the island of Mallorca, Spain in 1776. Boscana was educated at Palma and joined the Franciscan order in 1792. He traveled to Mexico in 1803 and to California in 1806. He served at Mission Nuestra Se√±ora de la Soledad (Soledad Mission), Mission La Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n (La Pur√≠sima Mission), Mission San Luis Rey de Francia (San Luis Rey Mission & Luise√±o 'Mission Indians'), and Mission San Gabriel Arc√°ngel (San Gabriel Mission & Gabrieli√±o‚ÄîTongva 'Mission Indians'). For more than a decade, from 1812‚Äì1826, he was stationed at Mission San Juan Capistrano. He died at Mission San Gabriel in 1831, and is the only missionary to be interred in its cemetery among over 2,000 other mission inhabitants, mainly Tongva-Gabrielino Indians, buried there. Ethnographic studies Boscana's first ethnographic contribution resulted from an 1812 questionnaire sent by the Spanish government to the missionaries of Alta California (Geiger).Geiger. 1976. The task of preparing a response on behalf of Mission San Juan Capistrano of the Juane√±o may have stimulated the missionary's latent interest in the native culture. While at San Juan Capistrano, Boscana composed two versions of a detailed ethnographic sketch of the Acagchemem (Juane√±o) Native Americans, who were primarily speakers of a dialect of the Luise√±o language but probably also included Tongva language (Gabrieli√±o) speakers from the north. One version of Boscana's manuscript, \\"Chinigchinich; a Historical Account of the Origin, Customs, and Traditions of the Indians at the Missionary Establishment of St. Juan Capistrano, Alta California Called The Acagchemem Nation,\\",Boscana, Ger√≥nimo. \\"Chinigchinich; a Historical Account of the Origin, Customs, and Traditions of the Indians at the Missionary Establishment of St. Juan Capistrano, Alta California Called The Acagchemem Nation.\\" online at: was translated by Alfred Robinson and published in 1846 as an appendix to his book \\"Life in California\\".Robinson, Alfred. 1846. Life in California . Wiley & Putnam, New York. Robinson was apparently responsible for giving the title \\"Chinigchinix (Chinigchinich)\\" to Boscana's work. An edition of this version with extensive annotations by the anthropologist and linguist John Peabody Harrington was published in 1933. The following year, Harrington published a translation of another, variant version of Boscana's account, newly discovered in France and entitled \\"Relaci√≥n hist√≥rica de la creencia, usos, costumbres, y extravagancias de los indios de esta Misi√≥n de San Juan Capistrano llamada la naci√≥n Acagchemem\\" (Harrington 1934).

Its headquarters are located at 60 Knightsbridge, London, England, overlooking Hyde Park. The club has a clear purpose: \\"To provide the members with outstanding yacht cruising, racing and social opportunities in the UK and internationally, building on the Club's unique heritage, central London facilities and close reciprocal relationships with other leading yacht clubs around the world.\\" History The RTYC was established in 1775 when Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, brother of King George III, put up a silver cup for a race on the River Thames and formed the Cumberland Fleet. This remains the alternative name of the club today. The RTYC name originates from 1830 when William IV of the United Kingdom came to the throne. Members of the club initially met in coffee houses. From 1857, the club owned various properties in London, moving to its current location of 60 Knightsbridge in 1923, although the current clubhouse was built more recently. In 1840, besides the RTYC, there were several other Thames sailing clubs, including the Royal Sailing Society, the Clarence Club, the British Yacht Club, and the Royal Yacht Squadron. RTYC yachting originally took place on the Thames but the Solent became increasingly important in the 1850s as the railways made the south coast more accessible. The club has had many distinguished Flag Officers and traditionally the Commodore has been a member of the royal family. Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma was Commodore for 20 years and today the club's Commodore is Prince Andrew, the Duke of York. The Patron of the Club is the Duke of Edinburgh and the Admiral is Prince Charles the Prince of Wales. Activities The club is involved in a range of yachting events for both the cruising and racing yachtsman, motor yacht owners and all those interested in the sea. Through the club's events and other contacts, members have access to yachting activities worldwide. They also have use of all the facilities of the clubhouse in Knightsbridge and leading reciprocal clubs around the world. Racing The club participates in numerous racing events both in the UK and worldwide. There is an annual regatta - the Cumberland Regatta - on the Solent and opportunities for both fleet and match racing. The club is particularly active in keelboat team racing and regularly competes with other leading clubs around the world. Cruising Every year the club organises cruises in UK waters and overseas. Overseas cruises have taken place all over the world from New Zealand to the Caribbean. Some members join in with their own boats while others charter. Social The club hosts a varied range of social events. There are the traditional \\"Black Tie\\" events that have been held for over a hundred years, such as the Fitting Out and the Laying Up Dinners, and the annual Prizewinners' Dinner. More recently the club has introduced Ladies Lunches, the Annual Cruising Dinner and the 'Talks at 60 Knightsbridge'. Functions and events The club is licensed for civil marriages and civil partnerships. Non-members may hold private or business functions at the club.http://www.royalthames.com/functions/ Charitable Trust The Royal Thames Yacht Club Charitable Trust provides funding to young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to become members of a working ship's crew and to experience going to sea.http://www.rtyccharity.org/ File:cmglee_Royal_Thames_Yacht_Club_exterior.jpg|Exterior of the headquarters in August 2012.

Formerly the lead vocalist of the band Black and Blue, Lo launched her solo career in 1998 and is best known for the singles, \\"Trash\\" () and \\"Please Break Up\\" (). Career 1995-1996: Black & Blue Prior to going solo, Lo was the lead vocalist in the Hong Kong indie rock band Black & Blue. The band released two albums: Hope in Just One Day (1995) containing songs mostly sung in English; and Black & Blue (1996) sung completely in Cantonese, a decision made with their record label to make themselves more understandable to fans. Lo wrote all the lyrics on both albums. 1998-2005: Solo Career with Sony Music In 1998, Lo signed with Sony Music Hong Kong to launch a career as a solo artist. Her first release under Sony was the EP Don't Have to be...Too Perfect () which contained the breakthrough radio-hit \\"Trash\\" (), considered one of her signature songs. Although \\"Trash\\" was a fairly mainstream ballad, the rest of the EP showed a continuity with her indie past. Lo would later ditch Keith Chan and Wyman Wong who had a dominant presence on the EP to work with entirely different songwriters and lyricists for her debut album. Released in late 1998, Lo's first full-length solo album was titled Miao, which referred to her love of cats and how \\"they listen while people sometimes don't.\\"iMUSIC Miao was apparently released to \\"more than disappointing\\" album sales and low radio airplay, with producer Kubert Leung remarking that the public had \\"failed to grasp the concept of the album.\\" HK Entertainment News Lo's sophomore album, Getting Closer to Candy Lo () (1999), represented a more conscious attempt to connect with a mainstream audience, while retaining a sense of the unique individualism found in Miao. The album continued to set Lo's music apart from the mainstream. It contained five of her compositions, including the single \\"Regeneration,\\" () which was influenced by 70's art rock. Upon release, the album garnered her some comparisons as \\"Hong Kong's Faith Yang\\".MTV Taiwan Art direction for the album was done by William Chang. A substantially more commercial direction was signalled by the release of 2002's Appreciating the Taste of Life (), which gave Lo her first-ever smash hit, \\"Please Break Up\\" (). The song topped the charts and won her year-end awards at all four of Hong Kong's major radio and TV stations, making it a career highlight for Lo. A duet version of the song was recorded with Taiwan singer Leehom Wang to accompany the second edition of the album. The song remains one of the most frequently requested songs at Hong Kong karaoke bars to this day. In May 2003, Lo held her first stadium concert at the Hong Kong Coliseum, True Music 1st Flight Live 2003, performing for two nights. This coincided with the release of the album Candy's Airline (), which spawned one of her biggest hits, \\"Love Triangle\\" (), and was followed up later in the year by Flower Talk () which contained a further hit, \\"Fall & Blossom\\" (). After a string of radio-friendly albums, Lo released her final album with Sony, Evolution Theory () in 2005, which returned to her alternative musical roots and is one of her most uncompromising albums to date. Like Flower Talk which preceded it, the album contains lyrics which deal with Buddhist themes. 2007-2011: Process & Retirement After a 2-year musical hiatus (during which she appeared in six films), Lo released her 10th studio album, Process, on 10 June 2007, upon joining her new record company \\"WOW Music\\". She is the first artist to release a USB flash memory digital album in Asia. Process contained the radio chart- topping hit \\"Love to the Limit\\" () and a Mandarin song, \\"Run Slowly\\" () which was previously available for download at Candy's temporary website https://web.archive.org/web/20071016051856/http://www.candylo.hk/ and saw a hit rate of more than 200,000 before being taken down. At a concert in 2011, Lo announced her retirement as a singer, though stated that she will continue to produce music behind-the-scenes. She has previously expressed dissatisfaction with the Hong Kong music industry and of having had a \\"difficult 13 years.\\" 2014-present: Return to music In 2014, Lo signed onto the newly founded label, WhatsUp Music Limited and collaborated with the band Fabel on the single \\"Self-Love\\" (). \\"Self-Love\\" topped two of the four major Hong Kong singles charts and received a nomination for \\"Best Vocal Collaboration\\" at the 2014 CASH Golden Sail Music Awards. She released two further singles under the label, namely, \\"Pastoral Dream\\" () and \\"The Philosopher\\" () in 2015. In November 2017, Lo released the single, \\"Tomorrow We Will Run By The Sea\\" (). The single coincided with her concert series RE:TURN ÁõßÂ∑ßÈü≥Candy Lo Concert 2017 held at the Hong Kong Macpherson Stadium on 20‚Äì21 December. In November 2018, Lo contributed vocals to the alt-rock single, \\"Sunset Party\\" (), as part of a collaborative project between composer Vicky Fung and lyricist Chow Yiu Fai. Acting Lo has appeared in numerous films, often as a supporting player in comedies. Notably, she was nominated three times at the 20th Hong Kong Film Awards (2001) for her roles in Tsui Hark's Time and Tide (Best Newcomer, Best Supporting Actress) and Twelve Nights [ÂçÅ‰∫åÂ§ú] (Best Newcomer). She received further nominations for her supporting roles in Truth or Dare : 6th Floor Rear Flat () in 2004 and Six Strong Guys () in 2005.

It was published in 2000 by Scholastic. It was awarded \\"Notable Series in Children's Book of the Year Awards 2001: Younger Readers\\". The book is focused on Lief and his companions in a search for the seven missing gems of Deltora in the Forests of Silence. Plot summary The book opens with a boy called Jarred, a friend of Prince Endon. After the death of King Alton and his queen, Endon is proclaimed King in his father's place. To consummate this, a magical steel belt, the Belt of Deltora, is set around Endon's waist. The Belt recognizes Endon as Deltora's rightful king. Jarred goes to the library and learns that the evil Shadow Lord, a Sauron-like intelligence located in the Shadowlands, once tried to seize the land in which is the kingdom of Deltora. Because the people of those days were divided into seven tribes, the Shadow Army soon overwhelmed much of the land. Jarred learned that a blacksmith named Adin gathered the sacred talismans from each tribe and attached them to a chain of steel medallions. The people's trust in Adin, channeled through the gems, was powerful enough to drive back the Shadow Army into its own dark home, the Shadowlands. Adin later became king of the united land called Deltora; yet he never forgot that the Enemy was not destroyed. He therefore never let the Belt out of his sight. With every generation, the Belt was worn less and less, diminishing its effect. The kings and queens also let their power go to the administrative council, diminishing its power. Jarred, learning of this, urges Endon to put on the Belt and revive the custom of Adin. Before he can explain in detail, Chief Advisor Prandine enters and accuses Jarred of treason. Jarred escapes Prandine and finds that the city has fallen into disrepair, and Deltora has become a virtual dystopia. Jarred then becomes apprentice and successor to Crian the blacksmith, later to marry Crian's granddaughter Anna. Seven years later, the gems of Deltora were stolen by the Ak-Baba under the Shadow Lord and were scattered throughout the land. This also allowed the Enemy to enter the land. Jarred helps King Endon and Queen Sharn (Endon's pregnant bride) escape the invasion through a secret tunnel. Sixteen years later, the Shadow Lord tyrannically rules Deltora. A person identified as Jarred's son and apprentice, Lief, has been born during this time. He has been raised to reject the Shadow Lord, but never to show any obvious opposition. On his birthday, Lief's father sends his son, accompanied by a soldier named Barda, to find the lost gems from the Belt and restore them to the belt to defeat the evil shadowlord. The nearest gem, the golden topaz, is to be found in Mid Wood, which is one of three perilous Forests of Silence. While travelling to the forest, Wenns capture them and take them into First Wood as an offering to the predator known as Wennbar. Before being eaten, a wild forest-dwelling girl of Lief's own age, called Jasmine appears. Jasmine, after a brief reluctance, rescues Lief and Barda, later to leads them to the Dark in the heart of Mid Wood. There, they discover a wall made of steadfastly cultivated vines, enclosing a clearing in the very center of the forest. In that center grow three flowers called the Lilies of Life, whose nectar possesses healing properties and makes you live forever. The wall of vines was guarded by a Jalis knight called Gorl, who sought to drink of the Nectar of Life and become immortal. Over the years, Gorl's body has rotted away, leaving nothing behind but his memories and his intentions. He captures Lief and Barda. Under their questions, Gorl narrates all, while Barda strives to break the psychokinetic control held by the knight over their bodies. Barda breaks the grip, but is given a mortal wound by Gorl's sword. As he is about to kill Lief, Jasmine persuades a tree to drop a limb onto Gorl, thus destroying him and breaching his wall. Sunlight enters the Dark, and the Lilies of Life bloom at last. Jasmine and Lief use their nectar to heal the dying Barda. As the Lilies fade, Jasmine takes the last of the nectar into a jar, so that she might use it on future injuries. Lief takes the topaz from its position as the pommel of Gorl's sword and fits it into the Belt of Deltora. The three relax and recuperate, while animals from all over Mid Wood enter the breach in Gorl's wall and devour the vines. Later, Barda and Lief re-embark, with Jasmine and her animal companions Kree and Filli in company. Characters *Lief: Lief is the main character of the series. Lief was born to parents Jarred and Anna of the Forge. As a child Lief roamed the streets of Del, sharpening his wits and gaining him the skills needed for his future quests. Though he did not know it, he was constantly protected by Barda and he prided himself on his many 'lucky' escapes. On his sixteenth birthday it is revealed to him that he must begin a dangerous quest to find the lost gems of the Belt of Deltora. *Barda: Barda was enlisted as a friend by the king and queen of Deltora and was trusted to help him find the lost gems of Deltora sixteen years before the initial story took place. For the next sixteen years Barda disguised himself as a beggar so as to discover information vital to the quest. He also became the bodyguard of Jarred and Anna's child Lief, albeit without the semi-arrogant Lief's knowledge thereof. Upon Lief's sixteenth birthday Barda revealed himself to Lief and the quest for the gems of Deltora began. Though Barda was at first annoyed to travel encumbered by a child, he soon saw Lief as more of a help than a hindrance. *Jasmine: Jasmine is a wild girl, described as having wild black hair and emerald green eyes who has grown up in the Forests of Silence, where Lief and Barda meet her shortly after leaving Del. Her parents were captured by Grey Guards when she was seven years old, and so she has been raised by the forest. She can understand the language of the trees and of many animals, and has incredibly sharp senses, but has trouble understanding some social customs. Jasmine is usually seen with her raven, Kree, and a mouse-like creature she calls Filli. Jasmine is like Lief and occasionally has a quick temper. After helping Lief and Barda in the forest and with the help of the topaz, she is greeted by her mother's spirit from beyond the grave, who tells her to go with Lief and Barda in their quest. After this encounter, she joins Lief and Barda in the search for the great gems that will complete the Belt.

It continues the trio's journey to find the seven missing gems of Deltora, braving dangers and guardians in each book. The book was first published in 2001 by Scholastic. Plot summary In The Forests of Silence, the topaz had been retrieved by Lief, Barda, and Jasmine. They continue on their way to the Lake of Tears, to retrieve the ruby. They learn that the land surrounding the Lake of Tears is controlled by the evil sorceress Thaegan, who has 13 monster children. As the companions travel through the countryside they rescue a man named Manus from the Shadow Lord's servants, Grey Guards. Manus is from the city of Raladin. 100 years ago, Thaegan put a spell on Raladin that caused them and all of their offspring to never be able to speak. Lief, Barda, and Jasmine also learn that Thaegan put a spell on the city of D'Or and turned it into the Lake of Tears. The companions, with Manus, escape from the Grey Guards only to be captured by Jin and Jod, two of Thaegan's children. They eventually defeat Jin and Jod and journey to the city of Raladin, where Manus hopes to find his people. Upon arrival, they find the city empty. Only when the Ralad people hear the companions, they come out of hiding. Lief, Barda, and Jasmine tell the Ralads that they must journey to the Lake of Tears, despite the Ralads pleas, but they do not tell them they are going in quest of one of the gems of the Belt of Deltora. Manus agrees to be their guide. When they get to the Lake of Tears, the monster Soldeen attacks them. Soldeen is a giant fish-like creature who is very deadly and has the ability to speak. Using the power of the topaz, Lief persuades Soldeen to give them the ruby. As Soldeen agrees, Thaegan appears and threatens to kill them all. The ruby flies out of Lief's hand and into the depths of the Lake as Thaegan uses her magic to harm them. Just as Thaegan is about to kill them all, Jasmine's bird Kree comes and kills Thaegan by drawing blood. All of Thaegan's spells are broken: the Ralads can now speak and the Lake of Tears turns back into the city of D'Or. Soldeen is a man named Nanion and gives the three companions the gem and wishes them well on their quest. The Belt now holds the topaz and ruby and now they journey towards the City of the Rats.

This service is a fundamental library service; however, readers' advisory also occurs in commercial contexts such as bookstores. Currently, almost all North American public libraries offer some form of readers' advisory. History North America > \\"Setting a date for the start of what we now call readers advisory service, > particularly readers advisory in the public library, is at best a > frustrating, almost arbitrary exercise. Efforts at historical precision can > founder on such basic issues as the absence of common definitions. For > example, answers to such questions as 'What exactly is a public library?\\" or > \\"What really is readers advisory?\\" have long been disputed.\\" (Bill Crowley, > from his 2005 journal article \\"Rediscovering the History of Readers Advisory > Service\\") Opposing Viewpoints on the Merits of Different Types of Readers' Advisory The historical period divisions and merits of different types of readers' advisory services is a hotly debated topic among librarians. Bill Crowley, in his 2005 article, \\"Rediscovering the History of Readers Advisory Service,\\" breaks down the historical period divisions of the service into four eras: *1876 to 1920 - \\"Inventing\\" Readers' Advisory *1920 to 1940 - \\"Privileging Nonfiction\\" in Readers' Advisory *1940 to 1984 - Readers' Advisory \\"'Lost' in Adult Services\\" *1984 to 2005 (current at time of article) - \\"Reviving Readers' Advisory\\" Juris Dilevko and Candice Magowan question the merits of the current readers' advisory emphasis on popular fiction materials in their book \\"Readers' Advisory Service in North American Public Libraries, 1870‚Äì2005.\\" They subdivide the history as: *1870 to 1916 - \\"The Formative Years\\" *1917 to 1962 - \\"The Commitment to Systematic Adult Education\\" *1963 to 2005 - \\"The Devolution into Entertainment\\" Dilevko and Mogowan write about \\"readers' advisory systematically committ[ing] itself to meaningful adult education through serious and purposeful reading\\" up until the 1960s, when emphasis on \\"popular culture resulted in the 'Give 'Em What They Want' approach\\" and \\"The Devolution into Entertainment.\\" 1897‚Äì1920 In 1897, the ALA President stated that \\"the personal influence of librarians who assisted and advised readers was the most potent force in molding community reading.\\" 1920‚Äì1980 Organized readers' advisory programs have been documented dating back to the 1920s. Between 1922‚Äì1926 readers' advisory programs were experimentally introduced into seven urban libraries (Cleveland and Detroit, in 1922, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, and Chicago, in 1923 and 1924, and Cincinnati and Portland, OR). The Adult Education Movement emerged in the 1920s in public libraries and was frequently discussed in American Library Association professional publications. The 1924 report The American Public Library and the Diffusion of Knowledge by William Learned to the Carnegie Corporation sought to establish adult education as the focus of the public library, with personalized readers' advisory service to adult readers by \\"reference experts\\" who would make up a \\"community intelligence service.\\" The 1926 American Library Association \\"book-length\\" commission report Libraries and Adult Education placed high importance on readers' advisory services in Adult Education. Judson T. Jennings provided a summary of the work, observing that the \\"library's contribution to adult education resolved itself into three major activities:\\" > 1\\\\. An information service regarding local opportunities for adult students. > 2\\\\. Service to other agencies engaged in adult education. > 3\\\\. Service to individual readers and students. This new professional interest during the 1920s spurred the creation of specialized full-time readers' advisory positions in major public libraries. By 1936, an estiminated, 50 public libraries had established readers' advisory services. Until the early 1960s, readers' advisory focused on non-fiction materials and continuing adult education. 1980s - 2000s Some librarians consider the early 1980s to be the beginning of a revival in readers' advisory and praise the inclusion of fiction (including genre fiction: fantasy, mystery, romance, etc.) and write that historically readers' advisory was biased in favor of nonfiction.Crowley, Bill (2005) \\"Rediscovering the History of Readers Advisory Service.\\" Public Libraries. Vol 44 No. 1. p.40Luyt, Brendan (2001). \\"Regulating Readers: The Social Origins of the Readers' Advisor in the United States.\\" The Library Quarterly. Vol. 71 No. 4 p.443-466 Others disapprove of the new approaches and changes in service. Dilevko and Magowan write \\"Post-1980 readers' advisory thus became an opportunity to converse with patrons about 'light, quick, escapist' books -- popular and ephemeral fiction and nonfiction for entertainment, pleasure, and recreation -- because such conversations were not 'too burdensome'.\\" In 1982, the term \\"genreflecting\\" was first coined by Betty Rosenberg, who authored: Genreflecting: A Guide to Reading Interests in Genre Fiction (Libraries Unlimited, 1982). Another major influence on the spread and revival of readers' advisory was the Adult Reading Round Table (ARRT), founded by a group of Chicago public librarians in 1984. The group organized workshops, seminars, and genre-study groups.A list of past programs offered by ARRT, dating back to its founding in 1984, is available at http://www.arrtreads.org/pastprograms.html (accessed March 10, 2015) Current Interest Interest in readers' advisory continues to grow. Libraries Unlimited Genreflecting Advisory Series has grown to 27 titles as of July 2008 (from 15 titles in 2005). Beyond traditional genres (fantasy, mystery, romance), some of the diverse offerings now include guides to LGBT literature,ABC-CLIO - Product - Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgendered Literature: A Genre Guide - Ellen Bosman, John P. Bradford and Robert B. Ridinger guides to graphic novels (comic books, manga, etc), and Christian fiction.http://lu.com/showbook.cfm?isbn=9781563088711 > \\". . . contemporary readers advisory service is best understood as an > organized program promoting both fiction and nonfiction discretionary > reading for the dual purposes of satisfying reader needs and advancing a > culture's goal of a literate population.\\" (Bill Crowley, from his 2005 > journal article \\"Rediscovering the History of Readers Advisory Service\\") Types Direct readers' advisory Direct readers' advisory is based on a non-judgmental assessment of the personal preferences of the reader through a series of questions, called a readers advisory conversation. The assessment focuses on reader likes and dislikes with regard to a number of factors, including subject, reading level, genre, writing style, the level of characterization, plot elements, storyline, pace, tone, frame, and setting. The hoped-for outcome of this interview is the identification of three or more appropriate suggestions (sometimes referred to as \\"readalikes\\"‚Äîespecially when the interview was initiated by patron interest in new authors/titles similar to one enjoyed in the past). In identifying suitable suggestions, a readers' advisor combines personal knowledge of material with a variety of specialized print and online resources to come up with appropriate suggestions. The goal of direct readers advisory is to suggest titles based on a reader's individual interests and tastes. Librarians who simply recommend their favorite books with little or no regard for the patron's own interests are not performing readers' advisory. For example, if a patron requests \\"a good book,\\" the readers' advisor might ask the reader to describe a book they have enjoyed. The focus of the conversation is not on recitation of plot, but on the aforementioned appeal elements (i.e. pace, subject, tone, writing style, etc.). In our example, the patron tells the readers' advisor of a humorous mystery novel with a sharp-tongued female protagonist. Our readers' advisor also learns that the patron prefers fast-paced dialogue to excessive descriptive passages. Once the appeal elements have been identified (i.e. a humorous mystery featuring snappy dialogue and a female protagonist), the readers' advisor will suggest appropriate titles in the collection by drawing on personal knowledge and/or by consulting appropriate print and online resources. Even though the patron requested a mystery, a skilled readers advisor will often offer a suggestion or two that point the reader to new a new vista outside of a mentioned genre or milieu. Readers' advisory can also be performed across multiple media. For example, a patron who likes the movie Matilda might be unaware that it is based on a book by Roald Dahl. Other patrons who enjoy audio books may be introduced to other titles read by the same person. Questions to consider asking in the readers' advisory interview In the 2005 edition of Readers' Advisory Services in the Public Library, Joyce Saricks lists some questions for advisors to consider, such as: *Are characters and plot quickly revealed or slowly unveiled? (Identifying Pacing) *Is there more dialogue or more description? (Identifying Pacing) *Is there a focus on a single character or on several whose lives are intertwined (Identify Characterization) *Is the focus of the story more interior and psychological or exterior and action oriented? (Identifying Story Line) Indirect readers' advisory Indirect readers' advisory display: \\"Looking for a good book? . . . You could ask one of our Fabulous Librarians . . . or try some of these nifty reading guides\\" Indirect readers' advisory involves the creation of displays, bookmarks, and annotated book lists that a reader/patron can pick up and peruse on their own without actively engaging a readers' advisor. Indirect readers' advisory aids, particularly annotated book lists, focus on appeal elements rather than providing extensive plot summaries. Recently, some public libraries (like the Williamsburg Regional Library in Virginia) have begun experimenting with form-based readers' advisory, which allows for a richer indirect readers advisory experience. Maintaining a Staff Recommendations display is another way to improve a library's readers' advisory service. Since many readers are browsers, staff recommendations make it easier to select a book. (Content is available under GNU Free Documentation License 1.2) In their 2001 article \\"Reader's Advisory: Matching Mood and Material,\\" Ross and Chelton recommend placing books in four areas of the library in order to make the most of merchandising. These four areas are the entrance, the ends of stacks, high traffic areas, and the circulation desk. Placing the display in these areas ensure that patrons will see and, hopefully, utilize the books on display. Ross and Chelton also note that books, not posters and announcements, should be here because merchandised titles will circulate very quickly. Discussion of Readers' Advisory Resources There are numerous books, online subscription databases, and websites dedicated to readers' advisory. Australia and New Zealand * Libraries Alive provide a guide to readers' advisory resources for Australian and New Zealand readers and authors. *Better Reading is a website that aims to be a great source of independent book recommendations for Australian readers and their families. The site focusses on sharing great stories, and helping people discover new books and authors. Print Resources Popular print resources include the What Do I Read Next? series of reference books (published by Thomson Gale), the Genreflecting series (published by Libraries Unlimited), and the Readers' Advisory Guides (published by the American Library Association). Seattle Librarian Nancy Pearl achieved broad fame and recognition for her readers guides, Book Lust and More Book Lust, which recommend \\"reading for every mood, moment, and reason.\\" Both have been popular with the general public and can be found at most book stores and libraries. Also of note are Pearl's guides to contemporary fiction: Now Read This: A Guide to Mainstream Fiction, 1978‚Äì1998 and Now Read This II: A Guide to Mainstream Fiction, 1990‚Äì2001. BookPage is a periodical available at many public libraries, containing book reviews, recommended reading lists, and author interviews. Internet Resources *Fiction_L was the Morton Grove Public Library's electronic mailing list for readers' advisory discussions, developed by Roberta S. Johnson and the Reader's Services staff of the library. As of June 2016, Fiction_L is managed by Cuyahoga County Public Library. Visit the new Fiction_L web page. The List encompasses fiction, as well as \\"all aspects of reader's advisory for children, young adults and adults, including non-fiction materials.\\" Many booklists discussed on the listerv are indexed on the library website, in the following categories: Genre, Character, Setting, Subject, Author, Audience, \\"Best of,\\" and Miscellaneous. The list is a powerful resource for a worldwide community of librarians and other readers, because of its accessibility and searchable archives. Given some basic information, almost every inquiry receives a response, often within minutes. *Booklist Online \\"delivers highly searchable and creatively linked reviews, columns, and features‚Äîall designed to help users find exactly the right book.\\" *NoveList is a database of reading recommendations, available through libraries around the world. It is a comprehensive source of information about books, and genres that includes read-alikes, expert recommendations, recommended reads lists, professional reviews, feature articles, author bios, complete series information, and lots more. NoveList Plus includes both fiction and nonfiction titles. There is also a companion service, NoveList Select, that adds these recommendations to a library's catalog. *BookBrowse.com offers a customized subscription service for libraries. Its readers' advisory database includes read-alikes, browsing by 100+ themes, in-depth reviews, previews, back-stories, book club advice, author bios, interviews & pronunciation guide and ezines. *ALA Recommended Reading compiles different reading lists for all ages, especially children and teens. Most lists are available on the ALA web site. *LibraryReads is a monthly staff-picks list of ten newly published titles, as nominated and voted on by public library workers from around the United States. This non-profit service served as inspiration for the Loan Stars list in Canada, and the Librarians' Choice list in Australia. *LibraryThing is a social networking website for cataloging and sharing personal and institutional library collections. The site contains a \\"Suggester\\" feature which provides book recommendations based on user catalogs with similar books. The broader your catalog, the more specific suggestions you will receive. *NextReads is an email newsletter service that delivers more than 25 themed book recommendation newsletters to readers. Libraries can customize the newsletters to include only items in the library's catalog, and also add information about related events and programs happening in the library. *Wowbrary is a weekly email newsletter showing the new books, movies, and CDs selected by a library in the previous week. Because these items are all in the library's catalog, newsletter recipients can be among the first to place holds, even if the items have not arrived yet. *What's Next is a free resource from the Kent District Library System in Michigan that helps users in finding quality series fiction. \\"A series is two or more books linked by character(s), settings, or other common traits.\\" *Whichbook allows you to customize your book search by choosing characteristics of the story from a range using sliders. The sliders can be dragged from one end of one extreme to the other in order to find a desirable combination on which to base the site's recommendations. The results can be limited to a specific format such as: eBooks, audiobooks, or large print editions. While you have the option to sign into the website to save your results and create book lists, all of the search features are accessible without creating an account. *Fantastic Fiction maintains bibliographies for over 30,000 authors and is an easy way to track series by authors and authors who write under different pseudonyms. *BookSpot.com is a free resource \\"that simplifies the search for the best book-related content on the Web\\" and directs users to where they can find audiobooks, free first chapters, and specific lists such as award winners and the top 150 bestsellers of the week. *Some libraries have developed online indirect readers' advisory websites based on specific titles, series, or authors. For example, the Allen County Public Library's Lemony Snicket Read-Alikes and Supplements page answers the question of 'what to read next' with annotated book lists based around different genre and stylistic aspects of the series (mystery books, books about \\"Orphans or kids living without much help from adults,\\" humorous books). They also refer readers to non-fiction works on related topics from the Lemony Snicket series. For example, the book Using Ropes and Knots is recommended because > \\"In The Bad Beginning (A Series of Unfortunate Events, Book the First) > Violet Baudelaire found herself in the unfortunate circumstance of trying to > rescue her baby sister Sunny from a perilous perch. Violet was able to > invent a grappling hook and attach it to a rope with the proper knot. It > will be unfortunate if you do not read this book and you find yourself > trying to rescue your baby sister.\\" *Goodreads is currently (2020) the world's largest site for readers and book recommendations. Users can keep a record of books read, are currently reading or want to read. Functionality for users includes: review and rate books, follow others; join groups; track books; and receive book recommendations, both automated and from friends. Users can tag books and can name and arrange shelves as they please. Goodreads launched in January 2007 and was acquired by Amazon.com in 2013. *What Should I Read Next is a website that is dedicated to answer a Readers' Advisory question many patrons ask. A reader can type in either a book they like or an author they enjoy and get recommendations of similar books they should read next. A patron can also narrow or direct their results by clicking on the subjects that calculate under a specific book they enjoy. This gives the option to search by the element that attracted a reader to a particular book to begin with. *Literature-Map is a useful website which can offer read-alike author suggestions. Simply type an author's name into the dialogue box, press enter and a visual representation of similar authors appear. The authors which appear nearest to the name in the dialogue box are a closer representation of the style of writing sought, whereas the author names on the outer perimeter only have minor aspects of the writing style. Blogs Reading and/or maintaining a readers' advisory blog for a library can be beneficial for both patrons and librarians. Patrons gain access to book reviews and recommendations and librarians stay current on new releases and improve their readers‚Äô advisory skills.

Life Moore was born in a suburb of Dublin and apprenticed to a wood carver. Impressed by the preaching of John Wesley, he frequented the Methodist meetings and joined a class in Dublin in 1777. He served from 1784 to 1786 as assistant traveling companion and amanuensis to Wesley, and again from 1788 to 1790. Wesley made him one of his literary executors and appointed him to be, after his death, one of the 12 ministers to regulate the services of City Road Chapel. He was President of the Methodist Conference in 1804 and 1823. Moore rejected ordainment in the Church of England, although he accepted it from Wesley assisted by two Episcopal clergymen; opposed Thomas Coke's Lichfield scheme of 1794 for the creation of a Methodist hierarchy and also the proposal brought forward in 1834 for the establishment of a theological school; and on the formation of a centenary fund in 1839 objected to the acquisition of land by the Methodist body. Works In conjunction with Coke, and under the authority of the conference, Moore published a Life of the Rev. John Wesley in 1792. A new, more complete, Life was published in 1824-25. His Life was published by Mrs. Richard Smith, with autobiographical content, in 1844.

History  Little is known of the history of this town, situated on the east bank of the Harpasus, a tributary of the M√¶ander. It is mentioned by Ptolemy, by Stephanus Byzantius, by Hierocles, and by Pliny the Elder. According to Pliny, there was in the neighbourhood a rocking-stone which could be set in motion by a finger- touch, whereas the force of the whole body could not move it. The Ancient Armenian village that resided in present-day Turkey hosts the ruined castle of Arpaz, in the district of Nazilli, nearly preserves the old name as does the Turkish form Harpaskale.  Bishopric  It was important enough in the late Roman province of Caria (civil Diocese of Asia) to become a bishopric, a suffragan of the archbishopric of Stauropolis , in the sway of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Harpasa appears in the lists of the Notitiae Episcopatuum until the 12th or 13th century. Lequien's Oriens Christianus I, 907 mentions only four historically documented bishops : * Phinias, who took part in the First Council of Ephesus in 431 * Zoticus, at the Council of Chalcedon 451, ? represented by the presbyter Philotheos ** Iren√¶us, who adhered the heresy Monophysitism * Leo, in Constantinople at the Council of Constantinople of 879-880 which rehabilitated Patriarch Photius I of Constantinople.  Titular see  The diocese was nominally restored (twentieth century?) by the Catholic Church as Titular bishopric of Harpasa (Latin) / Arpassa (Curiate Italian) / Harpasen(us) (Latin).Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, ), p. 839 It is vacant since decades, having had the following incumbents, so far of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank, including an Eastern Catholic : :BIOS TO ELABORATE * Joseph Pfluger (later Archbishop) (1911.11.30 ‚Äì 1927.01.29) * Blessed Bishop Pavel Peter Gojdic, Basilian Order of Saint Josaphat (O.S.B.M. - Byzantine Rite) (1927.03.07 ‚Äì 1940.04.11) * Bishop Stanislav Zela (1940.10.11 ‚Äì 1969.12.06)  References   Sources and external links  * GCatholic (former &) titular see * Sophrone P√©trid√®s, lemma 'Harpasa', in , vol.

Professional career Padilla turned pro in 1985 and retired shortly thereafter in 1986 after a TKO loss to Dwayne Prim. In 1991, he returned to boxing and went on a nine-fight winning streak, which included victories over future champion James Page and former champion Roger Mayweather, before challenging for a world title. In 1993, he captured the WBO Light Welterweight Title in an upset unanimous decision victory over undefeated Carlos Gonzalez. Later that year, he was named the Ring magazine comeback fighter of the year. Padilla successfully defended his title four times with victories over Efrem Calamati (35-0-1), Ray Oliveira, Harold Miller, and former champion Juan Laporte. His fight with Olivera in 1993 once held the Compubox record for the most punches thrown in a fight at 3,020. Final retirement During a sparring session with Shane Mosley, Padilla was hit with a hard punch which aggravated a head injury from his last fight. Padilla's boxing license was then suspended indefinitely, and he never fought again. He had a career record of 24-1-1 with 14 KOs. Recognition On June 25, 2012, Padilla was inducted into the California Boxing Hall of Fame. This is in addition to having a street in his hometown of Azusa named in his honor.

Maria delle Grazie, Milan, Italy (1498), by Leonardo da Vinci). Bishop John washes feet on Maundy Thursday 2007. The Mass of the Lord's Supper, also known as A Service of Worship for Maundy Thursday, is a Holy Week service celebrated on the evening of Maundy Thursday. It inaugurates the Easter Triduum, and commemorates the Last Supper of Jesus with his disciples, more explicitly than other celebrations of the Mass. The Catholic Church, Lutheran Churches, Methodist Churches, Reformed Churches, and Anglican Communion celebrate the Mass of the Lord's Supper (or the Liturgy of Maundy Thursday). The Mass stresses three aspects of that event: \\"the institution of the Eucharist, the institution of the ministerial priesthood, and the commandment of brotherly love that Jesus gave after washing the feet of his disciples.\\"Holy Thursday Evening Mass of the Lord's Supper, 45 In Anglicanism, these rites are found in the Book of Common Prayer,Proper Liturgy for Maundy Thursday, 1979 (American) Book of Common Prayer as well as in the Anglican Missal.The Anglican Missal, pp. B44-B59 In Methodism, they are found in the Book of Worship for Church and Home and The United Methodist Book of Worship. In Lutheranism, the Maundy Thursday liturgy is found in the Lutheran Service Book and Evangelical Lutheran Worship. History The celebration of a Mass in the evening of Holy Thursday began in late fourth-century Jerusalem, where it became customary to celebrate the events of the Passion of Jesus in the places where they took place. In Rome at that time a Mass was celebrated at which penitents were reconciled with a view to participation in the Easter celebrations. The Jerusalem custom spread and in seventh-century Rome the Pope celebrated a Mass of the Lord's Supper on this day as well as the Mass of Reconciliation. By the eighth century, the Masses became three: one for reconciliation, one for blessing the holy oils and a third for the Last Supper. The last two were in reduced form, being without Liturgy of the Word. Pope Pius V's reforms in 1570 forbade the celebration of Mass after noon, and the Mass of the Lord's Supper became a morning Mass and remained so until Pope Pius XII's reforms in the 1950s.Orlando O. Esp√≠n, James B. Nickoloff, An Introductory Dictionary of Theology and Religious Studies (Liturgical Press, 2007 , ), p. 379 The washing of feet that is now part of the Mass of the Lord's Supper was in use at an early stage without relation to this particular day, and was first prescribed for use on Holy Thursday by a 694 Council of Toledo. By the twelfth century it was found in the Roman liturgy as a separate service. Pope Pius V included this rite in his Roman Missal, placing it after the text of the Mass of the Lord's Supper.Orlando O. Esp√≠n, James B.

Current rubrics indicate that the rite is not an obligatory part of that Mass, but rather is something to be carried out \\"where a pastoral reason suggests it\\" (Roman Missal, Mass of the Lord's Supper, no. 10).\\"Holy Thursday Mandatum\\", USCCB, 2016 Structure The Mass begins as usual, with the exception that the tabernacle, wherever placed, should be empty.Holy Thursday Evening Mass of the Lord's Supper, 48 In the 1962 Missal (Roman rite), although white vestments and the Gloria in Excelsis are used, this is still Passiontide, so the \\"Judica me\\" is omitted at the foot of the altar, the \\"Gloria Patri\\" in the Introit and at the end of the Lavabo is omitted, and the Preface of the Cross is used. (The crucifixes, which have been covered during Passiontide, can today be covered with white instead of with violet.) At the singing of the Gloria in Excelsis Deo, all the church bells may be rung; afterwards, they (along with the organ) are silenced until the Gloria of the Easter Vigil.Holy Thursday Evening Mass of the Lord's Supper, 50 The Liturgy of the Word consists of the following readings: *Exodus 12:1-8, 11-14, a description of the original Passover celebration. and *Psalm 115 (116), thanksgiving for being saved and *, Paul the Apostle's account of what Jesus did at his Last Supper *, John the Evangelist's account of how Jesus washed his disciples' feet before that meal as an example of how they should treat each other. After the homily, which should explain the three aspects of the celebration mentioned above,Holy Thursday Evening Mass of the Lord's Supper, 45 the priest who is celebrating the Mass removes his chasuble, puts on a linen gremiale (an amice is often used for this purpose), and proceeds to wash the feet of a number of people (usually twelve, corresponding to the number of the Apostles)Holy Thursday Evening Mass of the Lord's Supper, 51 The recitation of the Nicene Creed is omitted in Anglican, Methodist, Lutheran, and Roman Catholic liturgies for Maundy Thursday. There are special formulas in the Eucharistic Prayer to recall that the Mass of the Lord's Supper is in commemoration of Jesus' Last Supper. Sufficient hosts are consecrated for the faithful to receive Communion both at that Mass and on the next day, Good Friday. The hosts intended for the Good Friday service are not placed in the tabernacle, as is usual, but are left on the altar, while the priests says the postcommunion prayer.Missale Romanum, Feria V in Cena Domini, 35-36 Then the priest incenses the Blessed Sacrament three times and, taking a humeral veil with which to hold it, carries it in solemn procession to a place of reservation somewhere in the church or in an appropriately adorned chapel.Missale Romanum, Feria V in Cena Domini, 37-38 The procession is led by a cross-bearer accompanied by two servers with lit candles; other servers with lit candles follow and a thurifer immediately precedes the priest.Missale Romanum, Feria V in Cena Domini, 38 On arrival at the altar of repose, the priest places the vessel with the Blessed Sacrament in the tabernacle there, leaving the door open. He then incenses it and closes the tabernacle door. After a period of adoration, he and the servers depart in silence.Missale Romanum, Feria V in Cena Domini, 39-40 A plenary indulgence is granted to the faithful, who devoutly recite the Tantum Ergo on Holy Thursday if it is recited in a solemn manner.Sacred Apostolic Penitentiary, Enchiridion Indulgentiarum, 2nd ed., 1968 The continuation of Eucharistic adoration is encouraged, but if continued after midnight should be done without outward solemnity.Missale Romanum, Feria V in Cena Domini, 43Holy Thursday Evening Mass of the Lord's Supper, 56 In the Philippines and several other Catholic countries, the faithful will travel from church to church praying at each church's altar of repose in a practice known as Seven Churches Visitation or Visita Iglesia. The Blessed Sacrament remains in the temporary place until the Holy Communion part of the Good Friday liturgical service. Stripping of the Altar On Maundy Thursday, the chancels of churches are traditionally stripped, with the altar often being draped with black paraments, in preparation for Good Friday. In the Methodist Churches, the chancel is stripped of any decorations, such as flowers and candles. Aside from depictions of the Stations of the Cross, other images, such as the cross, continue to be veiled in black or purple. At the conclusion of the Maundy Thursday liturgy in Lutheran Churches, \\"the altar, lectern and pulpit are left bare until Easter to symbolize the humiliation and barrenness of the cross.\\" In Anglican Churches, this ceremony is also performed at the conclusion of Maundy Thursday services, \\"in which all appointments, linens, and paraments are removed from the altar and chancel in preparation for Good Friday.\\" In the Catholic Church, the form of the Roman Rite in use before 1955 had no washing of the feet, which could instead be done in a separate later ceremony, and the Mass concluded with a ritual stripping of all altars, except the altar of repose, but leaving the cross and candlesticks. This was done to the accompaniment of Psalm 21 (Vulgate) (Deus, Deus meus) preceded and followed by the antiphon \\"Diviserunt sibi vestimenta mea: et super vestem meam miserunt sortem\\" (They divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment). In the Catholic Church, since 1955, the altar is stripped bare without ceremony later.Roman Missal, Thursday of the Lord's Supper, 41 References Category:Catholic liturgy Category:Holy Week ","title":"Mass of the Lord's Supper"},{"id":"7123708","title":"Pralhad Joshi"},{"id":"7123729","text":"Morgan Point Lighthouse is a lighthouse in Noank, Connecticut, United States, on the west side of the mouth of the Mystic River.

The human sex chromosomes, a typical pair of mammal allosomes, determine the sex of an individual created in sexual reproduction. Autosomes differ from allosomes because autosomes appear in pairs whose members have the same form but differ from other pairs in a diploid cell, whereas members of an allosome pair may differ from one another and thereby determine sex. Nettie Stevens and Edmund Beecher Wilson both independently discovered sex chromosomes in 1905. However, Stevens is credited for discovering them earlier than Wilson.  Differentiation  In humans, each cell nucleus contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, a total of 46 chromosomes. The first 22 pairs are called autosomes. Autosomes are homologous chromosomes i.e. chromosomes which contain the same genes (regions of DNA) in the same order along their chromosomal arms. The chromosomes of the 23rd pair are called allosomes consisting of two X chromosomes in most females, and an X chromosome and a Y chromosome in most males. Females therefore have 23 homologous chromosome pairs, while males have 22. The X and Y chromosomes have small regions of homology called pseudoautosomal regions. The X chromosome is always present as the 23rd chromosome in the ovum, while either an X or a Y chromosome can be present in an individual sperm.How many chromosomes do people have? - Genetics Home Reference Early in female embryonic development, in cells other than egg cells, one of the X chromosomes is randomly and permanently partially deactivated: In some cells the X chromosome inherited from the mother is deactivated, while in others the X chromosome from the father is deactivated. This ensures that both sexes always have exactly one functional copy of the X chromosome in each body cell. The deactivated X-chromosome is silenced by repressive heterochromatin that compacts the DNA and prevents expression of most genes (see X-inactivation). This compaction is regulated by PRC2 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2).  Sex determination  All diploid organisms with allosome-determined sex get half of their allosomes from each of their parents. In mammals, females are XX, they can pass along either of their X's, and since the males are XY they can pass along either an X or a Y. For a mammal to be female, the individual must receive an X chromosome from both parents, whereas to be male, the individual must receive a X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father. It is thus the male's sperm that determines the sex of each offspring in mammals. However, a small percentage of humans have a divergent sexual development, known as intersex. This can result from allosomes that are neither XX nor XY. It can also occur when two fertilized embryo fuse, producing a chimera that might contain two different sets of DNA one XX and the other XY. It could also result from exposure, often in utero, to chemicals that disrupt the normal conversion of the allosomes into sex hormones and further into the development of either ambiguous outer genitalia or internal organs.  Previous theories on Sex Determination  Ever since the discovery of X-inactivation through research into Calico cats, it has been postulated that X-inactivation plays a role in genetic sex determination in humans. Initially, there were many theories as to how exactly X-inactivation influences sex. To understand one such theory, you can take the following scenario into consideration: a DNA sequence that is concerned with the creation of a male-trait is regulated by a regulatory DNA sequence. If the regulatory DNA sequence allows the main sequence to be expressed, the male-trait will appear in the phenotype, otherwise not. An explanation for this theory is that the X-chromosome simply inactivates in the presence of another X-chromosome; this causes XX-chromosome humans to have a lower frequency of the regulatory gene (given that both X and Y chromosomes have an equal frequency of the regulator) and so the expression of the male trait is prevented from appearing in the phenotype. A picture depicting the locus of the SRY gene on the Y-chromosome.  Sex Determination as understood today  Theories like the one above have become redundant now, however. In the past, there wasn't much evidence supporting the idea that X-chromosome inactivation occurred due to dosage compensation. At present, it is believed that one X-chromosome in female humans is inactivated (twisted in a Barr body so that its DNA sequences can't be accessed). This leaves only one functioning X-chromosome in both male and female humans, thereby equalizing ‚Äúdosage.‚Äù But dosage regulation isn't all there is to genetic sex determination. There is a gene in the Y-chromosome that has regulatory sequences that control genes that code for maleness. This gene is called the SRY gene. The SRY sequence's prominence in sex determination was discovered when the genetics of sex-reversed XX men (i.e. humans who possessed biological male-traits but actually had XX allosomes) were studied. After examination, it was discovered that the difference between a typical XX individual (traditional female) and a sex-reversed XX man was that the typical individuals lacked the SRY gene. It is theorized that in sex-reversed XX men, the SRY mistakenly gets translocated to an X-chromosome in the XX pair during meiosis. Any how, this experimentation had proved the SRY gene's role in genetic sex determination.  Other vertebrates  It is argued that humans have developed a complex system of genetic sex determination due to their status as highly complex chordates. Lower chordates, such as fish, amphibians and reptiles, have systems that are influenced by the environment. Fish and amphibians, for example, have genetic sex determination but their sex can also be influenced by externally available steroids and incubation temperature of eggs. In reptiles, only incubation temperature determines sex. Many scientists argue that Sex Determination in flowering plants is more complex than that in humans. This is because even the flowering plant subset has a variety of mating systems. Their Sex Determination is primarily regulated by MADS-box genes. These genes code for proteins that form the sex organs in flowers. Understanding Sex Determination in other taxonomic groups allows us to understand human Sex Determination better, as well as place humans in the phylogenetic tree more accurately.  Plants  Sex chromosomes are most common in bryophytes, relatively common in vascular plants and unknown in ferns and lycophytes. The diversity of plants is reflected in their sex- determination systems, which include XY and UV systems as well as many variants. Sex chromosomes have evolved independently across many plant groups. Recombination of chromosomes may lead to heterogamety before the development of sex chromosomes, or recombination may be reduced after sex chromosomes develop. Only a few pseudoautosomal regions normally remain once sex chromosomes are fully differentiated. When chromosomes do not recombine, neutral sequence divergences begin to accumulate, which has been used to estimate the age of sex chromosomes in various plant lineages. Even the oldest estimated divergence, in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, is more recent than mammal or bird divergence. Due to this recency, most plant sex chromosomes also have relatively small sex-linked regions. Current evidence does not support the existence of plant sex chromosomes more ancient than those of M. polymorpha. The high prevalence of autopolyploidy in plants also impacts the structure of their sex chromosomes. Polyploidization can occur before and after the development of sex chromsomes. If it occurs after sex chromosomes are established, dosage should stay consistent between the sex chromosomes and autosomes, with minimal impact on sex differentiation. If it occurs before sex chromosomes become heteromorphic, as is likely in the octoploid red sorrel Rumex acetosella, sex is determined in a single XY system. In a more complicated system, the sandalwood species Viscum fischeri has X1X1X2X2 chromosomes in females, and X1X2Y chromosomes in males. Non- vascular plants Ferns and lycophytes have bisexual gametophytes and so there is no evidence for sex chromosomes. In the bryophytes, including liverworts, hornworts and mosses, sex chromosomes are common. The sex chromosomes in bryophetes affect what type of gamete is produced by the gametophyte, and there is wide diversity in gametophyte type. Unlike seed plants, where gametophytes are always unisexual, in bryophytes they may produce male, female, or both types of gamete. Bryophytes most commonly employ a UV sex- determination system, where U produces female gametophytes and V produces male gametophytes. The U and V chromosomes are heteromorphic with U larger than V, and are frequently both larger than the autosomes. There is variation even within this system, including UU/V and U/VV chromosome arrangements. In some bryophytes, microchromosomes have been found to co-occur with sex chromosomes and likely impact sex determination. Gymnosperms Dioecy is common among gymnosperms, found in an estimated 36% of species. However, heteromorphic sex chromosomes are relatively rare, with only 5 species known as of 2014. Five of these use an XY system, and one (Ginkgo biloba) uses a WZ system. Some gymnosperms, such as Johann‚Äôs Pine (Pinus johannis), have homomorphic sex chromosomes that are almost indistinguishable through karyotyping. Angiosperms Cosexual angiosperms with either monoecious or hermaphroditic flowers do not have sex chromosomes. Angiosperms with separate sexes (dioecious) may use sex chromosomes or environmental flowers for sex determination. Cytogenetic data from about 100 angiosperm species showed heteromorphic sex chromosomes in approximately half, mostly taking the form of XY sex-determination systems. Their Y is typically larger, unlike in humans; however there is diversity among angiosperms. In the Poplar genus (Populus) some species have male heterogamety while others have female heterogamety. Sex chromosomes have arisen independently multiple times in angiosperms, from the monoecious ancestral condition. The move from a monoecious to dioecious system requires both male and female sterility mutations to be present in the population. Male sterility likely arises first as an adaptation to prevent selfing. Once male sterility has reached a certain prevalence, then female sterility may have a chance to arise and spread. In the domesticated papaya (Carica papaya), three sex chromosomes are present, denoted as X, Y and Yh. This corresponds with three sexes: females with XX chromosomes, males with XY, and hermaphrodites with XYh . The hermaphrodite sex is estimated to have arisen only 4000 years ago, post-domestication of the plant. The genetic architecture suggests that either the Y chromosome has an X-inactivating gene, or that the Yh chromosome has an X-activating gene.  Medical applications  Allosomes not only carry the genes that determine male and female traits, but also those for some other characteristics as well. Genes that are carried by either sex chromosome are said to be sex linked. Sex linked diseases are passed down through families through one of the X or Y chromosomes. Since usually men inherit Y chromosomes, they are the only ones to inherit Y-linked traits. Men and women can get the X-linked ones since both inherit X chromosomes.Biological Basis of Heredity: Sex Linked Genes An allele is either said to be dominant or recessive. Dominant inheritance occurs when an abnormal gene from one parent causes disease even though the matching gene from the other parent is normal. The abnormal allele dominates. Recessive inheritance is when both matching genes must be abnormal to cause disease. If only one gene in the pair is abnormal, the disease does not occur, or is mild. Someone who has one abnormal gene (but no symptoms) is called a carrier. A carrier can pass this abnormal gene to his or her children.Sex-linked recessive - National Library of Medicine - PubMed Health X chromosome carry about 1500 genes, more than any other chromosome in the human body. Most of them code for something other than female anatomical traits. Many of the non-sex determining X-linked genes are responsible for abnormal conditions. The Y chromosome carries about 78 genes. Most of the Y chromosome genes are involved with essential cell house-keeping activities and sperm production. Only one of the Y chromosome genes, the SRY gene, is responsible for male anatomical traits. When any of the 9 genes involved in sperm production are missing or defective the result is usually very low sperm counts and infertility.Sex-Linked Traits Heredity and genetics Khan Academy Examples of mutations on the X chromosome include more common diseases such as color blindness, hemophilia, and fragile-X syndrome. * Color blindness or color vision deficiency is the inability or decreased ability to see color, or perceive color differences, under normal lighting conditions. Color blindness affects many individuals in the population. There is no actual blindness, but there is a deficiency of color vision. The most usual cause is a fault in the development of one or more sets of retinal cones that perceive color in light and transmit that information to the optic nerve. This type of color blindness is usually a sex-linked condition. The genes that produce photopigments are carried on the X chromosome; if some of these genes are missing or damaged, color blindness will be expressed in males with a higher probability than in females because males only have one X chromosome. * Hemophilia refers to a group of bleeding disorders in which it takes a long time for the blood to clot. This is referred to as X-Linked recessive.Hemophilia - National Library of Medicine - PubMed Health Hemophilia is much more common in males than females because males are hemizygous. They only have one copy of the gene in question and therefore express the trait when they inherit one mutant allele. In contrast, a female must inherit two mutant alleles, a less frequent event since the mutant allele is rare in the population. X-linked traits are maternally inherited from carrier mothers or from an affected father. Each son born to a carrier mother has a 50% probability of inheriting the X-chromosome carrying the mutant allele. **Queen Victoria was a carrier of the gene for hemophilia. She passed on the harmful allele to one of her four sons and at least two of her five daughters. Her son Leopold had the disease and died at age 30. As a result of marrying into other European royal families, the princesses Alice and Beatrice spread hemophilia to Russia, Germany, and Spain. By the early 20th century, ten of Victoria's descendants had hemophilia. All of them were men, as expected. *Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition involving changes in part of the X chromosome. It is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability (mental retardation) in males. It is caused by a change in a gene called FMR1. A small part of the gene code is repeated on a fragile area of the X chromosome. The more repeats, the more likely there is to be a problem. Males and females can both be affected, but because males have only one X chromosome, a single fragile X is likely to affect them more. Most fragile-X males have large testes, big ears, narrow faces, and sensory processing disorders that result in learning disabilities.Fragile X Syndrome - Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment of Fragile X Syndrome - NY Times Health Information Other complications include: *46,XX testicular disorder of sex development, also called XX male syndrome, is a condition in which individuals with two X chromosomes in each cell, the pattern normally found in females, have a male appearance. People with this disorder have male external genitalia. In most people with 46,XX testicular disorder of sex development, the condition results from an abnormal exchange of genetic material between chromosomes (translocation). This exchange occurs as a random event during the formation of sperm cells in the affected person's father. The SRY gene (which is on the Y chromosome) is misplaced in this disorder, almost always onto an X chromosome. Anyone with an X chromosome that carries the SRY gene will develop male characteristics despite not having a Y chromosome.46,XX testicular disorder of sex development - Genetics Home Reference  See  * Fisher's principle * Haldane's rule * XY sex-determination system * ZW sex-determination system * X0 sex-determination system  References  Category:Chromosomes mk:–û–¥—Ä–µ–¥—É–≤–∞—ö–µ –Ω–∞ –ø–æ–ª ","title":"Sex chromosome"},{"id":"7123752","text":"A nerve fascicle, or fasciculus is a bundle of funiculi.Siegel, A. & Sapru, H.

Magnetographs are useful for studying the Sun because the surface magnetic field is important to the creation and maintenance of the solar corona, and gives rise to the phenomena of solar flares and space weather. Vector magnetographs measure the longitudinal (line-of-sight) component of the magnetic field separately from the transverse (image-plane) components, using different aspects of the Zeeman splitting that affects the wavelength of emission and/or absorption spectral lines in the presence of a magnetic field. The Zeeman splitting is caused by the fact that individual atoms are magnetized due to the circulating motion of electrons bound to them. Emission or absorption of a photon changes the magnetic moment of the atom. In a magnetic field, photons emitted with different polarizations gain or lose energy depending on their orientation relative to the surrounding magnetic field, changing the characteristics of the spectral line‚Äîsome polarization components are blue-shifted or red-shifted relative to the line's reference wavelength, by a factor proportional to the field intensity. Specifically, the circular-polarized component of the light is shifted in wavelength proportional to the field strength in the direction of the observer, and the wavelength shift of the vertical and horizontal linearly-polarized components measures the field strength in those directions. A vector magnetograph works in a very narrow waveband around a single spectral line, for example the 525.02 nm 'Fe I' line from neutral (non-ionized) iron. The measured shifts in wavelength are fractions of a picometre. Measuring the full spectral profile of the line with this precision requires a high-dispersion spectrograph and a long time to collect sufficient photons to make the measurement with precision. For example, SOLIS requires about an hour to gather polarized spectral profiles over the whole Sun, and Hinode, the recently launched spacecraft with a 0.5-meter solar telescope on board, takes about an hour to cover a 164-arcsecond-square field (1% of the Sun) at very high spatial resolution. Other types of magnetograph use narrowband filter imaging to produce a measurement of the first few moments of the spectral line, and operate much more quickly: the HMI instrument on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory will produce a vector magnetogram every few minutes. The splitting effect is antisymmetric along the line-of-sight, but symmetric transverse to the line of sight, so the transverse component of the field can only be measured up to a factor of -1: there is a 180¬∞ ambiguity in vector magnetograph measurements of portion of the magnetic field that is perpendicular to the line of sight of the instrument. Notable existing vector magnetographs include the IVM at the Mees Observatory in Hawaii, SVM at Udaipur Solar Observatory, India, the SOLIS instrument at the National Solar Observatory (strictly speaking, SOLIS is a scanned spectropolarimeter), and the narrowband filtergraph instrument on the Hinode spacecraft. Planned instruments include a vector polarimeter at the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope slated to be built in the 20-teens, and the HMI instrument aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory, launched in February 2010.

He was loaned to Cowdenbeath for the 1998‚Äì99 season before making his Hearts debut the following year. In 2000, Craig Levein, previously his manager at Cowdenbeath, was appointed Hearts head coach and their familiarity coupled with Hearts' lack of transfer funds, ensured Milne was afforded more first team opportunities. However, Milne was unable to establish himself in the Tynecastle side's starting XI and he left for Partick Thistle in 2002. Milne's first season at Firhill was successful, the Jags exceeding expectations of relegation from the SPL by finishing 10th. Milne himself was converted to a leftback/left-sided centreback by manager John Lambie, and made numerous first team appearances in his new position. Partick struggled following Lambie's retirement though, and following successive relegations in 2003‚Äì04 and 2004‚Äì05, Milne moved to newly promoted Falkirk. Milne enjoyed relative success at the Falkirk Stadium in 2005‚Äì06, playing regularly as the Bairns reaffirmed their top-flight status, as well as notching his first SPL goal. In July 2008, Milne signed for Football League One side Scunthorpe United on a two-year deal. After an impressive debut for Scunthorpe, Milne was carried off in only his 2nd appearance for his new side and subsequently suffered further setbacks. Despite a few attempted returns, he was eventually forced into early retirement in mid-2010, having only made a total of 8 appearances for the club. He remained at Scunthorpe in an unpaid coaching role, while undergoing rehabilitation. In January 2011 it was reported that he was set to make an unexpected return for Scunthorpe's reserves team. He would be required to play as a trialist as he is no longer a registered player. In February 2011, he was told to leave Scunthorpe United by then-manager Ian Baraclough if he wished to play football again.

The light is a two-story white shingled structured topped with a glass-enclosed lantern and is a replica of the 1901 Brant Point Light. The Mystic Seaport Light was designed by William F. Herman Jr. and constructed in 1966. It was formally dedicated in August 31, 1967, but remained unlit due to active navigational regulations imposed by the United States Coast Guard. The Mystic Seaport light is now an active light, but not an official aid to navigation. The structure was used as an example of a lighthouse for Mystic Seaport visitors, but was not part of an exhibit until a 2008 renovation. The interior of the lighthouse was equipped with five LCD televisions to display two short educational films that highlight the history and architectural diversity of American lighthouses. Design and construction The Mystic Seaport Light was designed by William F. Herman Jr. and constructed by Engineered Building in 1966. Funds for the project were donated by Mr. and Mrs. John P. Blair. Mr. Blair was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Marine Historical Association since 1963. The Marine Historical Association was the original name for the Mystic Seaport. Prior to the construction of the light, a total of $5,000 was donated by Coast Guard Auxiliary members from Maine and Delaware to build the keeper's cottage. The original artist's conception called for a generic lighthouse that was designed to be representative of all lighthouses, but the actual design of the lighthouse was later changed to a replica of the 1901 Brant Point Light located on Nantucket Island in Massachusetts. Constructed on the tip of Shipyard Point, it is a two-story white shingled structure topped with a glass-enclosed lantern. The light measures by by . The lighthouse houses a fourth order Fresnel lens. The design of the keeper's house did not change much from the original artist's conception, though Tim Harrison notes that \\"it does not resemble a typical lighthouse keeper's house.\\" The dedication of the lighthouse was held on August 31, 1967, which was described as \\"another quiet[,] but proud ceremony\\" by Mystic Seaport. Care and maintenance of the lighthouse is performed by the Mystic Seaport.  Operational requirements  The Mystic Seaport Light is subject to United States Coast Guard regulations to become operational, and because it is a full-sized replica of a lighthouse, requirements include supervisory schedules and installation of an emergency, backup light. This was not a financial priority for Mystic Seaport in 1967 and it was not made a fully functional lighthouse. In 1979, Brierley noted that the present use of the lighthouse remained as \\"[a]n example of a lighthouse used as a navigational aid.\\" Regardless of its intended function, the lighthouse was used as the starting mark for the Mystic River Day seine boat race in 1981. By 2014, it is active, using a fourth order Fresnel lens on loan from the Coast Guard, but is not an official aid to navigation. Design renovation In late 2007, the Mystic Seaport asked Oudens Ello Architecture to develop a design proposal for the light. Oudens Ello Architecture developed a \\"multilayered system of open wood slats and sound absorptive material creating an interior environment evocative of a Nantucket basket.\\" The task called for an \\"audio-visual display in a single, conical room of little more than 100 square feet.\\" The renovated exhibit was also made wheelchair accessible via a ramp. Sentinels of the Sea In July 2008, the Mystic Seaport Light became part of the visitor experience when the interior was opened as part of the \\"Sentinels of the Sea\\" exhibit.

History Chinese Buddhist monk Faxian at the ruins of Ashoka palace The first record of travel from China is provided in the travelogue of Faxian (Fa-Hien) who visited Tampralipta, in what is now Tamluk in the 5th century AD. Records of immigration for the next sixteen centuries are not reliable although many words in Bengali can be attributed to Chinese influences. For example, chini, the Bengali word for \\"sugar\\" comes from the word for China, and words like Chinamati for porcelain china hint at Chinese influences.Suniti Chatterji. The Origin and Development of Bengali Language, University of Calcutta Press, 1926. The first recorded Chinese settler in India is Tong Achew, a trader who landed near Budge Budge in late 18th century. Achew set up a sugar cane plantation along with a sugar factory. Achew brought in a band of Chinese workers to work in his plantation and factory. This was the first Chinese settlement in India. Achew died shortly after and the Chinese settlers moved to Kolkata. The place came to be named as Achipur, after Tong Achew. Achew's grave and a Chinese temple is still seen in Achipur. Portuguese India Chinese children who were kidnapped by the Portuguese from China were sold as slaves in Portuguese India. By some accounts, the Portuguese roasted and ate some of the Chinese children. In Portuguese India, the Indian Muslim Kunjali Marakkars fought against the Portuguese and raided their shipping. One of the Kunjali Marrakars (Kunjali IV) rescued a Chinese boy, called Chinali, who had been enslaved on a Portuguese ship. The Kunjali was very fond of him, and he became one of his most feared lieutenants, a fanatical Muslim and enemy of the Portuguese, terrorizing them in battle. The Portuguese were terrorised by the Kunjali and his Chinese right-hand man, eventually, after the Portuguese allied with Calicut's Samorin, under Andre Furtado de Mendo√ßa they attacked the Kunjali and Chinali's forces, and they were handed over to the Portuguese by the Samorin after he reneged on a promise to let them go. Diogo do Couto, a Portuguese historian, questioned the Kunjali and Chinali when they were captured. He was present when the Kunjali surrendered to the Portuguese, and was described: \\"One of these was Chinale, a Chinese, who had been a servant at Malacca, and said to have been the captive of a Portuguese, taken as a boy from a fusta, and afterwards brought to Kunhali, who conceived such an affection for him that he trusted him with everything. He was the greatest exponent of the Moorish superstition and enemy of the Christians in all Malabar, and for those taken captive at sea and brought thither he invented the most exquisite kinds of torture when he martyred them.\\" British India Entrance of Nam Soon Church, Kolkata Kolkata, then known as Calcutta, was the capital of British India from 1772 to 1911. It was also geographically the easiest accessible metropolitan area from China by land. One of the first persons of Chinese origin to arrive in Calcutta was Yang Tai Chow (a.k.a Tong Achew and Yang Da Zhao) who arrived in 1778. He was an either northern Chinese or a Hakka from Gunagdong or Fujian province of China judging by the pronunciation of his surname. Governor General Warren Hastings granted land to Achew to set up a sugar cane plantation and sugar factory in a place, currently called Achipur, located near the town of Budge-Budge on the banks of the River Hoogly. According to records of the British East India Company from the year 1778 \\"Achew was granted 650 bighas of land about 6 miles south of Budge ‚Äì Budge for an annual rent of Rs 45\\". Many of the earliest Chinese immigrants worked on the Khidderpore docks. A police report in 1788 mentions a sizable Chinese population settled in the vicinity of Bow Bazaar Street. The sugar mill that Atchew had set up in the patch of land near the town of Budge Budge drew other Chinese migrants and soon a small community had formed around it. By 1783, we know Atchew was dead ‚Äì a letter shows an East India Company attorney trying to extract money from the executor of his estate. An advertisement in the Calcutta Gazette in 1804 announces that the sugar mill was up for sale. A temple and the grave of Tong Achi still remain and are visited by many Chinese who come from the city during the Chinese New Year. One of the earliest records of immigration from China can be found in a short treatise from 1820. This records hints that the first wave of immigration was of Hakkas but does not elaborate on the professions of these immigrants. According to a later police census, there were 362 in Calcutta in 1837. A common meeting place was the Temple of Guan Yu, the god of war, located in the Chinese quarter near Dharmatolla. A certain C. Alabaster mentions in 1849 that Cantonese carpenters congregated in the Bow Bazar Street area. As late as 2006, Bow Bazar is still noted for carpentry, but few of the workers or owners are now Chinese. In Assam, after the establishment of tea gardens in Assam, the British brought in Chinese labourers, artisans, tea growers and tea makers, employing fair or unfair means, and engaged them in the tea gardens. The migration started in 1838. They soon surmounted the language barrier and started intermingling, many of the Chinese married local women and established a new society in Assam. during British colonial times, to the point where it became hard to physically differentiate Chinese in Assam from locals during the time of their internment during the 1962 war. A series of voluntary migrations of Chinese from China followed. This broadened the space of the newly established society and made it more multi-cultural and multi-ethnic as the migrants married local girls and settled down. Their physical features changed; the descendents forgot the Chinese language. Through sheer hard work and perseverance, the dislocated Chinese made a new life for themselves and prospered. Many 'China Patty,‚Äô or small China towns, sprang up in different parts of Assam ‚Äì of which the China Patty of Makum was the biggest.https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/The-Assamese-Chinese- story/article15618808.ece Some Chinese convicts were deported from the early history of Straits Settlements entirely inhabited by Teochew and some Hakka immigrants were sent to be jailed in Madras in India, the \\"Madras district gazetteers, Volume 1\\" reported an incident where the Chinese convicts escaped and killed the police sent to apprehend them: \\"Much of the building work was done by Chinese convicts sent to the Madras jails from the Straits Settlements (where there was no sufficient prison accommodation) and more than once these people escaped from the temporary buildings' in which they were confined at Lovedale. In 1866 seven of them got away and it was several days before they were apprehended by the Tahsildar, aided by Badagas sent out in all directions to search. On 28 July in the following year twelve others broke out during a very stormy night and parties of armed police were sent out to scour the hills for them. They were at last arrested in Malabar a fortnight later. Some police weapons were found in their possession, and one of the parties of police had disappeared‚Äîan ominous coincidence. Search was made all over the country for the party, and at length, on 15 September, their four bodies were found lying in the jungle at Walagh√°t, half way down the Sisp√°ra gh√°t path, neatly laid out in a row with their severed heads carefully placed on their shoulders. It turned out that the wily Chinamen, on being overtaken, had at first pretended to surrender and had then suddenly attacked the police and killed them with their own weapons.\\" Other Chinese convicts in Madras who were released from jail then settled in the Nilgiri mountains near Naduvattam and married Tamil Paraiyan women, having mixed Chinese-Tamil children with them. They were documented by Edgar Thurston.http://www.bulletin247.com/english- news/show/unravelling-chinese-link-can-boost-nilgiris-tourism Paraiyan is also anglicized as \\"pariah\\". Edgar Thurston described the colony of the Chinese men with their Tamil pariah wives and children: \\"Halting in the course of a recent anthropological expedition on the western side of the Nilgiri plateau, in the midst of the Government Cinchona plantations, I came across a small settlement of Chinese, who have squatted for some years on the slopes of the hills between Naduvatam and Gudalur, and developed, as the result of ' marriage ' with Tamil pariah women, into a colony, earning an honest livelihood by growing vegetables, cultivating coffee on a small scale, and adding to their income from these sources by the economic products of the cow. An ambassador was sent to this miniature Chinese Court with a suggestion that the men should, in return for monies, present themselves before me with a view to their measurements being recorded. The reply which came back was in its way racially characteristic as between Hindus and Chinese. In the case of the former, permission to make use of their bodies for the purposes of research depends essentially on a pecuniary transaction, on a scale varying from two to eight annas. The Chinese, on the other hand, though poor, sent a courteous message to the effect that they did not require payment in money, but would be perfectly happy if I would give them, as a memento, copies of their photographs.\\" Thurston further describe a specific family: \\"The father was a typical Chinaman, whose only grievance was that, in the process of conversion to Christianity, he had been obliged to 'cut him tail off.' The mother was a typical Tamil Pariah of dusky hue. The colour of the children was more closely allied to the yellowish tint of the father than to the dark tint of the mother; and the semimongol parentage was betrayed in the slant eyes, flat nose, and (in one case) conspicuously prominent cheek-bones.\\" Thurston's description of the Chinese-Tamil families were cited by others, one mentioned \\"an instance mating between a Chinese male with a Tamil Pariah female\\" A 1959 book described attempts made to find out what happened to the colony of mixed Chinese and Tamils. According to Alabaster, there were lard manufacturers and shoemakers in addition to carpenters. Running tanneries and working with leather was traditionally not considered a respectable profession among upper- caste Hindus, and work was relegated to lower caste muchis and chamars. There was a high demand, however, for high quality leather goods in colonial India, one that the Chinese were able to fulfill. Alabaster also mentions licensed opium dens run by native Chinese and a Cheena Bazaar where contraband was readily available. Opium, however, was not illegal until after India's Independence from Great Britain in 1947. Immigration continued unabated through the turn of the century and during World War I partly due to political upheavals in China such as the First and Second Opium Wars, First Sino- Japanese War and the Boxer Rebellion. Around the time of the First World War, the first Chinese-owned tanneries sprang up. Sino-Indian War Chinese in India faced anti-national sentiment during the Sino Indian war of 1962. After the war, India passed the Defence of India Act in December 1962, permitting the \\"apprehension and detention in custody of any person [suspected] of being of hostile origin.\\" The broad language of the act allowed for the arrest of any person simply for having a Chinese surname, a drop of Chinese blood, or a Chinese spouse. Under the draconian law, 10,000 people of Chinese origin were estimated to have been detained at the desert prison camp in Deoli, Rajasthan. All of them were accused of being spies, but not a single charge has ever been proven. In 1964, many internees were forcibly and arbitrarily deported, resulting in the breakup of many families. The rest were released starting in 1965. The last internees were released from Deoli in mid-1967, after four and half years of captivity. The Chinese population in Calcutta decreased by half, from 20,000 to 10,000. Those who remained were seen as enemies, and most could not hold any job except in the restaurant, tanning, and shoemaking businesses. Moreover, their movements were restricted. They were required to report to designated police stations once a month, and until the mid-1990s, they had to apply for special permits to travel more than a few kilometres from their homes. The situation was alleviated when India and China resumed diplomatic relations in 1976. However, it was not until 1998 that ethnic Chinese were allowed naturalized Indian citizenship. In 2005, the first road sign in Chinese characters was put up in Chinatown, Tangra. In Assam, Chinese people living in different places were rounded up by the armed forces and compelled to leave their houses. The administration told them they would be shifted to a safer place for two or three days. They were not allowed to take anything with them except papers. In the Makum area, they were picked up and packed into a cowshed, from where they were taken to the Dibrugarh jail. In other parts they were arrested and brought to the police station and put in jails. They were then asked to board a closed train, which took them to the Deoli internment camp in Rajasthan. It was a long, seven-day journey of utter suffering. Infants, pregnant women, the old and the sick were also arrested and sent to the camp, violating all human rights. After some time the Government of India decided to deport the interned back to China in a few batches. In this process, the already divided families were divided again as the government selected the names randomly. The majority of them were deported to China. Many Indian (Assamese) wives also accompanied their husbands to China with their children. The interned people who were allowed to return to their places after a couple of years again faced a difficult situation. The property of most of the people had been auctioned as enemy property. There was no society and no government to support them. They were compelled to live in sheer misery and isolation. Most of them did not get to meet their deported family members ever again. Indian Chinese cuisine Chinese Indians also contributed to the development of fusion Indian Chinese cuisine (Chindian cuisine), which is now an integral part of the Indian culinary scene. In particular Chinese influences on Bengali cuisine are pronounced. Communities Chinese New Year 2014 celebration in Kolkata. Chinese Indians Chinese Indians today are located in ethnic neighbourhoods in Kolkata and Mumbai. In Mumbai's Chinatown, there are 400 Chinese Indian families. The population of Chinese in Mumbai stood at 4,000 in 2015. In 2013, there were 2,000 Chinese-Indians live in Kolkata. The most visible Chinese community in India is found in Kolkata where there are two Chinatowns. The main Chinatown of Kolkata is located in Tangra. An earlier Chinatown was established at Tiretta Bazaar is sometimes referred to as the old Chinatown. The Chinese presence at Tiretta Bazaar has dwindled. The older generation of this community works as tannery-owners, sauce manufacturers, shoeshop owners, restaurateurs and beauty parlours owners. The new generation have gone in large numbers to dentistry. Many of the shoe shops lining Bentick Street, near Dharmatolla, are owned and operated by Chinese. The restaurants have given rise to fusions of Chinese (especially Hakka) and Indian culinary traditions in the widely available form of Indian Chinese cuisine. There is one Chinese newspaper published in Kolkata, The Overseas Chinese Commerce in India, but figures from 2005 show that sales have dwindled from 500 to 300 copies sold. At one time, 90% of the students of the Grace Ling Liang English School were ethnic Chinese. But in 2003 they comprised only about 15% of the 1500 students. Many of the Chinese of Kolkata are Christians due to the influence of missionary schools they studied in. Architecturally, a feature of the Chinese imprint on Kolkata are the Chinese temples. The Chinese New Year remains widely observed as well as Hungry Ghost Festival and Moon Festival. The Chinese of Kolkata celebrate Chinese New Year with lion and dragon dance. It is celebrated in the end of January or early February. An exhaustive study of the Kolkata Chinese by Zhang Xing has recently been published. Expatriates Expatriate Chinese in India are concentrated in the cities of Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Bangalore. The Mumbai neighbourhood of Powai is described by the Economic Times as an \\"upcoming hub\\" for Chinese expats, who according to the newspaper \\"form close communities within themselves.\\" Better integration of Chinese expats in their host communities is hampered by short time frames of stays, often durations only last for 2‚Äì3 years as part of a work contract. Also many in order to comply with visa regulations must routinely exit and leave India. Notable people Notable Indian-Chinese include Chindian people who are of mixed Indian and Chinese ancestry. * Jwala Gutta: Indian badminton player; Gutta's mother is of Chinese origin and father is Indian * Lawrence Liang: Indian legal researcher and lawyer * Meiyang Chang: Indian actor and singer; Finalist for Indian Idol 3; Winner, Jhalak Dikhla Jaa 4; Badmaash Company, Sultan, Bharat * Nelson Wang: Indian restaurateur * Sahil Khan: Indian actor * Anand Yang: historian of South Asia See also *Indians in China *Ahom people - Ethnic group in Assam and Arunanchal Pradesh who originated from present day Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in China Notes External links *Kolkata Chinese Community Blog *'Legend of Fat Mama', a 23 minute documentary on Chinatown by Rafeeq Illiyas *Interview with the Principal of Grace Ling Liang English School * Category:Social groups of West Bengal Category:Culture of Kolkata Category:History of Kolkata Category:History of Bengal Category:Immigration to India ","title":"Chinese people in India"},{"id":"7123948","text":"Dave Winters (R-Shirland) is a former Illinois State Representative for the 68th district, serving from 1995 to 2012.

The Hudson's Bay Company held a commercial monopoly in Rupert's Land, consisting of the entire Hudson Bay drainage basin. The Selkirk Concession, also known as Selkirk's Grant, included a large section of the southwest area of Rupert's Land, bounded: on the north by the line of 52¬∞ N latitude roughly from the Assiniboine River east to Lake Winnipegosis, then by the line of 52¬∞ 30‚Ä≤ N latitude from Lake Winnipegosis to Lake Winnipeg; on the east by the Winnipeg River, Lake of the Woods and Rainy River; on the west roughly by the current boundary between modern Saskatchewan and Manitoba; and on the south by the (mostly very slight) rise of land marking the extent of the Hudson Bay watershed. This covered portions of present-day southern Manitoba, northern Minnesota and eastern North Dakota, in addition to small parts of eastern Saskatchewan, northwestern Ontario and northeastern South Dakota.\\"Red River Colony\\". The Canadian EncyclopediaMorris, Alexander (1880) The Treaties of Canada with the Indians of Manitoba and the North-West Territories Including the Negotiations on Which They Were Based, and Other Information Relating Thereto, Chapter I Lord Selkirk referred to the area as the District of Assiniboia and planned to create an agricultural colony there. To do so he populated the territory with impoverished people from Scotland and Ireland. Lord Selkirk had been profoundly upset by the poverty his people faced and believed that emigration to Western Canada would be their salvation. In return he was to provide The Hudson's Bay Company with 200 employees per year, allow for the company to set up trading posts in the colony and to give land for company employees when they retired. In 1812 the first settlers arrived when Miles MacDonell brought a small group of Scots to the colony. While The Hudson's Bay Company held the commercial monopoly in Rupert's Land, numerous aboriginal groups lived in the same territory and disputed the sovereignty of the area. Furthermore, The Hudson's Bay Company was facing competition from the North West Company (NWC), which disputed The Hudson's Bay Company's commercial monopoly. In 1814, The Hudson's Bay Company invoked its royal charter and ordered The North West Company to leave. Selkirk's settlement, commonly known as The Red River Colony, was embroiled in these issues, meeting resistance from fur traders of The North West Company as well as from the local M√©tis population. In November 1815 the newly appointed governor of Red River Colony, Robert Semple, arrived with around 160 new settlers. Tensions continued to rise, culminating in the Battle of Seven Oaks in June 1816. This confrontation involved a force of local M√©tis and North West Company employees led by Cuthbert Grant against a force or Red River settlers and Hudson's Bay Company employees led by Governor Semple, with the battle claiming the lives of 1 North West Company-related and 21 Hudson's Bay Company-related men, including Semple.

Farming the Frontier, The Agricultural Opening of the Oregon Country, 1786-1846. Vancouver, B.C.: University of British Columbia Press. 1985, pp. 10-13. The promise of free land ensured there was no shortage of settlers arriving at the area. By the 1850s the Hudson's Bay Company lost interest in providing financial aid to the colony. In 1867, the United Kingdom had passed the British North America Act, creating the Dominion of Canada from British holdings in the eastern portion of British North America. In 1869 the HBC \\"sold\\" Rupert's Land (received compensation for surrendering its trading monopoly back to the British Crown) to the expanding Canada. A lack of attention to concerns of the existing Red River settlers, M√©tis, and aboriginal groups caused M√©tis leader Louis Riel to establish a local provisional government to negotiate the political treatment of the local population in the handover to Canada, resulting in the Red River Rebellion of 1869-70 and Canada agreeing to create the province of Manitoba - on land that had been part of the Selkirk Concession - in 1870.

Stephen Hopkins (settler), a distant maternal line ancestor (see below), was given permission to build a house and cut hay near this farm in 1638, but the first house in Yarmouth built by an Englishman was built by his son Giles in 1638.Andrews, H. Franklin \\"Hamlin Family: A Genealogy of James Hamlin of Barnstable MA\\" (Quintin Publications Collection) 1902 Through many generations, it remained in the Taylor family until 1896, when Lucy W. Taylor sold the farm to George and William Bray, two brothers who had worked for the Taylors, and who were probably distant relatives. The property that Lucy sold for $400 included 50 acres (20 hectares) of uplands and adjacent marshlands which were capable of producing each year six tons of a combination of salt and fresh hay. The deed described the property as being in that part of Yarmouth known as Hockanom. It was sustained as a prosperous working farm by the Bray family until 1941. They continued to harvest salt marsh hay from Black Flat Marsh to feed their farm animals. The Brays often sold their strawberry and blueberry crops from a wheelbarrow on Old Kings Highway. In 1946 Robert J Williams purchased the farm and 88 acres for the tax due on the property. He moved from New Jersey to work for the Buzzards Bay Gas company until he retired. Robert Williams along with wife Katherin and son Robert Jr. lived on the farm and restored and improved the original farmhouse and surrounding land. They also improved the barn and a small apartment built into the side of the hill under the large ice-age boulder adjacent to the barn. Robert Williams introduced sheep to the farm and maintained them throughout his ownership. Although he worked a full-time job, he raised the sheep like the proud Welshman he was. He showed his sheep all over Massachusetts in county fairs. He sheared them and sold the wool. He also had several large vegetable gardens as well as wild and cultivated blueberries, and raspberries. The farm provided a great deal of food for the family. Robert Jr. built a home up the road for his new wife, and had a son in that house in the mid-1950s. Later he would move the family to south Yarmouth. The grandchildren would spend weekends on the farm up until the mid-1960s. The Williams family sold the farm they loved and cared for to a developer in the 1970s when Katherine became ill and could not keep up with the demands of the property. The terms stipulated that the farmhouse and barn be preserved. The Williams family saved the farm from destruction in the 1940s and in the 1970s. By the late 1980s, ownership changed hands a number of times, and the buildings saw neglect. In 1987, the prospect of non-farm use of the landCraig Williams, grandson of Robert Williams and weekend resident on the farm for many years. prompted the Town of Yarmouth to purchase the property. The specific intent was \\"to maintain the farm for historic preservation and conservation\\". Tenant/managers have lived in the farmhouse, welcoming the public and educating school groups about the farm's history and natural environment. The farm, a rare survivor of a type of property that once characterized north side agricultural development, was placed on the National Register of Historical Places in 1993. The farm consists of approximately 22 acres (8 hectares) bordering Chase Garden Creek and the Black Flats marsh and includes four fixed structures, including a Cape farmhouse, a barn, a caretaker's cottage, and a small storage building. A small flock of sheep is still kept at the farm. The non-profit Taylor‚ÄìBray Farm Preservation Association (TBFPA) and the Yarmouth Historical Commission began an active collaboration in 2001 aimed at fixing up the property for greater public enjoyment. Extensive work remains to further restore the late-18th-century farmhouse and barn.  Earliest farming conditions  An unpublished biography of Richard \\"Rock\\" Taylor by Mrs. Elizabeth Bray describes earliest farming conditions, the crude cow-houses, crude shelters for crops, and suitable fruit trees, mostly applicable to the neighboring larger Hallett farm. A cow-house (barn) only sheltered the cows and other stock; the fodder (usually salt hay) was stacked outside. The crops (corn) were stored in crude shelters made of poles with only the roof made of boards. The Kentish cherry trees were planted around the edge of the orchard to protect the less hardy trees within. The apple trees were often inferior seedlings, but could be good Pignoses (winter apple) or Foxwell (fall apple), or grafts on the inferior seedlings. The pears were also inferior seedlings, but there were grafts of the French Sugar Pear and the Black Worcester, and later the Catherine (from Boston) and the Orange; the trees were hardy and long-lived.\\"Genealogical Notes of Barnstable Families\\" (reprint of Amos Otis papers originally published in the Barnstable Patriot), Cape Cod Library of Local History and Genealogy, Volume 1 (Yarmouthport MA, The \\"Register\\" Press)  See also  *Plymouth Colony *Constance Hopkins Children of Constance and Nicholas Snow *National Register of Historic Places listings in Barnstable County, Massachusetts References External links * Taylor‚ÄìBray Farm * Taylor‚ÄìBray Farm Preservation Association * Chartier, Craig \\"Archaeology and History at the Taylor‚ÄìBray Farm, Yarmouth Port, MA * Historical Society of Old Yarmouth *Smith, Leonard H., Jr. \\"The Taylor Family of Yarmouth\\", Cape Cod Library of Local History and Genealogy, Volume 2 (Genealogical Publishing Co.

It is the nation's fifth oldest light station and the seventh oldest U.S. lighthouse. It is both the oldest and the tallest lighthouse in Connecticut and on Long Island Sound, with its tower reaching 90 feet. The light is visible for 15 miles and consists of three seconds of white light every six seconds. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. It is currently owned and maintained by the New London Maritime Society as part of the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act program.http://www.theday.com/local/20150806/new-london-maritime-society- takes-over-as-new-london-ledge-light-owner Location New London Harbor Light is located at Lighthouse Point in southern New London, just east of Guthrie Beach off Pequot Avenue. In addition to the lighthouse, the station includes the keeper's house, a small two-story brick residence. The property once also included a barn, an oil house, and an engine room; all of these structures have been removed. History The original New London Harbor Lighthouse was built on the west side of the entrance to New London Harbor in 1760. Connecticut ceded the lighthouse to the United States according to the \\"Memoranda of Cessions\\" of 7 August 1789. On May 7, 1800, Congress appropriated funds to rebuild the lighthouse, and it was removed in 1801 when the current stone tower was built. In 1855, a fourth-order Fresnel lens replaced the original 11 lamps with reflectors. Illumination was converted to oil-vapor lamp in 1909 and to acetylene in 1912. The light was electrified in 1930. The present keeper's house was built in 1863, and was enlarged in 1900 to accommodate the families of married keepers. The light was acquired by the New London Maritime Society in 2010.

It is located in the Belgrade's municipality of Palilula and statistically is part of Borƒça.  Location  Crvenka is located in Banat section of the municipality, half kilometer away from the left bank of the Danube, on the Batin kanal stream. It is built in the thickly forested area and surrounded by marshes of Panƒçevaƒçki Rit so, even being close, it can't be seen from the opposite, Zemun bank and it is not near to any other settlements of Belgrade.  History  During the 18th century an Austrian sentry post was erected here and was named Crvenka (Serbian for red land or red place). The settlement was built after the World War II. It developed as an experimental agricultural farm of the University of Belgrade‚Äôs Faculty of Agriculture, which is seated across the Danube, in the neighborhood of Zemun. The settlers came to Crvenka as they were needed for the work, instead of being colonized like in the other settlements in Panƒçevaƒçki Rit. Part of the original settlers were Germans who left for Germany in the 1960s.  Characteristics  Part of Crvenka is a weekend-settlement which means it has no permanent population. It consists of some 100 houses, mostly owned by the residents of Zemun, even though it is located across the river, in different municipality. Public transportation bus line 104 connects Crvenka to Belgrade‚Äôs neighborhood of Bogoslovija. The canal that flows through the settlement, Batin canal used to be broader and navigable, with colonies of wild ducks and white herons and it was used by the Belgrade's kayaking clubs for trainings. Since the canal was illegally dammed to create a path to Borƒça with tree trunks, the water flow was stopped, the canal began flooding the surrounding area and wild birds moved out. Crvenka gained some public notoriety when on 2 April 2016 a murder occurred on the settlement's embankment. Little known folk singer Jelena Marjanoviƒá was murdered and the viciousness of the crime, botched investigation by the police and a fact that the crime has not been solved, turned the murder into the cause c√©l√®bre in Serbia.  Future  In the mid 2000s, city government announced plans to urbanize the area which would be centered at Crvenka, as the core of the future ‚ÄûThird Belgrade‚Äú (after ‚Äûold‚Äú Belgrade and New Belgrade). Some of the requirements for the plan to develop was the construction of the northern part of the Belgrade bypass and the Pupin Bridge, which opened in 2014. However, due to the push of the Belgrade Waterfront project, plans are halted.

Originally published in 1919, it is in the public domain.Buttel, p. 120 Despite general agreement that it is indebted to Botticelli's The Birth of Venus, there is uncertainty about the nature of the debt. Helen Vendler takes it as obvious that the poem is about \\"our impoverished American Venus, who has none of the trappings of Botticelli's Venus, but who will eventually accumulate aura and mythological fullness through new American art\\".Vendler, p. 82 She dismisses the English poet Craig Raine's identification of the paltry nude with a sailboat. (\\"The nude is, one guesses, a sailing boat....Later, the ship will be weather-beaten, a goldener nude, and will eventually sink.\\"Raines, p. 66; quoted in Vendler, pp. 81-82) That only confirms that \\"the English incomprehension of Stevens continues almost unabated\\", she acidly remarks, conceding that Frank Kermode is the exception that proves the rule. She might concede that the \\"archaic\\" one of the first two lines is foam-arisen Aphrodite, who the paltry nude is not, but might well disapprove of the suggestion that the one who \\"scuds the glitters\\" is the American Venus (reduced to scudding on a weed) and that \\"the goldener nude\\" is Botticelli's Venus. Ronald Sukenick declares with equal certainty that \\"the nude is an emblematic figure of spring. There is a comparison between spring, in the first part of the poem, and a similar figure representing summer, in the latter part. Thus spring is 'paltry,' particularly early spring, spring at the start of her voyage, as compared with the fullness of summer described later on.\\"Sukenic, p. 37 He also declares that the correct word is \\"scurry\\", not the \\"scrurry\\" of the Collected Poems as reproduced here. (Ibid.) Compare Stevens's poem \\"Bantam in Pine-Woods\\" which also makes a statement about the new American art.  Notes   References  * Buttel, R.

It was filmed on location in England. In the years following its release, the film has garnered a large cult following.  Plot  Two beautiful women, Fran (Marianne Morris) and Miriam (Anulka Dziubinska) roam the English countryside. They lure unsuspecting men to their estate for orgies of sex and blood. But when an innocent young couple John and Harriett (Brian Deacon and Sally Faulkner) stumble into the vampires' lair, they find themselves sucked into an unforgettable vortex of savage lust and forbidden desires.  Cast   Production  Vampyres was shot on a modest budget of ¬£42,000 (). Effective use is made of erstwhile Hammer horror set Oakley Court and interiors were shot in Harefield Grove, a grade-II listed, early- nineteenth-century country house in the London borough of Hillingdon. Eroticism and graphic violence are interspersed with poetic dreamlike sequences, as when Fran and Miriam, after showering away the blood from their latest victim, flee to a nearby cemetery (Denham churchyard) at break of dawn. One of Vampyres' unique improvisations on the vampire genre is the decision for its vampires to feed out of a cut in the arm of victim Ted. Larraz explains his impetus behind this choice, saying, \\"I imagine my vampires turn almost to cannibalism, to eat somebody, to take the blood from anywhere, no matter if it is on the arm or on the balls!\\" Film theorist Barbara Creed called this wound \\"one of the most grotesque sights in the film.\\" Anulka had been featured in Playboy's \\"Girls of Munich\\" pictorial in 1972, and appeared as the magazine's Playmate of the Month in May 1973. While Vampyres was her first acting role on film, Anulka went on to appear in Ken Russell's Lisztomania (1975) and Michael Tuchner's The Likely Lads (1976). Prior to Vampyres, Marianne Morris had appeared in Corruption (1968), Lovebox (1972), Just One More Time (1974), and Percy's Progress (1974). Morris appeared naked in the October 1976 edition of British men's magazine Mayfair. The making of the film was briefly covered in the 1974 BBC documentary The Dracula Business.  Release  The film was bought by the British distributor Fox-Rank in 1974, who did not release it until 1976 as a double-feature with The Devil's Rain. Vampyres was distributed in the US by Cambist, who released it uncut with an X certificate. It was initially censored in the UK, with 2 minutes and 21 seconds of gory and sexual content cut. Larraz called this cut of the film \\"the Vatican version\\". Vampyres is now available uncut on DVD. The uncut Blu- ray was released by Blue Underground on 30 March 2010, and includes commentary with director Jos√© Ram√≥n Larraz and producer Brian Smedley-Aston, interviews with stars Marianne Morris and Anulka, the international trailer, and the U.S. trailer.Blue-Underground Unleashing Vampyres on Blu-ray  Alternate titles  * Blood Hunger * Daughters of Dracula (U.S.) * Satan's Daughters * Vampyres, Daughters of Dracula (Brazil, Mexico) * Vampyres: Daughters of Darkness (U.S.)  Reception  Vampyres received a mixed reception, with many reviews focusing on the film's explicit depiction of female bisexuality. The Independent Film Journal suggested that the film \\"bares enough flesh and suggestive coupling to link it to the softcore circuit rather than the traditional horror market\\". Variety's Frank Segers wrote that the film \\"indicates b.o. [box office] potential in appropriate adult situations...combining lesbian predilections with the usual bloodthirsty vampirical ways.\\" The UK press response also concentrated on the film's sexual content, despite its cuts. David Pirie wrote in The Monthly Film Bulletin, \\"it is rare for sex and violence to be so completely and graphically integrated in a British movie (left surprisingly intact by the censor).\\" Screen International's Marjorie Bilbow called Vampyres \\"A let down for horror addicts, with fringe benefits for voyeurs.\\"  Remake  A remake, also called Vampyres, was directed by V√≠ctor Matellano and released in 2015.\\"Vampyres (2015)\\"  References   Further reading   ‚Äì A novelisation of the film written by Tim Greaves, published in the UK in 2001 by Strega  External links   Category:1974 films Category:1974 horror films Category:British horror films Category:British films Category:British LGBT-related films Category:English-language films Category:Erotic horror films Category:Vampires in film Category:LGBT-related horror films Category:Films set in country houses Category:Bisexuality-related films Category:1974 LGBT-related films ","title":"Vampyres (film)"},{"id":"7124069","text":"Dzaoudzi‚ÄìPamandzi International Airport is an airport located in Dzaoudzi, Mayotte, France on the southern tip of the island of Petite-Terre (or Pamanzi), located east of Grande-Terre, the main island of Mayotte.

Design Studies were led in parallel with the one of the 140 C. The 42-000s were of simple expansion with two cylinders and possessed the powerful fireboxes of the 140-100s. Although the fireboxes were excellent, the rest was of average quality with cylinders particularly of small diameter (). The Chemin de fer de l'√âtat chose small wheels to give the engines the capacity for quick acceleration. The railway company was very satisfied with the engines as they were capable of hauling the heavy steel coaches. Construction This series of 20 engines, numbered 42-001 to 42-020, was built by Fives-Lille and was allocated to the Batignolles motive power depot. Although they were designed in 1913, production was delayed by World War I until 1923, when the Chemins de Fer de l'√âtat took delivery. Service They were designed to serve in the western suburbs of Paris. In 1930, the engines were equipped with for push-pull operation. The driver could operate the engine from the driving cabin of a Voiture √âtat √† 2 √©tages carriage at the other end of the train, using compressed-air pipes. This saved much time at terminals. The engines were modified, primarily with the addition of a smoke deflector and a closed cab. The 42-000s were renumbered 3-141.TC 1 to 20 by the SNCF in 1938. The electrification of the R√©seau Saint-Lazare moved the engines to Brittany. The last of the series were allocated to the St-Brieux depot and rented to the Soci√©t√© g√©n√©rale de chemins de fer et de transport automobile (CFTA) after R√©seau Breton lines between Carhaix and Paimpol had been re-gauged from metre gauge to standard gauge. The last 141.TC was withdrawn in 1971. Preservation One locomotive has been preserved: 42-019, later SNCF 3-141.TC.19 (Fives-Lille 4328 of 1923) is preserved by AJECTA at the Mus√©e vivant du chemin de fer in Longueville, Seine-et-Marne, and has been designated a Monument historique.

Goldberg purchasing the club from long-serving chairman Ron Noades. Palace were relegated from the FA Premier League that season - for the third time in six years. The takeover deal also saw Italian Serie A side Juventus have a 10% stake in Palace, with a view to Juventus players being loaned or sold to Palace. Goldberg also set a target into turning Palace into a leading European club by 2003. At the end of the 1997-98 season, he appointed Terry Venables as head coach and former manager Steve Coppell as Director of football. The club was not successful under his chairmanship and in January 1999 it was taken over by administrators who counted ¬£22 million of debts, including ¬£2m owed to Terry Venables and ¬£7m to banks, the remainder to football clubs, players and HMRC. The club also failed to reach the standards set when Goldberg took over, with their financial crisis not being solved until a takeover by Simon Jordan was completed more than a year later, and a return to the Premier League was not achieved until 2004. Bromley Goldberg's brother-in-law, Jerry Dolke, had become chairman of non-league Bromley and during the 2005-06 season the pair announced the controversial decision that Goldberg would replace the highly successful and highly popular George Wakeling and his management team, who had led to the Premier Division of the Isthmian League, and then secured survival by a long distance. Goldberg's start in management was successful, leading Bromley to promotion into the Conference South division via the play-offs. His first pre-season included a tie against the youth team of Crystal Palace and his competitive start was good, with Bromley topping the Premier Division after his first eleven games and reaching the First Round of the FA Cup before losing 4‚Äì1 to League One side Gillingham. Goldberg left Bromley during the 2007‚Äì08 season, to be succeeded by Simon Osborn, but returned to the club at the end of the season. In April 2009, Goldberg suffered serious damage to his knee ligament while playing for Bromley Veterans in an Isthmian Veterans Cup semi-final.

It was originally called the Southwest Ledge light, but this caused confusion with Southwest Ledge Light in New Haven, Connecticut, so it was renamed New London Ledge Light in 1910. The United States Coast Guard took over in 1939 upon its merger with the Lighthouse Service and the light was automated in 1987. The original fourth order Fresnel lens was removed and was later put on display in the Custom House Maritime Museum. The light was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Ghost legend New London Ledge is locally famous for the ghost of an early keeper named Ernie who allegedly haunts the lighthouse. The Coast Guard crew on duty at the lighthouse reported unexplained knockings taking place at night, as well as doors opening and closing repeatedly, the television turning on and off by itself sporadically, and the unexplained removal of sheets from beds.New London Ledge Lighthouse, Connecticut at Lighthousefriends.com An unknown Coast Guard officer wrote the following in the crew's log on the last night before the automated light system was installed: \\"Rock of slow torture. Ernie's domain. Hell on earth‚Äîmay New London Ledge‚Äôs light shine on forever because I‚Äôm through. I will watch it from afar while drinking a brew.\\" Ledge Light has been featured on paranormal reality shows such as Scariest Places on Earth and Ghost Hunters.

History When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, what would become PA 68 was designated as Legislative Route 243 between the Ohio border and Rochester, Legislative Route 78 between Rochester and Butler, Legislative Route 214 between Butler and Clarion, and Legislative Route 98 in a portion of Forest County. PA 68 was designated in 1927 to run from the Ohio border in Beaver County northeast to US 6/US 119/US 120/PA 6/PA 7 in Kane, running along its current routing to Clarion before continuing to Kane. At this time, the entire route was paved between the Ohio border and Clarion except for a portion between Rimersburg and Sligo. Between Clarion and Kane, the entire route was unpaved except for a portion near Marienville and to the southwest of Kane. A year later, the route between Rimersburg and Sligo was paved. By 1930, PA 68 paved between US 322 northwest of Clarion and Paint Mills, Arthurs and Snydersburg, and around Leeper while the state highway was under construction between Paint Mills and Arthurs, Snydersburg and southwest of Leeper, and the Clarion/Forest county line and Roses. In the 1930s, the entire length of the route between Clarion and Kane was paved. PA 68 was extended northwest from Kane along a paved road to PA 59 in Kinzua in 1935. In 1961, the Pennsylvania Department of Highways approved moving the northern terminus of PA 68 to US 6 in Kane, with PA 321 replacing much of the route north of Kane. The former northern terminus at PA 59 in Kinzua was inundated with the creation of the Allegheny Reservoir. In 1970, the north end of PA 68 was cut back to its current location at US 322 in Clarion, with the route between US 322 northwest of Clarion and US 6 in Kane replaced by a rerouted PA 66. This change was made to keep truck traffic away from the Toby Bridge, which had a 15-ton weight limit and collapsed from an incident with a truck in 1969. Northbound trucks were instead directed to follow I-80 and PA 66 to avoid the bridge along the former PA 68 alignment.

Owned by Freelancer Television Broadcasting, it is sister to Lake City-licensed NewsNet owned-and-operated station WMNN-LD (channel 26). The two stations share studios on West 13th Street in Cadillac; WXII-LP's transmitter is located west of downtown Traverse City near Harris and Cedar Run roads. On cable, the station is available on Charter Spectrum channel 11 throughout the northern Lower Peninsula. Starting in 2010, it was also carried on Charter in the eastern Upper Peninsula (including Sault Ste. Marie). History On December 12, 1996, a construction permit was issued for a low-power television station on UHF channel 51 in Pinconning, Michigan with the call sign W51CS. In 2001, the permit was moved to VHF channel 12 in Traverse City under call letters W12CX. In 2003, the call letters were changed to WLLZ-LP. From 1980 to 1996, the WLLZ calls were used by an album oriented rock FM radio station broadcasting on 98.7 in the Detroit area, nicknamed \\"Detroit's Wheelz\\" (later Smooth Jazz WVMV \\"V98.7\\" and now top-40 \\"AMP Radio\\" WDZH). After the FM station dropped the call letters, they were used for several years on an AM station in the market, and were picked up by Channel 12 after the AM station dropped them in 2003. WLLZ's owner at the time, P & P Cable Holdings, is known for picking up calls discarded by other Michigan radio and television stations for use on their own stations. WLLZ-LP signed on in January 2004 as an affiliate of Urban America Television. It added America One programming to its schedule in Summer 2004. WLLZ became a full affiliate of the network in May 2006 when Urban America Television ceased operations. Logo as \\"My TV 12\\", from 2008 until 2017 In June 2008, the station was added to Charter digital channel 202 throughout the northern Lower Peninsula. It moved to the basic tier on channel 72 in December 2008 and has now moved to channel 11 in 18 counties on Charter cable. Also in December 2008, WLLZ became a primary affiliate of MyNetworkTV; the station was then branded as \\"My TV 12\\". Until then, there was no local affiliate in the northern Michigan market. On May 15, 2009, WLLZ discontinued an affiliation with The Sportsman Channel (which was phasing out its over-the-air affiliations) and added RTV, with America One programming significantly reduced (though not entirely eliminated). Previously from 2007 until 2008, NBC affiliate WPBN-TV (channel 7) carried RTV on a second digital subchannel. This was dropped in favor of a simulcast of ABC affiliate WGTU (channel 29). Due to its low-powered status, WLLZ was exempt from switching to digital-only broadcasting on June 12, 2009. The station discontinued their affiliation with America One in 2015, when it merged with Youtoo TV into Youtoo America, allowing a contractual out of that agreement. With the start of the 2015‚Äì16 season, WLLZ has wound down carrying nearly all of their syndicated programming, with Cozi TV being carried most of the day and MyNetworkTV in prime time. On November 1, 2017, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the sale of WLLZ-LP to Freelancer Television Broadcasting, Inc.CONSENT TO ASSIGNMENT Federal Communications Commission, November 1, 2017 On December 4, 2017, the sale to Freelancer Television Broadcasting was completed, making it a sister station to WMNN-LD; the station then modified its branding to \\"Mi TV 12\\". It changed its call sign to WXII-LP on December 21, 2017. On April 23, 2019, the FCC granted WXII-LP a construction permit to operate a digital companion channel on UHF channel 30. In the meantime, digital over-the-air access to this station is being provided through a simulcast over a digital subchannel of co-owned station, WMNN-LD. Programming WXII-LP currently carries three programs in syndication: How I Met Your Mother, Last Man Standing and Bones. News programming Until May 2009, WLLZ aired INN National News, a newscast produced by Independent News Network in Davenport, Iowa from America One. It also carried a video simulcast of an hour of radio station WMKT's morning show hosted by Greg Marshall. The simulcast was discontinued in early 2011. In late 2017, following the station's callsign switch to WXII-LP, sister station WMNN-LD began producing 90-second news updates for channel 12 that aired during prime time over the first commercial break aired each hour. News programming expanded in March 2018, when WMNN-LD began producing hour-long 7:00 and 11:00 p.m. newscasts for the station each weeknight. The early newscast competes against a half-hour newscast produced by CBS affiliate WWTV (channel 9) that airs on Fox affiliate WFQX-TV (channel 32), while the 11:00 p.m. competes against longer-established late night newscasts on WWTV (and its Sault Ste. Marie satellite WWUP, channel 10), and WPBN-TV (and its Cheboygan satellite WTOM-TV, channel 4) as well as a pre-recorded broadcast on the latter's sister ABC affiliate, WGTU (and Sault Ste.

If conducted under stream of ammonia, then deep blue needle-like crystals of the tetrammine form. In presence of oxygen, concentrated solutions give rise to nitrites Cu(NO2)2(NH3)n. The nitrite results from oxidation of the ammonia. Reactions with cellulose Schweizer's reagent was once used in production of cellulose products such as rayon and cellophane. Cellulose, which is quite insoluble in water (hence its utility as clothing), dissolves in the presence of Schweizer's reagent. Using the reagent, cellulose can be extracted from wood pulp, cotton fiber, and other natural cellulose sources. Cellulose precipitates when the solution is acidified. It functions by binding to vicinal diols. Presently, the reagent is used in the analysis of the molecular weight of cellulose samples. History These properties of Schweizer's reagent were discovered by the Swiss chemist Matthias Eduard Schweizer (1818‚Äì1860),(Schweizer, 1857), p. 110: \\"Dieselbe besitzt n√§mlich in ausgezeichnetem Grade das Verm√∂gen, bei gew√∂hnlicher Temperatur Pflanzenfaser aufzul√∂sen. Uebergiesst man gereinigte Baumwolle mit der blauen Fl√ºssigkeit, so nimmt erstere bald eine gallertartige schl√ºpfrige Beschaffenheit an, die Fasern gehen auseinander und verschwinden und nach einigem Durcharbeiten mit einem Glasstabe hat sich das Ganze in eine schleimige Fl√ºssigkeit verwandelt. Dabei findet nicht die geringste W√§rmeentwicklung statt. Hat man nicht eine hinreichende Menge der Fl√ºssigkeit angewendet, so bleibt ein Theil der Fasern noch sichtbar; setzt man dann aber einen Ueberschuss der L√∂sung hinzu und sch√ºttelt um, so erh√§lt man eine beinahe klare blaue L√∂sung, die sich, nachdem sie mit Wasser verd√ºnnt worden ist, filtriren l√§sst.\\" (It possesses, namely, to an outstanding degree the capacity to dissolve plant fibers at ordinary temperatures. If one pours the blue liquid over cleaned cotton, then the former soon assumes a gelatinous, slippery texture, the fibers separate and vanish, and after some kneading with a glass rod, the whole transformed into a slimy liquid. During this, not the least evolution of heat occurred. If one did not use a sufficient quantity of liquid, then a portion of the fibers still remained visible; however, if one then adds an excess of the solution and shakes it, then one obtains a nearly clear blue solution, which, after it has been diluted with water, can be filtered.) after whom the reagent is named.

The series was first broadcast on BBC Three, in 2005, and repeated on BBC One in 2006. Among some of the more notable moments were Car Skittles; a stunt where the guests had to drive on to the back of a moving lorry, before letting them all drive a Ferrari - with a bathtub of water attached to the back which they were not allowed to spill. They were asked to race in a variety of motor-esque machines, from the aforementioned armchairs to Formula 1 cars. The final round of each show, between the two top-ranking guests, features the use of the car cannon in attempts to hit various things. The show originated as a one-off special of the popular BBC Two show, Top Gear, and was produced, as were a number of other television specials, in aid of charity Comic Relief for Sport Relief in 2004.

During his 14 years at The Dell he became virtually an institution, and by the end of his career he held the record for appearances for Southampton. Playing career Dundalk Traynor was born in Dundalk and originally was the product of local club St Patricks. He had just turned 17 years of age when he was promoted, on 10 September 1950, from the club's reserve and youth squad for a Dublin City Cup trip to Limerick's Market's Field. Keeping his place for the next two games which were away from home he made his Oriel Park debut on 31 December 1950 in a League of Ireland as a substitute in a game against Sligo Rovers. He was a member of a high quality Dundalk youth squad that had progressed to the semi-finals of both the FAI and Leinster Minor Cups and included some International and Inter-League players. For the next season, his place was with the reserves until injuries saw him line out in a League game against Sligo in early February, on the weekend before the first round 1952 FAI Cup clash versus St Patrick's Athletic. This time there was no going back to the reserves. A superb Cup game secured his place for the remainder of the season, thanks to a merciless sliding tackle and a deceptive turn of speed. A tough tackling, uncompromising defender, by the season's end he had in his possession a coveted FAI Cup medal, after Dundalk defeated Cork Athletic in a final replay, an Amateur international Cap against Scotland. Southampton He turned down offers from Chelsea and Manchester City to join Southampton in June 1952; he made his debut on 11 October 1952 away to Brentford making 10 appearances as Saints went on to be relegated from Division 2 at the end of that season. The following season, in Division 3, he became the club's regular left-back and his merciless sliding tackles and deceptive turn of pace stood him in good stead as Saints began the long haul back to Division 2. Although he was not the most athletic player, he had a super football brain and a great left foot. Tommy won eight Republic of Ireland national football team caps between 1954 and 1964 making his debut against Luxembourg in 1954 . By the time of Southampton's promotion season in 1966, age was catching up with him and he only made one appearance in his final season, at home to Preston on 27 November 1965. In his later years, he became an influential figure at the club, and he was granted a prestigious testimonial against FC Twente. During his time at The Dell he amassed 487 appearances for the club, scoring eight goals. After football Traynor was a founding member of the Southampton Tyro League in the late 1960s. After retiring at the end of the 1965‚Äì66 season, he briefly ran an off-licence and worked in Southampton Docks. He died in September 2006 at the age of 73 after a short illness.

The lighthouse is about two miles (3 km) from Calf Pasture Beach in Norwalk and can be seen from the beach. The cast-iron structure is still a working lighthouse operated by the United States Coast Guard and is not open to the public. The lighthouse is painted white with a brown band in the middle. Inside, the structure has three stories of living space along with a basement with cisterns for rainwater storage, all below a watchroom and lantern. History The lighthouse was built in 1906 and had a fourth order Fresnel lens. The light was automated by the Coast Guard in 1933 and now flashes green every 2.5 seconds. In 1988 the Fresnel lens was removed and a 250 mm optic was installed. In 1990 the lighthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 2004 the Coast Guard installed 100 tons of granite riprap as well as a section of step-cut stones to allow for easier access. Despite damage from vandalism, nesting birds, and corrosion, the structure is still said to be in good shape.

Schwarz \\"1831: Nat Turner's Rebellion,\\" American Heritage, August/September 2006. led by Nat Turner. The rebels killed between 55 and 65 people, at least 51 of whom were white. The rebellion was put down within a few days, but Turner survived in hiding for more than two months afterwards. The rebellion was effectively suppressed at Belmont Plantation on the morning of August 23, 1831. There was widespread fear in the aftermath, and militias organized in retaliation to the rebels. The state executed 56 slaves accused of being part of the rebellion, and many non-participant slaves were punished in the frenzy. Approximately 120 slaves and free blacks were murdered by militias and mobs in the area. State legislatures passed new laws prohibiting education of slaves and free black people, restricting rights of assembly and other civil liberties for free black people, and requiring white ministers to be present at all worship services. Nat Turner Nat Turner (October 2, 1800 ‚Äì November 11, 1831) was an African-American slave preacher who led the four-day rebellion of enslaved and free black people in Southampton County, Virginia in 1831. Born into slavery on October 2, 1800, in Southampton County, Virginia, an area with more blacks than whites, Turner was recorded as \\"Nat\\" by Benjamin Turner, his family‚Äôs owner. When Benjamin Turner died in 1810, Nat was inherited as property by Benjamin's son Samuel Turner. For most of his life, he was known as \\"Nat\\", but after the 1831 rebellion, he was widely referred to as \\"Nat Turner\\".Greenburg 2003, pp. 3‚Äì12. According to Greenburg, the trial transcript refers to him on the first mention as \\"Nat alias Nat Turner\\" and subsequently as \\"Nat\\". Thomas Ruffin Gray's The Confessions of Nat Turner, which purports to be Turner's confession and account of his life leading up the rebellion, was the most influential source of the name by which he is known, Greenburg writes. Turner knew little about the background of his father, who was believed to have escaped from slavery when Turner was a young boy., Greenburg 2003, p. 18. Turner spent his entire life in Southampton County, a plantation area where enslaved people comprised the majority of the population.Greenburg 2003, p. 278. Turner learned how to read and write at a young age. He was identified as having \\"natural intelligence and quickness of apprehension, surpassed by few.\\" He grew up deeply religious and was often seen fasting, praying, or immersed in reading the stories of the Bible.Aptheker (1993), p. 295. He frequently had visions which he interpreted as messages from God, and these visions influenced his life. He ran away at age 21 from Samuel Turner, his owner. He returned a month later after becoming delirious from hunger and receiving a vision which told him to \\"return to the service of my earthly master\\".Gray (1831), p. 9. He had his second vision in 1824 while working in the fields under a new owner, Thomas Moore. In it, \\"the Saviour was about to lay down the yoke he had borne for the sins of men, and the great day of judgment was at hand\\".Gray (1831), p. 10. Turner often conducted services, preaching the Bible to his fellow enslaved people, who dubbed him \\"The Prophet\\". Turner garnered white followers such as Etheldred T. Brantley, whom Turner was credited with having convinced to \\"cease from his wickedness\\". By the spring of 1828, Turner was convinced that he \\"was ordained for some great purpose in the hands of the Almighty\\". He \\"heard a loud noise in the heavens\\" while working in Moore‚Äôs fields on May 12, \\"and the Spirit instantly appeared to me and said the Serpent was loosened, and Christ had laid down the yoke he had borne for the sins of men, and that I should take it on and fight against the Serpent, for the time was fast approaching when the first should be last and the last should be first\\".Gray (1831), p. 11. Joseph Dreis wrote: \\"In connecting this vision to the motivation for his rebellion, Turner makes it clear that he sees himself as participating in the confrontation between God's Kingdom and the anti-Kingdom that characterized his social-historical context.\\" He was convinced that God had given him the task of \\"slay[ing] my enemies with their own weapons.\\" Turner said: \\"I communicated the great work laid out for me to do, to four in whom I had the greatest confidence\\" ‚Äì his fellow enslaved people Henry, Hark, Nelson, and Sam. In 1830, Joseph Travis purchased Turner, and Turner later recalled that he was \\"a kind master\\" who had \\"placed the greatest confidence in\\" him. Turner eagerly anticipated God's signal to \\"slay my enemies with their own weapons\\". He witnessed a solar eclipse on February 12, 1831 and was convinced that it was the sign for which he was waiting, so he started preparations for an uprising against the slave owners of Southampton County by purchasing muskets. He \\"communicated the great work laid out to do, to four in whom I had the greatest confidence\\", his fellow slaves, Henry, Hark, Nelson, and Sam. After the rebellion, a reward notice described him as: > 5 feet 6 or 8 inches [168‚Äì173 cm] high, weighs between 150 and 160 pounds > [68‚Äì73 kg], rather \\"bright\\" [light-colored] complexion, but not a mulatto, > broad shoulders, larger flat nose, large eyes, broad flat feet, rather > knockneed, walks brisk and active, hair on the top of the head very thin, no > beard, except on the upper lip and the top of the chin, a scar on one of his > temples, also one on the back of his neck, a large knot on one of the bones > of his right arm, near the wrist, produced by a blow.Description of Turner > included in a $500 reward notice in the Washington National Intelligencer on > September 24, 1831. Turner was hanged on November 11 in Jerusalem, Virginia. Skull In 2002, a skull said to have been Turner's was given to Richard G. Hatcher, the former mayor of Gary, Indiana, for the collection of a civil rights museum he planned to build there. In 2016, Hatcher returned the skull to two of Turner's descendants. Since receiving the skull, the family has temporarily placed it with the Smithsonian Institution, where DNA testing will be done to determine whether it is the authentic remains of Nat Turner. If the test renders positive results, the family plans to bury his remains next to his descendants. Another skull said to have been Turner's was contributed to the College of Wooster in Ohio upon its incorporation in 1866. When the school's only academic building burned down in 1901, the skull was saved by Dr. H. N. Mateer. Visitors recalled seeing a certificate, signed by a physician in Southampton County in 1866, that attested to the authenticity of the skull. The skull was eventually misplaced. Preparations Turner started with a few trusted fellow slaves. \\"All his initial recruits were other slaves from his neighborhood\\". The neighborhood men had to find ways to communicate their intentions without giving up their plot. Songs may have tipped the neighborhood members to movements. \\"It is believed that one of the ways Turner summoned fellow conspirators to the woods was through the use of particular songs.\\" Turner's Rebellion Annular sun eclipse on February 12, 1831 Beginning in February 1831, Turner claimed certain atmospheric conditions as a sign to begin preparations for a rebellion against slaveowners. On February 12, 1831, an annular solar eclipse was visible in Virginia. (This was coincidentally Abraham Lincoln's 22nd birthday.) He believed the eclipse to be a sign that it was time to revolt. Turner envisioned this as a black man's hand reaching over the sun., Allmendinger Jr., David F. Nat Turner and the Rising in Southampton County. Baltimore, MD, Johns Hopkins University Press, 2014. pp. 21‚Äì22. Turner originally planned to begin the rebellion on July 4, Independence Day, 1831, but he had fallen ill and used the delay for additional planning with his co-conspirators. An atmospheric disturbance on August 13 made the sun appear bluish-green, possibly the result of lingering atmospheric debris from an eruption of Mount St. Helens in present-day Washington state; he took it as the final signal and began the rebellion a week later, on August 21. He started with several trusted fellow slaves, and ultimately gathered more than 70 enslaved and free blacks, some of whom were on horseback. The rebels traveled from house to house, freeing slaves and killing all the white people whom they encountered. Muskets and firearms were too difficult to collect and would gather unwanted attention, so the rebels used knives, hatchets, axes, and blunt instruments. The rebellion did not discriminate by age or sex and members killed white men, women, and children.Francis Simkins and Charles Roland, A History of the South (New York: Alfred Knopf, 1971), 126; Philip Leigh The Confederacy at Flood Tide (Yardley, Pa.: Westholme Publishing, 2016), 193 Nat Turner confessed to killing only one person, Margaret Whitehead, whom he killed with a blow from a fence post. Historian Stephen B. Oates states that Turner called on his group to \\"kill all the white people\\". A newspaper noted, \\"Turner declared that 'indiscriminate slaughter was not their intention after they attained a foothold, and was resorted to in the first instance to strike terror and alarm.'\\"Richmond Enquirer, November 8, 1831, quoted in Aptheker, American Negro Slave Revolts, p. 299. Aptheker notes that the Enquirer was \\"hostile to the cause Turner espoused.\\" p. 298. The group spared a few homes \\"because Turner believed the poor white inhabitants 'thought no better of themselves than they did of negroes.'\\" The black rebels killed approximately 60 people before they were defeated by the state militia. Of the total killed, many were women and children. Eventually, the state militia infantry were able to defeat the insurrection with twice the manpower of the rebels, reinforced by three companies of artillery. Turner also thought that revolutionary violence would serve to awaken the attitudes of whites to the reality of the inherent brutality in slave-holding. Turner later said that he wanted to spread \\"terror and alarm\\" among whites. Retaliation Belmont, where the rebellion was quashed Within a day of the suppression of the rebellion, the local militia and three companies of artillery were joined by detachments of men from the and , which were anchored in Norfolk, and militias from counties in Virginia and North Carolina surrounding Southampton.Aptheker (1993), p. 300. The state executed 56 black people, and militias killed at least 100 more.Aptheker, American Negro Slave Revolts, p. 301, citing the Huntsville, Alabama, Southern Advocate, October 15, 1831. Another estimate was that 120 blacks were killed, most of whom were not involved with the rebellion. Rumors quickly spread among that the slave revolt was not limited to Southampton and that it had spread as far south as Alabama. Fears led to reports in North Carolina that \\"armies\\" of slaves were seen on highways, and that they had burned and massacred the white inhabitants of Wilmington, North Carolina, and were marching on the state capital. Such fear and alarm led to whites' attacking blacks throughout the South with flimsy cause; the editor of the Richmond Whig described the scene as \\"the slaughter of many blacks without trial and under circumstances of great barbarity\\".Richmond Whig, September 3, 1831, quoted in Aptheker, American Negro Slave Revolts, p. 301. The white violence against the black people continued two weeks after the rebellion had been suppressed. General Eppes ordered troops and white citizens to stop the killing: > He will not specify all the instances that he is bound to believe have > occurred, but pass in silence what has happened, with the expression of his > deepest sorrow, that any necessity should be supposed to have existed, to > justify a single act of atrocity. But he feels himself bound to declare, and > hereby announces to the troops and citizens, that no excuse will be allowed > for any similar acts of violence, after the promulgation of this > order.Richmond Enquirer, September 6, 1831, quoted in Aptheker, American > Negro Slave Revolts, p. 301. Reverend G. W. Powell wrote a letter to the New York Evening Post stating that \\"many negroes are killed every day. The exact number will never be known.\\"New York Evening Post, September 5, 1831, quoted in Aptheker, American Negro Slave Revolts, p. 301. A company of militia from Hertford County, North Carolina, reportedly killed 40 blacks in one day and took $23 and a gold watch from the dead. Captain Solon Borland led a contingent from Murfreesboro, North Carolina, and he condemned the acts \\"because it was tantamount to theft from the white owners of the slaves\\". Blacks suspected of participating in the rebellion were beheaded by the militia, and \\"their severed heads were mounted on poles at crossroads as a grisly form of intimidation\\". A section of Virginia State Route 658 remains labeled as \\"Blackhead Signpost Road\\" in reference to these events.Marable, Manning (2006), Living Black History. White militias and mobs attacked blacks in the area, killing an estimated 200 men, women, and children, many of whom were not involved in the revolt. During the rebellion, Virginia legislators targeted free blacks with a colonization bill, which allocated new funding to remove them to Africa, and a police bill that denied free blacks trials by jury and made any free blacks convicted of a crime subject to sale into slavery and relocation. Capture Turner eluded capture for six weeks but remained in Southampton County. On October 30, a white farmer named Benjamin Phipps discovered him hidden among the local Nottoway people, in a depression in the earth, created by a large, fallen tree that was covered with fence rails. While awaiting trial, Turner confessed his knowledge of the rebellion to attorney Thomas Ruffin Gray, who compiled what he claimed was Turner's confession. He was tried on November 5, 1831 for \\"conspiring to rebel and making insurrection\\"; he was convicted and sentenced to death. Southampton Co., VA, Court Minute Book 1830‚Äì1835, pp. 121‚Äì23 \\"Proceedings on the Southampton Insurrection, Aug‚ÄìNov 1831\\" He was asked if he regretted what he had done, and he responded, \\"Was Christ not crucified?\\" He was hanged on November 11 in Jerusalem, Virginia, and his corpse was drawn and quartered. According to some sources, he was beheaded as an example to frighten other would-be rebels. Some sources claim Turner was beheaded or decapitated; see: French 2004, 278‚Äì79 Turner received no formal burial; his headless remains were possibly buried in an unmarked grave. Soon after Turner's execution, Thomas Ruffin Gray published The Confessions of Nat Turner. His book was derived partly from research Gray did while Turner was in hiding and partly from jailhouse conversations with Turner before trial. This work is the primary historical document regarding Nat Turner, but some historians believe Gray's portrayal of Turner is inaccurate. Legal response In the aftermath of the rebellion, dozens of suspected rebels were tried in courts called specifically for the purpose of hearing the cases against the slaves. Most of the trials took place in Southampton, but some were held in neighboring Sussex County plus a few in other counties. Most slaves were found guilty and many were then executed, while others were transported outside the state but not executed; 15 of the slaves tried in Southampton were acquitted.Alfred L. Brophy, \\"The Nat Turner Trials\\", North Carolina Law Review (June 2013), volume 91: 1817‚Äì80. Of the 30 convicted, 18 were hanged while 12 were sold out of state. Of the five free blacks tried for participation in the insurrection, one was hanged while the others were acquitted.Walter L. Gordon, III, The Nat Turner Insurrection Trials: A Mystic Chord Resonates Today (Booksurge, 2009) pp. 75, 92.Greenberg, Kenneth S., Nat Turner: A Slave Rebellion in History and Memory, 2003, p.71. At least seven slaveowners sent legislative petitions for compensation for the loss of their slaves without trials during or immediately after the insurrection. They were all rejected.Brophy (2013), pp. 1831‚Äì1835. The Virginia General Assembly debated the future of slavery the following spring. Some urged gradual emancipation, but after Virginia's leading intellectual, Thomas R. Dew, President of the College of William and Mary, published a pamphlet defending the wisdom and benevolence of slavery, and the folly of its abolition, the pro-slavery side prevailed. The General Assembly passed legislation making it unlawful to teach reading and writing to slaves, free blacks, or mulattoes, and restricting all blacks from holding religious meetings without the presence of a licensed white minister.Virginia: A Guide to the Old Dominion (1992), p. 78 Other slave-holding states in the South enacted similar laws restricting activities of slaves and free blacks. Across Virginia and other Southern states, legislators made criminal the possession of abolitionist publications by either whites or blacks. Some free blacks chose to move their families north to obtain educations for their children. Some white people, such as teachers Thomas J. Jackson (later to be famous in the American Civil War as Gen. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson) and Mary Smith Peake, and George H. Thomas (a future Union general and child at the time of his doing this) violated the laws and taught slaves to read. Overall, the laws enacted in the aftermath of the Turner Rebellion enforced widespread illiteracy among slaves. As a result, most newly freed slaves and many free blacks in the South were illiterate at the end of the American Civil War. Freedmen and Northerners considered the issue of education and helping former slaves gain literacy as one of the most critical in the postwar South. Consequently, many Northern religious organizations, former Union Army officers and soldiers, and wealthy philanthropists were inspired to create and fund schools for the betterment of African Americans in the South. Although Reconstruction legislatures passed authorization to establish public education for the first time in the South, a system of legal racial segregation was later imposed under Jim Crow laws, and black schools were systematically underfunded by Southern states. Legacy The fear caused by Nat Turner's insurrection and the concerns raised in the emancipation debates that followed resulted in politicians and writers responding by defining slavery as a \\"positive good\\". Such authors included Thomas Roderick Dew, mentioned above. Other Southern writers began to promote a paternalistic ideal of improved Christian treatment of slaves, in part to avoid such rebellions. Dew and others believed that they were civilizing black people (who by this stage were mostly American-born) through slavery. The writings were collected in The pro-slavery argument, as maintained by the most distinguished writers of the southern states (1853). Interpretations The massacre of blacks after the rebellion was typical of the pattern of white fears and overreaction to blacks fighting for their freedom; many innocent blacks were killed in revenge. African Americans have generally regarded Turner as a hero of resistance, who made slaveowners pay for the hardships they had caused so many Africans and African Americans. James H. Harris, who has written extensively about the history of the black church, says that the revolt \\"marked the turning point in the black struggle for liberation.\\" According to Harris, Turner believed that \\"only a cataclysmic act could convince the architects of a violent social order that violence begets violence.\\" In the period soon after the revolt, whites did not try to interpret Turner's motives and ideas. Antebellum slaveholding whites were shocked by the murders and had their fears of rebellions heightened; Turner's name became \\"a symbol of terrorism and violent retribution.\\" \\"In the opinion of many\\", Turner's revolt was related to linked with Wm. Lloyd Garrison's new abolitionist newspaper The Liberator, which began earlier in 1831. Mr. Garrison \\"would not be permitted to live long, ...he would be taken away, and no one be the wiser for it. ...[I]f Mr Garrison were to go to the South, he would be dispatched immediately, ...[an] opinion expressed by persons at the South, repeatedly.\\" Southern states tightened restrictions on both free and enslaved blacks, trying to get the free blacks to go somewhere else and keep the enslaved ones incommunicado by prohibiting teaching and severely restricting preaching. Military readiness was looked into: South Carolina built a series of arsenals to ensure weapons would be available. Northern states shared much the same feeling: a proposal to create a college for African Americans in New Haven was overwhelmingly rejected (see New Haven Excitement), and schools in New Hampshire and Connecticut were destroyed by group violence (see Noyes Academy and Canterbury Female Boarding School). In an 1843 speech at the National Negro Convention, Henry Highland Garnet, a former slave and active abolitionist, described Nat Turner as \\"patriotic\\", saying that \\"future generations will remember him among the noble and brave.\\"Henry Highland Garnet, A Memorial Discourse (Philadelphia: J. M. Wilson, 1865), pp. 44‚Äì51. In 1861 Thomas Wentworth Higginson, a northern writer, praised Turner in a seminal article published in Atlantic Monthly. He described Turner as a man \\"who knew no book but the Bible, and that by heart who devoted himself soul and body to the cause of his race.\\" In the 21st century, writing after the September 11 attacks in the United States, William L. Andrews drew analogies between Turner and modern \\"religio-political terrorists\\". He suggested that the \\"spiritual logic\\" explicated in Confessions of Nat Turner warrants study as \\"a harbinger of the spiritualizing violence of today's jihads and crusades.\\" Legacy and honors * In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Nat Turner as one of the 100 Greatest African Americans.Asante, Molefi Kete (2002). 100 Greatest African Americans: A Biographical Encyclopedia, Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books. . * In 2009, in Newark, New Jersey, the largest city-owned park to be built was named Nat Turner Park, in his honor.

He was professionally known as Lorenzo Elliott Semple Jr. Biography Semple attended the Brooks School in North Andover, Massachusetts, graduating in 1940. He then attended Yale University, but left in 1941 to join the American Field Service in North Africa, where his boyish beard earned him the nickname \\"the goat\\".

Semple also tried writing for the theatre and had a play produced on Broadway, Tonight in Samarkand (1955), a melodrama adapted from the French. He wrote an episode for The Alcoa Hour called \\"Archangel Harrison\\" (1955). He wrote another play, Golden Fleecing, which was filmed for Matinee Theatre in 1958 and premiered on Broadway in 1959.Lorenzo Semple Jr. at Internet Broadway Database Semple wrote \\"China Boy\\" for the TV series Buckskin (1958), \\"Four Against Three Millions\\" and \\"Money Go Round\\" for Target (1958), and \\"Epitaph for a Golden Girl\\" for Pursuit (1958). \\"Golden Fleecing\\" was bought by MGM and produced under the title The Honeymoon Machine (1961), starring Steve McQueen, following which Semple relocated to Hollywood and established himself as a writer for several television shows, including Kraft Suspense Theatre (\\"Knight's Gambit\\" 1964), Breaking Point (\\"Never Trouble Trouble Till Trouble Troubles You\\" 1964), The Rogues (\\"Death of a Fleming \\" 1964), Theatre of Stars (\\"The Fliers\\" 1965), Burke's Law (several episodes)'. Batman Semple is best known as a writer for TV's Batman (1966-68) starring Burt Ward and Adam West While living in Spain in 1965, Semple was approached by producer William Dozier to develop a television series for ABC based on the comic book Batman. Semple wrote a pilot which was promptly picked up, and the series based on it put on the air, with popular success. Semple wrote the first four episodes. Semple also served as Executive Story Editor. At the same time he provided the screenplay for the 1966 Batman feature film version. He also wrote one double episode of the television series The Green Hornet called \\"Beautiful Dreamer,\\" which was broadcast in October 1966. He co-wrote a TV movie Thompson's Ghost (1966) and did episodes of The Rat Patrol (1966) and wrote \\"You're Only Young Twice\\" for Vacation Playhouse (1967). Film career From the late 1960s onwards, Semple focused on films. His success with the Batman film saw he and director Leslie Martinson re-teamed on Fathom (1967), a spy spoof for Raquel Welch. His script for the critically acclaimed cult film Pretty Poison (1968) won the award of the New York Film Critics Circle Awards as best screenplay of its year. He rewrote Larry Cohen's script Daddy's Gone A-Hunting (1969), and wrote the little seen The Sporting Club (1971). The Marriage of a Young Stockbroker (1971) was an attempt to match the success of The Graduate. Semple was one of several writers on the box office hit Papillon (1973). He received writing credit on a series of thrillers: The Super Cops (1974), The Parallax View (1974), The Drowning Pool (1975) and Three Days of the Condor (1975). Dino De Laurentiis Three Days of the Condor had been produced by Dino De Laurentiis, who hired Semple repeatedly over the next few years. He wrote the popular but critically assailed King Kong-remake (1976); Hurricane (1979), a major box office flop starring Mia Farrow, on which Semple is also credited as Executive Producer; and Flash Gordon (1980), again a comic strip derivative, done in a deliberately over-the-top style reminiscent of the \\"Batman\\" sensibility. As with his Batman, serious comic-strip devotees assailed Semple for the allegedly disrespectful approach he took to the printed originals. After Never Say Never Again (1983), a non-Eon Productions film in the James Bond series which brought Sean Connery back to the role for the last time, Semple wrote a final comic book adaptation, Sheena (1984), based on the comic book Sheena, Queen of the Jungle. He wrote a TV movie. Rearview Mirror (1984) and an Imperial war film that was never completed, The Bengal Lancers! (1984). He was credited on Never Too Young to Die (1986) and the TV movie Rapture (1993). Later career Subsequently, Semple and retired agent and producer Marcia Nasatir reviewed movies on YouTube as the Reel Geezers. In September 2008, he was hailed by the Writers Guild of America as a Living Legend. In 2010, the American Cinemateque presented a two-night retrospective of his movies in Santa Monica. In January 2013, author Jon Dambacher dedicated his short novel \\"A Strange, Sickly Beauty\\" to him. Death Semple died of natural causes at his home in Los Angeles, California, just one day after his 91st birthday.

The field of live blood microscopy is unregulated, there is no training requirement for practitioners and no recognised qualification, no recognised medical validity to the results, and proponents have made false claims about both medical blood pathology testing and their own services, which some have refused to amend when instructed by the Advertising Standards Authority. It has its origins in the now-discarded theories of pleomorphism promoted by G√ºnther Enderlein, notably in his 1925 book Bakterien-Cyklogenie. In January 2014 prominent live blood proponent and teacher Robert O. Young was arrested and charged for practising medicine without a license, and in March 2014 Errol Denton, a former student of his, a UK live blood practitioner, was convicted on nine counts in a rare prosecution under the Cancer Act 1939, followed in May 2014 by another former student, Stephen Ferguson. Overview Proponents claim that live blood analysis provides information \\"about the state of the immune system, possible vitamin deficiencies, amount of toxicity, pH and mineral imbalance, areas of concern and weaknesses, fungus and yeast.\\" Some even claim it can \\"spot cancer and other degenerative immune system diseases up to two years before they would otherwise be detectable\\" or say they can diagnose \\"lack of oxygen in the blood, low trace minerals, lack of exercise, too much alcohol or yeast, weak kidneys, bladder or spleen.\\" Practitioners include alternative medicine providers such as nutritionists, herbologists, naturopaths, and chiropractors. Dark field microscopy is useful to enhance contrast in unstained samples, but live blood analysis is not proven to be useful for any of its claimed indications. Two journal articles published in the alternative medical literature found that darkfield microscopy seemed unable to detect cancer, and that live blood analysis lacked reliability, reproducibility, and sensitivity and specificity. Edzard Ernst, professor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter and University of Plymouth, notes: \\"No credible scientific studies have demonstrated the reliability of LBA for detecting any of the above conditions.\\" Ernst describes live blood analysis as a \\"fraudulent\\" means of convincing patients to buy dietary supplements. Quackwatch has been critical of live blood analysis, noting dishonesty in the claims brought forward by its proponents. The alternative medicine popularizer Andrew Weil dismissed live blood analysis as \\"completely bogus\\", writing: \\"Dark-field microscopy combined with live blood analysis may sound like cutting-edge science, but it's old-fashioned hokum. Don't buy into it.\\" Common diagnoses There are several common diagnoses by the LBA practitioners that are actually based on observation of artifacts normally found in microscopy, and ignorance of basic biological science: *Acid in the blood: When the red blood cells stack on top of one another and appear like stacks of coins, it is called ‚Äòrouleaux‚Äô formation. By observation of the rouleaux, the LBA practitioners diagnose ‚Äòacid in the blood‚Äô, while other practitioners suggest a weak pancreas. Rouleaux of red blood cells under the microscope is an artifact which occurs when the blood sample at the edge of the coverslip starts to dry out; where a large number of red blood cells clump together; or when the blood starts to clot when contacted with the glass. These artifacts are observed in only small, selected areas on the slide, while near the center of the slide the red blood cells are free floating. Blood acidosis is a severe illness and can not be diagnosed by observation of blood, nor treated by dietary supplements. *Uric acid crystals and/or cholesterol plaques: Microscopic splinters of glass are often present when the slide is not cleaned thoroughly. Observation of such shards is claimed by the LBA practitioners to be uric acid crystals or cholesterol plaques, and thus to be indicative of ‚Äòacid imbalance, stress or poor lymphatic circulation‚Äô among other vague ailments. Uric acid crystals and cholesterol plaques, if present, are not visible in the blood samples. *Parasites: Particles of dirt and debris, commonly found on glass slides not cleaned thoroughly, or slightly deformed red blood cells are mistaken to be parasites. Patients with parasites in the blood stream would be very sick and in need of immediate medical care, not by nutritional or herbal supplements or life style change as often recommended by LBA practitioners. *Bacteria and yeast: LBA practitioners observe small irregular shape on the red blood cell membrane, a common artifact, and claim it represents bacteria or yeasts budding off the edge of the cell membrane. This claim violates the basic principle of biology that each living organism is unique and can not be transformed from one into another. Presence of bacteria or yeasts in the blood indicates the patient is in danger of developing sepsis, a life-threatening condition. *Fermentations: Light spots on some red blood cells are identified by LBA practitioners as fermentations caused by high sugar content in the blood. Fermentation is a chemical reaction of breaking down sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide catalyzed by enzymes produced in yeast. The red blood cells are not yeasts and cannot ferment sugar. Regulatory issues In 1996, the Pennsylvania Department of Laboratories informed three Pennsylvania chiropractors that Infinity2's \\"Nutritional Blood Analysis\\" could not be used for diagnostic purposes unless they maintain a laboratory that has both state and federal certification for complex testing. In 2001, the Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General issued a report on regulation of \\"unestablished laboratory tests\\" that focused on live blood cell analysis and the difficulty of regulating unestablished tests and laboratories. In 2002, an Australian naturopath was convicted and fined for falsely claiming that he could diagnose illness using live blood analysis after the death of a patient. He was acquitted of manslaughter. He subsequently changed his name and was later banned from practice for life.Court orders life ban on naturopath, Brisbane Times, April 4, 2008 In 2005, the Rhode Island Department of Health ordered a chiropractor to stop performing live blood analysis. An attorney for the State Board of Examiners in Chiropractic Medicine described the test as \\"useless\\" and a \\"money-making scheme... The point of it all is apparently to sell nutritional supplements.\\" A state medical board official said that live blood analysis has no discernible value, and that the public \\"should be very suspicious of any practitioner who offers this test.\\" In 2011, the UK General Medical Council suspended a doctor's licence to practise after he used live blood analysis to diagnose patients with Lyme disease. The doctor accepted he had been practising \\"bad medicine\\". In 2013, following several Advertising Standards Authority adjudications against claims made by LBA practitioners, the Committee of Advertising Practice added new guidelines to their AdviceOnline database advising what LBA marketers may claim in their advertising material. These state that \\"CAP is yet to see any evidence for the efficacy of this therapy which, without rigorous evidence to support it, should be advertised on an availability-only platform.\\" One of these practitioners, Errol Denton, who practised out of a serviced office in Harley Street, was prosecuted in December 2013 under the Cancer Act 1939, and chose to use a Freeman on the Land defence.Harley Street practitioner claimed he could cure cancer and HIV with lifestyle changes and herbs, court hears, Daily Telegraph, Dec 11 2013 On March 20, 2014 he was convicted on nine counts under the Cancer Act 1939 and fined ¬£9,000 plus around ¬£10,000 in costs.Eastern Daily Press , 20 March 2014 In April 2018, Denton was further convicted of two counts of \\"engaging in unfair commercial practice\\" and one of \\"selling food not of the quality demanded\\", for selling a bottle of colloidal silver drink to an undercover trading standards officer in February 2016, after examining a drop of her blood and from it claiming that she had dislocated her shoulder. He was made the subject of a Criminal Behaviour Order, fined ¬£2,250, and ordered pay ¬£15,000 in costs.

The southern terminus is at the Mason‚ÄìDixon line in Montgomery Township, where the road continues into Maryland as Maryland Route 494 (MD 494). The northern terminus is at an interchange with U.S. Route 22 (US 22) and US 322 northeast of Port Royal. PA 75 is a two-lane undivided road that passes through the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians in Franklin and Juniata counties. The route heads north from the Maryland border in Franklin County to Mercersburg, where it runs concurrent with PA 16 and PA 416. From Mercersburg, PA 75 heads north and crosses US 30 in Fort Loudon before it runs northeast through a long valley, where it has an interchange with the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 76 or I-76) in Willow Hill. The route turns north and heads into Juniata County, where it continues through another valley. PA 75 passes through Port Royal and crosses the Juniata River before it comes to its terminus at US 22/US 322. PA 75 was designated in 1928 to run from US 30 in Fort Loudon north to US 22 (William Penn Highway) northeast of Port Royal. In 1937, PA 75 was extended south from Fort Loudon to the Maryland border. The route was realigned to bypass Blairs Mills on a shorter alignment to the east in the 1930s. In the 1970s, PA 75 was extended north to the new US 22/US 322 freeway on a road that was widened into a divided highway by 1990. Route description Franklin County PA 75 northbound past its southern terminus at MD 494 at the Maryland border in Montgomery Township PA 75 begins at the Maryland border in Montgomery Township, Franklin County, where the road continues south into that state as MD 494. From the state line, the route heads north on two-lane undivided Fort Loudon Road through open agricultural areas with occasional homes. The road passes through Kasiesville before coming to Claylick and intersecting PA 995. PA 75 runs through more farmland with some woods and residences, passing through Shimpstown. The road heads through more open agricultural areas prior to entering the borough of Mercersburg, where it passes homes. PA 75 comes to an intersection with PA 16/PA 416, where it turns northwest to form a concurrency with the two routes on Buchanan Trail West. The three routes turn north onto Main Street and passes homes and businesses in the center of Mercersburg. In the northern part of town, PA 16 heads to the northwest with PA 75 and PA 416 continuing northeast on Fort Loudon Road. The road passes a few residential and commercial areas before crossing into Peters Township and heading into agricultural surroundings. PA 416 splits from PA 75 by continuing northeast on Mercersburg Road. At this point, the route runs through more open farmland with some residences, passing through Dickey. The road turns northwest to run a short distance east of the West Branch Conococheague Creek before coming to an intersection with US 30 near Fort Loudon. Here, PA 75 turns to the north and becomes Path Valley Road, passing through rural areas of homes. The route heads into forested areas with some homes between Tuscarora Mountain to the west and Kittatinny Mountain to the east, crossing into Metal Township. The road turns east for a short distance before heading north again, passing through Richmond Furnace. PA 75 runs through more forests before heading into a narrow agricultural valley with a few residences and curving to the northeast, heading through Metal. Farther to the northeast, the agricultural valley widens and the route runs through Fannettsburg and Springtown before coming to a ramp providing access to I-76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike). At this point, the road runs through more rural valley areas a short distance to the east of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, passing through Willow Hill prior to passing under the Pennsylvania Turnpike. PA 75 runs through more open farmland and enters Fannett Township, coming to an intersection with PA 641 in the community of Spring Run. The route heads through more rural areas and passes through Dry Run. The road heads into a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes and turns north at Doylesburg, coming to a junction with the western terminus of PA 274. Past this intersection, PA 75 continues to the north and heads through Concord before heading into forested areas and crossing through a gap in Tuscarora Mountain. Juniata County PA 75 enters Lack Township in Juniata County and becomes an unnamed road, running through Spears Grove. The road turns northeast into valley farmland with some woods and homes, passing through Waterloo. At this point, the route begins to run to the southeast of the Tuscarora Creek, heading through more rural areas. PA 75 heads into a narrow agricultural valley with some woods and homes as it passes near Pearluck. Farther northeast, the road heads into Tuscarora Township and runs through the residential community of East Waterford before passing through more farmland. The route heads through an area of forests before heading back into agricultural areas and reaches PA 850 in Honey Grove, where the two routes briefly run concurrent across Laurel Run. The road continues between farmland to the northwest and forested Tuscarora Mountain to the southeast before turning north into open agricultural areas and heading into Spruce Hill Township. Here, PA 75 turns northeast again and runs through more rural areas, passing through Spruce Hill. The road briefly curves north before resuming northeast, heading between wooded areas to the northwest and agricultural areas to the southeast. The route continues into Turbett Township and intersects the northern terminus of PA 74, heading through more farmland and woodland with some homes. PA 75 heads north-northeast as it comes to an intersection with PA 333 in Old Port. Here, PA 75 turns north to join PA 333 on Market Street, crossing the Tuscarora Creek into the borough of Port Royal, where PA 333 splits to the northwest. PA 75 turns to the northeast and passes several homes. The route comes to a bridge that carries it over Norfolk Southern's Pittsburgh Line, a portion of the town, and the Juniata River. After crossing the river, the road heads into Walker Township and turns northeast as an unnamed road into agricultural areas with occasional residences. PA 75 passes near a few commercial establishments and turns to the north-northeast. After crossing William Penn Highway (Old US 22), the route becomes a four-lane divided highway and runs through a mix of farmland and woodland, ending at an interchange with the US 22/US 322 freeway. The road continues north past this interchange as Industrial Park Road. History When routes were legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, what is now PA 75 was designated as Legislative Route 45 between Fort Loudon and Port Royal. PA 75 was designated in 1928 to run from US 30 in Fort Loudon north to US 22 (William Penn Highway) northeast of Port Royal. Upon designation, the route was paved between north of Richmond Furnace and PA 35 in Blairs Mills and between southwest of Port Royal and US 22 while the remainder was unpaved. By 1930, the route was paved south from Richmond Furnace to US 30 while the section between Pleasant View and southwest of Port Royal was under construction. In 1937, PA 75 was extended south from Fort Loudon to the Maryland border south of Mercersburg. In the 1930s, PA 75 was realigned to bypass Blairs Mills by way of a shorter alignment to the east, with the former alignment now Blairs Mills Road and Church Road. The entire length of the route was paved in the 1930s. In the 1970s, PA 75 was extended northeast from William Penn Highway to the new US 22/US 322 freeway. By 1990, the route was widened to a divided highway between William Penn Highway and US 22/US 322.

Types of fruit Apple picking Apple picking in Styria Apple picking is an activity found at apple farms. Apple orchards may be opened to the public, allowing consumers to pick their own apples or purchase pre-picked apples. Although this is ultimately a method of purchasing apples, it is often a social activity as well. Apple picking is often a very popular dating ritual in the American Midwest. Apple orchards catering to a family outing will provide additional activities beyond the picking of apples. Many have petting zoos, restaurants and country shops that sell related products such as home-made jams and jellies. This aspect of the activity is especially popular in the Northeastern United States & Southern Ontario and Southern Qu√©bec in Canada. The apples that fall off the trees are often used to make apple cider. Apple cider is a juice made grinding the apples, then pressing out the juice. Workers Fruit-growing polytunnels with caravans for the mainly Eastern European fruit workers conveniently parked behind, Perth and Kinross, Scotland, March 2009 Most fruit picking is done by migrant workers, who can be paid relatively low wages. In California, Mexican migrants most frequently do the work. There has been much controversy about replacing workers with automation. It puts many out of work. In Australia and New Zealand, people engaging in backpacker tourism do a lot of the fruit-picking work while on a working holiday visa. The Australian government encourages people on this visa to do this sort of work for a minimum of three months so they can add another year to their visa. This benefit does not apply to all parts of Australia - one must undertake work in selected post-code areas to become eligible for the extra year. Monoculture orchards can face particular labor-timetable issues. Automation As labor costs are still quite expensive in fruit picking, robots are being designed that can replace humans for this kind of work. The research is still in full progress, especially as the robots need to be carefully designed so that they do not bruise the fruit while picking.Problems with robotic fruit pickers One solution is the use of suction grippers. Citrus fruit robot pickers have thus far been the focus of research and development, but cherry pickers are also being researched.

History Gondo Smuggler statue in Gondo The village of Gondo, which is part of Zwischbergen, is located at the southern foot of the Simplon Pass on the Italian border. Although the majority language has been German for a long time, the population is partly of Italian descent. Gondo belonged to the dominion of Novara, until Boniface de Challant, the Bishop of Sion, bought the rights to the village in 1291 from Count de Castello. However, the parish of Gondo first belonged to the diocese of Sion in 1822. For much of the history of the village a school was held in the rectory, but in 1958 a schoolhouse was built. A new church was built in 1495 in the village. Disagreements over appointing the administrators of the new church in the middle of the 15th Century led to the creation of a municipal corporation and municipal statutes. Some of the families in Simplon and Gondo became wealthy through freight transport and smuggling over the pass. With their wealth, they became an important part in the political landscape of Valais. Between 1550 and 1897 there were gold mines in the valley. Starting in 1640 a postal riders between Lyon and Milan stopped in Gondo. In the 18th and 19th Centuries the village was hit by devastating avalanches. On 14 October 2000, a third of the village was destroyed by a landslide that claimed 13 lives and destroyed eight buildings, including the western part of the Stockalper tower, which was built in 1650. Geography Valley of Zwischbergen Zwischbergen has an area, , of . Of this area, 13.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while 24.4% is forested.

A left- footed player, Maldera was a modern full-back who possessed an accurate and powerful shot, which earned him the nickname \\"Aldo-gol\\", due to his prolific goalscoring ability, despite his more defensive playing role; he was a hard- working team player, who was capable of covering the flank effectively and aiding his team both offensively and defensively. Throughout his career, he was known for his pace, stamina, technique, dribbling, and crossing ability; his speed and galloping offensive runs earned him the nickname \\"the horse\\". Club career Maldera was born in Milan, and he spent a large part of his career with one of the major local clubs of his city A.C. Milan (1971‚Äì1982); with the club, he won a Serie A title in 1979, two Coppa Italia trophies in 1972 and 1977, a Serie B title (earning promotion to Serie A the following season, following Milan's involvement in the 1980 Totonero football betting scandal) in 1981, and a Mitropa Cup, during his final season with the club, in 1982, also serving as the club's captain. Throughout his career, he also played for Bologna F.C. 1909 (for a half season loan, as a youth, during his time with Milan), local rivals Internazionale, A.S. Roma and A.C.F. Fiorentina. Maldera won a total two Serie A titles throughout his career, at A.C. Milan and A.S. Roma respectively, both under the tutelage of manager Nils Liedholm. Maldera won his second career league title, with Roma, during the 1982‚Äì83 season, after leaving Milan following their relegation to Serie B at the conclusion of the 1981‚Äì82 season. Maldera this league victory up with a Coppa Italia with Roma in 1984, also reaching the European Cup final with Roma that season, only to lose out to Liverpool on penalties. International career Maldera made 10 appearances for Italy between 1974 and 1980. He represented his country at the 1978 FIFA World Cup,Aldo Maldera Statistics FIFA. Retrieved 4 February 2010. and at Euro 1980 on home soil, where the Italian national side finished in fourth place on both occasions, reaching the semi-finals. He also made 9 appearances for the Italy reserve, B, side, and 1 appearance with the Italy national Under-21 side. Personal life Maldera was the third son of a family of Apulian immigrants in Milan. Aldo's older brothers Luigi Maldera and Attilio Maldera both played football professionally. To distinguish them, Luigi was referred to as Maldera I, Attilio as Maldera II and Aldo as Maldera III. After retirement Following his retirement, he worked as a football agent, and he lived in Rome with his wife. He also worked as member of the A.S. Roma youth system until 2004, and later also as Sport director of Greek club Panionios F.C. with the president Zakiris and A.C. Milan's technical director Fabio Martella.

Star General bases its story setting on The Fleet, a series of books written by David Drake and Bill Fawcett. The game was developed by Catware and SSI in 1997. Overview Star General pits up to seven alien races against one another in a galactic battle of conquest. The seven races include the deceitful Cephalians, the reptilian Dragonians, the feline Hressa, the Humans, the barbarian Khalians, the insectoid Xritra, and fascist human separatists who belong to the Schleinel Hegemony. There are 90 different types of units, from ground forces to spaceships. Among the space vessels there are a wide variety of specializations‚Äîincluding mine countermeasure vessels, assault vessels, troop transports, reconnaissance, battleships, missile boats, carriers and destroyers. There is also some use of older terms of reference for classifying warships‚Äîterms of reference that are not used in the navies of today. One example is that the term monitor is used to specify a kind of space warship. The general disposition of ship types is an approximation of navies in the era between the two world wars, before carriers became a major part of naval forces. On the planetary surface, there are space docks for launching ships, mines to produce monetary units, factories to manufacture ships, and industrial plants and biodomes to support population, as well as a range of ground forces, again roughly equivalent to military forces in mid to late 1930s to perhaps early WW2. Reception Star General sold at least 50,000 units by September 1997. Computer Gaming Worlds Tim Carter panned the game as \\"all the flash and little of the gameplay\\" of what made the original a classic and concluded it was \\"so generic and lacking in flavor that it generates little of the suspense needed to make a truly addictive strategy game.\\" He did, however, praise the clean interface, simple learning curve, and some fun moments in space fleet actions. Star General was named the 85th best computer game ever by PC Gamer UK in 1997.

In a racing career which lasted from 1962 until 1964 he ran thirteen times and won nine races. His most notable win came in the 1963 Epsom Derby. Background Relko was a \\"strong, compact, perfectly balanced\\" bay horse standing just over 16.1 hands high with a narrow white stripe and three white socks.http://www.sporthorse-data.com/horse/570076/902/Horse_Relko-_2big.jpg Photograph of Relko He was bred by his owner Fran√ßois Dupr√© at his stud farm in Pont-d'Ouilly in the Basse-Normandie region. Relko was one of three outstanding colts produced by the broodmare Relance, the others being Match II and Reliance (Prix du Jockey Club). He was sired by the Grand Prix de Saint- Cloud winner Tanerko, a representative of the Teddy sire line. Relko was trained by Chantilly by Fran√ßois Mathet, who had previously handled the 1955 Derby winner Phil Drake. Racing career 1962: two-year-old season Relko began his racing career by winning the Prix Gladiator over 1100m at Le Tremblay and then won the Prix Isard at Maisons-Laffitte. He was beaten into second place by the filly Neptune's Doll when favoured to win the Crit√©rium de Maisons-Laffitte and then finished fourth to Hula Dancer in the Grand Crit√©rium. On his final start of the year Relko finished second in the Prix Thomas Bryon. 1963: three-year-old season In the spring of 1963, Relko won the Prix de Guiche and the Poule d'Essai des Poulains at Longchamp and was then aimed at The Derby. At Epsom on 29 May, Relko was sent off the 5/1 favourite in a field of twenty-six runners. Ridden by the 21-year-old Yves Saint-Martin, Relko tracked the leading group in the early stages before moving up into third place early in the straight. He was moved up to take the lead from Tarqogan three furlongs from the finish and pulled away from the rest of the field to win easily by six lengths from Merchant Venturer and Ragusa. The slow winning time of 2:39.4 was explained by the rain-softened state of the turf. Relko's Derby win was overshadowed for some time because of the revelation by the Daily Express that he had failed a drugs test. The incident took place in the context of a series of investigations into the \\"doping\\" of horses in British races. It was not until October that the Jockey Club confirmed Relko as the winner, stating that the substances detected could not be positively identified and therefore could not be proved to have affected the result. At the end of June, Relko was scheduled to run in the Irish Derby and made 11/8 favourite, but was withdrawn from the race minutes before the start, after appearing to be lame, leading to further suspicions of foul play. In autumn, Relko returned to the racecourse to record an impressive win in the Prix Royal Oak on 15 September, easily defeating Sanctus, the winner of the Prix du Jockey Club and the Grand Prix de Paris. In the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Relko became highly agitated before the start and ran poorly, finishing sixth behind Exbury. 1964: four-year-old season Relko was unbeaten in three starts as a four-year-old. He began by winning the Prix Ganay at Longchamp and then returned to Epsom where he won the Coronation Cup on heavy ground in June. On his final start he won the Grand Prix de Saint- Cloud in July. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Relko the fifteenth best French horse of the 20th Century and the second best Derby winner of the 1960s. Timeform gave Relko an end of season rating of 136. Stud record After winning a number of important races in France and in England, Relko was retired in September 1964 after a fetlock injury. In 1965, he was sent to stand at the Lavington stud in England. Although he was a top-class sire of middle-and-long distance horses, including Relkino, Give Thanks, Olwyn, Floyd and Lanfranco, he had little success as a sire of sires. Of his daughters, My Sierra Leone produced the Champion filly Royal Heroine who won the inaugural running of the Breeders' Cup Mile in North American record time. Relko died on 30 March 1982 and was buried at the Malthouse Stud in Berkshire.

Constructed in 1874, it was one of the last offshore masonry lights. Most offshore lights built after this were cast iron towers built on cylindrical cast iron foundations. Penfield Reef has been called one of the most treacherous areas of western Long Island Sound. D'Entremont, Jeremy, \\"Connecticut‚Äôs Penfield Reef Light: No Longer Ghostly\\" article at Lighthouse Digest at the \\"Lighthouse Depot\\" Web site, accessed July 18, 2007 The structure is about off Fairfield Beach, on one end of the reef. The lighthouse's foundation, structure and roofs were in good condition, according to a 2004 Town of Fairfield report, but the wood frame supporting the balcony around the tower was in need of major repairs. Other problems include asbestos tiles on the floor, lead paint on the walls, mold in most places and decaying brick and mortar work in the basement. The U.S. Coast Guard last had the lighthouse repaired in 2003. The lighthouse is connected to a two-floor keeper's quarters built of granite and timber frames on a concrete foundation surrounded by rocks. History The Penfield Reef Light was constructed in 1874. The light is an active aid to navigation. Haunting On December 22, 1916. Lighthouse Keeper Frederick A. Jordan (sometimes spelled Jordon) rowed a dory for the mainland, to join his family for Christmas. The sea was rough, and about northwest of the lighthouse, the boat capsized. Assistant Keeper Rudolph Iten said he was unable to launch a boat against a strong wind and an outgoing tide, and so he could only witness Jordan's disappearance into the water. Jordan's body was soon recovered, and Iten was absolved of blame for the death and became the next keeper. Environmental psychologists theorize that older, secluded buildings like the Penfield Reef Lighthouse are more likely to be perceived to be haunted. Nevertheless, according to a local legend, Jordan has haunted the place ever since. Iten wrote in the keeper's log that Jordan's ghost appeared two weeks later. Iten wrote that the ghost floated down the tower's stairs before dissolving into the darkness, and Iten said he found the log opened to the page that recorded the man's death. Iten also said the Penfield light began \\"behaving strangely\\" when the ghost appeared. Jeremy D'Entremont, author of The Lighthouses of Connecticut, said that since Iten had tried to save the man, the new keeper would be unlikely to make light of Jordan's death by fabricating a ghost tale. Other lighthouse keepers later said Jordan's ghost appeared to them, and Iten even got them to sign affidavits describing the apparitions. In one tale, Jordan was said to have pulled two boys from the water in 1942 after their boat capsized near Penfield Light. The boys said a man rescued them, but they couldn't find him when they went to the lighthouse to thank him. The boys identified Jordan as their rescuer after seeing his picture, the story goes.  Late twentieth century to present  In 1969, the Coast Guard announced it would replace the lighthouse with a steel tower, but a public outcry led by then U.S. Reps. Lowell Weicker and Stewart B. McKinney persuaded the agency to back off. By 1971, the light was automated and, after 97 years, no longer needed a keeper. The U.S. General Services Administration announced in 2007 that it was looking for someone to buy the lighthouse, and it would only charge a dollar for it. In January 2008 the town of Fairfield submitted a formal proposal to buy and maintain the lighthouse. The proposal includes restoration and repairs which would cost a total of $352,000 over 16 months.Fenster, Jordan, \\"Fairfield bids for lighthouse\\", news article, Fairfield Minuteman, January 24, 2008 On July 29, 2008, Beacon Preservation, Inc.

Royal Air Force Snetterton Heath or more simply RAF Snetterton Heath is a former Royal Air Force station located south east of the A11, south west of Attleborough, Norfolk, England. History Snetterton Heath airfield was constructed by Taylor Woodrow Ltd., in 1942 at a cost of ¬£950,000 to Class-A specifications. The main runway was 6,000 feet long with two secondaries of 4,200 feet each. Originally thirty-six hardstands of the \\"frying pan\\" type were constructed as when work started, the base was intended for Royal Air Force (RAF) use. When re-scheduled for the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), the number was increased to fifty, all of them being on the south and eastern side of the airfield as a railway line and the A11 road restricted dispersed locations. Total area of concrete laid in its construction was 530,000 square yards with storage provided for 144,000 gallons of fuel. USAAF use The airfield was allocated for USAAF use in 1943. Its USAAF designation was Station 138, Station-ID \\"SN\\". At one stage, it was planned to add an air depot, known as Eccles on the northern side of the airfield, access being across the A11. Four additional T-2 hangars were constructed on this site. Apparently a reduction in the number of heavy bombers being sent to the UK led to this depot becoming surplus to Eighth Air Force requirements and construction was stopped before all facilities were completed. From 13 September 1943 though 18 June 1945, Snetterton Heath served as headquarters for the 45th Combat Bombardment Wing of the 3rd Bomb Division. 386th Bombardment Group (Medium) The airfield was used by the United States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force 386th Bombardment Group (Medium), which arrived at Snetterton Heath from Lake Charles AAB, Louisiana on 3 June 1943. The 386th Bomb Group was assigned to the 3rd Bombardment Wing and flew Martin B-26B/C Marauder twin-engine medium bombers. Its operational squadrons were: * 552d Bombardment Squadron (RG) * 553d Bombardment Squadron (AN) * 554th Bombardment Squadron (RU) * 555th Bombardment Squadron (YA) The group remained at Snetterton Heath only a few days, being transferred to RAF Boxted on 10 June 1943 in north Essex where B-26 groups were to be established for operations. 96th Bombardment Group (Heavy) The 96th Bombardment Group (Heavy) arrived on 12 June 1943 from RAF Andrews Field. The 96th was assigned to the 45th Combat Bombardment Wing (later, 45th Air Division), and the group tail code was a \\"Square-C\\". Its operational squadrons were: * 337th Bombardment Squadron (AW) * 338th Bombardment Squadron (BX) * 339th Bombardment Squadron (QJ) * 413th Bombardment Squadron (MZ) The group flew Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses as part of the Eighth Air Force's strategic bombing campaign. The 96th BG transitioned to operational status at Snetterton Heath after being used as a training unit. It entered combat in May 1943 and functioned primarily as a strategic bombardment organization throughout the war. Snetterton was the most conveniently reached station from 3rd Division Headquarters at Elveden Hall, thus units of the 96th often led major operations carrying commanding generals. General Curtis LeMay led the Regensburg shuttle mission to North Africa flying out of this base, and received a Distinguished Unit Citation for withstanding severe assaults by enemy fighters. The 96th also led the 3rd Division on the famous Schweinfurt mission of 14 October 1943. The 96th also attacked shipyards, harbours, railway yards, aerodromes, oil refineries, aircraft factories, and other industrial targets in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The 96th received another DUC for leading the 45th Bomb Wing a great distance through heavy clouds and intense anti-aircraft fire to raid important aircraft component factories in Poland on 9 April 1944. Other significant targets included airfields at Bordeaux and Augsburg; marshalling yards at Kiel, Hamm, Brunswick, and Gdynia; aircraft factories at Chemnitz, Hanover, and Di√≥sgy≈ër; oil refineries at Merseburg and Brux, and chemical works in Wiesbaden, Ludwigshafen, and Neunkirchen. In addition to strategic operations, missions of the 96th BG included bombing coastal defences, railway bridges, gun emplacements, and field batteries in the battle area prior to and during the invasion of Normandy in June 1944; attacking enemy positions in support of the breakthrough at Saint-L√¥ in July 1944; aiding the campaign in France in August by striking roads and road junctions, and by dropping supplies to the Maquis; and attacking, during the early months of 1945, the communications supplying German armies on the western front. After V-E Day, the group was scheduled for occupation duties in Germany however plans were revised and the 96th BG flew food to the Netherlands and hauled redeployed personnel to French Morocco, Ireland, France, and Germany. In November 1945 its aircraft were flown back to the United States, and its squadrons were inactivated. The ground personnel left Snetterton Heath in early December, arriving at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey. The 96th Bomb Group was inactivated on 21 December 1945. Postwar use After the war, the airfield was by No. 262 Maintenance Unit RAF between December 1945 and November 1948. At the end of 1948 the airfield was closed and fell into disuse. Current use The original Snetterton Circuit (green) was laid out on the runways and taxiways of RAF Snetterton Heath (light brown) in the early 1950s. Redevelopment over the subsequent 60 years has reduced the portion of the property used, but the modern circuit (red) still largely conforms to the air base footprint. With the end of military control Snetterton Heath was privately purchased in 1952 with a view to using the runways and perimeter tracks as a motor racing circuit. The first motor cycle meeting was held in 1953 and the first motor races the following year. Today, banking and safety barriers have transformed the airfield and Snetterton Circuit is used extensively; not only for local club, national, as well as international racing, but for the testing and development of new designs of motor cycles and cars. A memorial window to the 96th Bomb Group can be seen in Quidenham church. There is also a sculpture commemorating the 96th BG on the approach road to the racing circuit, and a museum at the nearby New Eccles Hall School. Both the sculpture and the murals at the museum are the work of the school's Art teacher.

Illegal immigration refers to the migration of people into a country in violation of the immigration laws of that country, or the continued residence of people without the legal right to live in that country. Illegal immigration tends to be financially upward, from poorer to richer countries. Illegal residence in another country creates the risk of detention, deportation, and/or other sanctions. Asylum seekers who are denied asylum may face impediment to expulsion if the home country refuses to receive the person or if new asylum evidence emerges after the decision. In some cases, these people are considered undocumented immigrants, and in others, they may get a temporary residence permit, for example with reference to the principle of non-refoulement in the international Refugee Convention. The European Court of Human Rights, referring to the European Convention on Human Rights, has shown in a number of indicative judgments that there are enforcement barriers to expulsion to certain countries, for example, due to the risk of torture.[\\"impediment to expulsion\\" ,\\"kpthesaurus\\":[\\"350\\"]} Search results on \\"Impediment to expulsion\\" in the European Court of Human Rights archive Terminology There are campaigns discouraging the use of the term \\"illegal immigrant\\", generally based on the argument that the act of immigrating illegally does not make the people themselves illegal, but rather they are \\"people who have immigrated illegally\\". In the United States, a \\"Drop the I-Word\\" campaign was launched in 2010 advocating for the use of terms such as undocumented immigrants or unauthorized immigrants when referring to the foreign nationals who reside in a country illegally. In Europe, the Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants (PICUM) launched its international \\"Words Matter\\" campaign in 2014 to promote the use of the terms \\"undocumented\\" or \\"irregular\\" migrants instead of \\"illegal\\". News associations that have discontinued or discourage the use of the adjective \\"illegal\\" to qualify nouns that describe people include the US Associated Press,Illegal Immigrant no more Associated Press Blog, 2013 April 2 UK Press Association, European Journalism Observatory, European Journalism Centre, Association of European Journalists, Australian Press Council, and Australian Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance. Related terms that describe actions are not similarly discouraged by these campaigns. For example, Associated Press continues to use the term \\"illegal immigration\\" to describe the action of entering or residing in a country illegally. In contrast, in some contexts the term \\"illegal immigrants\\" is shortened, often pejoratively, to \\"illegals\\". On the other hand, the term undocumented has been cited by The New York Times, as a \\"term preferred by many immigrants and their advocates, but it has a flavor of euphemism and should be used with caution outside quotation\\". Newsweek questions the use of the phrase 'undocumented immigrants' as a method of euphemistic framing, namely, \\"a psychological technique that can influence the perception of social phenomena\\". Newsweek also suggests that persons who enter a country unlawfully cannot be entirely \\"undocumented\\" because they \\"just lack the certain specific documents for legal residency and employment. Many have driver's licences, debit cards, library cards, and school identifications which are useful documents in specific contexts but not nearly so much for immigration.\\" For example, in the U.S., youths brought into the country illegally are granted access to public K-12 education and benefits regardless of citizenship status, so the youths are documented for educational purposes, and are not entirely undocumented. A related term, irregular migration, is sometimes used e.g. by the International Organization for Migration, but it describes a somewhat wider concept which also includes illegal emigration. U.S. immigration laws use the phrase illegal immigrant at least in some contexts. Title 8 of the US Code is the portion of the law that contains laws on citizenship, nationality, and immigration. It defines the legal term Alien as \\"any person not a citizen or national of the United States\\". Terminology used in Title 8 includes illegal alien (33 times), unauthorized alien (21 times), undocumented alien (18 times), illegal immigrant (6 times), undocumented person (2 times) and others. An analysis by PolitiFact however concluded that the term \\"illegal alien\\" \\"occurs scarcely, often undefined or part of an introductory title or limited to apply to certain individuals convicted of felonies\\". In the United States, while overstaying a visa is a civil violation handled by immigration court, entering (including re-entering) the US without approval from an immigration officer is a crime: specifically a misdemeanor on the first offense. Illegal reentry after deportation is a felony offense. This is the distinction between the larger group referred to as unauthorized immigrants and the smaller subgroup referred to as criminal immigrants. Effects of illegal immigration Economy and labor market Research on the economic effects of illegal immigration is scant but existing studies suggest that the effects can be positive for the native population, and for public coffers. A 2015 study shows that \\"increasing deportation rates and tightening border control weakens low-skilled labor markets, increasing unemployment of native low-skilled workers. Legalization, instead, decreases the unemployment rate of low-skilled natives and increases income per native.\\" Studies show that legalization of undocumented immigrants would boost the U.S. economy; a 2013 study found that granting amnesty to undocumented immigrants would raise their incomes by a quarter (increasing U.S. GDP by approximately $1.4 trillion over a ten-year period), and a 2016 study found that \\"legalization would increase the economic contribution of the unauthorized population by about 20%, to 3.6% of private-sector GDP.\\" A 2018 National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that undocumented immigrants to the United States \\"generate higher surplus for US firms relative to natives, hence restricting their entry has a depressing effect on job creation and, in turn, on native labor markets\\". A paper by Spanish economists found that upon legalizing the undocumented immigrant population in Spain, the fiscal revenues increased by around ‚Ç¨4,189 per newly legalized immigrant. The paper found that the wages of the newly legalized immigrants increased after legalization, some low-skilled natives had worse labor market outcomes and high-skilled natives had improved labor market outcomes. According to economist George Borjas, immigrants may have caused the decline of real wages of US workers without a high school degree by 9% between 1980 and 2000 due to increased competition. Other economists, such as Gordon Hanson, criticized these findings. Douglas Massey argues that the developed countries need unskilled immigrant labor to fill undesirable jobs which citizens do not seek regardless of wages. Massey argues that this may refute claims that undocumented immigrants are \\"lowering wages\\" or stealing jobs from native-born workers, and that it instead shows that undocumented immigrants \\"take jobs that no one else wants\\". Since the decline of working class blue-collar jobs in manufacturing and industry, younger native-born generations have acquired higher education. In the US, only 12% of the labor force has less than a high school education, but 70% of irregular workers from Mexico lack a high school degree. The majority of new blue-collar jobs qualify as Massey's \\"underclass\\" work, and suffer from unreliability, subservient roles and, critically, a lack of potential for advancement. These \\"underclass\\" jobs, which have a disproportionate number of undocumented immigrants, include harvesting crops, unskilled labor in landscaping and construction, house-cleaning, and maid and busboy work in hotels and restaurants. However, as even these \\"underclass\\" jobs have higher relative wages than those in home countries they are still attractive for undocumented immigrants and since many undocumented immigrants often anticipate working only temporarily in the destination country, the lack of opportunity for advancement is seen by many as less of a problem. Support for this claim can be seen in a Pew Hispanic Center poll of over 3,000 undocumented immigrants from Mexico in the US, which found that 79% would voluntarily join a temporary worker program that allowed them to work legally for several years but then required them to leave. From this it is assumed that the willingness to take undesirable jobs is what gives undocumented immigrants their employment. Evidence for this may be seen in the average wages of undocumented day laborers in California, which was between $10 and $12 per hour according to a 2005 study, and the fact that this was higher than many entry-level white collar or service jobs. Entry-level white collar and service jobs offer advancement opportunities only for people with work permits and citizenship. Research indicates that the advantage to firms employing undocumented immigrants increases as more firms in the industry do so, further increases with the breadth of a firm's market, and also with the labor intensity of the firm's production process. However, the advantage decreases with the skill level of the firm's workers, meaning that undocumented immigrants do not provide as much competitive advantage when a high-skilled workforce is required. Reasons for illegal immigration Poverty Undocumented immigrants are not impoverished by the standards of their home countries. The poorest classes in a developing country may lack the resources needed to mount an attempt to cross illegally, or the connections to friends or family already in the destination country. Studies from the Pew Hispanic Center have shown that the education and wage levels of undocumented Mexican immigrants in the US are around the median for Mexico and that they are not a suitable predictor of one's choice to immigrate. Other examples do show that increases in poverty, especially when associated with immediate crises, can increase the likelihood of illegal migration. The 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, subsequent to the start of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), was associated with widespread poverty and a lower valuation for the peso relative to the dollar. Accessed 11 December 2009 It also marked the start of a massive swell in Mexican immigration, in which net illegal migration to the US increased every year from the mid-1990s until the mid-2000s. There are also examples where natural disasters and overpopulation can amplify poverty-driven migration flows. Overpopulation Population growth that exceeds the carrying capacity of an area or environment results in overpopulation. Virginia Abernethy notes that immigration is a road that provides a \\"relief valve\\" to overpopulation that stops a population from addressing the consequences of its overpopulation and that exports this overpopulation to another location or country. Overpopulation and its consequences is a bigger issue in developing countries. Family reunification in new country of residence Some undocumented immigrants seek to live with loved ones, such as a spouse or other family members. Having a family who have immigrated or being from a community with many immigrants is a much better predictor of one's choice to immigrate than poverty. Family reunification visas may be applied for by legal residents or naturalized citizens to bring their family members into a destination state legally, but these visas may be limited in number and subject to yearly quotas. This may result in family members entering illegally in order to reunify. From studying Mexican migration patterns, Douglas Massey finds that the likelihood that a Mexican national will emigrate illegally to the US increases dramatically if they have one or more family members already residing in the United States, legally or illegally. Wars and asylum Arrested refugees/immigrants in Fylakio detention centre, Evros, northern Greece. Unauthorised arrival into another country may be prompted by the need to escape civil war or repression in the country of origin. However, somebody who flees such a situation is in most countries under no circumstances an undocumented immigrant. If victims of forced displacement apply for asylum in the country they fled to and are granted refugee status they have the right to remain permanently. If asylum seekers are not granted some kind of legal protection status, then they may have to leave the country, or stay as irregular immigrants. According to the 1951 Refugee Convention refugees should be exempted from immigration laws and should expect protection from the country they entered. It is, however, up to the countries involved to decide if a particular immigrant is a refugee or not, and hence whether they are subject to the immigration controls. Furthermore, countries that did not sign the 1951 Refugee Convention or do not attempt to follow its guidelines are likely to consider refugees and asylum seekers as irregular immigrants. Deprivation of citizenship In a 2012 news story, the CSM reported, \\"The estimated 750,000 Rohingya, one of the most miserable and oppressed minorities in the world, are deeply resentful of their almost complete absence of civil rights in Myanmar. In 1982, the military junta stripped the Rohingya of their Myanmar citizenship, classing them as irregular immigrants and rendering them stateless.\\" In some countries, people born on national territory (henceforth not \\"immigrants\\") do not automatically obtain the nationality of their birthplace, and may have no legal title of residency. Education Families want to have better lives for their children and to succeed. In the article \\"Learning to be illegal\\" it discusses the safety the children have in K-12 schooling. The children are guaranteed education in a safe environment. Problems faced by undocumented immigrants Aside from the possibility that they may be intercepted and deported, undocumented immigrants also face other problems. Lack of access to services Undocumented immigrants usually have no or very limited access to public health systems, proper housing, education and banks. Some immigrants forge identity documents to get the access. Slavery For example, research at San Diego State University estimates that there are 2.4 million victims of human trafficking among irregular Mexican immigrants in the United States. Some workers are smuggled into the United States and Canada by human traffickers. People have been kidnapped or tricked into slavery to work as laborers, after entering the country, for example in factories. Those trafficked in this manner often face additional barriers to escaping slavery, since their status as undocumented immigrants makes it difficult for them to gain access to help or services. For example, Burmese women trafficked into Thailand and forced to work in factories or as prostitutes may not speak the language and may be vulnerable to abuse by police due to their undocumented immigrant status. Kidnapping and ransoms In some regions, people that are still en route to their destination country are also sometimes kidnapped, for example for ransom. In some instances, they are also tortured, raped, and killed if the requested ransom does not arrive. One case in point are the Eritrean migrants that are en route to Israel. A large number of them are captured in north Sinai (Egypt) and Eastern Sudan and held in the buildings in north Sinai.Sound of torture documentary Prostitution Some people forced into sexual slavery face challenges of charges of illegal immigration. Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, Western Europe is being confronted with a serious problem related to the sexual exploitation of undocumented immigrants (especially from Eastern Europe), for the purpose of prostitution. In the United States, human trafficking victims often pass through the porous border with Mexico. In an effort to curb the spread of this affliction, California Attorney General Kamala Harris and Mexico Attorney General Marisela Morales Ib√°√±ez signed an accord in 2012 to expand prosecutions of criminals typically members of transnational gangs who engage in the trafficking of human beings between the two countries. Exploitation of labour Most countries have laws requiring workers to have proper documentation, often intended to prevent or minimize the employment of undocumented immigrants. However the penalties against employers are often small and the acceptable identification requirements vague, ill-defined and seldom checked or enforced, making it easy for employers to hire illegal labor. Where the minimum wage is several times the prevailing wage in the home country, employers sometimes pay less than the legal minimum wage or have unsafe working conditions, relying on the reluctance of undocumented workers to report the violations to the authorities.  Injury and illness  The search for employment is central to illegal international migration. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, undocumented immigrants in the United States often work in dangerous industries such as agriculture and construction. A recent study suggests that the complex web of consequences resulting from irregular immigrant status limits irregular workers' ability to stay safe at work. In addition to physical danger at work, the choice to immigrate for work often entails work- induced lifestyle factors which impact the physical, mental and social health of immigrants and their families. Death Each year there are several hundred deaths along the U.S.‚ÄìMexico borderUnited States Government Accounting Office. GAO-06-770 , August 2006. of immigrants crossing the border illegally. Death by exposure occurs in the deserts of Southwestern United States during the hot summer season. In 2016 there were approximately 8,000 migrant deaths, with about 63% of deaths occurring within the Mediterranean. Methods Illegal border crossing Border patrol at sea by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection HMC Vigilant, one of several customs cutters of the UK Border Force, and capable of speeds up to 26 knots, departing Portsmouth Naval Base. Immigrants from countries that do not have automatic visa agreements, or who would not otherwise qualify for a visa, often cross the borders illegally in some areas like the United States‚ÄìMexico border, the Mona Channel between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, the Strait of Gibraltar, Fuerteventura, and the Strait of Otranto. Because these methods are illegal, they are often dangerous. Would-be immigrants have been known to suffocate in shipping containers, boxcars, and trucks, sink in shipwrecks caused by unseaworthy vessels, die of dehydration or exposure during long walks without water. An official estimate puts the number of people who died in illegal crossings across the U.S.‚ÄìMexican border between 1998 and 2004 at 1,954 (see immigrant deaths along the U.S.-Mexico border). Human smuggling is the practice of intermediaries aiding undocumented immigrants in crossing over international borders in financial gain, often in large groups. Human smuggling differs from, but is sometimes associated with, human trafficking. A human smuggler will facilitate illegal entry into a country for a fee, but on arrival at their destination, the smuggled person is usually free. Trafficking involves a process of using physical force, fraud, or deception to obtain and transport people. Types of notorious human smugglers include Snakehead gangs present in mainland China (especially in Fujian) that smuggle laborers into Pacific Rim states (making Chinatowns frequent centers of illegal immigration) and \\"coyotes\\", who smuggle undocumented immigrants to the Southwestern United States and have been known to abuse or even kill their passengers. Sometimes undocumented immigrants are abandoned by their human traffickers if there are difficulties, often dying in the process. Others may be victims of intentional killing. Overstaying a visa Many undocumented immigrants are migrants who originally arrive in a country lawfully but overstay their authorized residence (overstaying a visa). For example, most of the estimated 200,000 undocumented immigrants in Canada (perhaps as high as 500,000) are refugee claimants whose refugee applications were rejected but who have not yet been expelled from the country. Another example is formed by children of foreigners born in countries observing jus soli (\\"right of territory\\"), such as was the case in France until 1994 and in Ireland until 2005. In these countries, it was possible to obtain French or Irish nationality (respectively) solely by being born in France before 1994 or in Ireland before 2005 (respectively). At present, a French born child of foreign parents does not automatically obtain French nationality until residency duration conditions are met. Since 1 January 2005, a child born in Ireland does not automatically acquire Irish nationality unless certain conditions are met. Sham marriages Another method is by entering into a sham marriage where the marriage is contracted into for purely immigration advantage by a couple who are not in a genuine relationship. Common reasons for sham marriages are to gain immigration, (this is called immigration fraud) residency, work or citizenship rights for one or both of the spouses, or for other benefits. In the United Kingdom, those who arrange, participate in, or officiate over a sham marriage may be charged with a number of offenses, including assisting unlawful immigration and conspiracy to facilitate a breach of immigration law.Crown Prosecution Service, Immigration , accessed 4 June 2014. The United States has a penalty of a $250,000 fine and five-year prison sentence for such arrangements. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Justice Department say that they do not have accurate numbers on the rate of attempted marriage fraud.(Manwani v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 736 F. Supp. 1367 (W.D.N.C. 1990)). In the 2009 fiscal year, 506 of the 241,154 petitions filed were denied for suspected fraud, a rate of 0.2%; seven percent were denied on other grounds. Irregular immigrant populations by country or region Angola In 2007 around 44,000 Congolese were forced to leave Angola. Since 2004, more than 400,000 irregular immigrants, almost all from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, have been expelled from Angola. Australia Official government sources put the number of visa overstayers in Australia at approximately 50,000. This has been the official number of undocumented immigrants for about 25 years and is considered to be low. Other sources have placed it at up to 100,000, but no detailed study has been completed to quantify this number, which could be significantly higher. On 1 June 2013, the Migration Amendment (Reform of Employer Sanctions) Act 2013 commenced. This new law puts the onus on businesses to ensure that their employees maintain the necessary work entitlements in Australia. The new legislation also enables the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship to levy infringement notices against business (AUD $15,300) and individual (AUD $3,060) employers on a strict liability basis ‚Äì meaning that there is no requirement to prove fault, negligence or intention. Bangladesh There are about 1.2 million Indians living in Bangladesh illegally as of 2014. The undocumented migrants are mainly from the poorest states in India including West Bengal, Meghalaya, Assam and Manipur, which surround Bangladesh. They illegally immigrate to Bangladesh in search of jobs in the metropolitan hubs and a better standard of living. Bangladesh is fifth among the nations sending highest remittances to India. Indians working in Bangladesh sent more than $3.7 billion back to India in 2012. There is a significant number of Burmese undocumented immigrants in Bangladesh. As of 2012, the Bangladesh government estimated about 500,000 undocumented Burmese immigrants living across Bangladesh. Bhutan Immigration in Bhutan by Nepalese settlers (Lhotshampa) began slowly towards the end of the 19th century. The government passed the Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1985 to clarify and try to enforce the Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1958 to control the flood of illegal immigration. Those individuals who could not provide proof of residency prior to 1958 were adjudged to be undocumented immigrants. In 1991 and 1992, Bhutan expelled roughly 139,110 ethnic Nepalis, most of whom have been living in seven refugee camps in eastern Nepal ever since. The United States has offered to resettle 60,000 of the 107,000 Bhutanese refugees of Nepalese origin now living in U.N. refugee camps in Nepal. The Bhutanese government, even today, has not been able to sort the problem of giving citizenship to those people who are married to Bhutanese, even though they have been in the country for 40 years. Brazil Brazil has long been part of international migration routes. In 2009, the government estimated the number of undocumented immigrants at about 200,000 people; a Catholic charity working with immigrants said there were 600,000 undocumented immigrants (75,000 of whom were from Bolivia). That same year, the National Congress of Brazil approved an amnesty, opening a six-month window for all foreigners to seek legalization irrespective of their previous standing before the law. Brazil had last legalized all immigrants in 1998; bilateral deals, one of which promoted the legalization of all reciprocal immigrants with Bolivia to date, signed in 2005, are also common. Undocumented immigrants in Brazil enjoy the same legal privileges as native Brazilians regarding access to social services such as public education and the Brazilian public healthcare system. A Federal Police operation investigated Chinese immigrants who traveled through six countries before arriving in S√£o Paulo to work under substandard conditions in the textile industry. After signing the 2009 amnesty bill into law, President Lula da Silva said, in a speech, that \\"repression and intolerance against immigrants will not solve the problems caused by\\" the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, thereby also harshly criticizing the \\"policy of discrimination and prejudice\\" against immigrants in developed nations. An October 2009 piece from O Globo, quoting a UNDP study, estimates the number of undocumented immigrants at 0.7 million, and points out to a recent wave of xenophobia among the general populace. Canada There is no credible information available on illegal immigration in Canada. Estimates range between 35,000 and 120,000 undocumented immigrants in Canada. James Bissett, a former head of the Canadian Immigration Service, has suggested that the lack of any credible refugee screening process, combined with a high likelihood of ignoring any deportation orders, has resulted in tens of thousands of outstanding warrants for the arrest of rejected refugee claimants, with little attempt at enforcement. Refugee claimants in Canada do not have to attempt re- entry to learn the status of their claim. A 2008 report by the Auditor General Sheila Fraser stated that Canada has lost track of as many as 41,000 undocumented immigrants. This number was predicted to increase drastically with the expiration of temporary employer work permits issued in 2007 and 2008, which were not renewed in many cases because of the shortage of work due to the recession. Chile Chile has recently become a new pole of attraction for undocumented immigrants, mostly from neighboring Peru and Bolivia but also Ecuador, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Paraguay, Venezuela and Haiti. According to the 2002 national census, Chile's foreign-born foreign population has increased by 75% since 1992. China China is building a security barrier along its border with North Korea to prevent the defectors or refugees from North Korea. Also, many undocumented immigrants from Mongolia have tried to make it to China. There might be as many as 100,000 Africans in Guangzhou, mostly undocumented overstayers.Out of Africa and into China, immigrants struggle . Reuters UK. 21 August 2009. To encourage people to report foreigners living illegally in China, the police are giving a 100 yuan reward to whistle blowers whose information successfully leads to an expulsion. Dominican Republic The Dominican Republic is a nation that shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. An estimated 1,000,000 Haitians live and work in the Dominican Republic, which has a total population of about ten million. The percentage of Haitians that have illegally immigrated to the Dominican Republic is not accurately known, and \\"many Dominicans have come to resent the influx of lower-paid workers from across the border and have sought to make their country less hospitable to noncitizens.\\" India ABVP against Bangladeshi undocumented immigrants It is estimated that several tens of millions of undocumented immigrants live in India. Precise figures are not available, but the numbers run in tens of millions, at least 10 million are from Bangladesh, others being from Pakistan, Afghanistan and others. According to the Government of India, there at least 20 million undocumented immigrants from Bangladesh alone. This makes India the country with the largest number of undocumented immigrants in the world. During the Bangladesh Liberation War at least 10 million Bangladeshis crossed into India illegally to seek refuge from widespread rape and genocide. According to Indian Home Ministry, at least 1.4 Million Bangladeshi crossed over into India in the last decade alone. Samir Guha Roy of the Indian Statistical Institute called these estimates \\"motivatedly exaggerated\\". After examining the population growth and demographic statistics, Roy instead states that a significant numbers of internal migration is sometimes falsely thought to be immigrants. An analysis of the numbers by Roy revealed that on average around 91000 Bangladeshi nationals might have crossed over to India every year during the years 1981‚Äì1991 but how many of them were identified and pushed back is not known. It is possible that a large portion of these irregular immigrants returned on their own to their place of origin. According to a pro-Indian scholar, the trip to India from Bangladesh is one of the cheapest in the world, with a trip costing around Rs.2000 (around $30 US), which includes the fee for the \\"Tour Operator\\". As Bangladeshis are cultural similar to the Bengali people in India, they are able to pass off as Indian citizens and settle down in any part of India to establish a future., for a very small price. This false identity can be bolstered with false documentation available for as little as Rs.200 ($3 US) can even make them part of the vote bank. India is constructing barriers on its eastern borders to combat the surge of migrants. The Indo- Bangladeshi barrier is 4,000 km (2,500 mi) long. Presently, India is constructing a fence along the border to restrict illegal traffic from Bangladesh. This obstruction will virtually isolate Bangladesh from India. The barrier's plan is based on the designs of the Israeli West Bank barrier and will be 3.6 m (11.8 ft) high. The stated aim of the fence is to stop infiltration of terrorists, prevent smuggling, and end illegal immigration from Bangladesh.The good fences epidemic The Government of India recently passed the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 to tackle the illegal immigration crises. Iran Since late April 2007, the Iranian government has forcibly deported back Afghans living and working in Iran to Afghanistan at a rate between 250,000 and 300,000 per year. The forceful evictions of the refugees, who lived in Iran and Pakistan for nearly three decades, are part of the two countries' larger plans to repatriate all Afghan refugees within a few years. Iran said that it would send 1,000,000 by March 2008, and Pakistan announced that all 2,400,000 Afghan refugees, most living in camps, must return home by 2009. Aimal Khan, a political analyst at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute in Islamabad said it would be \\"disastrous\\" for Afghanistan. Israel Demonstration against the expulsion of undocumented immigrants and their families from Israel, Tel Aviv, 2009 Tens of thousands of migrants, mostly from Sudan and Eritrea, had crossed the Israeli border between 2009 and 2012. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that \\"This phenomenon is very grave and threatens the social fabric of society, our national security and our national identity.\\"Israel PM: illegal African immigrants threaten identity of Jewish state . Reuters. 20 May 2012. In May 2012, Israel introduced a law which would allow undocumented immigrants to be detained for up to three years, a measure that the Interior Ministry intended to stem the flow of Africans entering Israel across the desert border with Egypt. As a result, completing a barrier along the border with Egypt, illegal immigration from Africa decreased by over 99%. Israel faces substantial (estimated at 40,000 in 2009) illegal immigration of Arab workers from the Palestinian Authority territories, a migration that includes both workers seeking employment, and homosexuals escaping the social opprobrium of Arab society. Thousands of foreign workers who entered the country on temporary visas have overstayed and live illegally in Israel. There is a debate within Israel as to whether the Israel-born children of foreign workers should be allowed to remain in the country. Libya Before the Libyan civil war, Libya was home to a large undocumented Sub-Saharan African population which numbers as much as 2,000,000. The mass expulsion plan to summarily deport all undocumented foreigners was announced by then-current Libyan leader Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi in January 2008, \\"No resident without a legal visa will be excluded.\\" Malaysia There are an estimated 800,000 undocumented immigrants in Malaysia. In January 2009, Malaysia banned the hiring of foreign workers in factories, stores and restaurants to protect its citizens from mass unemployment amid the late 2000s recession.Malaysia bans foreign labourers , Al Jazeera English, 22 January 2009 An ethnic Indian Malaysian was recently sentenced to whipping and 10 months in prison for hiring six undocumented immigrants at his restaurant. \\"I think that after this, Malaysian employers will be afraid to take in foreign workers (without work permits). They will think twice\\", said immigration department prosecutor Azlan Abdul Latiff. \\"This is the first case where an employer is being sentenced to caning\\", he said. Undocumented immigrants also face caning before being deported. Mexico In the first six months of 2005, more than 120,000 people from Central America were deported, as compared to 2002, when for the entire year, only 130,000 were deported. People of Han Chinese origin pay about $5,500 to smugglers to be taken to Mexico from Hong Kong. It is estimated that 2.4% of rejections for work permits in Mexico correspond to Chinese citizens. In a 2010 news story, USA Today reported, \\"... Mexico's Arizona-style law requires local police to check IDs. And Mexican police freely engage in racial profiling and routinely harass Central American migrants, say immigration activists.\\" Many women from Eastern Europe, Asia, and Central and South America take jobs at table dance establishments in large cities. The National Institute of Migration (INM) in Mexico raids strip clubs and deports foreigners who work without proper documentation. In 2004, the INM deported 188,000 people at a cost of US$10 million. In September 2007, Mexican President Calder√≥n harshly criticized the United States government for the crackdown on undocumented immigrants, saying it has led to the persecution of immigrant workers without visas. \\"I have said that Mexico does not stop at its border, that wherever there is a Mexican, there is Mexico\\", he said.Mexican President Assails U.S. Measures on Migrants , New York Times, 3 September 2007 However, Mexico has also deported US citizens, deporting 2,000 cases in 2015 and 1,243 in 2014.Got deported from Mexico country expels hundreds US citizens every year Fox News 18 December 2015 Illegal immigration of Cubans through Canc√∫n tripled from 2004 to 2006. In October 2008, Mexico tightened its immigration rules and agreed to deport Cubans who use the country as an entry point to the US. It also criticized US policy that generally allows Cubans who reach US territory to stay. Cuban Foreign Minister said the Cuban-Mexican agreement would lead to \\"the immense majority of Cubans being repatriated.\\"Mexico to deport Cubans heading illegally to US, MiamiHerald.com, 22 October 2008 Nepal In 2008, Nepal's Maoist-led government has initiated a major crackdown against Tibetan exiles with the aim to deport to China all Tibetans living illegally in the country. Tibetans started pouring into Nepal after a failed anti-Chinese uprising in Tibet in 1959.NEPAL: Tibetans Warned of Deportation to China . There are 2 million more Biharis form India have been living in South-East Nepal bordering Indian state of Bihar, most of them are supported by Indian government. Pakistan As of 2005, 2.1% of the population of Pakistan had foreign origins, however the number of immigrants population in Pakistan recently grew sharply. Immigrants from South Asia make up a growing proportion of immigrants in Pakistan. The five largest immigrant groups in Pakistan are in turn Afghans, Bangladeshi, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Turkmens, Iranians, Indians, Sri Lankan, Burmese and Britons including a sizeable number of those of Pakistani origin. Other significant expatriate communities in the country are Armenians, Australians, Turks, Chinese, Americans, Filipinos, Bosnians and many others. Migrants from different countries of Arab world specially Egypt, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Kuwait, Libya, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen are in thousands. Nearly all undocumented migrants in Pakistan are Muslim refugees and they are accepted by the local population. There is no political support or legislation to deport these refugees from Pakistan. Philippines It was estimated by Teresita Ang-See, a prominent leader and activist of the Chinese Filipino community, that by 2007, as much as 100,000 undocumented immigrants from China are living in the Philippines, a tenth of the ethnic Chinese population. The latest influx has come in part because of Manila's move in 2005 to liberalise entry procedures for Chinese tourists and investors, a move that helped triple the number of Chinese visitors to 133,000 last year. Many of the new Chinese immigrants encounter hostility from many Filipinos, including Filipino-born Chinese, for being perceived as engaging in criminal activities and fraud. Russia Russia experiences a constant flow of immigration. On average, 200,000 legal immigrants enter the country every year; about half are ethnic Russians from other republics of the former Soviet Union. There are an estimated 10‚Äì12 million foreigners working in the country without legal permission to be there. There has been a significant influx of ethnic Georgians, Armenians, Azerbaijanis, Tajiks, and Uzbeks into large Russian cities in recent years, which has been viewed very unfavorably by many citizens and contributed to nationalist sentiments. Many immigrant ethnic groups have much higher birth rates than native Russians, further shifting the balance. Some Chinese flee the overpopulation and birth control regulations of their home country and settle in the Far East and in southern Siberia. Russia's main Pacific port and naval base of Vladivostok, once closed to foreigners, today is bristling with Chinese markets, restaurants and trade houses. This has been occurring a lot since the Soviet collapse. Illegal border crossing is considered a crime, and captured illegal border crossers have been sentenced to prison terms. For example, Rossiyskaya Gazeta reported in October 2008 the case of a North Korean who was detained after illegally crossing the Amur River from China. Considered by Russian authorities an \\"economic migrant\\", he was sentenced to 6 months in prison and was to be deported to the country of his nationality after serving his sentence, even though he may now risk an even heavier penalty there. That was just one of the 26 cases year-to-date of irregular entrants, of various nationalities, receiving criminal punishment in Amur Oblast. Saudi Arabia In 2004, Saudi Arabia began construction of a Saudi‚ÄìYemen barrier between its territory and Yemen to prevent the unauthorized movement of people and goods into and out of the Kingdom. Anthony H. Cordesman labeled it a \\"separation barrier\\".Anthony H. Cordesman, Saudi Arabia: National Security in a Troubled Region, p. 276. In February 2004, The Guardian reported that Yemeni opposition newspapers likened the barrier to the Israeli West Bank barrier, while The Independent wrote \\"Saudi Arabia, one of the most vocal critics in the Arab world of Israel's 'security fence' in the West Bank, is quietly emulating the Israeli example by erecting a barrier along its porous border with Yemen\\". Saudi officials rejected the comparison saying it was built to prevent infiltration and smuggling. Schengen Area Eurostat: Non-EU citizens found to be illegally present in the EU-28 and EFTA, 2015 The Schengen Area is a multilateral agreement between 26 states in which they in most cases abolish the border control among themselves. These states include most of the EU countries, as well as the EEC countries Norway, Switzerland and Iceland. Any person who is physically inside any of the Schengen states will usually be able to travel to any other Schengen state without hindrance from the law enforcement, even if he or she has no legal right to enter another Schengen Area member state. A person who wishes to immigrate illegally to a Schengen Area member state may therefore find it more practical to enter it through another member state. According to a BBC report from 2012, over 80% of undocumented immigrants entering the European Union pass through Greece. EU countries that are not members of the Schengen Agreement are still committed to allow lawful entry by citizens of EU countries; they may however exercise border control at their discretion.Migrants along the Balkan route crossing from Serbia into Hungary, 24 August 2015 This typically presents a significant hindrance to persons who are trying to enter those countries illegally. Citizens within The EU is an economic and political partnership between 28 European countries that together cover much of the European continent. A citizen of an EU member state has the right to seek employment within any other member state. The Schengen Agreement does not regulate treatment of persons who enter the Schengen Area illegally. This is therefore left to the individual states, and other applicable international treaties and European case law. Illegal immigration to Schengen and to Europe in general was increasing sharply since approximately early 2014. The main causes for this increase are the conflicts that followed the Arab Spring; in particular, the civil war in Syria has driven millions of people from their homes, and the disintegration of the Libyan government removed a major barrier for the African migrants. Illegal immigration to some of the Schengen Area states might face different consideration depending on countries such as Bulgaria, France, Greece. Bulgaria In 2013, 11,000 persons attempted to enter Bulgaria via its border with Turkey. Their aim is not believed by Bulgarian border officials to remain in Bulgaria, but to go to other European countries. In November 2013, Bulgaria started building a razor wire fence on its Turkey border, which was completed in 2015. France Children born to noncitizens in France are not immigrants themselves, but they are considered foreigners under French law, until they reach the age of 18, at which time they automatically become citizens. , \\"The Challenge of French Diversity.\\" French citizenship is based in the idea of political unity; therefore, French citizenship may be more accessible than other EU countries, such as Germany and the UK. However, many French citizens feel that those who gain French citizenship should conform to the cultural aspects of French life.Brubaker, Rogers. \\"Immigration, Citizenship, and the Nation-State in France and Germany\\". The Citizenship Debates: a Reader. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 1998. Foreigners can also become French citizens if they serve in the Foreign Legion. French law prohibits anyone from assisting or trying to assist \\"the entry, movement, or irregular stay of a foreigner in France\\". , \\"Helping illegal immigrants a Crime in France\\" France has an Immigration Ministry (L'immigration, l'int√©gration, l'asile et le d√©veloppement solidaire) which begun functioning in 2007 under President Sarkozy. The government seek to combat smugglers who profit financially from moving immigrants into, through, and out of France, according to the Immigration Minister, √âric Besson. Hungary Hungarian‚ÄìSerbian border fence In 2014, Hungary registered 43,000 asylum seekers and 80,000 up to July 2015. In the summer of 2015, Hungary started building a 4m high fence along its 175 km border to neighbouring Serbia to keep out the tens of thousands undocumented immigrants from the Middle East and migrants trying to reach the European Union. The border was sealed on 15 September 2015 and the fence was the following day attacked by refugees and defended by riot police. With the Hungary-Serbia border closed, migrants then started heading to Croatia, but as Croatia led the migrants to the Hungary-Croatia border, Hungary then started the construction of a second fence along its border with Croatia on 18 September 2015.  Norway  The number of undocumented immigrants in Norway was estimated to roughly 20 thousand in 2009,CLANDESTINO Project (2009). Undocumented Migration: Counting the Uncountable. Data and Trends Across Europe. Clandistino Project, Final Report, 23 November 2009 and to between 18 and 56 thousand in 2017. Estimates by organizations working with undocumented migrants are much lower, between 5 thousand and 10 thousand in 2011.√òien, C. og S√∏nsterudbr√•ten, S. (2011). No Way In, No Way Out? A study of living conditions of irregular migrants in Norway. Fafo rapport 2011:03. Germany The number of irregular immigrants caught in Germany from January to November 2018 was 38,000 according to the Federal Police. Over 28,000 people entered Germany by land and 10,300 entering from Austria. Some 9,270 people also arrived illegally at airports and more than 1,120 people at sea ports. Most of the migrants were from Afghanistan, Nigeria, Iraq, Syria and Turkey. Switzerland It is estimated that at least 100,000 individuals reside in Switzerland without being registered with the authorities and thus are considered undocumented immigrants by the state. Many are also workers, employed as nannies, labourers on farms or construction sites, as well as waiters or kitchen or other ancillary staff in the restaurant and hotel industry.http://www.sans-papiers.ch/index.php?id=90&L;=3 South Africa No accurate estimates of the number of undocumented migrants living in South Africa exist. Estimates that have been published vary widely. A 1996 Human Sciences Research Council study estimated that there were between 2.5 million and 4.1 million undocumented migrants in the country. In their 2008/09 annual report, the South African Police Service stated: \\"According to various estimates, the number of undocumented immigrants in South Africa may vary between three and six million people\\". Other estimates have put the figure as high as 10 million. , Statistics South Africa's official estimate is of between 500,000 and one million undocumented migrants. A large number of Zimbabweans have fled to South Africa as a result of instability in Zimbabwe, with many living as undocumented migrants in South Africa. Sociologist Alice Bloch notes that migrants in South Africa have been the victims of xenophobia and violence, regardless of their immigration status. South Korea According to the Republic of Korea Immigration Service, as of 31 December 2014, there were 208,778 undocumented immigrants, which is 11.6% of 1,797,618 total foreign nationals who resided in South Korea. Most undocumented immigrants in South Korea are Asian. The top 10 home countries of those undocumented immigrants all came from other Asian countries with China at number 1 followed by Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, Mongolia, Indonesia, Uzbekistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Cambodia. Syria Since the US-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003, there are more refugees from Iraq. The United Nations estimates that nearly 2,200,000 Iraqis have fled the country since 2003,UN warns of five million Iraqi refugees with nearly 100,000 fleeing to Syria and Jordan each month.U.N.: 100,000 Iraq refugees flee monthly . Alexander G. Higgins, Boston Globe, 3 November 2006 Most ventured to Jordan and Syria, creating demographic shifts that have worried both governments. Refugees are mired in poverty as they are generally barred from working in their host countries. Syrian authorities worried that the new influx of refugees would limit the country's resources. Sources like oil, heat, water and electricity were said to be becoming scarcer as demand were rising.Displaced Iraqis running out of cash, and prices are rising . On 1 October 2007, news agencies reported that Syria reimposed restrictions on Iraqi refugees, as stated by a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Under Syria's new rules, only Iraqi merchants, businessmen and university professors with visas acquired from Syrian embassies may enter Syria.\\"Syria restores visa limits\\" \\"BBC News\\" Thailand Turkey Turkey receives many economic migrants from nearby countries such as Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia, but also from North Caucasus, Central Asia, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Iraq War is thought to have increased the flow of illegal immigration into Turkey, and the global parties directly involved in the conflict have been accused of extending a less- helping hand than Turkey itself to resolve the precarious situation of immigrants stranded in passage.Iraq's Christians on the run (in German) United Kingdom Many try to cross the English Channel from Calais to seek asylum or refugee status in Great Britain. Truck drivers can be fined up to ‚Ç¨2,500 if irregular immigrants are found on board., \\"The Castaways of Illegal Immigration.\\" The Home Office has its agents working alongside French police and immigration agents, to prevent unauthorized people from entering the zone. An area of Calais known as \\"the Jungle\\" had a police raid in September 2009 to control illegal immigration. The French also try to stop undocumented immigrants from entering France from the southern part of the country. Non- governmental organizations, such as Secours Catholique and the Red Cross provide food, showers, and shelter to sans papiers who gather waiting to cross the Channel. In 1986, an Iranian man was sent back to Paris, from London, as he was unable to present any ID to British immigration officers. He stayed at the airport for nearly twenty years and his story loosely inpired a film, The Terminal. there were between 550,000 and 950,000 undocumented immigrants in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is a difficult country to reach as it is mostly located on one island and part of another, but traffickers in Calais, France have tried to smuggle undocumented immigrants into the UK. Many undocumented immigrants come from Africa and Asia. As of 2008 there were also many from Eastern Europe and Latin America having overstayed their visas. A 2012 study carried out by the University of Oxford's Centre on Migration, Policy and Society (COMPAS) has estimated that there were 120,000 irregular migrant children in the UK, of whom 65,000 were born in the UK to parents without legal status. According to the study these children are at risk of destitution, exploitation and social exclusion because of contradictory and frequently changing rules and regulations which jeopardize their access to healthcare, education, protection by the police and other public services. The Home Office estimated that 4,000 to 10,000 applications a year to stay in the UK are made on the basis of a sham marriage. Many undocumented immigrants or asylum seekers have tried to enter the UK from France, by hiding inside trucks or trains. On 11 August 2020, the Government of Britain and France worked together on a single channel to finalize a new plan for blocking illegal migrant route. Many of the migrants who aimed to emigrate to Britain came from Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Syria and countries in Africa, fleeing poverty, persecution or war. United States Undocumented immigrant rights march for amnesty in downtown Los Angeles, California on May Day, 2006 Approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants were estimated to be living in the United States in 2006. The Pew Hispanic Center estimated that this peaked at 12 million in March 2007 and declined to 11 million again in March 2009. The majority of the undocumented immigrants are from Mexico. The issue of illegal immigration has long been controversial in the United States. In 2007, President George W. Bush called for Congress to endorse his guest worker proposal, stating that undocumented immigrants took jobs that Americans would not take. The Pew Hispanic Center notes that while the number of legal immigrants arriving has not varied substantially since the 1980s, the number of undocumented immigrants has increased dramatically and, since the mid-1990s, has surpassed the number of legal immigrants. Penalties for employers of undocumented immigrants, of $2,000‚Äì$10,000 and up to six months' imprisonment, go largely unenforced. Political groups like Americans for Legal Immigration have formed to demand enforcement of immigration laws and secure borders. ALIPAC has also called for \\"safe departure\\" border checkpoints, free of criminal checks. In a 2011 news story, the Los Angeles Times reported, > ... illegal immigrants in 2010 were parents of 5.5 million children, 4.5 > million of whom were born in the U.S. and are citizens. Because illegal > immigrants are younger and more likely to be married, they represented a > disproportionate share of births‚Äî8% of the babies born in the U.S. between > March 2009 and March 2010 were to at least one illegal immigrant parent. Immigration from Mexico to the United States has slowed in recent years. This has been attributed to the slowing of the U.S. economy, the buildup in security along the border and increased violence on the Mexican side of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. In 2016, the Library of Congress announced it would use \\"noncitizens\\" and \\"unauthorized immigration\\" rather than \\"illegal aliens\\" as a bibliographical term. It said the once common phrase had become offensive, and was not precise. However, as of June 2019 it still uses \\"illegal aliens\\". In 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed the US attorneys offices not to use the term \\"undocumented immigrants\\", but to instead refer to people as \\"illegal aliens\\". Puerto Rico See Dominican immigration to Puerto Rico#Illegal immigration Venezuela An estimated 200,000 Colombians have fled the Colombian civil war and sought safety in Venezuela. Most of them lack identity documents and this hampers their access to services, as well as to the labor market. The Venezuelan government has no specific policies on refugees.

The southern terminus is at the Delaware state line southeast of Kennett Square, where the road continues south into that state as Delaware Route 82 (DE 82). The northern terminus is at PA 23 in Elverson. PA 82 heads through rural areas of Chester County along with the communities of Kennett Square, Unionville, and Coatesville. The route intersects many important roads including U.S. Route 1 (US 1) near Kennett Square, PA 162 and PA 842 in Unionville, US 30 in Coatesville, and US 322 in Brandywine Manor. PA 82 is a two-lane undivided road most of its length. PA 82 was originally designated in 1928 between the Delaware border and US 422/PA 17 in Baumstown, Berks County, following its current route to Elverson and heading north through Birdsboro to Baumstown. The route within East Marlborough Township was transferred to township maintenance in 1998. In 1987, flooding along the Hay Creek south of Birdsboro destroyed several bridges along PA 82; these bridges were never repaired. As a result, the northern terminus of PA 82 was cut back to Elverson in 2008, with the portion of route between PA 724 in Birdsboro and US 422 becoming part of an extended PA 345 while the remaining open portions between Elverson and Birdsboro were designated as unsigned quadrant routes. Route description PA 82 begins as Creek Road at the Delaware state line, where it meets the northern terminus of DE 82, in Kennett Township, Chester County. From the border, the route winds northwest as a two-lane undivided road through wooded areas alongside the Red Clay Creek. The road winds north along the creek's East Branch through more woodland with some homes. PA 82 turns west and heads into the borough of Kennett Square, where it becomes East South Street and passes through residential areas. The route passes north of Kennett High School before it turns north onto South Union Street and heads through commercial areas, coming to a bridge over an East Penn Railroad line. The road runs through wooded neighborhoods before it intersects the one-way pair of Cypress Street eastbound and State Street westbound (both of which comprise the Baltimore Pike) in the commercial downtown of Kennett Square. PA 82 becomes North Union Street and runs through more wooded areas of homes before leaving Kennett Square for Kennett Township again. The route passes a cemetery before it enters East Marlborough Township and immediately reaches an interchange with the US 1 freeway, where the route is a divided highway. Past this interchange, PA 82 becomes township-maintained and continues north as an undivided Unionville Road through wooded areas of residential subdivisions, coming to a junction with PA 926 in the community of Willowdale. The road continues past more housing developments with some farmland, passing to the west of Unionville High School, as it heads towards the community of Unionville. Here, PA 82 intersects Doe Run Road at a roundabout and turns west onto that road. The route passes homes and comes to an intersection with PA 842, forming a concurrency with that route. The two routes intersect the western terminus of PA 162 in the center of the community before PA 842 splits from PA 82 by turning southwest. PA 82 leaves Unionville and continues west on Doe Run Road through farmland with some woods and residences. Upon crossing into West Marlborough Township, the route becomes state-maintained again and continues through more rural areas, curving to the northwest. In the community of Doe Run, PA 82 intersects the northern terminus of PA 841. The road heads to the north and crosses Buck Run into East Fallowfield Township. Here, the route passes more farms and woods before curving northwest into increasing residential development, passing through the community of Ercildoun and intersecting Buck Run Road. PA 82 turns to the north and crosses Strasburg Road. The road curves northeast and passes farmland with some woods. PA 82 northbound past PA 340 north of Coatesville PA 82 enters Valley Township and heads north near homes on Strode Avenue. The road heads into an ArcelorMittal (formerly Lukens Steel Company) steel plant, where it crosses at-grade two branches of the Brandywine Valley Railroad serving the plant and enters the city of Coatesville. PA 82 intersects the eastern terminus of PA 372 and becomes lined with homes as it reaches a junction with US 30 Bus. At this point, the route turns east for a concurrency with US 30 Bus. on Lincoln Highway and runs past more residences before passing to the north of the steel plant. The road crosses the West Branch Brandywine Creek and a Brandywine Valley Railroad line at-grade before PA 82 splits from US 30 Bus. by heading northwest on four-lane undivided North 1st Avenue. PA 82 passes between the creek and railroad to the west and homes to the east before crossing under the High Bridge which carries Amtrak's Keystone Corridor. The route becomes a four-lane divided highway called Manor Road and winds north along the east bank of the West Branch Brandywine Creek through wooded hills with some development, becoming the border between Coatesville to the west and Valley Township to the east and reaching an interchange with the US 30 freeway. Past this interchange, PA 82 comes to an intersection with PA 340, where it enters West Brandywine Township and becomes a two-lane undivided road. The road passes through wooded areas with some residences before it heads into a mix of farmland and woodland with development. In the community of Brandywine Manor, the route crosses US 322. PA 82 continues through rural land with some homes, passing through a part of Wallace Township before it heads into West Nantmeal Township. The road crosses the East Branch Brandywine Creek and reaches a junction with the western terminus of PA 282. The route runs through more farmland and woodland with homes as it comes to an intersection with the southern terminus of PA 345 and Little Conestoga Road in the community of Loag. At this point, PA 82 turns northwest to remain along Manor Road and heads through agricultural areas with some woods and homes. The road curves north and becomes South Chestnut Street, coming to a bridge over the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 76) before a junction with PA 401. At this point, the route enters the borough of Elverson and runs northeast through residential areas with some fields. PA 82 turns north and reaches its northern terminus at PA 23 in the center of Elverson, where North Chestnut Street continues north as State Route 4082 (SR 4082), an unsigned quadrant route. History When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, the current alignment of PA 82 between Kennett Square and Unionville was legislated as part of Legislative Route 273, which continued from Unionville north and east to West Chester. By 1926, what would become PA 82 existed as a paved road except for a portion north of Brandywine Manor and between Birdsboro and Baumstown. PA 82 was designated in 1928 to run from the Delaware border south of Kennett Square north to US 422/PA 17 in Baumstown, following its current alignment north to Elverson where it continued north through Birdsboro to Baumstown. By 1930, the entire length of PA 82 was paved. On October 19, 1998, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) transferred maintenance of the route within East Marlborough Township to the township due to the township wanting to make improvements to the roads without waiting through the PennDOT approval process. Prior to 2008, PA 82 continued north through Elverson on Chestnut Street and entered Berks County. It was called Elverson Road, Twin Valley Road and Haycreek Road. In Birdsboro, PA 82 was called Furnace Street and had a small concurrency with PA 724. PA 82 crossed the Schuylkill River and then terminated at a T-intersection with US 422 westbound. On September 8, 1987, torrential rains flooded Hay Creek for days and destroyed several bridges that cross Hay Creek just south of Birdsboro. Over the coming months, local residents got used to the lack of traffic and fought to keep the road permanently closed, forcing PennDOT to forgo any possible bridge replacement. However, they did rebuild the bridge just south of Douglas Street. As a result, PA 82 was impossible to transverse from end to end. In late 2008, PennDOT decommissioned this section of PA 82 north of Elverson making the old section of PA 82 in Chester County SR 4082 and the section in Berks County SR 2082. The bulk of this area is now part of the Birdsboro Waters Forest section of the Hopewell Big Woods. In September 2010, PennDOT decided to hand over the closed portion of the former PA 82 to local landowners. When this section of PA 82 was decommissioned, PA 345 was extended north of its previous terminus in Birdsboro at PA 724 along PA 724 and then along the former routing of PA 82 to US 422. Major intersections PA 82 Alternate Truck Pennsylvania Route 82 Alternate Truck is a truck route around a weight-restricted bridge on PA 82 over Buck Run in East Fallowfield Township, on which trucks over 33 tons and combination loads over 40 tons are prohibited. The route follows US 1, PA 41, PA 10, Gum Tree Road, and Buck Run Road. It was established in 2013.

The museum was established in 1922 by merging the Essener Kunstmuseum, which was founded in 1906, and the private Folkwang Museum of the collector and patron Karl Ernst Osthaus in Hagen, founded in 1902. The term Folkwang derives from the name of the afterlife meadow of the dead, F√≥lkvangr, presided over by the Norse goddess Freyja. Museum Folkwang incorporates the Deutsche Plakat Museum (German poster museum), comprising circa 340,000 posters from politics, economy and culture. During a visit in Essen in 1932, Paul J. Sachs called the Folkwang \\"the most beautiful museum in the world.\\" In 2007, David Chipperfield designed an extension, which was then built onto the older building.  History  Museum Folkwang in the Nazi era , director of the museum in the 1920s and 1930s, and earlier directors, had made the museum's collection of modern art into one of the leading collections in the world. However, when the National Socialists came to power in Germany in the early 1930s, they instituted a government-wide purge of what they termed \\"degenerate art\\", by which they meant abstract, cubist, expressionist, surrealist and impressionist art. In 1937, Joseph Goebbels created a commission headed by Adolf Ziegler whose mission was to purge all German government-owned museums of such \\"degenerate\\" works. The Museum Folkwang fell into the category of government- controlled institutions and was therefore part of the purge. Over 1,200 works of art were removed from the museum (among others by Georges Braque, Paul C√©zanne, Giorgio de Chirico, Henri-Edmond Cross, Andr√© Derain, Henri Matisse, and Edvard Munch), part of over 17,000 works of art removed from museums throughout Germany. The Nazi government first organized a mass exhibition of this \\"degenerate\\" art‚Äîwhich, ironically, proved to be quite popular‚Äîand then began systematically selling the art to raise cash. Many works of art came into the possession of American and other collectors and museums. In the end, approximately 5,000 works of art deemed unsaleable were burned.\\"Degenerate Art\\", Philadelphia Museum of Art, accessed 20 September 2010\\"Marc Chagall's Purim\\", Philadelphia Museum of Art, accessed 20 September 2010 The Museum Folkwang and the other museums affected have generally not tried to reclaim these works because at the time, the removal and sale of the works of art were legal under German law. The works of art were ultimately the property of the German government, which had the legal right to dispose of them as it saw fit.

Photography  The photographic collection was established as an independent department in the Museum Folkwang in 1978; today it contains more than 50,000 photographs and a number of artists' estates. The Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation has been granting fellowships for contemporary German photography since 1982 in cooperation with the photographic collection of the Museum Folkwang. The museum was the site of the seminal Fotografie der Gegenwart exhibition in 1929 at which the leading photographers of the time from Germany, Austria and France were represented.

Antiochus I Nicator (Greek: ; epithet means \\"Victorious\\") is a proposed Graeco-Bactrian king of the dynasty of Diodotus I, who ruled for some period between 240 ‚Äì 220 BCE. His existence is controversial. A Seleucid king or a Bactrian namesake? Several Bactrian coins from the time of Diodotus I are struck with the legend \\"Of King Antiochus\\" though the portraits resemble those of Diodotos I and the reverse is the same as on other Diodotid coins: Zeus hurling a thunderbolt, with an eagle on the side. These coins have usually been interpreted as semi-independent issues of the first Bactrian king Diodotus I, who during the early stages of his liberation from the Seleucid empire used the name of his former overlord, the Seleucid king Antiochus II, but used his own portrait. However, in 2010, Jens Jakobssen proposed that they were struck by a Bactrian king who himself was called Antiochos. This king might have been a brother or a younger son of Diodotos I, ruling either as a co-regent or after the death of the first Diodotos' successor and son Diodotus II. The ancient sources are ambiguous: they mention no king between Diodotus II and Euthydemus I, but do not exclude the possibility. The later Bactrian king Agathocles honoured earlier rulers of Bactria on commemorative coins. Some of these honour a king Antiochos similar to the aforementioned series. On these commemorative coins, Antiochos was given the epithet \\"Nikator\\" (Victor). Similar coins were issued for Diodotus I, at the same mints, but the portraits for Antiochus Nikator are never identical to those of Diodotus I. Even if the portraits were not lifelike, this may indicate that Nikator was a separate person, and that the coins are not merely reissues of coins with Diodotus' portrait in the name of Antiochus II. Since this epithet was never used by Antiochus II (who was called \\"Theos\\", God), nor by any other Seleucid king named Antiochus, might indicate that Antiochus Nikator was a distinct individual. However, given the practices surrounding the award of epithets to Hellenistic rulers, it may be that Agathocles gave this epithet to one of the various kings named Antiochus in celebration of some victory. No ancient sources mention him. Until further evidence appears, the question of his existence remains unresolved.

He was a native of the municipality of Macrohon in the province now named Southern Leyte. Kangle√≥n was the acknowledged leader of the Resistance Movement in Leyte during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II. As such, his guerrilla forces helped pave the way for the American Leyte Landings on their return to the Philippines in 1944. Before the war, Colonel Kangleon was replaced and re- joining the group of soldiers under the pre-war 92nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Army in the General Headquarters in Leyte during the Liberation. And after the war, Ruperto Kangleon served as the Philippine Secretary of National Defense under Presidents Manuel Roxas and Elpidio Quirino. World War II Military service Kangleon was a former Lieutenant Colonel and was the commanding officer of the 81st Infantry Regiment of the 81st Division, USAFFE on 1942 at the general headquarters in Samar. The ordered to proceed to Davao where he and his men valiantly fought the troops of the Japanese Imperial army during the Japanese Invasion and Occupation. He was captured by the Japanese Imperial Army forces and was put to prison in the Japanese Internment Camps in Agusan. He managed to escape from prison in December 1942, and returned to Leyte, where he formed as a guerrilla movement.Wolfert, I., 1945, American Guerrilla in the Philippines, New York: Simon and Schuster With the help of Iliff David Richardson, Kangleon was able to establish contact with Col. Wendell Fertig on Mindanao. Soon after the Battle of Baybay, against Miranda's guerrillas on 15 Aug. 1943, Kangleon was able to consolidate and unite all forces on Leyte. Kangleon then moved his headquarters from Maasin to Don Lorenzo's Casa in Malitbog. In Nov. 1943, under orders from Col. Fertig, Kangleon, Richardson, and other guerrilla leaders were in Mindanao to coordinate activities, and meet the submarine USS Narwhal delivering American aid. However, by then the Japanese had made the Casa, in Malitbog, their headquarters for southern Leyte. On 1 Feb. 1944, Kangleon's forces went on the offensive, which included attacks on Japanese garrisons at Anahawan and Linoan, forcing the Japanese to not venture away from the coastal towns of southern Leyte. Kangleon's Guerrillas Kangleon's contribution to the war was the reason for his appointment to the defense portfolio. He led a number of guerrilla organizations, among the fiercest, with the greatest reach and had undertaken numerous operations against the Japanese Imperial Army in Visayas and sometimes in other islands was the dreaded Black Army. The Black Army was the main force of Kangleon that led in the liberation of Leyte Island during the last phase of the war. The island served as the United States Army entry point into the Philippine Archipelago when the U.S. invaded and defeated the Japanese. One of the highlights of the ferocious battle against the Japanese Army was the raid on Camp Buga-Buga that was an extremely difficult objective to take. It was a huge network of camps entrenched in large caves that opened into the face of insurmountable cliffs in Southern Leyte. Leyte Landing Col. Ruperto Kangleon reporting to General Douglas MacArthur. When the Allies led by General Douglas MacArthur landed on Battle of Leyte, Kangleon's guerrillas assisted them and three days later, on 21 October 1944, Kangleon was recognized as the overall commander of guerrilla forces on Leyte, the 92nd Division.Prefer, N.N., 2012, Leyte 1944, Havertown: Casemate Publishers, Gen. MacArthur personally pinned on Kangleon the Distinguished Service Cross of the United States of America, a decoration awarded for extraordinary heroism in combat witnessed by Philippine President Sergio Osme√±a as well as commanders of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, at the Leyte provincial capitol building. Later career Secretary of National Defense Kangleon became Leyte‚Äôs civil governor upon the re-establishment of the Philippine Commonwealth under President Osme√±a. On May 28, 1946, he was appointed Secretary of National Defense by President Manuel Roxas, the first of the Commonwealth and the Republic of the Philippines, in the same way that Kangleon was the Defense Secretary during the closing American colonial rule and held the position upon the declaration of independence on July 4, 1946. But due to policy differences with the next president, Elpidio Quirino on the leadership of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, Kangleon resigned as Defense Secretary on August 31, 1950. Kangleon was trying to ask President Quirino to remove the generals whom he considered deadwood to which the President disagreed. Senate Kangleon‚Äôs resignation from the Cabinet paved the way for his entry into the politics. Kangleon ran for Senate even without the endorsement of the incumbent President Quirino. He became senator and was appointed chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans and Military Pensions and vice chairman of the Committee on National Defense and Security. He championed the cause of the Filipino veterans by filing bills and resolutions for their welfare and advancement. However, even before he could finish his six-year term in the Senate, Sen. Kangleon succumbed to myocardial infarction on February 27, 1958, exactly a month away from his 68th birthday. The Filipino nation led by President Carlos P. Garcia mourned his untimely death. Sen. Kangleon was buried at the Manila South Cemetery on March 4, 1958, and was reinterred in his hometown of Macrohon, Leyte on February 27, 1994.

A B-17 Flying Fortress ('K', serial number 44-8081) of the 452nd Bomb Group just after taking off from Deopham Green airfield. The airfield was opened on 3 January 1944 and was used by the United States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force 452d Bombardment Group (Heavy), which arrived at Deopham Green from Walla Walla AAF Washington. The 452nd was assigned to the 45th Combat Bombardment Wing, and the group tail code was a \\"Square-L\\". Its operational squadrons were: * 728th Bombardment Squadron (9Z) * 729th Bombardment Squadron (M3) * 730th Bombardment Squadron (6K) * 731st Bombardment Squadron (7D) The group flew Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses as part of the Eighth Air Force's strategic bombing campaign. The 452nd BG entered combat on 5 February 1944 with an attack against aircraft assembly plants at Brunswick. It was engaged primarily in bombardment of strategic targets, including the marshalling yards at Frankfurt, aircraft assembly plants at Regensburg, aircraft component works at Kassel, the ball-bearing industry at Schweinfurt, a synthetic rubber plant at Hanover, and oil installations at Bohlen. First Lieutenant Donald Gott and Second Lieutenant William E Metzger Jr were each awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for remaining with their aircraft crippled during a mission over Germany on 9 November 1944. Lieutenant Gott was at the controls of a B-17 when it was hit by anti-aircraft fire, three engines being immobilised, a fire starting in the cockpit and with the radio operator and engineer being seriously wounded. Although faced with the imminent explosion of his bomb-laden aircraft, Lieutenant Gott, after conferring with his co-pilot, Lieutenant Metzger, decided to continue to the target. Then, after dropping their bombs, Lieutenant Gott made for the Allied lines to attempt to put the crippled Fortress down to save the life of the radio operator who had by now lost consciousness. Although ordered to bail out with the rest of the crew, the co-pilot chose to remain with Lieutenant Gott but, as he prepared to let down into a field the B-17 exploded killing all three crew members. In addition to strategic missions, the 452nd supported ground forces and carried out interdictory operations. They helped prepare for the invasion of Normandy by hitting airfields, V-weapon sites, bridges, and other objectives in France. The group struck coastal defenses on D-Day 6 June 1944, and bombed enemy positions in support of the breakthrough at Saint-L√¥ in July and the offensive against Brest in August and September 1944. Later in September, it assisted the Operation Market-Garden (the airborne attack on the Netherlands), hit enemy communications in and near the combat zone during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944 - January 1945, and bombed an airfield in support of the airborne assault across the Rhine in March 1945. The group received a Distinguished Unit Citation for action on 7 April 1945 when, despite vigorous fighter attacks and heavy flak, it accurately bombed a jet- fighter airfield at Kaltenkirchen. The 452nd Bomb Group flew its last combat mission of World War II [in Europe] on 21 April 1945, striking marshalling yards at Ingolstadt. The group flew a total of 250 missions from Deopham Green during the war, losing 110 of its bombers in the course of these operations. Indeed, the group suffered particularly heavy losses during the spring of 1944, at that time sustaining one of the highest rates of loss of any Fortress equipped unit in the Eighth Air Force. The 452nd returned to the United States, being inactivated at Sioux Falls AAF South Dakota on 28 August 1945. Postwar use After the war, the station was handed back to RAF Maintenance Command on 9 October 1945. The unit was No. 258 Maintenance Unit RAF. Public roads, closed when construction started in 1942, were later re-opened, one of them using part of the old main runway, the airfield finally being closed on 1 January 1948. Unfortunately over the years most of the buildings have been torn down and the airfield has been returned to agricultural use. However many of the runways and taxiways of the old airfield remain, albeit at a reduced width. There is a memorial on the side of the road running through the site, another outside Hingham Church and another at Attleborough railway station.

Manitoba borders on Saskatchewan to the west, Ontario to the east, Nunavut to the north, and the American states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south. Although the border with Saskatchewan appears straight on large- scale maps, it actually has many right-angle corners that give the appearance of a slanted line. In elevation, Manitoba ranges from sea level on Hudson Bay to 2727 ft (831 m) on top of Baldy Mountain. The northern sixty percent of the province is on the Canadian Shield. The northernmost regions of Manitoba lie permafrost (permanently frozen subsoil), and a section of tundra bordering Hudson Bay. All waters in the province flow into Hudson Bay, due to its coastal area. Lake Winnipegosis and Lake Winnipeg are two of its largest lakes. Important rivers are the Red River, Assiniboine River, Nelson River, and Churchill River. Manitoba is the sixth largest Canadian province, and the eighth largest Canadian province by percentage of fresh water. The capital and largest city of the province is Winnipeg; the province lies in the time zone UTC ‚àí6. Environmental geography Manitoba has an extreme climate, but southern latitudes allow agriculture. The northern area of the region ranges from coniferous forests to muskeg to tundra in the far north. Before settlement had occurred, a vast portion of southern Manitoba was either flood plain or swamp. An extensive system for drainage ditches was required throughout south-central Manitoba to make the region suitable for cultivation. Boreal forests of the southern part of the province have extensive black spruce and white spruce forests. The tundra region of northern Manitoba exhibits more sparse black spruce forests whose tree heights are limited by the thin soils, permafrost underlayer and generally cold climate. In this region polar bears are found, denning in the Wapusk National Park and migrating to hunt for seals when pack ice forms on Hudson Bay.C.

Northeast Manitoba follows the Hudson Bay shoreline. Churchill, on the Hudson Bay is the only port for the prairie provinces. The harbour serves as an open market for grain. Manitoba was the first Canadian province to be involved in the wheat industry. There are only three ice-free months a year that allow for the shipments to be sent when shipping through the home port of Churchill. The Canadian Shield limits the amount of farming in the north, but there are some forestry and mining operations. The majority of the grain production is found in farms in the south. Central and southern Manitoba is covered by lakes and rivers. Most of the population is centred in the southern third of the province. Manitoba played a significant role in the European settlement of the Canadian west. Explorers arrived in Manitoba by the Hudson Bay, in search of a passage to China. As the fur trade boomed, settlements rose up in the province to trading posts for the Natives and the voyageurs. The settlement was not easy, and colonization slowed down for several years around 1816. In 1870, the Hudson's Bay Company sold its huge domain to the confederation of Canada. Settlement inflated in Manitoba when the railway was built in the province and again in late 19th, early 20th century when government promoted settlement by European immigrants. Mountain ranges of Manitoba Relief of Manitoba Manitoba has two mountain/hill ranges, which are both escarpments formed by prehistoric Lake Agassiz: the Pembina Escarpment and the Manitoba Escarpment. * The Pembina Mountains are located in southern Manitoba and extend to the Assiniboine River and over North Dakota border. The highest point is 2,000 feet. * The Manitoba Escarpment has four different sets of mountains/hills, and three are in Manitoba: the Riding Mountains, the Duck Mountains, and the Porcupine Mountains. The highest point in Manitoba is Baldy Mountain, which reaches 2,727 feet (832 m) and is located in the Duck Mountains. Hart Mountain, which is located in the Porcupine Mountains, rises to 2,700 feet and is not far behind.

Such systems can be written as Ax = b in matrix notation where x and b are column vectors and the evaluation of b requires the multiplication of the rows of A by the vector x. Cracovians introduced the idea of using the transpose of A, AT, and multiplying the columns of AT by the column x. This amounts to the definition of a new type of matrix multiplication denoted here by '‚àß'. Thus x ‚àß AT = b = Ax. The Cracovian product of two matrices, say A and B, is defined by A ‚àß B = BTA, where BT and A are assumed compatible for the common (Cayley) type of matrix multiplication. Since (AB)T = BTAT, the products (A ‚àß B) ‚àß C and A ‚àß (B ‚àß C) will generally be different; thus, Cracovian multiplication is non- associative. Cracovians are an example of a quasigroup. Cracovians adopted a column-row convention for designating individual elements as opposed to the standard row-column convention of matrix analysis. This made manual multiplication easier, as one needed to follow two parallel columns (instead of a vertical column and a horizontal row in the matrix notation.) It also sped up computer calculations, because both factors' elements were used in a similar order, which was more compatible with the sequential access memory in computers of those times ‚Äî mostly magnetic tape memory and drum memory. Use of Cracovians in astronomy faded as computers with bigger random access memory came into general use. Any modern reference to them is in connection with their non-associative multiplication. In programming In R the desired effect can be achieved via the \`crossprod()\` function. Specifically, the Cracovian product of matrices A and B can be obtained as \`crossprod(B, A)\`.

He left that club in late 2011 and joined Grimsby Town soon afterwards. As captain of Cambridge United he led the team to a second-place finish and F.A Trophy glory at Wembley. During the play-off final Miller received a ruptured Achilles' tendon in the final minutes of the game, despite this he still lifted the trophy - whilst in a wheelchair - as Cambridge won 2‚Äì1 against Gateshead, sending the club into the Football League. The injury ruled him out for the majority of the next season. After playing very few games he was released on a free transfer. After his time as captain at Cambridge United Miller became the club's Community Football Manager, while also playing on a part-time basis for Needham Market Playing career Bury Town Born in Colchester, Essex, Miller began his career with Isthmian League Division One North team Bury Town, with whom he reached the semi-final of the FA Vase. He signed a new one-and-a-half-year contract in January 2006, and was appointed as captain at the start of the 2006‚Äì07 season. Miller at Ipswich Ipswich Town He was signed by Ipswich Town on 22 September 2006 for a nominal fee on a contract until June 2007. Miller joined League Two side Boston United on a month-long loan in November 2006. This loan at Boston was extended until January 2007. He then joined another League Two side, Darlington, on a month's loan in February 2007. The loan was extended until April 2007, but Miller was recalled in late March to cover for injuries in Ipswich's squad. He made his sole appearance for Ipswich on 31 March 2007, as a substitute in the 74th minute for Jonathan Walters in their Championship fixture in the 3‚Äì1 victory over Plymouth Argyle. Miller agreed a new one-year contract with Ipswich in June 2007 and subsequently re- joined Darlington on an initial month's loan. It was extended until January 2008. Darlington On 11 January 2008 Miller joined Darlington permanently on a free transfer, signing a one-and-a-half-year contract. On 10 May 2008, Miller came on as an 87th-minute substitute in the League Two play-off semi- final first leg against Rochdale, replacing the injured Alan White. With the game tied at 1‚Äì1, Miller rose to head a 92nd-minute winner from a Neil Wainwright direct free kick, to give Darlington the lead heading into the second leg. After Darlington's players were asked to take a pay cut in November 2011, and Miller did not receive his wages for that month, he handed in his notice and left the club in December 2011. Grimsby Town Miller signed a 16-month contract with Conference National club Grimsby Town and made his debut in the starting eleven as the \\"Mariners\\" beat Lincoln City 3‚Äì1 on 1 January 2012. On 17 February 2012 he scored the equaliser in the 1‚Äì2 away victory at Southport, which was also his first goal for Grimsby, a corner from Frankie Artus was met with a powerful header by Miller inside the six-yard box. Miller was ever present for Grimsby during the 2012‚Äì13 season and played in the FA Trophy final at Wembley Stadium which ended in a defeat on penalties to Wrexham. The club had also led the Conference for a small part of the season but fell off towards the end and were eventually defeated in the play- offs by Newport County. Miller was released by the club on 3 May 2013. Cambridge United On 3 June 2013, Miller signed for Cambridge United on a two-year deal. At the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season the club did not offer him a new deal when his contract expired. Braintree and Needham Market In 2015 Miller signed a short-term deal with The National League side Braintree Town but only featured in one game before joining Needham Market.

Jjimjil is derived from the words meaning heating. In other areas of the building or on other floors there are unisex areas, usually with a snack bar, ondol-heated floor for lounging and sleeping, wide- screen TVs, exercise rooms, ice rooms, heated salt rooms, PC bang, noraebang, and sleeping quarters with bunk beds or sleeping mats. Many of the sleeping rooms have themes or elements to them. Usually jjimjilbangs will have various rooms with temperatures to suit guests' preferred relaxing temperatures. The walls are decorated with woods, minerals, crystals, stones, and metals to make the ambient mood and smell more natural. The elements used have traditional Korean medicinal purposes in the rooms. Most jjimjilbangs are open 24 hours and are a popular weekend getaway for South Korean families. During the week, many hardworking South Korean men, whose families live out of the city for cost savings, stay in jjimjilbangs overnight after working or drinking with co-workers late into the night. The cost is around 8,000-12,000 won to enter, and one can sleep overnight and enjoy the bathhouse and sauna. Hanjeungmak Hanjeungmak (Hangul: ÌïúÏ¶ùÎßâ, Hanja: Ê±óËí∏Âπï) is Korean traditional sauna. Intensely hot and dry, it uses traditionally burning wood of pine to heat a domelike kiln made of stone. Nowadays, hanjeungmaks are incorporated into jjimjilbang rather than being independent facilities. Bulgama installed in jjimjilbang is a variety of hanjeungmak, heated with higher temperature. Sometimes the dome- shaped walls of kiln rooms are plastered with loam, salt, minerals. History The first mention of hanjeungmak, initially referred to as Hanjeungso (, Hanja: Ê±óËí∏ÊâÄ), is found in the Annals of Sejong in the 15th century. The record also states that the Korean kiln saunas were used for medicinal purposes. At that time, hanjeungmaks were state-supported kiln saunas maintained by Buddhist monks. Since 1429, the saunas were constructed separating facilities for men and women. There are a picture painted by Kim Jun geun in the 19th century depicting a hanjeungmak and its circular wall made from bricks accompanied by a bath house.  Orientation  Jjimjilbangs usually operate 24 hours a day. In the entrance, there are the doors labelled ‚Äúmen‚Äù or ‚Äúwomen‚Äù and shoes are to be stored using a given key. Once inside, the shoe locker key is exchanged with another locker key to store clothes and belongings. Afterwards bathers walk into the gender-segregated bathhouse area (children of both genders below seven years of age are free to intermingle) and take a shower. Then, one should wear the jjimjilbang clothes (usually a T-shirt and shorts, color-coordinated according to gender), which are received with the locker key. In the bathing areas, there are kiln saunas with themes including a jade, a salt, or mineral kiln: the dome-shaped inside the kilns are plastered with jade powder, salt and mineral respectively. Often there are several kilns with temperatures ranging from . The temperature of the kilns is displayed on a sign at the entrance.  Hygiene  Jjimjilbangs are kept in a very sanitary condition for the health of patrons, and most are cleaned continuously. No harsh chemicals are used in the waters or saunas. But there were cases to be detected with molds or athletes foot germs during the hygiene checking, and also the cases of receiving administrative measure due to the foods over the expiry date. Currently, health control standards are forced to be followed according to Public Health Control Act. Yet, it is better to avoid the patients with cold or fever, or poor general condition. All wet areas prohibit the use of clothing for safety reasons. With the extreme heat of the baths and steam rooms, it is believed that toxic chemicals can leach out of apparel and into the body. It is also believed that if you wear a swimsuit or cover up you may be trying to hide a disease. Recently, the hygienic quality and healthiness of some jjimjilbangs were questioned, especially the proper washing of clothing provided by the jjimjilbangs. Concerns about the clothes increasing atopy symptoms in patients, or even of accidentally hosting parasites, were voiced, although the evidence was inconclusive. Safety Theft, usually of smartphones, is occasionally a problem at some jimjilbangs.

History RAF Fighter Command use Mendlesham airfield was built during 1943 and opened in late December of that year. Three RAF fighter squadrons manned by Czechoslovakian pilots moved in - No.310 flying Spitfire LFIXs and No. 312 flying Spitfire LFIXbs on 19 February 1944. No.313 flew in on 20 February with Spitfire IXs. No.310 finally moved out on 28 March 1944; Nos. 312 & 313 left on 4 April 1944.RAF Airfields of World War 2 by Jonathon Falconer, published reprint in 2016 USAAF use In March 1944, Mendlesham was allocated to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Eighth Air Force. It was assigned USAAF designation Station 156. From 30 March 1944 though 11 July 1945, Mendlesham served as headquarters for the 93d Combat Bombardment Wing, 3d Bombardment Division, Eighth Air Force. 34th Bombardment Group (Heavy) The first USAAF tenant was the United States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force 34th Bombardment Group (Heavy), arriving from Blythe AAF California. The 34th was assigned to the 93d Combat Bombardment Wing, and the group tail code was a \\"Square-S\\". Its operational squadrons were: * 4th Bombardment Squadron (Q6) * 7th Bombardment Squadron (R2) * 18th Bombardment Squadron (8I) * 391st Bombardment Squadron (3L) The group flew both Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses and Consolidated B-24 Liberators as part of the Eighth Air Force's strategic bombing campaign. 34th Bomb Group Lockheed/Vega B-17G-65-VE Fortress Serial 44-8457 Douglas-Tulsa B-24H-15-DT Liberator Serial 41-28851 of the 7th Bomb Squadron. This aircraft was damaged during a mission on 24 August 1944 and made an emergency landing in Sweden (MACR 8461). The aircraft was interned until the end of the war then repaired and flown back to the UK in 1945. The 34th flew 170 operations from the station, the first sixty-two while flying B-24 Liberators and the remainder with B-17G Fortresses. The change-over was made during the summer of 1944 when, in common with other groups assigned to the 93rd Combat Wing, the 3rd Division standardized on the Fortress. The group helped to prepare for the invasion of Normandy by bombing airfields in France and Germany, and supported the landing in June by attacking coastal defenses and communications. Continued to take part in the campaign in France by supporting ground forces at Saint-L√¥, 24‚Äì25 July, and by striking V-weapon sites, gun emplacements, and supply lines throughout the summer of 1944. The group converted to B-17s in September 1944 and engaged primarily in bombardment of strategic objectives from October 1944 to February 1945. Targets included marshalling yards in Ludwigshafen, Hamm, Osnabr√ºck, and Darmstadt; oil centers in Bielefeld, Merseburg, Hamburg, and Misburg; factories in Berlin, Dalteln, and Hanover; and airfields in M√ºnster, Neum√ºnster, and Frankfurt. During this period the group also supported ground forces during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944-January 1945. In March 1945, with few industrial targets remaining and with Allied armies advancing across Germany, the 34th turned almost solely to interdicting enemy communications and supporting Allied ground forces. Before V-E Day, it carried food to flooded areas of the Netherlands (Operation Chowhound), and after V-E Day transported prisoners of war from German camps to Allied centers. The 34th Bomb Group returned to Sioux Falls AAF, South Dakota on 28 August 1945 and was inactivated. RAF Maintenance Command use After the war, the field was used as the sub-site of No. 94 Maintenance Unit RAF being used as an ammunition storage depot. It was reduced to inactive status in June 1954 and sold. Current use With the end of military control the former technical site of Mendlesham to the southwest of the airfield was developed into an industrial estate. Large, expansive buildings were constructed over the area, around the T2 hangar that still exists. The balance of the airfield was returned to agricultural use; the runways, hardstands and perimeter track being largely removed for aggregate and today are fields, although parts of the perimeter track and the 02/20 runway remain as single-track farm access roads. No evidence of the wartime control tower remains. The NE end of the 20 runway has a small portion remaining at full width. A few wartime buildings are in use by farmers. Only the faintest hint of a perimeter track remains visible. A small but impressive memorial bronze plaque, subscribed to by the men of the 34th Group before their departure and erected in 1949 on the old airfield next to the A140 road, was stolen in April 2010 and presumably melted down for scrap. In January 2014 an appeal was started to raise ¬£35,000 to replace it in the more secure location of St Mary's Church in Mendlesham. Some aerospace-related use still remains though: one portion of runway 08/25, although now covered with grass, is now in use by local microlight pilots and by Suffolk Coastal Floaters hang-gliding club along with a blister-type hangar at the EOR.

The southern terminus of the route is at U.S. Route 119 (US 119) in Point Marion less than from the Pennsylvania-West Virginia border. The northern terminus is at PA 51 in Pittsburgh. PA 88 runs parallel to the Monongahela River for almost its entire length. Signed in 1927, PA 88 is one of the oldest state highways in Pennsylvania. For a brief period between 1927 and 1928, the route followed the Perry Highway between Pittsburgh and Erie. In 1928, the Perry Highway became US 19. Route description right PA 88 begins in Point Marion at an intersection with US 119\\\\. PA 88 begins as Main Street then turns to the west crossing the Monongahela River into Greene County on the Albert Gallatin Memorial Bridge. After crossing the river, PA 88 turns to the north as it begins to parallel the Monongahela River to the east as well as railroad tracks to the west. After crossing the Dunkard Creek, PA 88 has entered the village of Poland Mines. In Monongahela Township, PA 88 intersects Pennsylvania Route 21. In the boro of Carmichaels, PA 88 is called Vine Street and crosses the Muddy Creek. In Jefferson Township, PA 88 intersects the eastern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 188 southwest of Rices Landing. After crossing the Tenmile Creek, PA 88 has entered Washington County as Front Street. PA 88 passes through the following villages: Milfred Terrace, Fredericktown Hill, North Fredericktown, Vesta Heights, and Vestaburg. In East Bethlehem Township and Centerville Boro. In Centerville Boro, PA 88 becomes Low Hill Rd. PA 88 has a snake like curve paralleling the Monongahela River. In Centerville Boro, PA 88 joins Pennsylvania Turnpike 43 for before leaving to join another concurrency with U.S. Route 40. East of PA 43, PA 88 leaves US 40 at a trumpet interchange in West Brownsville. North of the concurrency, PA 88 becomes a local road named California Road. In California, PA 88 becomes Wood Street then turns to the west and becomes 3rd Street. In Coal Center, PA 88 Highpoint Drive, then Spring Street, and then Highpoint Drive again. Passengers can see Turnpike 43 from PA 88 in Coal Center. As PA 88 begins to shift to the east, it enters the following boros: Elco, Roscoe, and Stockdale. As PA 88 enters these boros it becomes Highpoint Drive and Chester Avenue. North of Stockdale, PA 88 begins to turn to the north and becomes Main Street. In Speers as Pennsylvania Street, PA 88 interchanges Interstate 70 at exit 40 in a scaped shaped interchange with long ramps. In Charleroi and North Charleroi, PA 88 is called McKean Avenue. In Carroll Township, PA 88 is called Country Club Road and meets the southern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 837. In Monongahela, PA 88 begins a three route concurrency with Pennsylvania Route 136 and Pennsylvania Route 837. Then PA 88/PA 136/PA 837 become Main Street and intersect the northern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 481. In the northern tip of Monongahela, PA 136 splits off from PA 88 and PA 837. As PA 88/PA 837 enter New Eagle, PA 837 splits from PA 88 then PA 88 becomes Union Street. In Union Township, PA 88 passes under Turnpike 43. In Finleyville, PA 88 becomes Sheridan Avenue. Finleyville is where the future Interstate 576 (Southern Beltway) will meet Turnpike 43. Then PA 88 re-enters Union Township passing several businesses and then becomes Library Road near the Allegheny County line. The entire Allegheny County stretch of PA 88 is also designated as Library Road. Starting at the Washington/Allegheny County line where PA 88 becomes Library Road, PA 88 runs through South Park, Bethel Park, Castle Shannon, and the Overbrook neighborhood of Pittsburgh where PA 88/Library Rd. ends at an \\"Y\\" intersection with Pennsylvania Route 51/Saw Mill Run Blvd. Three of the six county's colored Belt Routes connect with and/or run along PA 88 (see below). History PA 88 originally was planned to extend from Pittsburgh all the way north to Erie, along the highway that now largely follows US 19. US 19 was first proposed for this route in 1927, but the routing at the time was turned down. The route does appear as both PA 88 and US 19 on one 1928 map. In the 1930s (most likely 1935 or 1936) PA 88 was extended north to New Castle. The route is not marked as PA 88 on the official 1930 map but is so marked on the 1940 map. The Pittsburgh-to-New Castle section was largely split off on July 15, 1960 to form Pennsylvania Route 65, in honor of the 65th Infantry Division of the United States Army during World War II. The 7.7 mile stretch of PA 88 from PA 65's current southern terminus at the West End Bridge to PA 88's current northern terminus was decommissioned. This designation change was made to reduce the number of concurrent routes in Pittsburgh. The changes took effect a few months later and signs were changed by spring 1961. Connections to PA 65 Nonetheless, PA 88's legacy still survives in its former northern sections. Of PA 88's five spur routes, PA 288 and PA 488 were branch routes off what is now US 19, while PA 288, PA 388, PA 488, and PA 588 now appear as spur routes of 65, but still retain the \\"88\\" base numbers. (PA 88 did retain PA 188 as a spur route.) In addition, a drive-in theater known as Spotlight 88 in North Sewickley Township retained its name after the route was rebadged as 65, and is still known by that name as its current incarnation as a flea market after the drive-in was destroyed by an F3 tornado on May 31, 1985.Pennsylvania Highways - Pennsylvania Route 88 Major intersections PA 88 Truck Pennsylvania Route 88 Truck is a truck route in California, Pennsylvania. The route was created to allow access to the Pennsylvania Route 43 toll freeway and to allow large vehicles to avoid the large hill into the Monongahela Valley. The center of the route is at the PA 43 interchange, with a two-lane stretch providing access to California University of Pennsylvania and the surrounding business district, as well as connecting traffic with northbound Route 88; a four-lane stretch provides a more gradual ascent of the hill on Route 88 southbound.

A severe forest fire was almost inevitable, followed by severe erosion and the creation of a second-growth forest that differed from the previous old-growth forest in many ways. Today, the Mackinac Wilderness is a roadless unit within the managed Hiawatha Forest. Much of the wilderness consists of wetlands alongside the Carp River, a natural trout stream listed as a National Wild and Scenic River, and the unit's wilderness designation helps protect part of the river's drainage. The wilderness is also a template of natural succession that contrasts with most of the Hiawatha National Forest, which continues to be managed for harvestable pulpwood. The unit's terrain is dominated by postglacial moraines and sand dunes left behind by the Wisconsin glaciation and modified by the stormy climate that accompanied the glacial meltoff. Many of the sandy ridges and mounds are separated by creeks and ribbon-shaped wetlands, and some of the highlands are laced together by beaver dams. Beaver ponds are key features of the wilderness. Two tree families found in large numbers within the Mackinac Wilderness are aspen and birch, both typical of second-growth forests in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In wet areas near the Carp River, the Northern whitecedar is found, although this tree is severely impacted by browsing by whitetail deer. Birds such as the great blue heron, the osprey, and the sandhill crane nest in the wilderness. The Mackinac Wilderness had no footpaths as of 2006, and public visitation to the wilderness was centered on the roadside strip adjacent to M-123, and on the Carp River and its banks. As of 2006, the Mackinac Wilderness was managed jointly by the U.S. Forest Service and the Ojibwa tribe of Native Americans. Like Mackinac Island, the Mackinac Wilderness is pronounced Mack-in-aw, and is often misspelled accordingly. Members of the Ojibwa nation living in the eastern Upper Peninsula often call themselves Chippewa.

Route description PA 89 north of the junction with PA 430 PA 89 begins running north on Franklin Street in the city of Titusville just after the PA 8/PA 27 junction. PA 89 runs northeast out of the city before arcing back around to the north and passing through the community of Vrooman. The highway then bypasses Rome and Buells Corners to the east and then continues north through Hatchtown. West of the borough of Spartansburg, PA 89 forms a brief concurrency with PA 77. PA 89 then crosses over into Erie County. PA 89 continues north to US 6, which it overlaps with from Lovell to the borough of Elgin. After splitting off to the north once again, the highway turns more northwest and meets Pennsylvania Route 8 south of the borough of Wattsburg. The two routes overlap through Wattsburg (where they meet the western terminus of PA 474) and split up in Lowville. At Colt Station, PA 89 crosses PA 430. North of the PA 430 junction, PA 89 has an interchange with Interstate 86 (exit 3). later, PA 89 has an interchange with Interstate 90 (exit 41). PA 89 then enters the borough of North East.

Great Ashfield Airfield is still in private use although much reduced in size. It was originally a Royal Flying Corps grass landing strip on this site in World War I, and before the USAAF arrived the RAF had been using it for training, during that period it was known as RAF Elmswell. United States Army Air Forces use Great Ashfield was re-built for the USAAF in 1942 and assigned designation Station 155. The first aircraft to land on the station is believed to have been a battle-damaged B-26 Marauder returning from a raid over the Netherlands on 17 May 1943. USAAF Station Units assigned to RAF Great Ashfield were: * 455th Sub-Depot * 18th Weather Squadron * 31st Station Complement Squadron Regular Army Station Units included: * 1152nd Quartermaster Company * 1249th Military Police Company * 1735th Ordnance Supply & Maintenance Company * 877th Chemical Company (Air Operations) * 2036th Engineer Fire Fighting Platoon  385th Bombardment Group (Heavy)  General Ira C Eaker and General Lee with Lieutenant-Colonel Elliot Vandevanter Jr, commanding officer of the 385th Bomb Group, during an official visitm 28 September 1943.

The airfield was opened on 19 June 1943 and was used by the United States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force 385th Bombardment Group (Heavy). The 385th arrived from Great Falls AAF Montana and was assigned to the 93d Combat Bombardment Wing. The group tail code was a \\"Square-G\\". Its operational squadrons were: * 548th Bombardment Squadron (GX) * 549th Bombardment Squadron (XA) * 550th Bombardment Squadron (SG) * 551st Bombardment Squadron (HR) The group flew Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses as part of the Eighth Air Force's strategic bombing campaign. The 385th BG operated primarily as a strategic bombardment organization until the war ended, striking such targets as industrial areas, air bases, oil refineries, and communications centers in Germany, France, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway. The group received a Distinguished Unit Citation for bombing an aircraft factory at Regensburg on 17 August 1943 after a long hazardous flight over enemy territory. The group led the 4th Bomb Wing a great distance through heavy and damaging opposition for the successful bombardment of an aircraft repair plant at Zwickau on 12 May 1944, being awarded another DUC for this performance. Other strategic targets included aircraft factories in Oschersleben and Marienburg, battery works in Stuttgart, airfields in Beauvais and Chartres, oil refineries in Ludwigshafen and Merseburg, and marshalling yards in Munich and Oranienburg. Sometimes supported ground forces and struck interdictory targets. Attacked coastline defenses in June 1944 in preparation for the Normandy invasion and hit marshalling yards and choke points during the landing on D-Day. Bombed enemy positions in support of ground forces at Saint-L√¥ in July 1944. Attacked German communications and fortifications during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944-January 1945. Bombed troop concentrations and communications centers in Germany and France, March‚ÄìApril 1945, to assist the final thrust into Germany. On 6 March 1944 raid to Berlin (the most costly mission the Eighth ever carried out) the 3rd Division commander, Brigadier General Russell Wilson, took off from Great Ashfield in a radar-equipped B-17 in a leading group of the 385th. All of the 385th aircraft returned safely ... all that is except the one carrying General Wilson which was seen to take several hits from flak setting one engine on fire. Although four of the crew managed to parachute to safety (including Medal of Honor hero First Lieutenant John C. Morgan), eight of the others were killed when the bomber exploded. After V-E Day, the 385th Bomb Group hauled prisoners of war from Germany to Allied centers and flew food to the Netherlands. The group returned to Sioux Falls AAF South Dakota on 28 August 1945 and was inactivated. Legacy During the Cold War, the United States Air Force 385th Strategic Aerospace Wing, based at Offut AFB Nebraska controlled a mixture of strategic missiles and air refueling aircraft. The wing provided airborne command post services and supported SAC's global air refueling mission. The wing was active between 1962 and 1964 and was bestowed the World War II legacy and honors of the USAAF 385th Bomb Group upon activation. Postwar Royal Air Force use After the war, the airfield reverted to RAF control and it came under Maintenance Command as a sub-site for bomb storage before being finally abandoned and sold in 1955. Civil use War memorial, Great Ashfield. Across the ford, steps lead up to a simple stone slab with a bronze plaque commemorating the men of the 385th Heavy Bombardment Group of the US Army Air Force who flew B17s out of the then Great Ashfield airfield. With the end of military control, Great Ashfield was returned to agriculture. Much of the concrete has been removed and sold as aggregate, with a small section of the main runway being retained for use by light aircraft. Much of the perimeter track has been reduced to a single lane farm access road and a few wartime buildings remain in a deteriorated state. A memorial to those of the 385th who lost their lives flying from Great Ashfield can be seen in the village church.

The Blue series is so called because the covers of the books were blue.  History of the series  In the 1950s, the Franco- Belgian comics magazine Tintin had a good following in France and Wallonia (the French speaking part of Belgium). However, the sister publication Kuifje, aimed at the Dutch speaking part of Belgium, suffered in comparison. So they brought in a Dutch-speaking cartoonist - Willy Vandersteen. In Tintin, he created 6 stories from 1952 to 1957. Herg√© taught Vandersteen to draw in the ligne claire style, so these 6 stories were Vandersteen's first works drawn in the ligne claire style. It was decided that when these stories were published as books they would have blue covers to distinguish them from the earlier books with red covers. When Vandersteen left the magazine, he continued his stories, but they were again released with red covers. These books were specifically praised by franquin the main writer of spirou and fantasio who personally prefers de gezanten van mars to be his favorite suske en wiske tale.

History Eye was a standard Class A airfield for heavy bombers. The U.S. Army 829th Engineer Battalion began construction of this WWII air base in September 1942, with the 827th Battalion arriving that December to assist. The 859th Battalion arrived in May of the following year when the 829th Battalion left. The bulk of the work was done in the summer of 1943 with the 827th setting records in pouring concrete while the 859th made their mark in building construction. Additional work was performed by British contractors. The airfield was declared operational and turned over to the U.S. Army Air Forces on 7 December 1943, two years after the attack on Pearl Harbor. On 1 April 1944, the entire airfield was complete and occupied by the 8th Air Force, which designated it AAF Station 134. RAF Eye was one of the last wartime airfields to be built in the area and some of the equipment used in its construction remained for many years after the war.

The 490th arrived from Mountain Home AAF Idaho and was assigned to the 93d Combat Bombardment Wing. The group flew Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses and Consolidated B-24 Liberators as part of the Eighth Air Force's strategic bombing campaign. The group tail code was initially a \\"Square-T\\" when it moved in with B-24 Liberators. After being re-equipped with B-17G Flying Fortresses, it adopted a red stripe at the top of the plane's vertical stabilizers. Operational flying squadrons of the group were: * 848th Bombardment Squadron (7W) * 849th Bombardment Squadron (W8) * 850th Bombardment Squadron (7Q) * 851st Bombardment Squadron (S3) The 490th BG combat in June 1944 with B-24's, bombing airfields and coastal defences in France immediately preceding and during the invasion of Normandy. Then struck bridges, rail lines, vehicles, road junctions, and troop concentrations in France. Supported ground forces near Caen in July and near Brest in September 1944. The group converted to B-17's in October and operated primarily against strategic targets until the end of February 1945. The 490th mounted attacks against enemy oil plants, tank factories, marshalling yards, aircraft plants, and airfields in such cities as Berlin, Hamburg, Merseburg, M√ºnster, Kassel, Hannover, and Cologne. Interrupted strategic missions to attack supply lines and military installations during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944-January 1945. Beginning in March 1945, attacked interdictory targets and supported advancing ground forces. After V-E Day, carried food to flood stricken areas of the Netherlands and transported French, Spanish, and Belgian prisoners of war from Austria to Allied centers. The 490th returned to the US to Drew Field, Florida on 3 September 1945, then was inactivated on 7 November 1945. Postwar RAF use After the war Eye then transferred to RAF Bomber Command on 1 November 1945 as an active station. However the airfield was gradually run down and was finally sold by the Air Ministry during 1962-63. Current use With the end of military control, Eye airfield was converted into an industrial estate with a large factory for processing straw being established in the hangars and former technical site. Later, other industrial development and new buildings were built in the same area. There is a natural gas pumping station in the centre of the former airfield. The world's first poultry litter-fueled generating plant was built on the site in 1992. It produces 12.7 MW of power and consumes 140,000 tonnes of chicken litter a year and is owned by Energy Power Resources (EPR). Many of the old taxiways and runways remain, along with a T-2 hangar and various wartime buildings in various states of repair and use.

The northern terminus of the route is at PA 487 in Orangeville, the part of the road west of the Susquehanna and Berwick once being part of the Susquehanna & Tioga Turnpike (1806). The route heads northwest as an undivided road from Nesquehoning through mountainous areas, passing through Beaver Meadows. The road reaches the city of Hazleton, where it passes through developed areas and crosses PA 309. PA 93 continues through West Hazleton and becomes a divided highway before it reaches an interchange with Interstate 81 (I-81). The road becomes undivided again and passes through Conyngham before coming to an interchange with I-80. PA 93 continues northwest and passes through Nescopeck before crossing the Susquehanna River into Berwick and forming a concurrency with US 11.

PA 93 was designated in 1927 between US 309/PA 22 in Hazleton and US 11/PA 19 in Berwick while US 309/PA 22 was designated onto the road between Nesquehoning and Hazleton. A year later, PA 93 was extended to PA 339 (now PA 487) in Orangeville and the PA 22 designation was removed from US 309. In the 1930s, the south end of PA 93 was truncated to PA 29 (now PA 239) southeast of Nescopeck, with PA 29 replacing the route southeast to Hazleton. PA 93 was extended north to PA 115 (now PA 254) in Rohrsburg in the 1940s. A realigned PA 29 replaced the US 309 designation between Nesquehoning and Hazleton in the 1950s. On May 9, 1966, PA 93 was extended southeast to US 209 in Nesquehoning, replacing that section of PA 29, while the north end was cut back to PA 487 in Orangeville in the 1960s. Route description PA 93 begins at an intersection with US 209 in the borough of Nesquehoning in Carbon County, heading north on two-lane undivided Hunter Street. The road passes over a railroad line owned by the Carbon & Schuylkill Railroad and operated as part of the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad's Reading Division before it heads into forested areas.

The route bends west and is lined with residences before it comes to a junction with the northern terminus of PA 339. The roadway passes through the commercial downtown of Nescopeck before heading back into residential areas and curving southwest into woods. PA 93 in Briar Creek Township PA 93 enters Mifflin Township in Columbia County and immediately turns northwest to enter Briar Creek Township and cross over the Susquehanna River near the mouth of Nescopeck Creek. Upon reaching the north bank of the river, the road enters the borough of Berwick and passes over the North Shore Railroad before heading off the bridge and into the commercial downtown on South Market Street. The route immediately intersects US 11 and turns southwest to form a wrong-way concurrency with that route on the one-way pair of West 2nd Street northbound and West Front Street southbound, with each street carrying two lanes of traffic. The streets pass through the downtown before running past a mix of homes and businesses. Both directions of US 11/PA 93 merge to head west on West Front Street, which has two northbound lanes and one southbound lane. A block later, PA 93 splits from US 11 by heading northwest onto two-lane undivided Orange Street, heading through residential areas.

Farther west, PA 93 enters the borough of Orangeville and becomes Berwick Road, reaching its northern terminus at an intersection with PA 487 in a residential area. History PA 93 southbound from PA 487 in Orangeville When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, the present-day alignment of PA 93 was designated as part of Legislative Route 170 between Nesquehoning and Hudsondale and between Beaver Meadows and Hazleton and as part of Legislative Route 184 between Hazleton and Conyngham. By 1926, the roadway between Nesquehoning and Berwick was paved. US 309/PA 22 was realigned onto the road between Nesquehoning and Hazleton in 1927 while PA 93 was designated to run from US 309/PA 22 (now PA 309) in Hazleton northwest to US 11/PA 19 in Berwick. In 1928, PA 93 was extended northwest from Berwick to PA 339 (now PA 487) in Orangeville along an unpaved road while the concurrent PA 22 designation was removed from US 309. By 1930, a section of the route west of Berwick was under construction. The southern terminus of PA 93 was cut back to PA 29 (now PA 239) southeast of Nescopeck in the 1930s, with PA 29 replacing the route between there and Hazleton. By this time, the route was paved between Berwick and Orangeville. In the 1940s, PA 93 was extended north from Orangeville to PA 115 (now PA 254) in Rohrsburg, running concurrent with PA 339 before following Rohrsburg Road. In addition, the section of PA 29 between Hazleton and West Hazleton was widened to a multilane highway. US 309 and PA 29 switched alignments between Allentown and Hazleton in the 1950s, with PA 29 designated onto the road between Nesquehoning and Hazleton. On May 9, 1966, PA 93 was extended southeast to US 209 in Nesquehoning, replacing the section of PA 29 between Nesquehoning and southeast of Nescopeck. In the 1960s, the northern terminus of PA 93 was cut back to PA 487 in Orangeville. The road was upgraded to a divided highway between Hazleton and the I-81 interchange in the 1960s. Major intersections PA 93 Truck Pennsylvania Route 93 Truck (PA 93 Truck) is a truck route of PA 93 that bypasses a weight-restricted bridge over Quakake Creek in Packer Township, on which trucks over 34 tons and combination loads over 40 tons are prohibited. The route follows US 209, PA 54, PA 309, Ben Titus Road, and Quakake Road. The route was originally signed in 2013, but in 2017 the Southbound Truck Route was lengthened to PA 424 restricting most trucks over 28 feet from going down the Broad Mountain after numerous wrecks. The southbound truck route follows PA 424, PA 309, PA 54 and US 209.

Gifts from local patrons and corporate benefactors from their personal art collections are also included in the Museum's holdings. Many of these donors were themselves artists or sponsors of area artists. The Museum collection added to the local cultural heritage in two major ways - public exposure to the larger world of art and documentation of local art history. The purchases of works by local artists and the acceptance of donations were the two major influences on the development of the Permanent Collection until the Museum moved into the Cultural Center for the Arts in 1970. At that time, the Museum‚Äôs Board decided that the Permanent Collection should be focused on a more specific collecting area. The Ralph L. Wilson Collection of American Art, gifted in the 1970s, was a significant step toward the eventual focus on 19th and 20th Century American artists. History The Canton Museum of Art traces its roots to the Little Civic Art Gallery founded in the Canton Public Library in 1935. A year later, the organization became known as the Canton Art Institute and an active program of exhibits and educational programs flourished throughout the late 1930s. In 1941, a Richardsonian building known as the Case Mansion was donated and renovated to become the home of the Institute. During the next thirty years, CAI became a focal point for the arts in Canton, supporting affiliate organizations such as Canton Fine Arts Associates. It provided a home for the offices of the Canton Symphony, and facilities for the Madrigal Singers, Canton Chamber Music Society and the Players‚Äô Guild. All the arts in Canton were centralized when the Cultural Center for the Arts was established in 1970. The Institute began a program of expanded exhibits and art classes. Educational initiatives, such as the Humanities program with the Canton City Schools, were begun and new affiliate organizations, including the Museum Guild, the Players‚Äô Guild Theatre, and the Potter's Guild were founded. During the 1980s, the Board of Trustees and CMA Staff began to clarify the goals and direction of the Museum. In 1989, a unique focus for the Permanent Collection: * 19th and 20th Century American works on paper and * American ceramics, 1950s and forward, was approved by the CMC and Board of Trustees. 1980s CAI shows including a Goya exhibit, two successful exhibitions of Ohio‚Äôs quilts and a commemoration of the Statue of Liberty‚Äôs centennial. In the 1990s, the museum presented a broad variety of exhibits, including innovative projects such as Ubu Roi and The Power of If involving students, teachers and area artists. A CMA original exhibit, \\"Ultra-Realistic Sculpture by Mark Sijan,\\" presented here in 1992, went on an extended national tour. The museum's educational efforts included Outreach programs and Art Experience Days. CMA celebrated its 60th Anniversary in 1995 and assumed a new identity as The Canton Museum of Art. In 1997-98, the Museum presented \\"Norman Rockwell‚Äôs America,\\" the most successful exhibit in the Museum‚Äôs history and hosted a touring exhibition from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, \\"The Nazi Olympics‚ÄîBerlin 1936.\\" In 2004, the Museum presented the prestigious \\"Andrew Wyeth: The Helga Pictures\\" exhibit to over 12,000 patrons in six weeks. Museum overview CMA offers 12 to 15 exhibitions throughout the year. In this rotation, the main exhibition is often accompanied by two smaller exhibitions of regional artists and a presentation of works from the permanent collection developed around a theme. Permanent Collection exhibitions might contain works by significant American, European and regional artists. Once a year gallery space is devoted to art by high school students in Canton and Stark County. The high school shows are juried and financial scholarships are awarded for both college and CMA art classes. Affiliate groups have two fund-raisers annually that are intended as social events for the community. The ‚ÄúAntiques in Canton‚Äù Show & Sale has a nationally known guest curator, and ‚ÄúChristkindl Markt‚Äù is a juried arts and craft show bringing over 100 craftsmen from around the country. The Museum‚Äôs Education Department provides the public with studio art classes and workshops. Educational Outreach programs take the museum off-site to libraries, parochial schools, area public schools, five inner city schools and a special school for students with behavioral disorders. Docent-led school tours are available for current exhibitions and art experience days allow students to participate in hands-on projects. For over 20 years, the Canton City school district has offered special Humanities courses to its students at the Museum. And Kent State University, Stark Campus schedules its ceramic classes in our Pot Shop. The CMA is a regular meeting place for a number of community and civic organizations such as the Rotary, the Canton Garden Club, and Prime Time, a seniors group affiliated with a local hospital. Permanent collection The Canton Museum of Art‚Äôs Permanent Collection focus is 19th-, 20th- and 21st-century American works on paper and contemporary ceramics, 1950s and forward. Major categories are American drawings; American watercolors; American prints and American ceramics. This focus is unique among museums in northeast Ohio ‚Äì an area that includes such distinguished museums as the Akron Art Museum, The Butler Institute of American Art and the Cleveland Museum of Art. The collection focus was enhanced through the gift of a fine collection of watercolors and drawings from Ralph L. Wilson in the 70s. Included in his gift were works by Burchfield, Demuth, Feininger, Henri, Keller, Marin, Maurer, Prendergast, Shinn, Sommer. Augmented the watercolor collection are purchased works of Thomas Hart Benton, Oscar Bluemner, Carolyn Brady, Winslow Homer, Edward Hopper, George Luks, Jan Multaka, Joseph Raffael, John Singer Sargent and Andrew Wyeth. The print collection contains work by Romare Bearden, Thomas Hart Benton, Alexander Calder, Mary Cassatt, Roy Lichtenstein, Mary Nimmo Moran, Philip Pearlstein, Robert Rauschenberg, Larry Rivers and Andy Warhol. Contemporary ceramics 1950s and forward is a unique yet traditional focus for the Museum. Ohio‚Äôs history of ceramics includes decorative pottery work of Roseville, Rookwood, Weller and McCoy and the Museum‚Äôs focus extends this interest in pottery with contemporary works. The collection contains works by Jack Earl, Maija Grotell, Marilyn Levine, Toshiko Takaezu and Patti Warashina among others. In the past three years, the collection has been expanded through gifts and purchases with works by Ken Ferguson, Karen Karnes, Don Pilcher, Don Reitz and Victor Spinski. Since 1992, the Museum has purchased watercolors by Thomas Hart Benton, Oscar Bluemner, Carolyn Brady, Winslow Homer, Edward Hopper, George Luks, Jan Multaka, Joseph Raffael and John Singer Sargent. The ceramic collection was supplemented with purchases of works by Brother Thomas Bezanson, Ken Ferguson, Karen Karnes, Roberta Laidman and Victor Spinski. In addition, the Museum accepted gifts of works by Don Pilcher and Don Reitz. The permanent collection serves as the foundation for the Museum‚Äôs exhibition programs. It is used in ongoing exhibits of the Permanent Collection (mindful of the special rotation requirements of watercolors and works on paper), and as the core of special exhibits created with loans from other institutions.

The southern terminus of the route is at the Mason‚ÄìDixon line, where PA 94 continues into Maryland as Maryland Route 30 (MD 30). The northern terminus is at PA 34 south of Mount Holly Springs. PA 94 heads north-northwest from the state line through southwestern York County, where it passes through Hanover and intersects PA 116/PA 194 in the center of town. Past Hanover, the route heads into rural areas and crosses into the eastern portion of Adams County. Here, PA 94 intersects U.S. Route 30 (US 30) east of New Oxford, PA 394 in Hampton, PA 234 north of Hampton, and US 15 in York Springs. The route heads into Cumberland County and crosses South Mountain, reaching its end at PA 34. PA 94 is designated as the 94th Infantry Division Memorial Highway for its entire length. The current route served as part of two 19th-century turnpikes that connected the Cumberland Valley with Baltimore. The section south of Hanover became part of the Hanover branch of the Baltimore and Reisterstown Turnpike (later the Baltimore and Hanover Turnpike) in 1805 while the section north of Hanover became the southern portion of the Hanover and Carlisle Turnpike, which continued north to Carlisle, in 1812. PA 94 was designated in 1928 to run from MD 30 at the Maryland border southeast of Hanover to PA 34 in Mount Holly Springs along a paved road. The route was widened in Hanover in the 1940s and 1950s. Route description PA 94 northbound past its southern terminus at MD 30 at the Maryland border in West Manheim Township PA 94 begins at the Maryland border in West Manheim Township, York County, where the road continues south into that state as MD 30. From the state line, the route heads northwest on two- lane undivided Baltimore Pike, passing through agricultural areas with some woods and residential development and serving the communities of West Manheim and Pleasant Hill. PA 94 runs through more rural areas with residential subdivisions. The road briefly gains a center left-turn lane as it passes commercial development, turning north and heading into Penn Township. At this point, the route becomes Baltimore Street and passing a mix of residential and business development, running through Parkville and curving northwest again. The road enters the borough of Hanover, where it is lined with several homes. Upon reaching the commercial downtown, PA 94 comes to an intersection with PA 116 and northbound PA 194\\\\. The route becomes Carlisle Street at this point and intersects the southbound direction of PA 194 a block later. The road crosses a York Railway line and CSX's Hanover Subdivision railroad line within a short distance of each other and leaves the downtown area, heading past more residences. Farther north, PA 94 gains a center left-turn lane and passes several businesses. The route becomes the border between Penn Township to the west and Hanover to the east as it runs to the west of the North Hanover Mall. The road passes more businesses before fully entering Penn Township again and narrowing back to two lanes. PA 94 southbound in York Springs PA 94 enters Conewago Township in Adams County and becomes Carlisle Pike, heading into agricultural areas with some commercial development. A short distance later, the route becomes the border between Oxford Township to the west and Berwick Township to the east, running through a wooded area between two lakes before heading through more farmland with some woods and development. In the commercial community of Cross Keys, the road crosses US 30 into Hamilton Township to the east of the borough of New Oxford, running through more agricultural areas with some homes. Farther north, PA 94 crosses the Conewago Creek into Reading Township and runs through more rural areas before coming into the residential community of Hampton and intersecting the eastern terminus of PA 394\\\\. The road heads through a mix of farms, woods, and homes as it comes to a junction with PA 234\\\\. Past this, the route continues through open farmland with some woodland and residences, passing through Round Hill. PA 94 crosses Mud Run into Huntington Township and runs through more rural areas as it passes to the west of Bermudian Springs High School, turning more to the northwest as it heads into Latimore Township. The route heads through forested areas with some homes, crossing back into Huntington Township and reaching an interchange with US 15, becoming a four-lane divided highway at this point. From here, the road continues into residential areas as a two-lane undivided road and enters the borough of York Springs, passing through the town on Main Street. PA 94 crosses back into Huntington Township and becomes Carlisle Pike again, running through farmland with a few areas of woods and homes. The route heads into Latimore Township again and turns more to the north through open farm fields. PA 94 heads north into South Middleton Township in Cumberland County and becomes Baltimore Pike, running through a mix of farms and woods with some homes. Farther north, the road traverses forested South Mountain and crosses the Appalachian Trail, curving to the northwest. PA 94 turns north and enters the borough of Mount Holly Springs and becomes South Baltimore Avenue, passing through wooded areas of housing developments before ending at PA 34. History The section of present-day PA 94 south of Hanover was built in 1736 and 1737 as a wagon road connecting the Conewago Settlement (present-day Hanover) with Baltimore. This road became the Hanover branch of the Baltimore and Reisterstown Turnpike in 1805, a private turnpike that ran between Baltimore and Hanover via Reisterstown, Maryland. This branch later became known as the Baltimore and Hanover Turnpike, with toll collection stopped by 1899. The section of current PA 94 north of Hanover was chartered as the Hanover and Carlisle Turnpike in 1812, connecting Hanover with Carlisle. These two turnpikes provided an improved trade link between the Cumberland Valley and Baltimore. When routes were legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, what is now PA 94 was designated as part of Legislative Route 190 between the Maryland border and Hanover. PA 94 was designated in 1928 to run from MD 30 at the Maryland border southeast of Hanover north-northwest to PA 34 in Mount Holly Springs, following its current alignment. Upon designation, the entire length of the route was paved. The portion of PA 94 in central Hanover was widened in the 1940s. In the 1950s, the widened sections of the route were extended further north and south in the Hanover area. In 1998, an act of the Pennsylvania General Assembly designated the entire length of PA 94 as the 94th Infantry Division Memorial Highway in honor of the 94th Infantry Division.

The airfield was opened in April 1944 and was used by the United States Army Air Forces 8th Air Force 493d Bombardment Group (Heavy), arriving from RAF Elveden Hall. The 493d was assigned to the 93d Combat Bombardment Wing, and the group tail code was a \\"Square-X\\" while equipped with B-24s. Its operational squadrons were: * 860th Bombardment Squadron (NG) * 861st Bombardment Squadron (G6) * 862d Bombardment Squadron (8M) * 863d Bombardment Squadron (Q4) The group flew both the Consolidated B-24 Liberator and the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress as part of the Eighth Air Force's strategic bombing campaign. Debach airfield was the last Eighth Air Force heavy bomber station to become operational, the group flying its first mission on D-Day. Unfortunately the American engineers had not made a very satisfactory job of constructing the runway and the concrete soon started to break up. By the end of 1944, the runway was so bad that the group had to move temporarily to RAF Little Walden while runways were repaired and strengthened. The group returned to Debach in March 1945. The 493d BG used B-24's until they were replaced with B-17's in September 1944. The group operated chiefly against industrial and military installations in Germany, attacking an ordnance depot at Magdeburg, marshalling yards at Cologne, synthetic oil plants at Merseburg, a railroad tunnel at Ahrweiler, bridges at Irlich, factories at Frankfurt, and other strategic objectives. On 25 September, a bombardment of Strasbourg left a number of buildings destroyed in the historical city centre. Additional operations included striking airfields, bridges, and gun batteries prior to and during the invasion of Normandy in June 1944; hitting enemy positions to assist ground forces south of Caen and at Saint-L√¥ in July 1944; bombing German fortifications to cover the airborne attack on the Netherlands in September 1944; attacking enemy communications during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944-January 1945; and assisting the airborne assault across the Rhine in March 1945. The 493d Bomb Group flew its last combat mission, an attack on marshalling yards at Nauen, on 20 April 1945. The unit returned to Sioux Falls AAF South Dakota and was inactivated on 28 August 1945. Postwar use The USAAF is remembered in the village's sign. After the war, Debach was used first as a camp for German PoWs and later for displaced persons before being abandoned about 1948. It was sold in 1963-64, the main N‚ÄìS runway becoming the boundary between two adjoining farms. The more interesting western side includes the control tower and several original buildings. The northern end of the main runway was sold in 1969 for the construction of a mushroom farm. Much of the concrete runways and taxiways were ground into aggregate for use during road building, and the land reclaimed to be used for agricultural crops. Many of the buildings on the former Technical site were torn down with one man being killed during the removal of the north-east T2 hangar. The other hangar is now a farm grain store. The control tower still stands and has been completely restored with other close buildings being used to display artefacts and act as a museum to 493rd Bomb Group. Pylons carrying electricity now cross the southern edge of the former airfield. See also *List of former Royal Air Force stations References Citations Bibliography * Freeman, Roger A.

The lighthouse is also known simply as \\"Breakwater Light\\" or \\"Outer Light\\". It is one of two built off Lynde Point in the nineteenth century. The other lighthouse, known as Lynde Point Light or more commonly as \\"Inner Light\\", is 75 years older than this lighthouse. The two lighthouses mark the harbor channel at the mouth of the Connecticut River. History The lighthouse has been in service since 1886. In 2007, the federal government announced it would sell the lighthouse as part of the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Program, which was created to transfer responsibility for maintenance of lighthouses to municipal governments or private entities. The Old Saybrook town government expressed an interest in the lighthouse, which is not expected to be transferred from the federal government until sometime in 2008 or 2009. The National Park Service will screen potential owners. The Coast Guard would continue to maintain the light while the new owners maintain the historic structure. The Coast Guard also owns the land on which the lighthouse sits, and transferring the land is not part of the preservation program.

DuBois was born in Zanesville, Ohio, and settled in Waterbury, Connecticut, in 1889. Her published fiction included several short stories plus six novels (DuBois 1890, 1892, 1895a, 1895b, 1900, 1907). A Luiseno drawing by Pablo Tac, a Luiseno who lived at Mission San Luis Rey in the 1820s and 1830s, from Mission San Juan Capistrano: A Pocket History and Tour Guide p. 5. DuBois' most enduring contribution was as a self-taught ethnographer, doing pioneering studies in a period when professional academic anthropology was just becoming established in the United States. Starting in the late 1890s, she made summer trips out west to see her sister who lived in the San Diego area. She began making treks into the San Diego backcountry, to meet the surviving communities of Diegue√±o and Luise√±o Indians. Soon she was writing about their traditional and contemporary lifeways, promoting traditional crafts (particularly basketry), and helping with financial and political assistance. DuBois' longest ethnographic work was a detailed monograph on \\"The Religion of the Luise√±o Indians of Southern California\\" (1908), edited by Alfred L. Kroeber. In addition, she published 23 shorter articles about the region's native peoples, with particular emphases on their mythology, ceremonies, and crafts (Laylander 2004). Her manuscript papers are on file at Cornell University,Guide to the Constance Goddard DuBois Papers, 1897‚Äì1909 and the San Diego Museum of Man has a collection of her photographs.

He was educated at the University of Chicago for his BS degree, at the University of Bristol for his MSc on a Marshall Scholarship, and finally at the Columbia University for MPhil and PhD. He is currently a Reader in Vertebrate Palaeontology at the University of Edinburgh. In addition to his scientific papers and technical monographs, his popular book Dinosaurs (2008) and the textbook Dinosaur Paleobiology (2012) earned him accolades, and he became the resident palaeontologist and scientific consultant for the BBC Earth and 20th Century Fox's 2013 film Walking With Dinosaurs, which is followed by his popular book Walking with Dinosaurs Encyclopedia. His most recent book The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs: A New History of a Lost World (2018), written for the adult lay person, won widespread acclaim, and was a New York Times bestseller. Biography Brusatte was born in Ottawa, Illinois to Jim and Roxanne Brusatte. He was educated at the Ottawa Township High School. From 2002, he attended the University of Chicago from where he earned his BS in geophysical sciences in 2006. He studied under Paul Sereno. He was elected a Student Marshal, the highest academic honor the university bestows to undergraduates. He was also the winner of the John Crerar Foundation Science Writing Prize and the Howard Hughes Institute Undergraduate Research Fellowship. In 2006, he was awarded the Marshall Scholarship to study in the United Kingdom. He entered the University of Bristol and obtained an MSc in both palaeobiology and earth sciences in 2008. His master's thesis was about the origin of a group of dinosaurs and was titled Basal Archosaur Phylogeny and Evolution, on which he was supervised by Michael J. Benton. He returned to the US to join the Columbia University, from where he completed his MPhil in 2011 and PhD in 2013 from the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences. During this period he concurrently worked as a researcher at the Division of Paleontology, American Museum of Natural History. He became a Chancellor's Fellow in Vertebrate Palaentology at the School of GeoSciences in the University of Edinburgh in February 2013. He is a member of the Editorial Board for Current Biology. Contributions He is the author of the 2002 book Stately Fossils: A Comprehensive Look at the State Fossils and Other Official Fossils and the 2008 book Dinosaurs. Brusatte has additionally authored several scientific papers as well as over 100 popular articles for magazines such as Fossil News, Dino Press, Dinosaur World, and Prehistoric Times. At Chicago, he aided in the creation of two databases, TaxonSearch and CharacterSearch, that organize taxonomic and phylogenetic information. Discovery of fossils Brusatte has discovered more than a dozen new species of vertebrate fossils. His breakthrough in the study of dinosaur fossils was while at the University of Chicago with Paul Sereno. Having discovered the skull, jaw and neck fossils of a 95-million-year-old theropod in the Elrhaz Formation of Niger in 1997, Sereno was looking for a competent student to analyse it. Brusatte took the opportunity in 2004, completed the project in 2005, and published his findings in 2007 with Sereno. The animal was found to be a new species of Carcharodontosaurus, which they named C. iguidensis. He estimated that the complete skull would be more than five feet long, one of the biggest skulls of a known carnivorous dinosaur. This was followed by the description of another new theropod from the Elrhaz Formation in January 2008, Kryptops palaios. Another significant discovery was from China in 2014. Alongside Chinese paleontologist L√º Junchang and others, Brusatte described a 66-million-year-old dinosaur, Qianzhousaurus sinensis, which was closely related to the famous T. rex. Due to its long snout, it was given the nickname \\"Pinocchio rex\\". In January 2015 his team announced the discovery of a marine reptile belonging to the Jurassic Period, around 170 million years ago. The giant, long-nosed, fish-like animal, named Dearcmhara shawcrossi, was found on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. He warrants that the species is not ancestral to Nessie, the Scottish legendary marine animal, as popular media liked to hype, but is certainly the first \\"distinctly Scottish prehistoric marine reptile\\". T. rex Autopsy Stephen Brusatte took part in T. Rex Autopsy, a documentary produced by National Geographic Channel and aired on 7 June 2015. Movies On February 2020 it was reported that Brusatte had been hired as a member of the consulting team of paleontologists to work on Jurassic World: Dominion.Bui, Hoai-Tran.

He could locate people buried under the earthquake rubble and not only differentiate whether the person was dead or alive, but could also indicate this to the other members of the rescue crew. If he sensed a dead person, he laid down; when he sensed a live person beneath the rubble, he stood up, wagged his tail and barked.

Empire and Communications is a book published in 1950 by University of Toronto professor Harold Innis. It is based on six lectures Innis delivered at Oxford University in 1948.Watson, John Alexander. (2006) Marginal Man: The Dark Vision of Harold Innis. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.224. The series, known as the Beit Lectures, was dedicated to exploring British imperial history. Innis, however, decided to undertake a sweeping historical survey of how communications media influence the rise and fall of empires. He traced the effects of media such as stone, clay, papyrus, parchment and paper from ancient to modern times.Innis, Harold. (2007) Empire and Communications. Toronto: Dundurn Press, p.23. . It is the fourth and latest edition of Innis's book. The original edition of 1950 published by Oxford University Press was reissued in 1972 by University of Toronto Press, edited by Mary Quayle Innis with an introduction by Marshall McLuhan. An illustrated third edition was published by Press Porcepic in 1986. Innis argued that the \\"bias\\" of each medium toward space or toward time helps to determine the nature of the civilization in which that medium dominates. \\"Media that emphasize time are those that are durable in character such as parchment, clay and stone,\\" he writes in his introduction.Innis (Empire), p.26. These media tend to favour decentralization. \\"Media that emphasize space are apt to be less durable and light in character, such as papyrus and paper.\\" These media generally favour large, centralized administrations. Innis believed that to persist in time and to occupy space, empires needed to strike a balance between time-biased and space-biased media.Innis (Empire), p.27. Such a balance is likely to be threatened, however, when monopolies of knowledge exist favouring some media over others.See, for example, Innis's discussion of the priestly monopoly over writing that undermined the Egyptian empire. Innis (Empire) pp. 44‚Äì45. Empire and Communications examines the impact of media such as stone, clay, papyrus and the alphabet on the empires of Egypt and Babylonia. It also looks at the oral tradition in ancient Greece; the written tradition and the Roman Empire; the influence of parchment and paper in medieval Europe and the effects of paper and the printing press in modern times. Chapter 1. Introduction Harold Innis's highly condensed prose style, which frequently ranges over many centuries and several key ideas in one or two sentences, can make his writing in Empire and Communications difficult to understand. Biographer Paul Heyer recommends that readers use Innis's introduction as a helpful guide.Heyer, Paul. (2003) Harold Innis. Lanham, MD.: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc., p.45. Harold Innis noted that papyrus documents enabled Rome to administer its huge empire. Empire, bias and balance In his introduction, Innis promises to examine the significance of communications in a small number of empires. \\"The effective government of large areas,\\" he writes, \\"depends to a very important extent on the efficiency of communication.\\" He argues for example, that light and easily transported papyrus enabled Rome to govern a large, centralized empire. For Innis, papyrus is associated with the political and administrative control of space. It, therefore, is a space-biased medium. Parchment, dominant after the breakup of the Roman Empire, was a durable medium used for hand copying manuscripts in medieval monasteries. For Innis, parchment favours decentralization and is associated with the religious control of time. It, therefore, is a time-biased medium. Innis argues that in order to last, large-scale political organizations such as empires must balance biases toward time and space. \\"They have tended to flourish under conditions in which civilization reflects the influence of more than one medium and in which the bias of one medium towards decentralization is offset by the bias of another medium towards centralization.\\"Innis (Empire), p.27 Writing, printing, and speech Innis divides the history of the empires and civilizations he will examine into two periods, one for writing and the other for printing. \\"In the writing period we can note the importance of various media such as the clay tablet of Mesopotamia, the papyrus roll in the Egyptian and in the Graeco-Roman world, parchment codex in the late Graeco- Roman world and the early Middle Ages, and paper after its introduction in the Western world from China.\\" Innis notes that he will concentrate on paper as a medium in the printing period along with the introduction of paper-making machinery at the beginning of the 19th century and the use of wood pulp in the manufacture of paper after 1850. He is quick to add, however, that it would be presumptuous to conclude that writing alone determined the course of civilizations. Historians naturally focus on writing because it endures. \\"We are apt to overlook the significance of the spoken word,\\" he writes, \\"and to forget that it has left little tangible remains.\\" For Innis, that tendency poses a problem. \\"It is scarcely possible for generations disciplined in the written and the printed tradition to appreciate the oral tradition.\\"Innis (Empire), p.28. Therefore, the media biases of one civilization make understanding other peoples difficult, if not impossible. \\"A change in the type of medium implies a change in the type of appraisal and hence makes it difficult for one civilization to understand another.\\" As an example, Innis refers to our tendency to impose a modern conception of time on past civilizations. \\"With the dominance of arithmetic and the decimal system, dependent apparently on the number of fingers or toes, modern students have accepted the linear measure of time,\\" he writes. \\"The dangers of applying this procrustean device in the appraisal of civilizations in which it did not exist illustrate one of numerous problems.\\"Innis (Empire), p.29. Innis also contrasts the strikingly different effects of writing and speaking. He argues that \\"writing as compared with speaking involves an impression at the second remove and reading an impression at the third remove. The voice of a second- rate person is more impressive than the published opinion of superior ability.\\"Innis (Empire), p.31. Chapter 2. Egypt: From stone to papyrus Harold Innis traces the evolution of ancient Egyptian dynasties and kingdoms in terms of their use of stone or papyrus as dominant media of communication. His outline of Egyptian civilization is a complex and highly detailed analysis of how these media, along with several other technologies, affected the distribution of power in society. Influence of the Nile A funerary stele from ancient Egypt's Middle Kingdom. Innis believed that hieroglyphics engraved in stone originally perpetuated the divine power of Egyptian kings. Innis begins, as other historians do, with the crucial importance of the Nile as a formative influence on Egyptian civilization. The river provided the water and fertile land needed for agricultural production in a desert region.O'Brien, Patrick K., general editor. (1999) Atlas of World History. New York: Oxford University Press, p.30. Innis writes that the Nile therefore, \\"acted as a principle of order and centralization, necessitated collective work, created solidarity, imposed organizations on the people, and cemented them in a society.\\"Innis (Empire), p.32. This observation is reminiscent of Innis's earlier work on the economic influence of waterways and other geographical features in his book, The Fur Trade in Canada, first published in 1930.Innis, Harold. (1970) The Fur Trade in Canada. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. See for example, Chapter 4, The Struggle for the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay (1663‚Äì1713), pp. 43‚Äì83. However, in Empire and Communications, Innis extends his economic analysis to explore the influence of the Nile on religion, associating the river with the sun god Ra, creator of the universe. In a series of intellectual leaps, Innis asserts that Ra's power was vested in an absolute monarch whose political authority was reinforced by specialized astronomical knowledge. Such knowledge was used to produce the calendar which could predict the Nile's yearly floods. Stone, hieroglyphics and absolute monarchs As the absolute monarchy extended its influence over Egypt, a pictorial hieroglyphic writing system was invented to express the idea of royal immortality.\\"Hieroglyphics was the Greek name for sacred, engraved writing.\\" Innis (Empire), p.34. According to Innis, the idea of the divine right of autocratic monarchs was developed from 2895 BC to 2540 BC. \\"The pyramids,\\" Innis writes, \\"carried with them the art of pictorial representation as an essential element of funerary ritual.\\" The written word on the tomb, he asserts, perpetuated the divine power of kings.Innis (Empire), p.33. Innis suggests that the decline of the absolute monarchy after 2540 BC may have been related to the need for a more accurate calendar based on the solar year. He suggests that priests may have developed such a calendar increasing their power and authority.Innis (Empire), p.34. After 2000 BC, peasants, craftsmen, and scribes obtained religious and political rights. \\"The profound disturbances in Egyptian civilization,\\" Innis writes \\"involved in the shift from absolute monarchy to more democratic organization coincided with a shift in emphasis on stone as a medium of communication or as a basis of prestige, as shown in the pyramids, to an emphasis on papyrus.\\"Innis (Empire), p.35. Papyrus and the power of scribes Innis traces the influence of the newer medium of papyrus on political power in ancient Egypt. The growing use of papyrus led to the replacement of cumbersome hieroglyphic scripts by cursive or hieratic writing. Rapid writing styles made administration more efficient and highly trained scribes became part of a privileged civil service.Innis (Empire), pp. 36‚Äì37. Innis writes. however, that the replacement of one dominant medium by another led to upheaval. > The shift from dependence on stone to dependence on papyrus and the changes > in political and religious institutions imposed an enormous strain on > Egyptian civilization. Egypt quickly succumbed to invasion from peoples > equipped with new instruments of attack. Invaders with the sword and the bow > and long-range weapons broke through Egyptian defence, dependent on the > battle-axe and the dagger. With the use of bronze and possibly iron weapons, > horses and chariots, Syrian Semitic peoples under the Hyksos or Shepherd > kings captured and held Egypt from 1660 to 1580 BC.Innis (Empire), p.39. Hyksos rule lasted about a century until the Egyptians drove them out.O'Brien, p.37. Innis writes that the invaders had adopted hieroglyphic writing and Egyptian customs, \\"but complexity enabled the Egyptians to resist.\\" The Egyptians may have won their victory using horses and light chariots acquired from the Libyans. Empire and the one true god Innis writes that the military organization that expelled the Hyksos enabled the Egyptians to establish and expand an empire that included Syria and Palestine, and that eventually reached the Euphrates. Egyptian administrators used papyrus and a postal service to run the empire, but adopted cuneiform as a more efficient script. The pharaoh Akhnaton tried to introduce Aten, the solar disk as the one true god, a system of worship that would provide a common ideal for the whole empire. But the priests and the people resisted \\"a single cult in which duty to the empire was the chief consideration.\\"Innis (Empire), pp. 40‚Äì41. Priestly power, Innis writes, resulted from religious control over the complex and difficult art of writing. The monarch's attempts to maintain an empire extended in space were defeated by a priestly monopoly over knowledge systems concerned with time --- systems that began with the need for accurate predictions about when the Nile would overflow its banks.Innis (Empire), p.44. Innis argues that priestly theocracy gradually cost Egypt its empire. \\"Monopoly over writing supported an emphasis on religion and the time concept, which defeated efforts to solve the problem of space.\\"Innis (Empire), p.45. Chapter 3. Babylonia: The origins of writing In this chapter, Innis outlines the history of the world's first civilizations in Mesopotamia. He starts with the fertile plains between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, but as the history unfolds, his discussion extends to large parts of the modern Middle East. Biographer Paul Heyer's warning that Innis's work can be challenging applies to te 3000 history. Innis's condensed, elliptical prose demands careful reading as he traces the origins of writing from clay tablet and cuneiform script to the efficient Phoenician alphabet written on parchment and papyrus.Heyer, pp. 34, 48. Along the way, Innis comments on many aspects of the ancient Middle Eastern empires, including power struggles between priests and kings, the evolution of military technologies and the development of the Hebrew Bible. History begins at Sumer Innis begins by observing that unlike in Egypt where calculating the timing of the Nile's flooding was a source of power, the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in southern Mesopotamia were used for irrigation. Therefore the ability to measure time precisely was somewhat less critical. Nevertheless, as in Egypt, the small city-states of Sumer depended on the rivers and so, the cycles of agricultural production were organized around them.Innis (Empire), p.46. The rivers also provided communications materials. In Egypt, the Nile's papyrus became a medium for writing while in Mesopotamia, the rivers yielded the alluvial sediments the Sumerians used to fashion the clay tablets on which they inscribed their wedge-shaped, cuneiform script.Heyer, p.48. Their earliest writing recorded agricultural accounts and economic transactions.Innis, (Empire), p.46. Innis points out that the tablets were not well suited to pictographic writing because making straight lines \\"tended to pull up the clay.\\" Therefore, Sumerian scribes used a cylindrical reed stylus to stamp or press wedges and lines on the moist tablet. Scribes gradually developed cuneiform signs to represent syllables and the sounds of the spoken language.Innis (Empire), p. 47‚Äì48. Innis writes that as a heavy material, clay was not very portable and so was not generally suited for communication over large areas. Cuneiform inscription required years of training overseen by priests. Innis contends therefore, that as a writing medium, clay tended to favour decentralization and religious control.Innis (Empire), pp. 48‚Äì49. From city-states to empires Innis suggests that religious control in Sumer became a victim of its own successes. \\"The accumulation of wealth and power in the hands of priests and the temple organizations,\\" he writes, \\"was probably followed by ruthless warfare between city-states.\\"Innis (Empire), p.49. The time-bound priests, unskilled in technological change and the military arts, lost power to spatially oriented kings intent on territorial expansion. Around 2350 BC, the Sumerians were conquered by their northern, Semitic neighbours the Akkadians. Under Sargon the Great, the empire expanded to include extensive territories reaching northwest as far as Turkey and west to the Mediterranean.Innis (Empire), p.50 and O'Brien, p.28. Thus begins the rise and fall of a series of empires over approximately two thousand years. Innis mentions many of them, but focuses more attention on innovations that facilitated their growth. These include the advancement of civil law under Hammurabi, the development of mathematics including fixed standards of weights and measures, as well as the breeding of horses that combined speed with strength and that, along with three-man chariots, helped deliver spectacular military victories to the Assyrians.Innis (Empire), pp. 51‚Äì60. Alphabet, empire and trade The Phoenician alphabet. The Phoenicians were sailors and traders who travelled widely taking their versatile alphabet with them. In discussing the advent and spread of the alphabet, Innis refers to what he sees as the subversive relationship between those at the centre of civilizations and those on their fringes or margins. He argues that monopolies of knowledge develop at the centre only to be challenged and eventually overthrown by new ideas or techniques that take shape on the margins.Innis (Empire), p.62. Thus, the Phoenician alphabet, a radically simplified writing system, undermined the elaborate hieroglyphic and cuneiform scripts overseen by priestly elites in Egypt and Babylonia. \\"The Phoenicians had no monopoly of knowledge,\\" Innis writes, \\"[which] might hamper the development of writing.\\"Innis (Empire), p.64. As a trading people, the Phoenicians needed \\"a swift and concise method of recording transactions.\\" The alphabet with its limited number of visual symbols to represent the primary elements of human speech was well suited to trade. \\"Commerce and the alphabet were inextricably interwoven, particularly when letters of the alphabet were used as numerals.\\"Innis (Empire), pp. 64‚Äì65. The alphabet, combined with the use of parchment and papyrus, Innis argues, had a decentralizing effect favouring cities and smaller nations over centralized empires.Innis (Empire), p.65. He suggests that improved communication, made possible by the alphabet, enabled the Assyrians and the Persians to administer large empires in which trading cities helped offset concentrations of power in political and religious organizations.Innis (Empire), p.76. Alphabet, the Hebrews and religion Innis sketches the influence of the alphabet on the Hebrews in the marginal territory of Palestine. The Hebrews combined oral and written traditions in their scriptures.See also, Innis, Harold. (1951) The Bias of Communication. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. p.6. Innis provides a concise, one-paragraph summary of the alphabet's impact on the Hebrew religion in this later work. Innis points out that they had previously acquired key ideas from the Egyptians. \\"The influence of Egypt on the Hebrews,\\" he writes, \\"was suggested in the emphasis on the sacred character of writing and on the power of the word which when uttered brought about creation itself. The word is the word of wisdom. Word, wisdom, and God were almost identical theological concepts.\\" The Hebrews distrusted images. For them, words were the true source of wisdom. \\"The written letter replaced the graven image as an object of worship.\\"Innis (Empire), p.66. In a typically complex passage, Innis writes: > \\"Denunciation of images and concentration on the abstract in writing opened > the way for advance from blood relationship to universal ethical standards > and strengthened the position of the prophets in their opposition to > absolute monarchical power. The abhorrence of idolatry of graven images > implied a sacred power in writing, observance of the law, and worship of the > one true God.\\" The alphabet enabled the Hebrews to record their rich oral tradition in poetry and prose. \\"Hebrew has been described as the only Semitic language before Arabic to produce an important literature characterized by simplicity, vigour and lyric force. With other Semitic languages it was admirably adapted to the vivid, vigorous description of concrete objects and events.\\"Innis (Empire), p.67. Innis traces the influence of various strands in scriptural writing suggesting that the combination of these sources strengthened the movement toward monotheism. In a summary passage, Innis explores the wide-ranging influence of the alphabet in ancient times. He argues that it enabled the Assyrians and Persians to expand their empires, allowed for the growth of trade under the Arameans and Phoenicians and invigorated religion in Palestine. As such, the alphabet provided a balance. \\"An alphabet became the basis of political organization through efficient control of territorial space and of religious organization through efficient control over time in the establishment of monotheism.\\"Innis (Empire), p.77. Chapter 4. Greece and the oral tradition \\"Greek civilization,\\" Innis writes, \\"was a reflection of the power of the spoken word.\\"Innis (Empire), p.78. In this chapter, he explores how the vitality of the spoken word helped the ancient Greeks create a civilization that profoundly influenced all of Europe. Greek civilization differed in significant ways from the empires of Egypt and Babylonia. Innis biographer John Watson notes that those preceding empires \\"had revolved around an uneasy alliance of absolute monarchs and scholarly theocrats.\\"Watson, p.368. The monarchs ruled by force while an elite priestly class controlled religious dogma through their monopolies of knowledge over complex writing systems. \\"The monarch was typically a war leader whose grasp of the concept of space allowed him to expand his territory,\\" Watson writes, \\"incorporating even the most highly articulated theocracies. The priests specialized in elaborating conceptions of time and continuity.\\" Innis argues that the Greeks struck a different balance, one based on \\"the freshness and elasticity of an oral tradition\\" that left its stamp on Western poetry, drama, sculpture, architecture, philosophy, science and mathematics.Innis (Empire), p.89. Socrates, Plato and the spoken word Detail of the painting The Death of Socrates by Jacques-Louis David. Innis begins by examining Greek civilization at its height in the 5th century BC. He points out that the philosopher Socrates (c. 470 BC‚Äì399 BC) \\"was the last great product and exponent of the oral tradition.\\"p.79. Socrates taught using a question and answer technique that produced discussion and debate. His student, Plato (428/427 BC ‚Äì 348/347 BC), elaborated on these Socratic conversations by writing dialogues in which Socrates was the central character. This dramatic device engaged readers in the debate while allowing Plato to search for truth using a dialectical method or one based on discussion.The Oxford English Dictionary (second edition 1989, v.4, p.599) defines dialectic in this sense as, \\"The art of critical examination into the truth of an opinion; the investigation of truth by discussion...Originally, the art of reasoning or disputation by question and answer, 'invented', according to Aristotle, by Zeno of Elea, and scientifically developed by Plato.\\" \\"The dialogues were developed,\\" Innis writes \\"as a most effective instrument for preserving [the] power of the spoken word on the written page.\\"Innis (Empire), p.79. He adds that Plato's pupil, Aristotle (384 BC ‚Äì 322 BC), regarded the Platonic dialogues as \\"half- way between poetry and prose.\\" Innis argues that Plato's use of the flexible oral tradition in his writing enabled him to escape the confines of a rigid philosophical system. \\"Continuous philosophical discussion aimed at truth. The life and movement of dialectic opposed the establishment of a finished system of dogma.\\" This balance between speech and prose also contributed to the immortality of Plato's work. Innis writes that the power of the oral tradition reached its height in the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides when \\"drama became the expression of Athenian democracy.\\"Innis (Empire), pp. 100‚Äì101. He argues that tragedy attracted the interest and participation of everyone. \\"To know oneself was to know man's powerlessness and to know the indestructible and conquering majesty of suffering humanity.\\"Innis (Empire), p.101. For Innis, the fall of Athens to Sparta in 404 BC and the trial and execution of Socrates for corrupting Athenian youth were symptoms of the collapse of the older oral culture. That culture had sustained a long poetic tradition, but Plato attacked poetry as a teaching device and expelled poets from his ideal republic. According to Innis, Plato and Aristotle developed prose in defence of a new culture in which gods and poets were subordinated to philosophical and scientific inquiry.Innis (Empire), pp. 79‚Äì80. Innis argues that eventually, the spread of writing widened the gap between the city-states hastening the collapse of Greek civilization.Innis (Empire), p.104. The Greek alphabet Innis notes that the early Mycenaean Greeks of the Bronze Age developed their own styles of communication because they escaped the cultural influence of the Minoans they had conquered on the island of Crete. \\"The complexity of the script of Minoan civilization and its relative restriction to Crete left the Greeks free to develop their own traditions.\\"Innis (Empire), p.80. Innis adds that the growth of a strong oral tradition reflected in Greek epic poetry also fostered resistance to the dominance of other cultures. This led the Greeks to take over and modify the Phoenician alphabet possibly around the beginning of the 7th century BC.Innis (Empire), p.81. In a marginal note, Innis indicates that the Phoenician alphabet had been influenced by Canaanite script. See Innis (Empire), p.237. The Greeks adapted this 24-letter, Semitic alphabet which consisted only of consonants to their rich oral tradition by using some of its letters to represent vowel sounds. Innis writes that the vowels in each written word \\"permitted the expression of fine distinctions and light shades of meaning.\\"Innis (Empire), p.81. The classics professor, Eric Havelock, whose work influenced Innis, makes a similar point when he argues that this alphabet enabled the Greeks to record their oral literary tradition with a \\"wealth of detail and depth of psychological feeling\\" absent in other Near Eastern civilizations with more limited writing systems.Havelock, Eric. (1986) The Muse Learns to Write: Reflections on Orality and Literacy from Antiquity to the Present. New Haven: Yale University Press, pp. 8‚Äì9. Innis himself quotes scholar Richard Jebb's claim that the Greek language \\"'responds with happy elasticity to every demand of the Greek intellect...the earliest work of art created by the spontaneous working of the Greek mind.'\\"Innis (Empire), p.81 and endnote p.204: \\"Sir Richard Jebb, Essays and Addresses (Cambridge, 1907), 573.\\" Poetry, politics and the oral tradition \\"The power of the oral tradition,\\" Innis writes, \\"implied the creation of a structure suited to its needs.\\" That structure consisted of the metres and stock phrases of epic poetry which included the Homeric poems, the Iliad and Odyssey. The epics were sung by professional minstrels who pleased audiences by reshaping the poems to meet the needs of new generations. Innis points out that music was central to the oral tradition and the lyre accompanied the performance of the epic poems.Innis (Empire), p.84. He argues that the Homeric poems reflected two significant developments. The first was the rise of an aristocratic civilization which valued justice and right action over the traditional ties of kinship. The second was the humanization of the Greek gods whose limited powers encouraged belief in rational explanations for the order of things.Innis (Cmpire), pp. 83‚Äì85. \\"Decline of belief in the supernatural led to the explanation of nature in terms of natural causes,\\" Innis writes. \\"With the independent search for truth, science was separated from myth.\\"Innis (Empire), p.85. Head of the poet Sappho. Gradually, the flexible oral tradition gave rise to other kinds of poetry. Innis notes that these new kinds of literature \\"reflected the efficiency of the oral tradition in expressing the needs of social change.\\" Hesiod wrote about agricultural themes, becoming the first spokesman for common people.Bury, J.B. (undated) A History of Greece. New York: The Modern Library, Random House, Inc. p.100. Innis writes that his poems were produced \\"by an individual who made no attempt to conceal his personality.\\" In the 7th century BC, Archilochos took poetry a step further when he contributed to breaking down the heroic code of epic poetry. Innis suggests he responded to a rising public opinion while historian J.B. Bury describes him as venting his feelings freely and denouncing his enemies.Bury, p. 112. Innis argues that these changes in poetic style and form coincided with the replacement of Greek kingdoms by republics in the 8th and 7th centuries BC. Finally, he mentions the development of shorter, lyric poetry that could be intensely personal as shown in the work of Sappho. This profusion of short personal lyrics likely coincided with the spread of writing and the increasing use of papyrus from Egypt. Greek science and philosophy Innis credits the oral tradition with fostering the rise of Greek science and philosophy. He argues that when combined with the simplicity of the alphabet, the oral tradition prevented the development of a highly specialized class of scribes and a priestly monopoly over education. Moreover, unlike the Hebrews, the Greeks did not develop written religious texts. \\"The Greeks had no Bible with a sacred literature attempting to give reasons and coherence to the scheme of things, making dogmatic assertions and strangling science in infancy.\\"Innis (Empire), p.88. Innis contends that the flexibility of the oral tradition encouraged the introduction of a new medium, mathematics. Thales of Miletus may have discovered trigonometry. He also studied geometry and astronomy, using mathematics as \\"a means of discarding allegory and myth and advancing universal generalizations.\\"Innis (Empire), pp. 86‚Äì87. Thus, mathematics gave rise to philosophical speculation. The map maker, Anaximander also sought universal truths becoming \\"the first to write down his thoughts in prose and to publish them, thus definitely addressing the public and giving up the privacy of his thought.\\"Innis (Empire), p.87. According to Innis, this use of prose \\"reflected a revolutionary break, an appeal to rational authority and the influence of the logic of writing.\\" Chapter 5. Rome and the written tradition In this chapter, Harold Innis focuses on the gradual displacement of oral communication by written media during the long history of the Roman Empire. The spread of writing hastened the downfall of the Roman Republic, he argues, facilitating the emergence of a Roman Empire stretching from Britain to Mesopotamia.Innis (Empire), pp. 122 & 125. To administer such a vast empire, the Romans were forced to establish centralized bureaucracies.Innis (Empire), p.122. These bureaucracies depended on supplies of cheap papyrus from the Nile Delta for the long-distance transmission of written rules, orders and procedures.Innis (Empire), pp. 125 & 129. The bureaucratic Roman state backed by the influence of writing, in turn, fostered absolutism, the form of government in which power is vested in a single ruler.Innis (Empire), p.125. Innis adds that Roman bureaucracy destroyed the balance between oral and written law giving rise to fixed, written decrees. The torture of Roman citizens and the imposition of capital punishment for relatively minor crimes became common as living law \\"was replaced by the dead letter.\\"Innis (Rmpire), pp. 126‚Äì127. Finally, Innis discusses the rise of Christianity, a religion which spread through the use of scripture inscribed on parchment.Innis (Empire), pp. 130‚Äì131. He writes that the Byzantine Empire in the east eventually flourished because of a balance in media biases. Papyrus enabled the governing of a large spatial empire, while parchment contributed to the development of a religious hierarchy concerned with time.Innis (Empire), p.137. Rome and Greece The initials SPQR stood for SenƒÅtus Populusque R≈çmƒÅnus (\\"The Senate and the People of Rome\\"). They were emblazoned on the banners of Roman legions. \\"The achievements of a rich oral tradition in Greek civilization,\\" Innis writes, \\"became the basis of Western culture.\\"Innis (Empire), p.106. He asserts that Greek culture had the power \\"to awaken the special forces of each people by whom it was adopted\\" and the Romans were no exception. According to Innis, it appears Greek colonies in Sicily and Italy along with Greek traders introduced the Greek alphabet to Rome in the 7th century BC. The alphabet was developed into a Graeco-Etruscan script when Rome was governed by an Etruscan king. The Etruscans also introduced Greek gods in the 6th century BC apparently to reinforce their own rule. Rome became isolated from Greece in the 5th and 4th centuries BC and overthrew the monarchy. A patrician aristocracy took control, but after prolonged class warfare, gradually shared power with the plebeians.Innis (Empire), pp. 107‚Äì108. Innis suggests that Roman law flourished at this time because of its oral tradition. A priestly class, \\"equipped with trained memories,\\" made and administered the laws, their power strengthened because there was no body of written law.Innis (Empire), p.107. Although plebeian pressure eventually resulted in the adoption of the Twelve Tables‚Äîa written constitution‚Äîinterpretation remained in the hands of priests in the College of Pontiffs. One of Roman law's greatest achievements, Innis writes, lay in the development of civil laws governing families, property and contracts. Paternal rights were limited, women became independent and individual initiative was given the greatest possible scope.Innis (Empire), pp. 110‚Äì111. Innis seems to suggest that political stability coupled with strong oral traditions in law and religion contributed to the unity of the Roman Republic.Innis (Empire), p.110. \\"The relations of the state to religious institutions and of political philosophy to philosophy, which had scarcely been problems in the unity of the Greek polis, were vital to the Romans.\\" He warns however, that the growing influence of written laws, treaties and decrees in contrast to the oral tradition of civil law \\"boded ill for the history of the republic and the empire.\\"Innis (Empire), p.111. Innis quickly sketches the Roman conquest of Italy and its three wars with the North African city of Carthage. The Punic Wars ended with the destruction of Carthage in 146 BC. At the same time, Rome pursued military expansion in the eastern Mediterranean eventually conquering Macedonia and Greece as well as extending Roman rule to Pergamum in modern-day Turkey. Rome and the problems of Greek empire Innis interrupts his account of Roman military expansion to discuss earlier problems that had arisen from the Greek conquests undertaken by Philip of Macedon and his son, Alexander the Great. Philip and Alexander had established a Macedonian Empire which controlled the Persian Empire as well as territory as far east as India. Innis suggests Rome would inherit the problems that faced Philip and Alexander including strong separatist tendencies. After Alexander's death, four separate Hellenistic dynasties arose. The Seleucids controlled the former Persian Empire; the Ptolemies ruled in Egypt; the Attalids in Pergamum and the Antigonids in Macedonia.Innis (Empire), pp. 111‚Äì112. Seleucid dynasty The Seleucid rulers attempted to dominate Persian, Babylonian and Hebrew religions but failed to establish the concept of the Greek city-state. Their kingdom eventually collapsed. Innis concludes that monarchies that lack the binding powers of nationality and religion and that depend on force were inherently insecure, unable to resolve dynastic problems.Innis (Empire), p.112. Innis's sentence reads: \\"Monarchies without the cement of nationality and religion and depending on force and solution of dynastic problems were insecure.\\" Ptolemaic dynasty Innis discusses various aspects of Ptolemaic rule over Egypt including the founding of the ancient library and university at Alexandria made possible by access to abundant supplies of papyrus. \\"By 285 BC the library established by Ptolemy I had 20,000 manuscripts,\\" Innis writes, \\"and by the middle of the first century 700,000, while a smaller library established by Ptolemy II...possibly for duplicates had 42,800.\\"Innis (Empire), pp. 112‚Äì113. He points out that the power of the written tradition in library and university gave rise to specialists, not poets and scholars ‚Äî drudges who corrected proofs and those who indulged in the mania of book collecting. \\"Literature was divorced from life, thought from action, poetry from philosophy.\\"Innis (Empire), p.113. Innis quotes the epic poet Apollonius's claim that \\"a great book was a great evil.\\" Cheap papyrus also facilitated the rise of an extensive administrative system eventually rife with nepotism and other forms of bureaucratic corruption. \\"An Egyptian theocratic state,\\" Innis notes, \\"compelled its conquerors to establish similar institutions designed to reduce its power.\\"Innis (Empire), pp. 114‚Äì115. Attalid dynasty Innis contrasts the scholarly pursuits of the Attalid dynasty at Pergamum with what he sees as the dilettantism of Alexandria. He writes that Eumenes II who ruled from 197 to 159 BC established a library, but was forced to rely on parchment because Egypt had prohibited the export of papyrus to Pergamum. Innis suggests that the Attalids probably preserved the masterpieces of ancient Greek prose. He notes that Pergamum had shielded a number of cities from attacks by the Gauls. \\"Its art reflected the influence of the meeting of civilization and barbarism, a conflict of good and evil, in the attempt at unfamiliar ways of expression.\\"Innis (Empire), p.115. Antigonid dynasty Innis writes that the Antigonids \\"gradually transformed the small city-states of Greece into municipalities.\\" They captured Athens in 261 BC and Sparta in 222 BC. The Greek cities of this period developed common interests. \\"With supplies of papyrus and parchment and the employment of educated slaves,\\" Innis writes, \\"books were produced on an unprecedented scale. Hellenistic capitals provided a large reading public.\\"Innis (Empire), p.116. Most of the books, however, were \\"third-hand compendia of snippets and textbooks, short cuts to knowledge, quantities of tragedies, and an active comedy of manners in Athens. Literary men wrote books about other books and became bibliophiles.\\" Innis reports that by the 2nd century \\"everything had been swamped by the growth of rhetoric.\\" He argues that once classical Greek philosophy \\"became crystallized in writing,\\" it was superseded by an emphasis on philosophical teaching. He mentions Stoicism, the Cynics and Epicurean teachings all of which emphasized the priority of reason over popular religion. \\"The Olympian religion and the city-state were replaced by philosophy and science for the educated and by Eastern religions for the common man.\\"Innis (Empire), p.117. As communication between these two groups became increasingly difficult, cultural division stimulated the rise of a class structure. Innis concludes that the increasing emphasis on writing also created divisions among Athens, Alexandria and Pergamum weakening science and philosophy and opening \\"the way to religions from the East and force from Rome in the West.\\"Innis (Empire)p.117. Greek influence and Roman prose Innis returns to his account of Roman history by noting that Rome's military successes in the eastern Mediterranean brought it under the direct influence of Greek culture. He quotes the Roman poet Horace: \\"Captive Greece took captive her proud conqueror.\\" Innis gives various examples of Greek influence in Rome. They include the introduction of Greek tragedies and comedies at Roman festivals to satisfy the demands of soldiers who had served in Greek settlements as well as the translation of the Odyssey into Latin.Innis (Empire), p.117‚Äì118. Innis mentions there was strong opposition to this spread of Greek culture. He reports for example, that Cato the Elder deplored what he saw as the corrupting effects of Greek literature. Cato responded by laying the foundations for a dignified and versatile Latin prose.Innis (Empire), p.118. In the meantime, the Roman Senate empowered officials to expel those who taught rhetoric and philosophy and in 154 BC, two disciples of Epicurus were banished from Rome. Nevertheless, Innis points out that Greek influence continued as \\"Greek teachers and grammarians enhanced the popularity of Hellenistic ideals in literature.\\" Meantime, Innis asserts, Roman prose \\"gained fresh power in attempts to meet problems of the Republic.\\" He is apparently referring to the vast enrichment of the Roman aristocracy and upper middle class as wealth poured in from newly conquered provinces. \\"The plunder from the provinces provided the funds for that orgy of corrupt and selfish wealth which was to consume the Republic in revolution,\\" writes Will Durant in his series of volumes called The Story of Civilization.Durant, Will. (1944) Caesar and Christ: A History of Roman Civilization and of Christianity from their beginnings to AD 325. New York: Simon and Schuster, p.88. Innis mentions that the large-scale farms owned by aristocrats brought protests presumably from small farmers forced off the land and into the cities as part of a growing urban proletariat.Innis (Empire), p.118. For more detail on agrarian grievances, see Durant, p.111. The Gracchi brothers were among the first, Innis writes, \\"to use the weapon of Greek rhetoric\\" in their failed attempts to secure democratic reforms. Gaius Gracchus made Latin prose more vivid and powerful. Innis adds that political speeches such as his \\"were given wider publicity through an enlarged circle of readers.\\" As political oratory shaped Latin prose style, written speech almost equaled the power of oral speech.Innis (Empire), pp. 118‚Äì119. Writing, empire and religion Rome's dominance of Egypt, Innis writes, gave it access to papyrus which supported a chain of interrelated developments that would eventually lead to the decline and fall of Rome. Papyrus facilitated the spread of writing which in turn, permitted the growth of bureaucratic administration needed to govern territories that would eventually stretch from Britain to Mesopotamia.Innis (Empire), pp. 120, 122, 125. \\"The spread of writing contributed to the downfall of the Republic and the emergence of the empire,\\" Innis writes. Roman Colosseum, symbol of permanence. Centralized administrative bureaucracy helped create the conditions for the emergence of absolute rulers such as the Caesars which, in turn, led to emperor worship.Innis (Empire), pp. 122‚Äì124. According to Innis, the increased power of writing touched every aspect of Roman culture including law which became rigidly codified and increasingly reliant on such harsh measures as torture and capital punishment even for relatively trivial crimes.Innis (Empire), pp. 126‚Äì127. \\"The written tradition dependent on papyrus and the roll supported an emphasis on centralized bureaucratic administration,\\" Innis writes. \\"Rome became dependent on the army, territorial expansion, and law at the expense of trade and an international economy.\\"Innis (Empire), p.129. Innis notes that Rome attempted to increase its imperial prestige by founding libraries.Innis (Empire), p.127. And, with the discovery of cement about 180 BC, the Romans constructed magnificent buildings featuring arch, vault and dome. \\"Vaulted architecture became an expression of equilibrium, stability, and permanence, monuments which persisted through centuries of neglect.\\"Innis (Empire), p.130. Innis argues that the gradual rise of Christianity from its origins as a Jewish sect among lower social strata on the margins of empire was propelled by the development of the parchment codex, a much more convenient medium than cumbersome papyrus rolls. \\"The oral tradition of Christianity was crystallized in books which became sacred,\\" Innis writes.Innis (Empire), p.132. He adds that after breaking away from Judaism, Christianity was forced to reach out to other religions, its position strengthened further by scholars who attempted to synthesize Jewish religion and Greek philosophy in the organization of the Church. Constantine ended official persecution of Christianity and moved the imperial capital to Constantinople eventually creating a religious split between the declining Western Roman Empire and believers in the East. \\"As the power of empire was weakened in the West that of the Church of Rome increased and difficulties with heresies in the East became more acute.\\"Innis (Empire), p.135. Innis contends the Eastern or Byzantine Empire survived after the fall of Rome because it struck a balance between time and space-biased media. \\"The Byzantine empire developed on the basis of a compromise between organization reflecting the bias of different media: that of papyrus in the development of an imperial bureaucracy in relation to a vast area and that of parchment in the development of an ecclesiastical hierarchy in relation to time.\\" Chapter 6. Middle Ages: Parchment and paper In Chapter 6, Innis tries to show how the medium of parchment supported the power of churches, clergy and monasteries in medieval Europe after the breakdown of the Roman empire. Rome's centralized administration had depended on papyrus, a fragile medium produced in the Nile Delta. Innis notes that parchment, on the other hand, is a durable medium that can be produced wherever farm animals are raised. He argues, therefore, that parchment is suited to the decentralized administration of a wide network of local religious institutions.Innis (Empire), p.138. However, the arrival of paper via China and the Arab world, challenged the power of religion and its preoccupation with time. \\"A monopoly of knowledge based on parchment,\\" Innis writes, \\"invited competition from a new medium such as paper which emphasized the significance of space as reflected in the growth of nationalist monarchies.\\"Innis (Empire), p.159. He notes that paper also facilitated the growth of commerce and trade in the 13th century.Innis (Empire), pp. 150‚Äì151 & 160. Monasteries and books Innis writes that monasticism originated in Egypt and spread rapidly partly in protest against Caesaropapism or the worldly domination of the early Christian church by emperors.Innis (Empire), p.139. He credits St. Benedict with adapting monasticism to the needs of the Western church. The Rule of St. Benedict required monks to engage in spiritual reading. Copying books and storing them in monastery libraries soon became sacred duties.Innis (Empire), p.140. Innis notes that copying texts on parchment required strength and effort: > Working six hours a day the scribe produced from two to four pages and > required from ten months to a year and a quarter to copy a Bible. The size > of the scriptures absorbed the energies of monasteries. Libraries were > slowly built up and uniform rules in the care of books were generally > adopted in the 13th century. Demands for space led to the standing of books > upright on the shelves in the 14th and 15th centuries and to the rush of > library construction in the 15th century.Innis (Empire), pp. 160‚Äì161. Innis points out that Western monasteries preserved and transmitted the classics of the ancient world. Islam, images, and Christianity Innis writes that Islam (which he sometimes refers to as Mohammedanism) gathered strength by emphasizing the sacredness of the written word. He notes that the Caliph Iezid II ordered the destruction of pictures in Christian churches within the Umayyad Empire.Innis (Empire), p.142. The banning of icons within churches was also sanctioned by Byzantine Emperor Leo III in 730 while Emperor Constantine V issued a decree in 753‚Äì754 condemning image worship. Innis writes that this proscription of images was designed to strengthen the empire partly by curbing the power of monks, who relied on images to sanction their authority. Monasteries, he notes, had amassed large properties through their exemption from taxation and competed with the state for labour. Byzantine emperors reacted by secularizing large monastic properties, restricting the number of monks, and causing persecution, which drove large numbers of them to Italy. The Western church, on the other hand, saw images as useful especially for reaching the illiterate. Innis adds that by 731, iconoclasts were excluded from the Church and Charles Martel's defeat of the Arabs in 732 ended Muslim expansion in western Europe. The Synod of Gentilly (767), the Lateran Council (769), and the Second Council of Nicea (787), sanctioned the use of images although Charlemagne prohibited image veneration or worship.Innis (Empire), pp. 142‚Äì143. Chapter 7. Mass media, from print to radio In his final chapter, Harold Innis traces the rise of mass media beginning with the printing press in 15th century Europe and ending with mass circulation newspapers, magazines, books, movies and radio in the 19th and 20th centuries. He argues that such media gradually undermined the authority of religion and enabled the rise of science, facilitating Reformation, Renaissance and Revolution, political, industrial and commercial. For Innis, space-biased and mechanized mass media helped create modern empires, European and American, bent on territorial expansion and obsessed with present-mindedness. \\"Mass production and standardization are the enemies of the West,\\" he warned. \\"The limitations of mechanization of the printed and the spoken word must be emphasized and determined efforts to recapture the vitality of the oral tradition must be made.\\"Innis (Empire), p.195 Bibles and the print revolution Innis notes that the expense of producing hand-copied, manuscript Bibles on parchment invited lower-cost competition, especially in countries where the copyists' guild did not hold a strong monopoly. \\"In 1470 it was estimated in Paris that a printed Bible cost about one-fifth that of a manuscript Bible,\\" Innis writes. He adds that the sheer size of the scriptures hastened the introduction of printing and that the flexibility of setting the limited number of alphabetic letters in type permitted small-scale, privately- owned printing enterprises.Innis (Empire), p.164 \\"By the end of the fifteenth century presses had been established in the larger centres of Europe,\\" Innis writes. This led to a growing book trade as commercially minded printers reproduced various kinds of books including religious ones for the Church, medical and legal texts and translations from Latin and Greek. The Greek New Testament that Erasmus produced in 1516 became the basis for Martin Luther's German translation (1522) and William Tyndale's English version (1526). The rise in the numbers of Bibles and other books printed in native or vernacular languages contributed to the growth in the size or printing establishments and further undermined the influence of hand-copied, religious manuscripts. The printed word gained authority over the written one. Innis quotes historian W.E.H. Lecky: \\"The age of cathedrals had passed. The age of the printing press had begun.\\"Innis (Empire), pp. 166‚Äì167 Innis notes that Luther \\"took full advantage of an established book trade and large numbers of the New and later the Old Testament were widely distributed at low prices.\\" Luther's attacks on the Catholic Church including his protests against the sale of indulgences, Canon law and the authority of the priesthood were widely distributed as pamphlets along with Luther's emphasis on St. Paul's doctrine of salvation through faith alone.Innis (Empire), p.167  Recent critical opinion  See also * Harold Innis's communications theories * Monopolies of knowledge * Time- and space-bias Notes References * Bury, J.B.

Biography After the study of zoology, botany, chemistry and anthropology, his main focus was research of the great bustard. He recorded his observations in the breeding grounds and his experience with hand bred great bustards in several publications. Moreover, he was chief assistant at the Berlin Zoo. In 1966, he became director of the Duisburg Zoo and landed in the headlines in May 1966 when the white whale Moby Dick strayed into the Rhine. After futile attempts to capture Moby Dick, Wolfgang Gewalt came in for ever more negative criticism. A few newspapers even demanded: \\"Arrest Wolfgang Gewalt\\". In June 1966, the whale fortunately succeeded in swimming back to the North Sea. In 1969, Gewalt led an expedition to Canada and brought back the first beluga to Duisburg. For this he reaped angry criticism. In the same year Wolfgang Gewalt participated in the Encyclopedia Grzimeks Tierleben for which he wrote a contribution on Didelphidae. In 1972, he and his colleagues founded the European Association for Aquatic Mammals at the Dolfinarium Harderwijk in the Netherlands. This is a society for the care of aquatic mammals in human custody. In 1975, he brought five Orinoco river dolphins or toninas back to Duisburg from an expedition to Venezuela. In 1978 one of Wolfgang Gewalt's dreams was fulfilled with the birth of the first bottlenose dolphin in a German Zoo. In 1993, Wolfgang Gewalt retired. On April 26, 2007 he died from the consequences of an accident in his home.

Etymology The word \\"Fanous\\" (Fanos, Phanous and Fanoos in Egyptian dialects) is a term of Greek origin transliterated to \\"candle\\". It means 'light' or 'lantern'. It was historically used in its meaning of \\"the light of the world,\\" and is a symbol of hope, as in \\"light in the darkness\\". History Old Fanous Ramadan from Egypt The traditional use of fanous as decorations associated with Ramadan is believed to have originated during the Fatimid Caliphate, primarily centered in Egypt, where tradition holds that the Caliph Al-Muizz Lideenillah was greeted by the Egyptian people holding lanterns to celebrate his arrival at Cairo during the holy month of Ramadan. Its use has now spread to almost all Muslim countries. Fanous Fanous In Ancient times it was similar to a lamp, and would have incorporated either candles or oil. The fanous originally developed from the torches used in the Pharaonic festivals celebrating the rising of the star Sirius. For five days, the Ancient Egyptians celebrated the birthdays of Osiris, Horus, Isis, Seth and Nephtys‚Äîone on each day‚Äîby lighting the streets with the fanous (torches). Torches or candles were also used in early Christianity. This is recorded by Egyptian historian Al-Maqrizi (1364 - 1442), who noted in his book, \\"Al Mawaiz wa al-'i'tibar bi dhikr al-khitat wa al-'athar\\", that these torches or candles were used at Christmastime for celebration. Today Fanous is widely used all over the world ‚Äì especially in Asian regions and the Arab world ‚Äì not just for a specific religion purposes, but for names of people or decorative purposes. They can be found in houses, restaurants, hotels, malls, etc. Often arranged as a grouping of lights arranged in different designs and shapes. Metal and glass are mostly used for their construction.

The theatre is often referred to as simply \\"The Manoel\\", and is named after Grand Master of the Order of the Knights Hospitaller, Fra Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena, who ordered its construction in 1731. The theatre is reputed to be Europe's third-oldest working theatre (older than the San Carlo in Naples), and the oldest theatre still in operation in the Commonwealth of Nations. The theatre is located on Old Theatre Street (Maltese: Triq it-Teatru l-Antik) in Valletta. It considers itself as the country's national theatre and the home of Malta Philharmonic Orchestra (Maltese: Orkestra Filarmonika Nazzjonali). Originally called the Teatro Pubblico, its name was changed to Teatro Reale, or Theatre Royal, in 1812, and renamed Manoel Theatre in 1866. The first play to be performed was Maffei's Merope. The theatre is a small, 623 seat venue, with an oval-shaped auditorium, three tiers of boxes constructed entirely of wood, decorated with gold leaf, and a pale blue trompe-l'oeil ceiling that resembles a round cupola. The building is a Grade 1 listed building as noted by Malta's Superintendence of Cultural Heritage, and is also scheduled by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA). History 329x329px Before the construction of the theatre, plays and amateur theatrical productions were staged in the halls and piano nobiles of the Knights' auberges. These were palaces constructed for the langues of the Order. The Langue of Italy often held such entertainment, staged by its knights in their Auberge. The records of the Langue even state that on February 2, 1697, some Maltese gentlemen presented a play in the Auberge d'Italie. Women were prohibited from attending these events after incidents during the Carnival festivities of 1639. The two houses rebuilt for the Priory of Navarra, now serving as the Ministry for Home Affairs In 1731, Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena commissioned and personally funded the construction of the building to serve as a public theatre \\"for the honest recreation of the people.\\" The Grand Master bought two houses from the Priory of Navarre, with a frontage on what is now Old Theatre Street for the sum of 2,186 scudi. It has a plain fa√ßade, in keeping with Valletta's Mannerist style, and has three floors with a mezzanine-level above the ground floor. The fa√ßade incorporates a doorway surmounted by a stone balustraded open balcony, itself supported by three heavy scroll corbels. The interior is decorated in Rococo style. The theatre was possibly designed by Romano Carapecchia, and was built by Francesco Zerafa and Antonio Azzopardi. Construction was finished in only ten months. This however, may be because alterations were made to the fabric of the three adjoining houses, incorporating them into a theatre. The building occupied an area of 94¬Ω square canes, which was later altered to 93 square canes and 2¬Ω palms. The theatre is said to have been modelled after the contemporary Palermo Theatre.Scicluna, Sir Hannibal P., \\"Buildings and Fortifications of Valletta\\", in Malta and Gibraltar; London, W.H. & L. Collingridge, at p. 215 Its auditorium was originally semi-circular or horseshoe shaped, with an illuminated parterre that served as a small dance floor. The first theatrical performance to be staged at the Teatro Pubblico was Scipione Maffei's classic tragedy Merope, on January 9, 1732.Compendio del Giornale del Sac. Fra. Gaetano Rebout. R.M.L., Ms. 20. The actors in that production were the Knights themselves, and the set was designed by the Knights' chief military architect, Francois Mondion. Palazzo Bonici used by the Manoel Theatre until 2014 On January 26, 1732 a satirical and anti- clerical play \\"Il bacchettiere falso\\" by Girolamo Gigli was performed. On January 18, 1769, the play \\"Il trionfo di Minerva\\", by Lentisco Adrasteo was presented on the occasion of Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca's birthday. A similar honour was also given to Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim, on his elevation as Grand Master. On this occasion, Hompesch appeared on the balcony thanking the crowd, showering handfuls of gold coins on the people that had gathered to applaud. Over the course of the next half-century, it was the venue for an extensive repertoire of lyric operas performed by companies of visiting professionals or by amateur groups of knights, and French tragedies or Italian comedies. Works by Johann Adolf Hasse, Niccol√≤ Piccinni and Baldassare Galuppi were extremely popular at the theatre during its early years. In its early days, the management of the theatre, and censorship of its performances, was entrusted to a senior knight, known as the Protettore. The first recorded impresario was Melchiorre Prevvost Lanarelli in 1736, and the last Giovanni Le Brun in 1866. From 1768 to 1770 the impresario was a woman, Natala Farrugia. In setting up the theatre, Grand Master de Vilhena set the rent to be paid by the impresario at 320 scudi per annum, of which 80 accrued for rent from Easter to August, 120 for autumn, and another 120 scudi from Christmas to Carnival. When dances or veglioni (masked ball) were held in the theatre, the pit was raised by a scaffolding to the level of the stage. On August 22, 1778, regulations were passed for the lighting of the theatre and corridors on such occasions, with the shading of lights, in any manner, being prohibited. In 1778, to avoid scandal, theatre companies were prohibited from sleeping in the boxes of the theatre. This was a practice which was common during that time. A few years later, in 1783, the Teatro Pubblico underwent considerable modification and decoration, based on a design by the Roman architect, Natale Marini. A model was displayed before the inquisitor and many knights, and the model was so admired that the Commissioners of the Foundation of the Theatre decided to add a further two louis, as a bonus to Marini‚Äôs invoice of 49 scudi.Diverse Scritture relative alla Fondazione Manoel, R.M.L., Treas. A. 32, cited by . The pale blue, trompe-l'oeil ceiling that resembles a round cupola. Nicolas Isouard's first known opera, Casaciello perseguitato da un mago, was performed here in 1792, and Isouard became director of this theatre in 1798, after the French captured Malta, and continued to premiere other operas there.Paul Xuereb, The Manoel Theatre, a short history, Valletta, Friends of the Manoel Theatre Several of Isouard's own works, including Avviso ai Maritati and Artaserse, were performed at the Manoel during this time. French rule over Malta was short-lived and within two years the islands passed into the hands of Great Britain. An English gentleman who accompanied Abercrombie‚Äôs expedition to Egypt in 1801, wrote that: > \\"La Valette possesses an opera, small indeed, but neat, though much out of > repair. Italy and Sicily supply it with very tolerable vocal performers, and > it is a very agreeable entertainment for the garrison. It was excessively > crowded every night by the officers of the expedition, to whom it was a > great source of amusement. The price of admission is one shilling.\\" The proscenium and theatre-boxes at the Manoel. During the early British Era, the \\"Teatro Pubblico\\" was renamed as the \\"Teatro Reale\\", going through a series of enlargements and re-modellings throughout the 19th century, most notably in 1812, when Sir George Whitmore added today's gallery and proscenium, raised the ceiling by one storey, and added eight more boxes, bringing the total to 67. Whitmore also transformed the auditorium to the oval shape that it has today. Further alterations were made in 1844, when the Manoel‚Äôs set designer, Ercolani, repainted the panels on the wooden boxes and had them gilded. Another stratum of silver leaf was added to the panels and ceiling in 1906. Throughout this time, the Teatro Reale was rented out to professional impresarios, who hosted nine-month opera seasons. It was visited by many foreign dignitaries, including Sir Walter Scott, and H.M. Queen Adelaide, the Queen Dowager, widow of William IV of England, who attended performances of Elisir d'Amore and Gemma di Vergy at the theatre, during her convalescence in Malta. Lucia di Lammermoor was given as a gala night in honour of the Queen Dowager, featuring soprano Camilla Darbois.Rolandi, Ulderico, \\"Musica e Musicisti in Malta\\", in Archivio Storico di Malta, Vol. I, Fasc. I, page 20, cited by . English and Italian opera and operetta were the most popular productions at the Teatro Reale throughout the 19th century; however, the Maltese public was particularly supportive of operas by Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti and Verdi. Royal Opera House, Valletta, c. 1866.|left In 1861, the Teatro Reale was given on perpetual lease, by the government, to Dr. Salvatore Mifsud and Anacleto Conti for an annual ground rent of ¬£236,15, and in 1862, the directum dominium was sold to Emmanuele Scicluna for ¬£7,833.6.8. Subsequent owners were Carmelo Arpa, a chemist (1889) and the Gollcher family (1906-7).Records of Notary Luigi Vella of 5 May 1861, and of 9 September 1802, cited by . The theatre had fallen into disuse in 1866, as a result of the construction of Malta's new Royal Opera House, designed by Edward Middleton Barry, on Strada Reale, at the entrance to Valletta. The theatre began to serve as a doss house for homeless and indigent citizens, who rented out the stalls for a few pennies a night. However, in 1873, the Teatro Reale - was officially renamed the \\"Manoel Theatre\\", and it enjoyed a brief new lease on life when the Royal Opera House burnt down. But by 1877, the Royal Opera House had been rebuilt, and once more, the Manoel Theatre was eclipsed and fell again into disuse. On December 27, 1922, January 6, 1923 and February 3, 1923, the Manoel Theatre was the venue for the first public airing of Malta's National Anthem, \\"L-Innu Malti.\\" During the Second World War, the Manoel Theatre served as emergency accommodation for victims of the constant bombardment by the Luftwaffe and the Regia Aeronautica. In the early 20th century, it was also used intermittently as the venue for Carnival balls and, for a period of about twenty years, it operated as a movie theatre. The theatre was included on the Antiquities List of 1925.  Present day  Despite numerous alterations over the years, it retains many of its old architectural features, such as the white Carrara marble staircase, shell- shaped niches, and Viennese chandeliers. Two water reservoirs beneath the floor create an acoustic environment that is so precise, that the hushed page- turnings of an orchestra conductor can be heard clearly throughout the auditorium. Following the destruction of the Royal Opera House by Axis bombardment on April 7, 1942, the Manoel Theatre was expropriated by the Government of Malta in 1956, and was quickly restored to its former glory. It reopened in December 1960 with a performance of Copp√©lia by Ballet Rambert. In subsequent years the theatre foyer was enlarged by means of the annexation of the adjacent Palazzo Bonici, a grand 18th century palace that was the former home of the Testaferrata Bonnici family, however on January 9, 2007, the Constitutional Court of Malta revoked the 1958 order of possession and use in respect of this property, and ordered that the property be returned to its original owner. This annex currently houses the theatre's bar and restaurant. Restoration of the fa√ßade of the Manoel Theatre has been a source of controversy. The theatre is being restored by the Manoel Theatre Restoration Committee. Previous restoration attempts done in the 1970s were heavily criticised, with the removal of a balcony and the reinforcement of old stone with new masonry. The first phase of the new restoration took place in 2003, and included the restoration of the paintings on the frontispiece of the auditorium boxes. In 2004, the auditorium was restored by a team of Sante Guido Restauro e Conservazione di Opere d'Arte, who unearthed paintings that will allow the understanding of the theatre's development. This second phase included the cleaning of the gilt. The third phase included the restoration of the proscenium arch and the boxes it incorporates, while the fourth phase of the restoration project was the ceiling‚Äôs restoration, which was inaugurated on October 3, 2006. Although controversial, an application to restore the theatre's fa√ßade was approved by Maltese planning and heritage supervisory bodies and was restored in 2017. Today, the Manoel Theatre continues to put up a broad variety of theatrical productions in both English and Maltese, opera, musical recitals (including lunchtime recitals in Sala Isouard), poetry recitals, dramatic readings, and an annual Christmas pantomime, produced by the Malta Amateur Dramatic Club. Management of the theatre is currently entrusted to Chairman Michael Grech, deputy chairman Kenneth Zammit Tabona, and board members Mario Philip Azzopardi, Anita Alosio and Lino Farrugia. Many productions are regularly presented, both by local talent and international stars, and the theatre has been a source for the cultural appreciation of the arts in Malta. Since 1960, it has had an official Management Committee and is no longer rented out for whole seasons to impresarios as in the past. The theatre's musical programmes retain some variety, but the main emphasis during recent decades has been on instrumental music. The theatre is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.  World premieres held at Manoel Theatre (incomplete)  * 8 April 2016: The Price of One.

Only one layer is in contact with the basement membrane; the other layers adhere to one another to maintain structural integrity. Although this epithelium is referred to as squamous, many cells within the layers may not be flattened; this is due to the convention of naming epithelia according to the cell type at the surface. In the deeper layers, the cells may be columnar or cuboidal. There are no intercellular spaces. This type of epithelium is well suited to areas in the body subject to constant abrasion, as the thickest layers can be sequentially sloughed off and replaced before the basement membrane is exposed. It forms the outermost layer of the skin and the inner lining of the mouth, esophagus and vagina. Structure Non-keratinized Non-keratinized surfaces must be kept moist by bodily secretions to prevent them from drying out. Examples of non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium include some parts of the oral cavity, conjunctiva of eye, esophagus, external female genitalia, and vagina. Even non-keratinized surfaces, consisting as they do of keratinocytes, have a minor superficial keratinized layer of varying thickness, depending on the age of the epithelium and the damage it has experienced. Keratinized Keratinized surfaces are protected from absorption by keratin protein. Keratinized epithelium has keratin protein deposited on the surface which makes it impermeable and dry. Examples of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium include skin, epidermis of the palm of the hand and sole of the foot, and the masticatory mucosa.

Biography The years 332-33-34 and 350 are mentioned as the date of his birth, and the years 451-52 and 466 as the date of his death, all authors agreeing that he lived about 118 years. He was born at Schenalolet in the district of Akhmim, and died in his monastery, which still exists today as the (White Monastery), near the ruins of the village of Atripe. In 371, he became a monk at this large double monastery, which was then ruled by his uncle Bgol, whom he succeeded as abbot in 388. St. Cyril of Alexandria, whom he accompanied to the First Council of Ephesus in 431, appointed him archimandrite during that council. The Copts honour him as a saint and as the Father of the Coptic Church. The monastic rule of Pachomius underwent various modifications and was made more severe under the abbacy of Bgol and Schenute. Perhaps the most important modification was the introduction of vows into the monastic life. Each monk made a solemn profession in the church, that he would faithfully observe the rule of the monastery. The formula of this vow, as prescribed by Schenute, was published by Leipoldt (loc. cit. below p. 107), and by Leclercq in \\"Dictionnaire d'Arch√©ologie chr√©tienne\\" s. v. C√©nobitisme. It is as follows: \\"I vow [homologein] before God in His holy place as the word of my tongue is my witness: I shall never sully my body in any way; I shall not steal; I shall not take false oaths; I shall not lie; I shall not do evil secretly. If I transgress what I have sworn [homologein] I shall not enter the kingdom of heaven, for I know that God before whom I pronounce the formula of this pledge [diatheke] will thrust me body and soul into hell-fire, for I shall have transgressed the formula of the pledge [diatheke] have pronounced\\" (op. cit.) It is the first monastic vow of which we have any knowledge. Another modification of the rule of Pachomius was a combination of the cenobitic (communal) with the anchoretic (eremitic) life. Schenute was the most influential monastic head and perhaps the most powerful man in Egypt during his time. Besa, his biographer and successor as Abbot of Atripe, states that at one time he ruled over 2200 monks and 1800 nuns. But Schenute was too self-conscious, passionate and tyrannical, his rule too severe, and his enforcement of it too violent, to make his influence wholesome and lasting. Outside of Egypt he remained unknown; neither Latin nor Greek writers make any mention of him. He considered philosophy useless, and his whole knowledge of theology consisted in the repetition of the current ecclesiastical formulas. Extremely austere with himself, he required the same austerity of his disciples, and rigidly enforced an absolute submission to his authority. Writings His literary works, written in the Sahidic language, consist chiefly of letters to monks and nuns, spiritual exhortations, and some very forcible sermons. They are edited with a Latin translation by Leipoldt, in \\"Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium\\" (Paris, 1906) and, with a French translation, by Am√©lineau in the same publication (Paris, 1907-.)

During a career in operetta and other forms of musical theatre, she managed several of her own opera companies and raised four children as a single mother. She is best remembered as a producer of the original production of Trial by Jury by Gilbert and Sullivan. Life and career Dolaro was born in London. Her father was the violinist and conductor Benjamin Simmonds, and her mother was Julia (n√©e Lewis). Dolaro received early music lessons from her father's colleagues, and she attended the Paris Conservatory as a teenager to continue her musical studies. In 1865, at the age of sixteen, she married Isaac Dolaro Belasco, an Italian Jew of Spanish descent, in Upper Kennington, England. By 1870, she had adopted Dolaro as her stage name.Siegel, Michele. \\"Selina Dolaro\\", Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia, 1 March 2009, Jewish Women's Archive, accessed 12 January 2010 Programme cover of April 1875 for La P√©richole and Trial by Jury, with caricatures of Gilbert and Sullivan as cherubs framing a portrait of Dolaro Dolaro made her stage debut at the Lyceum Theatre, in the role of the Spanish princess, Galsuinda, in Herv√©'s operetta Chilp√©ric in 1870 and soon played there in Offenbach operettas. Successes at various London theatres followed: After a season at the Gaiety Theatre, London, Dolaro starred in an English-language Offenbach adaptation called Breaking the Spell, on tour with Fred Sullivan's Operetta Company in 1871.Liverpool Mercury, 5 September 1871, p. 1 In 1872 Dolaro was a leading performer in H. B. Farnie's English-language adaptation of Offenbach's Genevi√®ve de Brabant,The Times, 20 February 1872, p. 9 in Herv√©'s Doctor FaustThe Times, 1 June 1872, p. 8 and in a burlesque of Ferdinand H√©rold's Zampa (\\"Charmingly sung by Miss Dolaro in imitation of Mdlle Chaumont\\", said The Times)The Times, 5 October 1872, p. 11 She also appeared in the title role of Bizet's Carmen in the first English-language production, with the Carl Rosa Opera Company, opposite Durward Lely as Don Jos√©.Adams, p. 254 In 1873, Dolaro divorced her husband on the grounds of his adultery and desertion; she brought up her two sons and two daughters on her own income. By January 1875, Dolaro was director of the Royalty Theatre, where her father served as musical director. She starred as the title character in Offenbach's La P√©richole, uniting \\"vivacity as an actress\\" with \\"taste and skill as a singer\\".The Times, 2 February 1875, p. 8 As a replacement afterpiece to La P√©richole, her new theatre manager, Richard D'Oyly Carte, commissioned Trial by Jury from W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan.In late January 1875, The Times ran advertisements for the Royalty Theatre: \\"In preparation, a new comic opera composed expressly for this theatre by Mr. Arthur Sullivan, in which Madame Dolaro and Nelly Bromley will appear\\" (Allen, p. 28), and commentators took this as an advertisement for Trial by Jury. However, Trial has no place for two principal ladies. McElroy and others conclude that Sullivan was writing a two-act opera for the Royalty that was abandoned, and the music was soon re-used in Sullivan's The Zoo, which has roles for two women. The Zoo played at another London theatre later in 1875 and at the Royalty in 1879 (McElroy, pp. 39‚Äì54). In any event, Bromley played the sole female principal role in Trial, not Dolaro. Sullivan conducted the opening night performance of Trial on 25 March, but Dolaro's father generally conducted the orchestra thereafter until the end of its initial run on 12 June 1875.Burgess, Michael. \\"Richard D'Oyly Carte\\", The Savoyard, January 1975, pp. 7‚Äì11 Dolaro took her Madame Selina Dolaro's Comic Opera Co. on tour between 13 June and 10 October 1875, as the theatre was closed during the hot summer months. On their return, Charles Morton became manager of the theatre. Dolaro returned to the position in January 1876 when, again working with Carte, she played Malvina in The Duke's Daughter. Dolaro continued to perform both in London and on tour, appearing at the Alhambra Theatre in 1877. In 1879 she worked at the Folly Theatre, which she also managed for the time. Dolaro travelled to the United States that autumn, appearing in October at the Academy of Music in New York City in the title role of Carmen, but reviews were mixed, with one critic commenting that she seemed \\"much more at home\\" performing in burlesque and comic opera. She then joined a touring comic opera troupe before returning to London. In 1880 she appeared again at the Globe Theatre as Cerisette in Farnie & Genee's The Naval Cadets. Soon thereafter she moved to New York, where she spent the next few seasons performing in comic opera. There, she worked under Carte's agency while appearing as Girola in Bucalossi's Les Manteaux Noirs and Katrina in Robert Planquette's Rip van Winkle and as the Fairy Queen in Gilbert and Sullivan's Iolanthe, both in 1882 at the Standard Theatre. In 1883, an opinion piece in the New York Herald by a Reverend Philip Germond denounced \\"play- acting as a godless life.\\" Dolaro responded with a spirited defence of her profession: \\"Had I not been ‚Äòlaunched‚Äô on this ‚Äògodless life,‚Äô I should probably have been a burden to some parish or perhaps launched on what I regard as indeed a godless life. ... Is it not enough that we must slave as we do to earn the means to educate and train our children so as to enable them to become useful members of society without being assailed even from the pulpit with such outrageous slander?‚Äù Dolaro's last part was Minnie Marden in an adaptation of Victorien Sardou's Agnes in 1886. Her health soon began to decline, as she began to struggle with tuberculosis. Her last appearance was in New York as a supernumerary in a benefit production of Hamlet for Lester Wallack, played at Daly's Theatre in May 1888. Dolaro died of a stroke in New York City in January 1889 at the age of 39. Publications Dolaro's play, In the Fashion (later known only as Fashion), ran in New York between 1887 and 1888. Her Mes amours: Poems, Passionate and Playful, based on love letters that she had received, was published in 1888. She also wrote a play called Justine. Dolaro also wrote novels, including: *The Princess Daphne, Belford, Clarke & Co. (US), 1888 (Edward Heron-Allen with Selina Dolaro ‚Äì a tale of psychic vampirism, involving mesmerism, doppelgangers and metapsychosis) *Bella Demonia, Belford, Clarke & Co.

Their monthly shared world anthology of urban fantasy centered on the fictitious city of San Cibola, California, and the magical inhabitants that lived side-by-side with the normal citizens. From this collective, Finn published the novels Gods New & Used and Year of the Hare, the first collection of stories revolving around Sam Bowen. Finn later became a contributing editor for RevolutionSF.com and wrote a number of articles and reviews to the website. Finn served as the creative director for the Violet Crown Radio Players, an audio theater troupe based in Austin, Texas, from 2002 to 2007. He has written several original scripts to critical acclaim and also adapted novels and short stories to an old time radio format, most notably ‚ÄúThe Adventures of Sailor Steve Costigan‚Äù, and ‚ÄúKing Kong‚Äù, which was nominated for a B. Iden Payne award. He has been active in Robert E. Howard studies since 2002 and is now considered to be a scholar in the field. His biography of Howard, Blood & Thunder: The Life & Art of Robert E. Howard (Monkeybrain, Inc.), was released in November 2006 at the World Fantasy Convention and was a finalist for the 2007 Locus Awards for Best Non-Fiction. For his work on Blood & Thunder, Finn was nominated for the 2007 World Fantasy Award in the Special Award Professional category. Finn won the 2005 Cimmerian Awards for Outstanding Achievement, Best Essay (for ‚ÄúFists of Robert E. Howard‚Äù from The Barbaric Triumph), and the Emerging Scholar plus the 2007 Awards for Outstanding Achievement, Book By A Single Author (for Blood & Thunder) and Outstanding Achievement, Website (along with Leo Grin, Rob Roehm and Steve Tompkins for The Cimmerian blog). In 2013, 2014 and 2016 Finn was named one of the top movie critics in Texas by the Texas Associated Press Managing Editors awards.

Like other sonar systems, multibeam systems emit sound waves in a fan shape beneath a ship's hull. The amount of time it takes for the sound waves to bounce off the seabed and return to a receiver is used to determine water depth. Unlike other sonars, multibeam systems use beamforming to extract directional information from the returning soundwaves, producing a swath of depth readings from a single ping. History and progression USS Susan B. Anthony (AP-72) shipwreck off the coast of France. Multibeam sonar sounding systems, also known as swathe (British English) or swath (American English), originated for military applications. The Sonar Array Sounding System (SASS) was developed in the early 1960s by the US Navy, in conjunction with General Instrument to map large swaths of the ocean floor to assist the underwater navigation of its submarine force. SASS was tested aboard the USS Compass Island (AG-153). The final array system, composed of sixty-one one degree beams with a swath width of approximately 1.15 times water depth, was then installed on the USNS Bowditch (T-AGS-21), USNS Dutton (T-AGS-22) and USNS Michelson (T-AGS-23). Starting in the 1970s, companies such as General Instrument (now SeaBeam Instruments, part of L3 Klein) in the United States, Krupp Atlas (now Atlas Hydrographic) and Elac Nautik (now part of the W√§rtsil√§ Corporation) in Germany, Simrad (now Kongsberg Maritime) in Norway and RESON now Teledyne RESON A/S in Denmark developed systems that could be mounted to the hull of large ships, and then small boats (as technologies improved and operating frequencies increased). The first commercial multibeam is now known as the SeaBeam Classic and was put in service in May 1977Harold Farr, Marine Geodesy, Volume 4, Issue 2 1980, pages 77 ‚Äì 93 on the Australian survey vessel HMAS Cook. This system produced up to 16 beams across a 45-degree arc. The (retronym) term \\"SeaBeam Classic\\" was coined after the manufacturer developed newer systems such as the SeaBeam 2000 and the SeaBeam 2112 in the late 1980s. The second SeaBeam Classic installation was on the French Research Vessel Jean Charcot. The SB Classic arrays on the Charcot were damaged in a grounding and the SeaBeam was replaced with an EM120 in 1991. Although it seems that the original SeaBeam Classic installation was not used much, the others were widely used, and subsequent installations were made on many vessels. SeaBeam Classic systems were subsequently installed on the US academic research vessels (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California), the (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University) and the (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution). As technology improved in the 1980s and 1990s, higher-frequency systems suitable for high-resolution mapping in shallow water were developed, and such systems are widely used for shallow-water hydrographic surveying in support of navigational charting. Multibeam echosounders are also commonly used for geological and oceanographic research, and since the 1990s for offshore oil and gas exploration and seafloor cable routing. In 1989, Atlas Electronics (Bremen, Germany) installed a second- generation deep-sea multibeam called Hydrosweep DS on the German research vessel Meteor. The Hydrosweep DS (HS-DS) produced up to 59 beams across a 90-degree swath, which was a vast improvement and was inherently ice- strengthened. Early HS-DS systems were installed on the (Germany), the (Germany), the (US) and the (India) in 1989 and 1990 and subsequently on a number of other vessels including the (US) and (Japan). As the cost of components has decreased, the number of multibeam systems sold and in operation worldwide has increased significantly. Smaller, portable systems can be operated on a small launch or tender vessel unlike the older systems that required considerable time and effort to attach to a ship's hull. Some multibeam echosounders such as the Teledyne Odom MB2 also incorporate a motion sensor at the face of the acoustic transducer, allowing even faster installation on small vessels. Multibeam echosounders like this are allowing many smaller hydrographic survey companies to move from traditional single beam echosounders to swath systems. Multibeam data includes bathymetry, acoustic backscatter, and water column data. Gas plumes now commonly identified in midwater multibeam data are termed flares. A multibeam echosounder showing the transmit array (larger black rectangle) and receive array (narrower rectangle) - Odom MB1 Theory of operation A multibeam echosounder is a device typically used by hydrographic surveyors to determine the depth of water and the nature of the seabed. Most modern systems work by transmitting a broad acoustic fan shaped pulse from a specially designed transducer across the full swath acrosstrack with a narrow alongtrack then forming multiple receive beams (beamforming) that are much narrower in the acrosstrack (around 1 degree depending on the system). From this narrow beam, a two way travel time of the acoustic pulse is then established utilizing a bottom detection algorithm. If the speed of sound in water is known for the full water column profile, the depth and position of the return signal can be determined from the receive angle and the two-way travel time. In order to determine the transmit and receive angle of each beam, a multibeam echosounder requires accurate measurement of the motion of the sonar relative to a cartesian coordinate system. The measured values are typically heave, pitch, roll, yaw, and heading. To compensate for signal loss due to spreading and absorption a time-varied gain circuit is designed into the receiver. For deep water systems, a steerable transmit beam is required to compensate for pitch. This can also be accomplished with beamforming.  References  * Louay M.A. Jalloul and Sam. P.

In the first years of the republic, Turkish architecture was influenced by Seljuk and Ottoman architecture, in particular during the First National Architectural Movement (also called the Turkish Neoclassical architecture movement.) However, starting from the 1930s, architectural styles began to differ from traditional architecture, also as a result of an increasing number of foreign architects being invited to work in the country, mostly from Germany and Austria. The Second World War was a period of isolation, during which the Second National Architectural Movement emerged. Similar to Fascist architecture, the movement aimed to create a modern but nationalistic architecture. Starting from the 1950s, isolation from the rest of the world began to diminish, which enabled the Turkish architects to experiment with new styles and become increasingly inspired by their counterparts in the rest of the world. However, they were largely constrained by the lack of technological infrastructure or insufficient financial resources until the 1980s. Thereafter, the liberalization of the economy and the shift towards export-led growth paved the way for the private sector to become the leading influence on architecture in Turkey. 1920s to early 1930s: First national architectural movement The First National Architectural Movement (Turkish: Birinci Ulusal Mimarlƒ±k Akƒ±mƒ±) was an architectural movement led by Turkish architects Vedat Tek (1873‚Äì1942) and Mimar Kemaleddin Bey (1870‚Äì1927). Followers of the movement wanted to create a new and \\"national\\" architecture, which was based on motifs from Seljuk and Ottoman architecture. The movement was also labelled Turkish Neoclassical architecture, or the National Architectural Renaissance. Other prominent followers of this movement were Arif Hikmet Koyunoƒülu (1888‚Äì1982) and Giulio Mongeri (1873‚Äì1953). Notable buildings from this era are the Istanbul Main Post Office (1905‚Äì1909), Tayyare Apartments (1919‚Äì1922), Istanbul 4th Vakƒ±f Han (1911‚Äì1926), State Art and Sculpture Museum (1927‚Äì1930), Ethnography Museum of Ankara (1925‚Äì1928), Bebek Mosque, and Kamer Hatun Mosque.

As there were not enough architects in Turkey until the 1950s, various architects were invited by the government from Germany, Austria, Switzerland and France, in order to manage the rapid construction of the new capital Ankara. About 40 architects and urban planners designed and oversaw various projects (mostly in Ankara, and to a lesser extent in Istanbul and Izmir) between 1924 and 1942. Among them were Gudrun Baudisch, Rudolf Belling, Paul Bonatz, Ernst Arnold Egli, Martin Elsaesser, Anton Hanak, Franz Hillinger, Clemens Holzmeister, Henri Prost, Paolo Vietti-Violi, Werner Issel, Hermann Jansen, Theodor Jost, Heinrich Krippel, Carl Christoph L√∂rcher, Robert Oerley, Bernhard Pfau, Bruno Taut and Josef Thorak. Selected examples of buildings from this era are the Bauhaus style Florya Atat√ºrk Marine Mansion (1935) designed by Seyfi Arkan; the Art Deco style Ankara railway station (1937) designed by ≈ûekip Akalƒ±n; the Court of Cassation building (1933‚Äì35) designed by Clemens Holzmeister; the Faculty of Languages, History and Geography building (1937) of Ankara University designed by Bruno Taut; and the Grand National Assembly of Turkey building (1938‚Äì63) designed by Clemens Holzmeister.

File:TBMM.jpeg|The Grand National Assembly of Turkey building (1938‚Äì63) in Ankara was designed by Clemens Holzmeister. Second national architectural movement Inspired by the design characteristics of Fascist architecture in Italy and Nazi architecture in Germany, which sought a modern interpretation of Neoclassical architecture (i.e. the architecture of a modern era Roman Empire, according to their ideologies), there was a trend towards creating a new national architecture in Turkey around the 1940s. The movement was called the Second National Architectural Movement (Turkish: ƒ∞kinci Ulusal Mimarlƒ±k Akƒ±mƒ±). The large number of foreign architects employed in Turkey in this period (especially from Germany and Austria) was a major factor in the introduction of these architectural movements and their stylistical characteristics. The pioneers of the movement in Turkey were Sedad Hakkƒ± Eldem, Ekrem Hakkƒ± Ayverdihttps://www.dunyabizim.com/images/haberler/haber/2016/04/25/ekrem- hakki-ayverdi.jpg and Emin Onat. In order to lead this movement, Sedad Hakkƒ± Eldem, who was a professor, held National Architecture seminars at the Mimar Sinan University of Fine Arts, focusing on the traditional Turkish house styles. Similar to their contemporary equivalents in Italy and Germany, the government buildings of this style in Ankara and Istanbul had typically large proportions (high ceilings, high windows, etc.) in order to give the impression of a strong state authority. Some of them also had monumental facade designs reminiscent of Neoclassical architecture; but with more modern and plain rectangular shapes, symmetry, simplicity, and a general lack of ornateness. Some of the buildings related to this style are the Ankara Opera House designed by ≈ûevki Balmumcu (1933‚Äì34) and renovated by Paul Bonatz (1946‚Äì47); the TCDD General Headquarters Building designed by Bedri U√ßar in 1938; Istanbul University Faculty of Science and Faculty of Literature buildings (1944‚Äì52); Anƒ±tkabir (1944‚Äì53); Istanbul Radio Headquarters (1945‚Äì49); ≈ûi≈üli Mosque (1945‚Äì49); and the √áanakkale Martyrs' Memorial (1954‚Äì60). The movement was particularly influential between 1935 and 1950. From the 1950s, the influence of this style started to diminish due to the next wave of influences, especially International Style and Rationalism.

These were architects who either studied in Europe or had information of the modernist architecture of the time. Their quest for modernist architecture was in line with the International Style and Rationalism. However, the development of the Turkish economy was an important factor as well. Even though Turkish architects were able to follow up on the modern design of important architects of the time, they were constrained by the lack of technological infrastructure or insufficient financial resources. Selected examples of buildings from this era are the Anadolu Club Hotel (1951‚Äì1957) in B√ºy√ºkada designed by Turgut Cansever and Abdurrahman Hancƒ±; Hilton Istanbul Bosphorus (1952‚Äì1955) designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and Sedad Hakkƒ± Eldem; Istanbul Municipality Headquarters (1953‚Äì1960) designed by Nevzat Erol; Emek Business Center (1959‚Äì1965) in Ankara designed by Enver Tokay and ƒ∞lhan Tayman; and Tekel Headquarters (1958‚Äì1960) in Istanbul designed by Yƒ±lmaz Sanlƒ± and ƒ∞lhan Tayman. One of the most important developments of this period was the establishment of the Chamber of Architects of Turkey in 1954. Various professional organizations for architects had existed beforehand, but there were no laws for the architectural profession until 1954. Brutalist architecture become popular during 1950s, the work of Behruz √áinici in Middle East Technical University is the best example of this era.

Despite these hardships, architects were able to design some important buildings. Abandoning Rationalism, Turkish architects tried to design their buildings in more flexible and fragmented forms. Important works from this period are the Vakƒ±flar Hotel in Istanbul (1968, today the Ceylan Intercontinental Hotel), Middle East Technical University Campuses (1961) in Ankara, Istanbul Manufacturers' Market (1959), Turkish Historical Society Building (1967), Grand Ankara Hotel (1960, today the Rixos Grand Ankara Hotel) and Atat√ºrk Cultural Center (1969) in Istanbul. As a result of economic and social turbulence, architecture in Turkey suffered also in the 1970s. There were no significant breakthroughs during this period. Some important designs from the 1970s are the Turkish Language Association Building (1972), Atat√ºrk Library (1973) and Abdi ƒ∞pek√ßi Arena (1979).

Istanbul's skyline has changed significantly since the 1990s. In January 1980, the government of Prime Minister S√ºleyman Demirel began implementing a far-reaching reform program designed by then Undersecretary of the Prime Ministry Turgut √ñzal to shift Turkey's economy toward export-led growth. These reforms had a positive effect on the construction industry and architecture. New methods such as prefabrication and curtain wall systems were introduced to Turkish architects and contractors in the 1980s. In addition, steel, aluminum, plastic and glass production increased, which allowed architects to free themselves from rigid forms. Panoramic view of Istanbul. Until the 1980s, the government sector was the leading client when it came to architecture and construction. However, the liberalization of the economy paved the way for the private sector to become the leading influence. Notable architects from this period include Behruz √áinici, Merih Karaaslan, Sevin√ß Hadi, ≈ûandor Hadi, Ersen G√ºrsel, Mehmet √áubuk, Doƒüan Tekeli, Sami Sisa, Emre Arolat, Murat Tabanlƒ±oƒülu, Melkan Tabanlƒ±oƒülu, H√ºsrev Tayla, Doƒüan Hasol, Atilla Y√ºcel, Sema Soygeni≈ü, Murat Soygeni≈ü and Kaya Arƒ±koƒülu, among others.

The traditional preparation caused mucous cells to swell during fixation which results in the serous cells being popped out of their alignment.

Early life Born in Brooklyn, New York, on November 19, 1951 and then growing up in Oceanside, Long Island, Werner began playing and performing at a young age, first recording on television at the age of 11. Although he studied classical piano as a child, he enjoyed playing anything he heard on the radio and improvisation was his true calling. In high school and his first years of college he attended the Manhattan School of Music as a classical piano major. His aptitude for improvisation led him to the Berklee College of Music in 1970, where he met and studied with his first piano/spiritual teacher, Madame Chaloff. From Boston, Werner traveled to Brazil with the saxophonist Victor Assis Brasil. There he met Assis's twin brother, Brazilian pianist Joao Assis Brasil. His studies with Joao and Madame Chaloff would lead to the writing of the book Effortless Mastery. Later life and career Werner started his own trio in 1981 with drummer Tom Rainey and bassist Ratzo Harris. The Kenny Werner Trio matured for fourteen years, touring in America and Europe and recording four albums along the way. In the 1980s, he became the pianist for The Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra (currently known as the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra). Challenged by Lewis and Bob Brookmeyer to write for the band, he produced his first compositions and arrangements for jazz orchestra, consequently leading him to write for the bands in Europe including the Cologne, Danish, and Stockholm Jazz Orchestras, the Umo Jazz Orchestra of Finland and several times as the guest composer and soloist with the Metropole Orchestra of Holland. Since then Werner has had commissions to write for large ensembles such as jazz orchestras, full orchestras and most in 2007, wind ensemble, choir and string quartet as featured on his album No Beginning, No End (2009). Werner continued to play duo with Toots Thielemans for seventeen years. They recorded an album together and Werner received a Grammy nomination for his composition, \\"Inspiration.\\" For twenty years, he was musical director for Broadway star Betty Buckley. They made six albums together and she has sung his arrangements for small bands and orchestras. He and Joe Lovano have recorded and collaborated on each other's projects for over 40 years. During the 1990s, Werner made three award-winning albums: Kenny Werner at Maybeck, Concord Duo Series, Vol. 10, and Live at Visiones. In 2000, Werner formed a trio with Ari Hoenig on drums and Johannes Weidenmueller on bass, with Werner acting as composer, arranger, and pianist. In 2007, he released his first album for Blue Note Records, Lawn Chair Society, featuring Chris Potter, Dave Douglas, Scott Colley, and Brian Blade. Werner was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for the album No Beginning No End (Half Note, 2010), which explored tragedy and loss, death and transition, and the path from one lifetime to the next. The album featured Joe Lovano, Judi Silvano, and over seventy musicians. In 1996, Werner wrote a book about the psychological aspects of music in Effortless Mastery ‚Äì Liberating the Master Musician Within. He lectured to support the book.

The entry and exit of large molecules from the cell nucleus is tightly controlled by the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Although small molecules can enter the nucleus without regulation, macromolecules such as RNA and proteins require association with transport factors known as nuclear transport receptors, like karyopherins called importins to enter the nucleus and exportins to exit. Protein that must be imported to the nucleus from the cytoplasm carry nuclear localization signals (NLS) that are bound by importins. An NLS is a sequence of amino acids that acts as a tag. They are diverse in their composition and most commonly hydrophilic, although hydrophobic sequences have also been documented. Proteins, transfer RNA, and assembled ribosomal subunits are exported from the nucleus due to association with exportins, which bind signaling sequences called nuclear export signals (NES). The ability of both importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by the small Ras related GTPase, Ran. GTPases are enzymes that bind to a molecule called guanosine triphosphate (GTP) which they then hydrolyze to create guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and release energy. Ran is in a different conformation depending on whether it is bound to GTP or GDP. In its GTP bound state, Ran is capable of binding karyopherins (importins and exportins). Importins release cargo upon binding to RanGTP, while exportins must bind RanGTP to form a ternary complex with their export cargo. The dominant nucleotide binding state of Ran depends on whether it is located in the nucleus (RanGTP) or the cytoplasm (RanGDP). Macromolecules, such as RNA and proteins, are actively transported across the nuclear membrane in a process called the Ran-GTP nuclear transport cycle. Nuclear import Importin proteins bind their cargo in the cytoplasm, after which they are able to interact with the nuclear pore complex and pass through its channel. Once inside the nucleus, interaction with Ran-GTP causes a conformational change in the importin that causes it to dissociate from its cargo. The resulting complex of importin and Ran-GTP then translocates to the cytoplasm, where a protein called Ran Binding Protein (RanBP) separates Ran- GTP from importin. Separation allows access to a GTPase activating protein (GAP) that binds Ran-GTP and induces the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. The Ran-GDP produced from this process now binds the nuclear transport factor NUTF2 which returns it to the nucleoplasm. Now in the nucleus, the Ran-GDP interacts with a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) which replaces the GDP with GTP, resulting again in Ran-GTP, and beginning the cycle anew. Nuclear export Nuclear export roughly reverses the import process; in the nucleus, the exportin binds the cargo and Ran-GTP and diffuses through the pore to the cytoplasm, where the complex dissociates. Ran-GTP binds GAP and hydrolyzes GTP, and the resulting Ran-GDP complex is restored to the nucleus where it exchanges its bound ligand for GTP. Hence, whereas importins depend on RanGTP to dissociate from their cargo, exportins require RanGTP in order to bind to their cargo. A specialized mRNA exporter protein moves mature mRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is complete. This translocation process is actively dependent on the Ran protein, although the specific mechanism is not yet well understood. Some particularly commonly transcribed genes are physically located near nuclear pores to facilitate the translocation process. Export of tRNA is also dependent on the various modifications it undergoes, thus preventing export of improperly functioning tRNA. This quality control mechanism is important due to tRNA's central role in translation, where it is involved in adding amino acids to a growing peptide chain. The tRNA exporter in vertebrates is called exportin-t. Exportin-t binds directly to its tRNA cargo in the nucleus, a process promoted by the presence of RanGTP. Mutations that affect tRNA's structure inhibit its ability to bind to exportin-t, and consequentially, to be exported, providing the cell with another quality control step. As described above, once the complex has crossed the envelope it dissociates and releases the tRNA cargo into the cytosol. Protein shuttling Many proteins are known to have both NESs and NLSs and thus shuttle constantly between the nucleus and the cytosol. In certain cases one of these steps (i.e., nuclear import or nuclear export) is regulated, often by post-translational modifications. Protein shuttling can be assessed using a heterokaryon fusion assay.

Many white √©migr√©s participated in the White movement or supported it, although the term is often broadly applied to anyone who may have left the country due to the change in r√©gimes. Some white √©migr√©s, like Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, were opposed to the Bolsheviks but had not directly supported the White movement; some were apolitical. The term is also applied to the descendants of those who left and who still retain a Russian Orthodox Christian identity while living abroad. The term is most commonly used in France, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

They spanned all classes and included military soldiers and officers, Cossacks, intellectuals of various professions, dispossessed businessmen and landowners, as well as officials of the Russian Imperial government and of various anti-Bolshevik governments of the Russian Civil War period.

A large number also fled to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Iran, Germany and France. Some √©migr√©s also fled to Portugal, Spain, Romania, Belgium, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Italy, India and South Africa. Berlin and Paris developed thriving √©migr√© communities.

Ideological inclinations White propaganda poster, c. 1932 White √©migr√©s were, generally speaking, anticommunist and did not consider the Soviet Union and its legacy to be Russian at its core, a position which was reflective of their Russian Nationalist sympathies; they tended not to recognize the demands of Ukrainian, Georgian, and other minority groups for self-determination but yearned for the resurrection of the Russian Empire. They consider the period of 1917 to 1991 to have been a period of internationalist and anti-Christian occupation by the Soviet regime. They used the Tsarist tricolor (white-blue-red) as their national flag, for example, and some organizations used the flag of the Imperial Russian Navy. A significant percentage of white √©migr√©s may be described as monarchists, although many adopted a position of being \\"unpredetermined\\" (\\"nepredreshentsi\\"), believing that Russia's political structure should be determined by popular plebiscite. Many white √©migr√©s believed that their mission was to preserve the pre-revolutionary Russian culture and way of life while living abroad, in order to return this influence to Russian culture after the fall of the USSR. Many symbols of the White √©migr√©s were reintroduced as symbols of the post-Soviet Russia, such as the Byzantine eagle and the Russian tricolor. A religious mission to the outside world was another concept promoted by people such as Bishop John of Shanghai and San Francisco (canonized as a saint of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad) who said at the 1938 All-Diaspora Council: Many white √©migr√©s also believed it was their duty to remain active in combat against the Soviet Union, with the hopes of liberating Russia. This ideology was largely inspired by General Pyotr Wrangel, who said upon the White army's defeat \\"The battle for Russia has not ceased, it has merely taken on new forms\\". White army veteran Captain Vasili Orekhov, publisher of the \\"Sentry\\" journal, encapsulated this idea of responsibility with the following words: Organizations and activities Emblem used by white √©migr√© volunteers in the Spanish Civil War. The √©migr√©s formed various organizations for the purpose of combatting the Soviet regime such as the Russian All-Military Union, the Brotherhood of Russian Truth, and the NTS. This made the white √©migr√©s a target for infiltration by the Soviet secret police (e.g. operation TREST and the Inner Line). Seventy-five White army veterans served as volunteers supporting Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War. Some white √©migr√©s, labeled \\"Soviet patriots,\\" adopted pro- Soviet sympathies. These people formed organizations such as the Mladorossi, the Evraziitsi, and the Smenovekhovtsi. One of the most notable forms of activities by Russian √©migr√©s was building monuments to Russian war dead of World War I, which stood in marked contrast to the Soviet Union, which did not build any monuments to the 2 million Russians killed between 1914 and 1917, as the war had been condemned by Lenin as an \\"imperialist war\\". Besides for the war dead, other monuments were put up. In Brussels, Seattle, and Harbin, monuments were built to honor the executed Emperor Nicholas II while a monument was put up in Shanghai to honor Alexander Pushkin, Russia's national poet. In fact, a monument to Pushkin would have been built in Paris had not a dispute arouse with the Ministry of Fine Arts over its precise location. The popularity of monuments for the war dead reflected not only sadness over the war dead, but also a way to bring together the often badly divided √©migr√© communities shattered across Europe, Asia and North America. Monuments for the war dead were often a way to symbolically recreate Russia abroad with example at the monument for those Russians killed while serving in the Russian Expeditionary Force (REF) in France at village of Mourmelon-le-Grand having a hermitage built near it together with transplanted fir trees and a Russian style farm to make it look like home. To built community consensus around the war memorials, the design of the memorials were deliberately kept simple with no sculpture which could be given a symbolic meaning, thereby ensuring that no particular interpretation of the war could be put forward other than grief over the war dead. The design of Orthodox churches at the war memorials was done in the style of medieval Orthodox churches in Novgorod and Pskov as this architectural style was seen as politically neutral and hence able to bring the communities together better. Both left-wing and right-wing √©migr√© who otherwise passionately disagreed came together to honor the war dead of World War I, which was virtually the only occasions when overseas Russian communities could all come together, explaining why such memorial services were so important to the √©migr√© communities. The neo-classical style which typically adorned war memorials in Imperial Russia was consciously avoided as building a war memorial in that style was viewed as expressing support for restoring the monarchy. The sense of loss was not only for those the war monuments honored, but due to the sense of loss caused by defeat with a columnist in an √©migr√© newspaper in Paris writing about the dedication of a memorial to the REF in 1930: \\"We lost everything - family, economic situation, personal happiness, the homeland...Are our sufferings good to anyone? In truth-we have nothing, we have lost everything. Weep, weep\\". Such monuments were also a way of commanding respect from the host communities with an √©migr√© newspaper saying in 1930: \\"Peoples honor heroes. To the living: care, to the dead: memory. We in a foreign land do not have a tomb of an 'unknown soldier', but we do have thousands of suffering people. They are our honor and our justification (opravdanie) before the world. Their wounds and suffering are for Russia. They remain true to honor and obligation. That is our Russian passport\\". This was especially the case in France, the home of the largest overseas Russian community, where services honoring the events of World War I were a major part of French life after 1918, and where by honoring the Russian war dead allowed the Russian √©migr√©s in France to take part in the ceremonials, letting the √©migr√©s feel like a part of the wider French community. In 1927, the Orthodox Metropolitan Evlogii when he spoke at the war monument in Valenciennes: \\"Blood spilled on the soil of beautiful and glorious France is the best atmosphere to unite France forever with a Russia national and worthy\\". The fact that the crosses of the Russians buried in France were painted white-the color of the French war dead and allies-while the crosses of the German war dead were painted black was widely noticed within the Russian community in France as a sign that the French regarded them as allies. In Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, war memorials to the Russian war dead were presented in Pan-Slavic terms, as a symbol of how Russians had fought together with the Czechs and Serbs in the war. King Alexander of Yugoslavia was a Russophile who welcomed Russian √©migr√©s to his kingdom, and after France, Yugoslavia had the largest Russian √©migr√© community, leading to Yugoslavia to have almost as many war memorials to the Russian war dead as France. War memorials in Yugoslavia usually also honored both Serbian war dead and the members of the Czechoslovak Legions who died in the war, giving them a decidedly pan-Slavic feel. A planned Orthodox church to honor the Russian prisoners who died in an Austrian POW camp outside Osijek would have featured busts of the Emperor Nicholas II, King Peter I and King Alexander to emphasis how the Houses of Romanov and Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá had been allied in the war, linking the Russian and Serbian experiences of the war. Between 1934 and 1936, an ossuary containing the bones of Russian soldiers killed all over the world was built in the Novo Groblje cemetery in Belgrade, which used to illustrate the theme of Serbian-Russian friendship, and which King Alexander contributed 5,000 dinars to meet the construction costs. When the memorial was opened in 1936, the Patriarch Varnava of the Serbian Orthodox Church declared in a speech opening it: \\"The Russians bore great sacrifices on our account wishing to defend Serbs at a time when powerful enemies attacked tiny Serbia from all sides. And the great Slavic soul of the Russians did not allow it to be looked upon with indifference that a fraternal Slavic people should perish\\". Karel Kram√°≈ô, a wealthy conservative Czechoslovak politician and a Russophile worked together with Russian √©migr√©s to build an Orthodox church in Prague which Kram√°≈ô called in his opening speech \\"a monument of Slavic connection\\" and to \\"remind Russians not only of their former sufferings but also about the recognition on the side of the Slavs\\". A service at the Russian war memorial in Terezin in 1930 turned into \\"a Russian-Czech political demonstration in a manifestation of Slavic mutuality\\" with the theme that the Russians had died so that the Czechs might be free. Prague had a large community of Russian √©migr√©s, and by constantly linking the Russian experience of World War I to the experiences of the Czechoslovak Legions was a way of asserting that the Russians had helped to make Czechoslovakia possible. In Germany, right-wing √©migr√©s found much to their own frustration that right-wing German veterans shunned their offers to participate in Totensonntag (\\"Day of the Dead\\") as German conservatives did not wish to honor the sacrifices of those who had fought against Germany, and it was left-wing German veterans, usually associated with Social Democratic Party, who welcomed having Russians participate in Totensonntag to illustrate the theme that all peoples in the nations involved in the First World war were victims. In Germany, November 11 was not a holiday as no one wanted to honor the day that the Reich lost the war, and Totensonntag played the same role in Germany that November 11 played in the Allied nations, as the time to honor the war dead. The anti-war and internationalist message at the Totensonntag ceremonies organized by the SPD did not sit well with right-wing Russian √©migr√©s found themselves rather out of place at these ceremonies. The city of Harbin in China was founded by the Russians in 1896, becoming known the \\"Moscow of the Orient\\" due to its Russian appearance, and after the Revolution its Russian population was further reinforced by √©migr√©s, through the majority of the Russians living in Harbin were people who had come before World War I. About 127,000 people living in Harbin in 1920 came from Russia, making it one of the largest Russian-speaking cites in East Asia. Many of the Russians in Harbin were wealthy, and the city was a center of Russian culture as the Russian community in Harbin made it their mission to preserve the pre-war Russian culture in a city on the plains of Manchuria with for instance Harbin having two opera companies and numerous theaters performing the traditional classics of the Russian stage. The economic success of the Russians in Harbin often surprised foreign visitors who assumed that they should be poor, leading one visitor in 1923 to comment that Russian ‚Äúladies as well gowned as at the Paris races [who] strolled with men faultlessly garbed by European standards‚Äù, leading him to wonder how they achieved this \\"deceptive appearance\\". The extent of Russian economic dominance of Harbin could be seen that ‚ÄúMoya-tvoya\\", a pidgin language combining aspects of Russian and Mandarin Chinese which developed in the 19th century when Chinese went to work in Siberia was considered essential by the Chinese merchants of Harbin. White √©migr√©s fought with the Soviet Red Army during the Soviet invasion of Xinjiang and the Xinjiang War of 1937. During World War II, many white √©migr√©s took part in the Russian Liberation Movement. The main reason that pushed the Whites to support the German power with action was the concept of a 'spring offensive', an armed intervention against the USSR that must be exploited in order to continue the civil war. The latter was perceived by many Russian officers as an ongoing case that was never finished since the day of their exile.O. Beyda, ‚Äò‚ÄúRe-Fighting the Civil War‚Äù: Second Lieutenant Mikhail Aleksandrovich Gubanov‚Äô. Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr Geschichte Osteuropas, Vol. 66, No. 2, 2018, p. 247. During the war, the white √©migr√©s came into contact with former Soviet citizens from German-occupied territories who used the German retreat as an opportunity to either flee from the Soviet Union, or were in Germany and Austria as POWs and forced labor, and preferred to stay in the West, often referred to as the second wave of √©migr√©s (often also called DPs ‚Äì displaced persons, see Displaced persons camp). This smaller second wave fairly quickly began to assimilate into the white √©migr√© community. After the war, active anti-Soviet combat was almost exclusively continued by NTS: other organizations either dissolved, or began concentrating exclusively on self- preservation and/or educating the youth. Various youth organizations, such as the Scouts-in-Exile became functional in raising children with a background in pre-Soviet Russian culture and heritage. The white √©migr√©s formed the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad in 1924. The church continues its existence to this day, acting as both the spiritual and cultural center of the Russian Orthodox community abroad. On 17 May 2007, the Act of Canonical Communion with the Moscow Patriarchate reestablished canonical ties between the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad and the Russian Church of the Moscow Patriarchate, after more than 80 years of separation. In China \\"White Russians\\" flooded into China after World War I and into the early 1920s. Most of the Russians went to Manchuria and treaty ports such as Shanghai, but a few ended up in Beijing. In 1924, the Chinese government recognized the government of the Soviet Union and the majority of White Russians in China who refused to become Soviet citizens were rendered stateless, thus subject to Chinese law unlike other Europeans, Americans, and Japanese living in China who enjoyed the principles of extraterritoriality. Nor were White Russians born in China eligible to be Chinese citizens. Although some of the White Russians arrived with their fortunes intact, most were penniless and due to ethnic prejudices and their inability to speak Chinese, were unable to find jobs. To support themselves and their families, many of the younger women became prostitutes or taxi dancers. They were popular with both foreign men, there being a shortage of foreign women, and Chinese men. A League of Nations survey in Shanghai in 1935 found that 22% of Russian women between 16 and 45 years of age were engaging in prostitution to some extent. The percentage in Beijing may have been higher than Shanghai as economic opportunities were more limited. The White Russian women mostly worked in the \\"Badlands\\" area adjoining the Beijing Legation Quarter on the east, centered on Chuanban Hutong (alley). The American explorer Roy Chapman Andrews said he frequented the \\"cafes of somewhat dubious reputation\\" with the explorer Sven Hedin and scientist Davidson Black to \\"have scrambled eggs and dance with the Russian girls.\\" An Italian diplomat condemned the White Russians: \\"The prestige of the white face fell precipitously when Chinese could possess a white woman for a dollar or less, and Russian officers in tattered uniforms begged at the doors of Chinese theaters.\\" Notable \\"first-wave\\" √©migr√©s Statesmen, religious figures Military figures Historians and philosophers The arts Scientists and inventors Other figures White √©migr√© organizations and entities Orthodox Church jurisdictions: *Orthodox Church in America (–ê–ü–¶, –ú–∏—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–æ–ª–∏—è) ‚Äì not entirely founded by White √©migr√©s but includes a significant percentage of √©migr√© parishes. *Patriarchal Exarchate for Orthodox Parishes of Russian Tradition in Western Europe (–ü–∞—Ä–∏–∂—Å–∫–∏–π –≠–∫–∑–∞—Ä—Ö–∞—Ç) *Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (–†–ü–¶–ó, –ó–∞—Ä—É–±–µ–∂–Ω–∞—è –¶–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤—å) Military and paramilitary organizations: *Russian All-Military Union (the oldest organization representing the White Government in exile) *Russian Liberation Movement **Russian Liberation Army **Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia **Russian Corps Combatants (–°–æ—é–∑ –ß–∏–Ω–æ–≤ –†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ö–æ—Ä–ø—É—Å–∞) *Association of Cadets (–û–±—ä–µ–¥–∏–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ö–∞–¥–µ—Ç –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ö–æ—Ä–ø—É—Å–æ–≤ –∑–∞ –†—É–±–µ–∂–æ–º) *Don Cossack Host *Kuban Cossack Host *Russian All Military Union (–†–û–í–°) **Inner Line *Terek Cossack Host *Brotherhood of Russian Truth *Shanghai Volunteer Corps Political organizations: *Russian Imperial Union-Order (the oldest organization representing the monarchist White Russians) *Constitutional Democratic Party *Union of October 17 *Socialist Revolutionary Party *Russian Social Democratic Labor Party **Mensheviks *Congress of Russian Americans *High Monarchist Union (–í—ã—Å—à–∏–π –ú–æ–Ω–∞—Ä—Ö–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç) *Mladorossi *National Alliance of Russian Solidarists (–ù–¢–°) *Russian All National Popular State Movement (–†–û–ù–î–î) *Union for the Struggle for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia (–°–ë–û–ù–†): founded by \\"second wave\\" √©migr√©s, but also included many White √©migr√©s. *Smenovekhovtsy *All-Russian Fascist Organization *Russian Fascist Organization *Russian Fascist Party **Russian Women's Fascist Movement Youth organizations: *National Organization of Rangers (or \\"Knights\\") (–ù–û–í, –í–∏—Ç—è–∑–∏) *National Association of Russian Explorers (–ù–û–†–†) *National Organization of Russian Scouts (–ù–û–†–°) *Organization of Russian Young Pathfinders (–û–†–Æ–†) *Russian Fascist Party **Fascist Union of Youth **Union of Young Fascists ‚Äì Vanguard (boys) **Union of Young Fascists ‚Äì Vanguard (girls) **Union of Fascist Little Ones *Orthodox Organization of Russian Pathfinders (–ü–û–†–†) *Russian Christian Students Movement (–†–°–•–î) *Russian Sokol (–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π –°–æ–∫–æ–ª) *VSHSON Charitable organizations: *Russian Nobility Association in America *Society for the Relief of Czarist Exiles *The Tolstoy Foundation References *Cohen, Aaron \\"'Our Russian Passport': First World War Monuments, Transnational Commemoration, and the Russian Emigration in Europe, 1918-39\\" pages 627-651 from The Journal of Contemporary History, Vol. 49, No. 4, October 2014. *Fran√ßois Bauchpas, L'√©migration blanche, Paris, 1968 *Karlinsky, Simon Freedom from Violence and Lies: Essays on Russian Poetry and Music, Boston, Academic Studies Press, 2013. *M.

It is the 856th most common surname in the United States. Etymology The first is that the surname Duke and its variant, Dukes, are both derived from the various Middle English words duc, duk, and douc, which all came from the Old French word \\"duc.\\" This ultimately stemmed from the Latin dux, meaning \\"leader,\\" and is a derivative of ducere, \\"to lead.\\" The surname was evidently acquired by someone who was looked upon as a leader, not denoting one of noble birth since many captains or military leaders were titled landholders who would have taken their last names from their estates. The surname Dukes translates literally as \\"Duke's son.\\" Alternatively, it has been suggested by scholars that the surname is simply a shortened form of Marmaduke, which is from the Irish Maelmaedoc, meaning 'servant of Maedoc.' St Maedoc was a Christian missionary in 7th Century Wales and Ireland. As a Plantation surname, it can be found primarily in east Ulster and has been Gaelicised as Di√∫c. References date back to the late twelfth century, with Herbert le Duc, a member of the Knights Templar, using the Gallicized version of the name. From 1190-1191, Roger le Duc was Sheriff of London, and three generations of his family succeeded him in this office. The Pipe rolls for Berkshire refer to Adam Duke in the year 1198, and in 1214 one Henry Dukes is recorded in the Curia Regis rolls for Warwickshire. Dukes Dukes is a patronymic form of the surname Duke that originated in medieval England, of Anglo-Norman origin. The meaning is derived from son or descendant of Duke, which was originally recorded le Duc, a term used to mean \\"leader\\" before it became associated with a specific rank of the nobility. It is an uncommon name; the 2000 United States Census showed it to be the 1,577th most popular surname,namenum.com while the United Kingdom Census of that same year showed it to be the 1,749th most popular.  Earliest usage  The earliest recorded uses of the surname include: *Ralph or Radulphus Dux in 1199, Buckinghamshire, *Arnold de Dukes in 1200, Cambridgeshire, *Henry or Henricus Dukes in 1214, Warwickshire.sourced from the Curia Regis Rolls of Warwickshire History Records indicate nameholders came to England during and in the decades following the Norman Conquest, but its usage became more common in the reign of Richard I and especially in the time of King John. In Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs long reign the surname often appeared among the rolls of her ennobled subjects who were prominently mentioned in the annals of her time. Duke families were also found very early in Ireland. According to O‚ÄôHart‚Äôs Irish Pedigrees, Vol. II, some were residing in County Westmeath in the Fifteenth century. The will of one William Duke, of Kyllenagh, Kildare, recorded 1551, is found in the records at Dublin. After this early date, the family name appears with more or less variation in form, and with increasing frequency upon the pages of the Irish Public Records. Hanna, in his Scotch-Irish Families of Ulster, estimates that there were in 1890 within the province of Ulster 268 persons bearing the name Duke. Thus the Dukes were one of the ancient families of England and of Ireland. They are among the earliest recorded by Burke in his pedigrees of the nobility and of the landed gentry. The first mention made of them by this authority was the aforementioned Roger le Duc, sheriff of London. The names of Duke and Dukes have been well-established in the Americas, with one of the earliest arrivals to New England being one Captain Edward Duke in 1634. Humphrey Dukes sailed to Barbados with his wife and servants in 1630.

Chronology This station was opened on 10 August 1896. It served as the mainline station for taking visitors to the 1901 Glasgow International Exhibition. It was closed to passengers on 4 August 1952 and to freight on 6 July 1964, with the line being closed on 5 October 1964. The building was destroyed by fire in August 1968. Description of the site The line entered the station site in the south east corner passing under Gibson Street next to the River Kelvin and ran alongside the east side of the river until reaching the north west corner when it crossed the river prior to passing under Caledonian Crescent where the station building was located. The goods yard was located to the east of the line, and was converted to a Park and Ride Car Park as part of the Glasgow Subway modernisation in 1976‚Äì1979. The station building was designed by well known Glasgow architect James Miller who designed many other Caledonian Railway stations, including Botanic Gardens which was the next stop on the line. It was in a style similar to other stations designed by Miller at the time. It was destroyed by a fire started by children while abandoned in August 1968.Evening Times, Glasgow, August 1968, held at Mitchell Library The outer walls with some decorative stonework as well as the base of an entrance vestibule with the pattern and fragments of the black and white checked floor tiles remain. Above the station site and mouth of the tunnel is Caledonian Mansions which was built by the Caledonian Railway company on land it purchased for tunnel construction. The company's monogram is still visible on the east side of the mansions on Caledonian Crescent, just uphill from the station site. At the north west corner of the site the formation of the line from the station towards Botanic Gardens passes under Otago Street where the station buildings were located, before entering the tunnel under Great Western Road. It was through the tunnel (at the south of the site) to Stobcross that the River Kelvin flowed when it burst its banks at the site of the station goods yard in December 1994. As part of the flood defence measures put in place, a bank was put in place in front of the tunnel mouth. References  Notes  Sources  * Urquhart, Gordon R. (2000).

Club career Early career Simpson was born in Leith and began his career with local side Leith Amateurs, before joining Division Two side St Bernard's for the start of the 1925-26 season. He scored 12 times in his first seven games for \\"Saints\\" and eventually totalled 33 goals for the season. However, the 1926 General Strike had severe financial ramifications for Scottish lower-league sides, and part way into the 1926-27 season Simpson left St Bernards for English non-league side Kettering Town. At Kettering, Simpson did well, and his break came, strangely, in a game for Kettering, playing against Crystal Palace in an FA Cup First Round tie, in 1928. Though he failed to find the net, Simpson impressed Palace manager Fred Mavin who signed him the following summer. Crystal Palace Simpson made his Crystal Palace debut in the fifth game of the 1929-30 season against Norwich City and scored a hat-trick, and by March of that season, had scored 27 goals in 27 league and cup games. This alerted the big clubs of the time to his talent, and a transfer away from Selhurst Park seemed certain. However, the Palace directors put a huge price- tag on his contract, and no move came. He finished the season, and improved on his record up until March, finally having netted 36 times in 34 games. In the 1930-31 season, he achieved a Palace record, scoring six goals in a 7‚Äì2 win over Exeter City, in a Division Three South fixture. He would go on to score 46 goals that season, a Palace record that still stands. In his first five Palace seasons, Simpson topped the goalscoring charts every time, another unbeaten record. In the 1934-35 season, Simpson suffered a knee injury. After his comeback, Simpson appeared to be inferior to the player he was before. In April 1935, he scored in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Swindon Town which would prove to be his last outing for Palace. He was transferred to West Ham United that summer. His final Palace total was 165 goals, from 195 appearances, a goals-per-game total of 0.85. He also scored 19 hat-tricks for Palace, in four years. His goals and hat-trick totals for Palace are records that are still unbeaten. West Ham United, Reading and Aldershot After two largely un-noteworthy seasons with West Ham, and still not fully recovered from his injury, he left in 1937, moving to Reading. At Elm Park, despite being towards the end of his career, he seemed to regain some form. He would return to Selhurst Park in early 1938 with \\"The Royals\\", and score two of Reading's three goals, to beat \\"The Glaziers\\" 3‚Äì2. Simpson ended his career with a short spell at Aldershot. Biography After his playing career ended, Peter Simpson returned to the Croydon area, taking over a tobacconist's there. He died in Croydon, at the age of sixty-nine. However, though he did not make it into Palace's Centenary XI (possibly because the majority of the voters were more accustomed to the talents of later players, Ian Wright and Andrew Johnson, who played in the top division, rather than a vintage great, such as Simpson), the record books of Crystal Palace F.C., continue to show Simpson's achievements.

Biography Family connections Born in 1563 at Hinton St George, Somerset, he was the youngest son of Robert Cuffe of Donyatt in that county. Of the same family, although the relationship does not seem to have been definitely settled, was Hugh Cuffe, who in 1598 was granted large estates in the county of Cork, and whose grandson Maurice wrote an account of the defence of Ballyalley Castle, co. Clare, when besieged in the rebellion of 1641. Maurice Cuffe's journal was printed by the Camden Society in 1841, and the writer's grandnephew John was created Baron Desart in the Irish peerage in 1733 (the first baron's grandson, Otway Cuffe, became viscount in 1781, and Earl of Desart in 1793, and these titles are still extant). To another branch of the Somerset family of Cuffe belonged Thomas Cuffe of Crych, who went to Ireland in 1641, and whose son James was knighted by Charles II and granted land in Mayo and Galway. In 1797 James Cuffe (d. 1821), in direct line of descent from this Sir James Cuffe, was made Baron Tyrawley of Ballinrobe, County Mayo. Early life After receiving his early education at the grammar school of Hinton St. George, Henry Cuffe was elected at the age of fifteen a scholar of Trinity College, Oxford (25 May 1578) by the interest of Lady Elizabeth Powlett of Hinton, who always showed a kindly regard for his welfare. At Oxford, Cuffe exhibited a conspicuous ability, and became a finished Greek scholar. He attracted the attention of Sir Henry Savile, who aided him in his studies, and about 1582 made the acquaintance of John Hotman, a learned French Protestant in the service of the Earl of Leicester. In 1582 and 1583 he corresponded regularly with Hotman, and some of these letters, which prove strong affection between the writers, are printed in 'Francisci et Joannis Hotomanxorum...Epistolae' (Amsterdam, 1700). Cuffe proceeded B.A. 13 June 1580, and was elected fellow of his college 30 May 1583, but a severe remark about the practical jokes which the founder of Trinity, Sir Thomas Pope, was fond of playing on his friends, led to his expulsion from the college. In 1586, Sir Henry Savile offered him a tutorship at Merton, and there Cuffe pursued his Greek studies with conspicuous success. On 20 Feb 1588/9 he graduated M.A., and after proving his capacity as a teacher of Greek by holding a lectureship at Queen's College, he was in 1590 elected Regius Professor of Greek in the university. This post he held for seven years. He addressed the queen in a Latin speech at Carfax when she visited Oxford in 1592, and was chosen junior proctor 15 April 1594. Very soon afterwards Cuffe abandoned Oxford for London, where he obtained the post of secretary to the Earl of Essex. With Essex Essex employed a number of educated men, who were chiefly engaged in a voluminous foreign correspondence. At the time that Cuffe entered his service, Edward Reynolds, Sir Henry Wotton, Anthony Bacon, and Temple were already members of Essex's household, and the newcomer was described as a 'great philosopher' who could 'suit the wise observations of ancient authors to the transactions of modern times.' He accompanied Essex in the expedition to Cadiz in 1596, and wrote an account of it on his return for publication, but this was prohibited by order of the queen and her council. Anthony Bacon, to whom Cuffe confided the manuscript, succeeded, however, in distributing a few copies. On Essex's acceptance of the lord-lieutenancy of Ireland, Cuffe sailed to Dublin in the earl's company in April 1599. In the following August he visited London to deliver to the queen those important dispatches in which Essex excused himself for his delay in suppressing Tyrone's Rebellion. 'Mr Cuffe,' wrote Rowland White to Sir Robert Sidney (12 Sep 1599), 'hath had access to the queen, who came of purpose marvelously well instructed to answer such objections as her majesty could lay to his [i.e. Essex's] charge, and I hear that Cuffe hath wisely behaved himself to her majesty's better satisfaction' (Sidney Papers). But the royal letter which Cuffe carried back to Essex was not conciliatory, and on 28 Sep, Cuffe accompanied by his master on his sudden visit to London which ended in Essex's imprisonment. During the latter months of the earl's confinement Cuffe appears to have been in continual intercourse with him, and after his release (26 Aug 1600) definitely re-entered his service. He was deeply interested in Essex's reinstatement at court, both on grounds of personal ambition and of affection for his employer, and, now that few friends had access to the earl, was much in his confidence. Rebellion For a man of Essex's temperament he was the worst possible counsellor. He urged him to seek at all hazards an interview with the queen, and argued that Elizabeth would be unable to withhold her favour from him after she had heard from his mouth the story of his grievances and of the animosity with which the Cecils, Raleigh, and others regarded him. He deprecated all compromise with those he regarded as the earl's enemies; taunted Essex with having already submitted voluntarily to many degradations; advised Essex's friends to form an alliance with all political malcontents to make themselves a party to be feared; laid his plans before Sir Henry Neville, who had just been recalled from the French embassy and had grievances against the government; and obtained Essex's consent to communicate with his old friend Sir Charles Danvers. Cuffe had no clear ideas as to the details of his policy, and did not take part in the secret meetings of Essex's friends, whom he had helped to bring together, at Drury House, in November and December 1600. Meanwhile, some of Essex's relatives perceived the evil effect on Essex of Cuffe's maladroit counsels, and they induced him in November to dismiss him from his service. Sir Gilly Merrick, Essex's steward, was ordered to remove him from Essex House. But Cuffe appealed to the good nature of his master's friend, the Earl of Southampton, who readily obtained from Essex a rescission of the order (see Wotton). Cuffe's work was, however, done. He opposed the appeal to force and took no part in the riot in the city of London on Sunday, 8 Feb 1600/1 (see Devereux, Robert, second Earl of Essex), but with Essex and all his allies was thrown into the Tower. When Essex, just before his execution, requested to be confronted with Cuffe in the Tower (21 Feb 1600/1) in the presence of witnesses, he used the words: 'You have been one of the chiefest instigators of me to all these my disloyal courses into which I have fallen.' Trial and execution At the end of February Cuffe answered several questions respecting Essex's negotiations with King James of Scotland which the lords of the council put to him. He appears to have told the truth, but his replies show that he had not managed that part of Essex's correspondence, which was mainly in the hands of Anthony Bacon. Some days before his execution, however, he wrote to Sir Robert Cecil enclosing a copy of instructions which Essex had prepared for presentation to the Earl of Mar, an ambassador to Elizabeth from James, with the object of so poisoning Mar's mind against Cecil and his friends that Mar might communicate suspicion of them to the queen.Yorke, Philip, ed., Miscellaneous State Papers, vol.1 (1778) pp.372‚Äì376. On 2 March 1600/1 Cuffe was twice re-examined, and explained his negotiation with Sir Henry Neville. Three days later he was put on his trial, with Sir Christopher Blount, Sir Charles Danvers, Sir John Davis, and Sir Gilly Merrick. Cuffe and Merrick were not indicted, like the rest, for open acts of violence. Coke, the attorney-general and prosecuting counsel, denounced Cuffe in the strongest terms, and began his address to the court with the remark that he 'was the arrantest traitor that ever came to that bar,' 'the very seducer of the earl,' and 'the cunning coiner of all plots.' Cuffe replied that he had wished to see his master recalled to the queen's favour, but that was the limit of his desire and action. On the day of the rebellion he never left Essex House. Coke thereupon said that he would give him 'a cuff that should set him down,' and read extracts from Essex's and Sir Henry Neville's confessions. Sir Charles Danvers' confession was also put in, and it was stated that, in case of the plot succeeding, Cuffe had been promised the speakership in the next parliament. The jury returned a verdict of guilty against all the prisoners. Cuffe asked for the companionship of a divine before he was executed. On 13 March Merrick and Cuffe were drawn to Tyburn. Cuffe began a speech admitting his guilt while denying many of the charges brought against him. The authorities twice interrupted him, and on the second occasion he 'began to apply himself to his devotions, which he managed with a great deal of fervor,' and was 'dispatched by the executioner' (State Trials, i. 1410‚Äì1451). Bacon in the official 'Declaration of the Treasons,' 1601, describes Cuffe as 'a base fellow by birth, but a great scholar, and indeed a noble traitor by the book, being otherwise of a turbulent and mutinous spirit against all superiors.' Francis Osborn, in his 'Advice to a Son,' illustrates by Cuffe's career his warning 'Mingle not your interest with a great one's.' Works In 1607 an editor who signed himself R.M. dedicated to Robert, lord Willoughby and Eresby, a short philosophical and scientific tract by Cuffe.The Differences of the Ages of Man's Life: together with the Originall Causes, Progresse, and End thereof. Written by the learned Henrie Cuffe, sometime fellow of Merton College, Oxford, An.Dom. 1600...London. Printed by Arnold Hatfield for Martin Clarke, 1607. Other editions appeared in 1638 and 1640. Cuffe here shows wide reading in the writings of the Greek philosophers; a belief in astrology, and faith in a divine providence. In Cott. MS. Nero D. x. is 'De Rebus Gestis in sancto concilio Nicaeno,' a translation attributed to Cuffe from the Greek of Gelasius Cyzicenus. In Harl. MS. 1327, fol. 58, are to be found Aphorismes Political, gathered out of the Life and End of that most noble Robert Devereux, Earle of Essex, not long before his death, a work which is also ascribed to Cuffe. Cuffe assisted Columbanus in his edition (p. 2, Florence, 1598) of Longus's Pastoral of Daphnis and Chloe, and contributed six Greek elegiacs to William Camden's Britannia.

The painting is presumed to have been commissioned by Niccol√≤ Aurelio, a secretary to the Venetian Council of Ten, whose coat of arms appears on the sarcophagus or fountain, to celebrate his marriage to a young widow, Laura Bagarotto.Robertson G. Renaissance Studies, Volume 2, Number 2, June 1988, pp. 268-279(12) Honour, Love and Truth, an Alternative Reading of Titian's Sacred and Profane Love. Jaff√©, 92 It perhaps depicts a figure representing the bride dressed in white, sitting beside Cupid and accompanied by the goddess Venus.Essentially the identification proposed by Charles Hope in a paper of 1976. See Puttfarken, 146. The title of the painting is first recorded in 1693, when it was listed in an inventory as ' (Divine love and Profane love), and may not represent the original concept at all.Jaff√©, 92; Brilliant, 78; Brown, 239 Although \\"much ink has been spilt by art historians attempting to decipher the iconography of the painting\\", and some measure of consensus has been achieved, basic aspects of the intended meaning of the painting, including the identity of the central figures, remain disputed.Jaff√©, 92 quoted; Puttfarken, 147; Brilliant, 75-80 Description Two women, who appear to be modelled on the same person, sit on a carved Ancient Roman sarcophagus that has been converted to a water-trough, or a trough made to look like a Roman sarcophagus; the broad ledges here are not found in actual sarcophagi. How the water enters is unclear, but it leaves through a phallic- looking brass spout between the two women, next to an anachronistic coat of arms in the carving. This belongs to Niccol√≤ Aurelio, whose presence in the picture is probably also represented by the spout.Jaff√©, 92; Brilliant, 75; Brown, 238 Between the two women is a small winged boy, who may be Cupid, son and companion of Venus, or merely a putto. He is looking intently into the water, and splashing a hand in it. The woman on the left is fully and richly dressed; her clothes are now usually recognized as those of a bride,Jaff√©, 94; Brown, 239-242 though in the past they have been said to be typical of courtesan wear. In her hair she wears myrtle, both a flower sacred to Venus and one worn by brides.Jaff√©, 94; Brown, 240 In contrast, the woman on the right is nude except for a white cloth over her loins and a large red mantle worn over one shoulder. It was generally recognised by the 20th century that, somewhat contrary to a natural first impression, if the painting indeed represented figures along the lines of Sacred and Profane Love, the clothed figure was \\"profane love\\", and the nude one \\"sacred love\\".Wind, 142-143 The nude figure sits comfortably on the ledge of the trough, with one hand resting on it and the other held high, holding a vessel with smoke coming out of it, probably an incense-burner. In contrast the pose of the clothed figure, apparently poised and relaxed, becomes rather strange in the lower part of her body when considered carefully, \\"the lower half of the bride's body is lost in her drapery and does not conform with her upper half\\".Jaff√©, 94 The ledge seems too high for her to be sitting on it properly, and her knees are wide apart. Perhaps she is actually sitting on something else beside the trough, or this may just be one of a number of lapses in depicting anatomy found in Titian's early career. The clothed woman leans over, but is probably not supported by, a metal bowl whose contents have been described in various ways, despite it not being possible to see them. Another shallow metal bowl is on the ledge, nearer the nude figure; some have proposed a meaning for the decoration inside the bowl, such as the arms of Aurelio's bride, but this does not seem to be the case on close examination, after the picture was cleaned.Jaff√©, 93; Brown, 240, 242-243, who believes the clothed Venus is the \\"heavenly\\" one, and the nude the \\"Earthly Venus\\". It would be convenient if the arms were there, as an early objection to the marriage picture theory was that \\"allusion to a marriage would require two coats of arms, not one\\".Wind, 150, note 35. The carved scenes on the front face of the trough/sarcophagus do not yet have a generally agreed reading.Brown, 242-243; Brilliant, 78-79 They were described by Edgar Wind as \\"A man is being scourged, a woman dragged by the hair, and an unbridled horse is led away by the mane\\", all perhaps images of the taming of the passions.Wind, 145 (quoted) to 147 Alternatively they have been seen as (reading right to left): Adam and Eve standing beside the Tree of Knowledge, Cain killing Abel, and the Conversion of Saint Paul, shown falling off his horse.DeStefano By 1914 they had been claimed to derive from scenes in five different literary works, ancient and modern,Brilliant, 79. In reverse date order of the suggestion: Ovid, Statius, Virgil, Boiardo, Gaius Valerius Flaccus. reflecting the 19th-century taste for finding literary sources for paintings. They have been connected with the woodcut illustrations to Francesco Colonna's Hypnerotomachia Poliphili (published in Venice in 1499). The landscape on the left, behind the clothed woman, goes uphill to a what seems to be a walled castle or village dominated by a high defensive tower. There are two rabbits nearby, usually symbols of fecundity or lust in the Renaissance. The landscape behind the unclothed figure stretches downhill, with a village dominated by a church tower and steeple on the far side of water. Two men on horses are hunting a hare or outsized rabbit with fast lurcher-type dogs, and a flock of sheep are apparently tended by a shepherd, with a pair of lovers sitting nearby.Jaff√©, 94; Brown, 238, 243; Brilliant, 75-76 Meaning Detail of the nude woman There have been a number of conflicting interpretations of the painting. Their starting point is to identify the purpose of the painting, which most interpretations in recent decades see as commemorating a marriage. Next the figures, who seem physically identical, but whose clothing is so different, need to be assigned identities, at which point agreement ends. While the trend in recent years has been to downplay complicated and obscure explanations of the iconography of paintings by Titian (and other Venetian painters), in this case no straightforward interpretation has been found, and scholars remain more ready to consider allegorical alternatives of some complexity,Puttfarken, 147; Brilliant, 79-80 and to consider that \\"some paintings are enigmatic, even ambiguous ab initio, and no meaning derived from, or assigned to them, can ever be definitive\\".Brilliant, 80 Titian would probably not have devised a complicated allegorical meaning himself; it has been suggested that the Renaissance humanist scholar Cardinal Pietro Bembo, or a similar figure, may have devised the allegorical scheme.Jaff√©, 92-94 Scholars have proposed several identifications of the figures, and analyses and interpretations which largely flow from these. The concept of Geminae Veneres or \\"Twin Venuses\\", a dual nature in Venus, was well developed in both classical thought and Renaissance Neoplatonism, with the earthly Aphrodite Pandemos, representing carnal love and beauty, and the heavenly Aphrodite Urania representing a higher and more spiritual love, using the classical terms for the figures. Erwin Panofsky and others found both in the painting, with the earthly Venus the nude one.Brown, 239-241; DeStefano quotes chunks of Panofsky. Others see the clothed figure as representing the bride (idealized, and not a portrait, which would have been rather indecorous in Venice), and only the nude figure representing Venus. For Edgar Wind the theme was \\"an initiation of Beauty [at left] into Love\\".Wind, 148 It has also been suggested that the painting asserts by allegory the innocence of Laura Bagarotto's father, who had been executed by the Republic of Venice for treason in 1509. In this interpretation the contents of the urn beside the clothed woman are the ashes of the bride's father, and the naked figure is Venus as Truth, and/or Charity. Although the first record of a version of what is now the usual title is only in an inventory of 1693,Brilliant, 75-80. On p. 78 he lists a number of titles the work has been given it remains possible that the two female figures are indeed intended to be personifications of the Neoplatonic concepts of sacred and profane love. The art historian Walter Friedl√§nder outlined similarities between the painting and Francesco Colonna's Hypnerotomachia Poliphili and proposed that the two figures represented Polia and Venere, the two female characters in the 1499 romance. Style The composition has elements also found in the works of Titian's former master or colleague Giorgione, an immensely influential Venetian painter who died very young in 1510, but the painting is generally agreed to show that Titian's own style had developed into a maturity that allows no confusion with his old rival. While many works of the previous few years have been disputed between the two artists, there is no question of that here. Titian shows \\"entire clarity and consistency of purpose, and certainty in the selection of artistic means. After a decade of search in multiple and sometimes contradictory directions, Titian has settled for the basic proposition of classical style that had been expounded by Giorgione, but with precise self-knowledge of the differences of personality and vision ‚Äî and, not least, of hand ‚Äî with which could interpret it.\\"Freedburg, 147-148 A religious painting of the same period, that has many similarities in style is the Noli me tangere, probably also of 1514 (National Gallery), in which Titian uses much the same group of buildings as at the left here, but reversed and without the tower. These develop from the group in the Dresden Venus.Jaff√©, 86 In Titian's Jacopo Pesaro being presented by Pope Alexander VI to Saint Peter (probably before 1512, Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp) Saint Peter is enthroned above a painting of a classical relief which can be compared to the one here in size, complexity, and its uncertain subject-matter.Jaff√©, 78-79 History The work was bought in 1608 by Cardinal Scipione Borghese, nephew of Pope Paul V and a major collector and patron of art. It is now kept with other works from the Borghese collection in the Galleria Borghese in Rome. Painting materials The painting was analyzed in 2000 by a variant of x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy which made it possible to identify the pigments used by Titian. The analysis identified lead white, azurite, lead-tin yellow, vermilion and yellow ochre.R. Klockenkamper, A. von Bohlen and L.

The year after leaving the Black Hawk in 1954, Wyands was an intermission performer at another San Francisco club, before becoming music director for vocalist Ella Fitzgerald during a 3-month period in 1956. For ten months around 1957, he was accompanist to pop singers in a club in Ottawa, Canada. Following this, he toured with vocalist Carmen McRae for three months, and arrived in New York with her in 1958. In New York, he played with Roy Haynes, Charles Mingus (1959), Jerome Richardson (1959), and Gigi Gryce. In the 1960s Wyands was a member of Illinois Jacquet's band.

New features The game includes updated graphics, new courses, and other new features. The \\"Game Face\\" feature has been vastly improved with more detail and customization available for each body part, and after designing their own golfer, players can choose from 3000 items in the \\"Pro Shop\\" which allows players to purchase new clothing, clubs, balls, gloves, and other golf-related miscellanea. However, many items are locked at the start of the game, and the player must complete certain tasks to unlock these items. The \\"Game Setup\\" in the options menu has been changed vastly, to allow the player to choose their swing style. Another new feature allows players to choose the classic control settings or a newer swing style. There is also the new \\"Speed Golf\\" setting, which allows players to skip to the next shot after the ball has been struck without watching where the ball lands. Game modes Screenshot from the PSP version of the game Seven new game modes have been added (One-Ball, Team One-Ball, no balls, Bloodsome, Greensome, Elimination and Team balls black balls). Real time events Several of the older game modes have been improved, such as the \\"Real Time Event Calendar\\" which allows the player to play special events on different days of the year based on their system's internal clock. This has replaced the classic \\"Scenario Mode\\" but there is now a Real Time Event for every day of the year. Greensome/Bloodsome Two new types of traditional game mode have been added this year, \\"greensome\\" and \\"bloodsome\\". In \\"greensome\\", two teams of two golfers both hit their golf balls from the tee, but after that, only one of the balls is played (this is the team captain's choice). Players will then alternate shots with the chosen ball until it is holed. The game of \\"bloodsome\\" has similar rules, with the exception that the opposing team chooses which ball is played. The scoring system uses match play rules. Team tour The \\"Team Tour\\" mode allows players using their own created golfers to build up their own team to travel the world playing in different types of game modes until they reach the final match against Tiger Woods' team. With each victory, the player is allowed more golfers to be added to their team. The golfers that are available are the golfers that they have just beaten. In each round, the player may also \\"Up the Ante\\" to gain extra experience and free modifiers if they win under specific circumstances; for example, the \\"Beat The Spread\\" option for Match Play games starts the opponent 4UP (see match play rules below), and the \\"Without a Net\\" option means that if the ball goes in the water or out of bounds, the player instantly loses. Team Tour is the quickest way to gain experience. Stroke Play Stroke play is in the \\"Traditional Game Modes\\" section. Stroke Play allows up to 4 players to compete on a round of 9 or 18 holes on any chosen course with variable difficulty settings (tee color, pin location etc.). All golfers use their own ball. The player numbers determine who tees off first on the first hole, but after the first hole, the player with the lowest score tees off first, then the second lowest score and so on. After the initial tee shot, the player furthest from the hole takes their shot next. However many shots or \\"strokes\\" the player takes is recorded on the scorecard after each hole. Match play A modified version of stroke play with the exception that the winner of each hole goes \\"1UP\\" depending on their current score. For example, on the first hole, the score will be \\"AS\\" (All Square), but the player that wins the hole will then score 1 hole, and their score will change to \\"1UP\\", meaning that player is winning by one hole. The game continues until either player wins enough holes that the other player(s) cannot win. If there is a situation where a player is the same number up as there are holes remaining (for example, 5UP with 5 holes to play), they are declared to be \\"Dormie X\\" (where X is the number of holes that player is winning by). Once a player is Dormie, the other player must then win every remaining hole to force Sudden Death, or else the player who is \\"Dormie\\" wins the match. If a hole is tied, the player who is \\"Dormie\\" wins, although the score does not change. Skillzone The Skillzone was introduced in Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003; it features 3 unique areas which have 15 targets in each. The player can compete in various games in these areas for extra money to buy items from the pro shop. The three courses available are: Granite Pass, Diablo Valley, and The Roof. The various game modes each have their own rules which players must abide by. The game types are: *Target: The player begins with 15 balls to hit as many of the targets as possible. Successive hits on the targets results in cash being earned and more balls being given. *Target2Target: A variation of \\"Target\\". The computer randomly picks a target which the player must hit. The same rules as \\"Target\\" apply. *Capture: This game mode requires 2 human players. The players alternate turns to hit targets and earn money. The first player to hit 5 targets wins. However, a player can \\"steal\\" a target by landing on the target closer to the bullseye than the opponent. *T-I-G-E-R: A variation of the classic \\"Horse\\". The player hits a target, and their opponent must match the score (same ring on the particular target) or beat it. The first player to fail to do so receives a letter, and the first to spell \\"Tiger\\" loses. Skills 18 This game mode was only introduced in Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06, so it is one of the most recent additions. The player chooses a course and difficulty settings to play on before beginning. On each hole there are 3 hovering rings; a large green ring, a medium-sized yellow ring, and a small red ring. The player must attempt to hit their ball through these rings while maintaining a good score (Birdies, Eagles etc.). The harder the ring, the more points it is worth. Hitting the ball through more than one ring in a single shot results in bonus points being awarded. Shootout mode Shootout Mode is entirely different from any of the other game modes. Before the match begins, 2 or more players pick up to 8 golfers per team on 2 teams. These teams then play against each other in stroke play format on each hole of the chosen course. The loser of the hole is eliminated from the match, and the next player in their team takes their place, while the winner keeps playing until he/she is defeated. If players tie on a hole, both players advance to the next hole. One-ball/team one-ball In One-Ball, as the name suggests, both players will use only one ball, and will alternate shots with it until the ball is holed. Whoever sinks the ball will win the hole. Although the player is allowed to make it more difficult for their opponent by striking the ball into an undesirable position such as a bunker, the rough, etc., the shot must travel at least half of the distance to the hole on each stroke. If the player fails to do this, he or she will be marked with a \\"Betrayal,\\" and will lose one turn. Similarly, if a player hits the ball out of bounds, he or she will be penalized with a \\"Double Betrayal,\\" and will lose two consecutive turns. This gives the gameplay a tactical twist, in that the players are typically trying to make the worst legal shot possible. Additionally, a player must carefully decide when to finally attack the hole, since a narrowly missed putt or chip-in can set up the opponent for an easy hole. Team-One Ball is played in the same format, but uses two teams of two golfers each. Bestball/fourball These are both 2-team, 4-player (mix of human and CPU players is allowed) games. All four players play all of their balls for the hole, in the same style as what would be if it was a 4-player Stroke Play match. The best scoring golfer on each team's score will be applied in either Stroke or Match play. PGA tour season mode General The PGA Tour Season Mode allows players to play in various tournaments across a 30-year career, using their own created golfer. Each tournament is 72 holes (4 rounds) played at different courses, usually determined by the name of the event (e.g. \\"The Pebble Beach Open\\" or \\"The UK Major Championship\\"). The game mode is designed to be as realistic as possible, with players able to view the scoreboard after each hole, which shows the scores for each round, how many holes the golfer has played in the current round and the total number of strokes they have taken. Guests & the cut The player whose profile is being used may \\"invite\\" other human players into the tournaments as guests, but this is only possible in the first round, and the guests must play all four rounds, they cannot skip a round, however, the profile's owner (the profile whose PGA Tour Season Mode it is) can choose to \\"Cut\\" the guest (remove them from the tournament) before any round. Note that guests cannot receive trophies, earn FedEx Cup points or improve their PGA Tour Ranking while playing as a guest. After the second round of a tournament, only the Top 70 golfers in the tournament advance, the rest are cut. Requirements Some tournaments have specific entry requirements such as \\"Top 20 PGA Tour Ranked Players Only\\" - if the player does not meet the requirement, they are not allowed to participate in that tournament and the first round will be locked, preventing entry. Match play tournaments Some tournaments such as the Australian Challenge and the EA Match Play Championship are played against an opponent with match play rules, and guests cannot be invited into match play tournaments. \\"Game Face\\" and \\"My Team\\" menus \\"Game Face\\" The \\"Game Face\\" menu has been combined with a new \\"My Team\\" option which allows players to modify their skills, buy equipment from the pro shop, change the animations their golfer uses, and change their team's logo, name and uniform. However, initially, the player must design his/her custom golfer using the game face option from the main menu. The Game Face feature has been greatly improved, and now the player must customize everything, from muscles on the arms and length of the legs to the smallest detail of wrinkles or the bridge of the nose. The new system also allows players to create the way their golfer looks in terms of body part size, muscle, fat, feature positioning (face) and the overall height. \\"My Team\\" On entering the \\"Game Face\\" option and selecting a golfer that has already been created, the player is faced with the \\"My Team\\" menu which shows the team's name and logo at the top of the screen, as well as four portraits of members of the player's current team. The portrait of the created golfer also features several menu options including (in no particular order): My Skills, My Appearance, My Animations, Pro Shop, Team Name, Team Logo & Team Uniform. Each of these different menu commands takes the player to different parts of the \\"My Team\\" area. *My Skills: This option goes to the stats screen, where the player can view and edit their stats, as well as check their current experience and any equipped modifiers. *My Appearance: This option accesses the \\"Game Face\\" tool to allow the player to make any more changes to the way their golfer looks. Height, size and details can all be changed here just as they could be in the initial character creation. *My Animations: This option allows the player to choose what their golfer does after a good hole such as scoring Birdie or Eagle, what the golfer does after scoring Bogey or worse, and allows the player to buy a new swing style, or customize their own unique swing. Note that customized swings cannot contain modifiers, while most of the swings available to purchase have one level one power modifier. *Pro Shop: The pro shop contains (when everything is unlocked) a total of 3000 items in different categories ranging from Shirts and Pants to Clubs, Gloves and Balls. *Team Name: This allows the player to name their team. As with the player name, there is an 8-character limit. *Team Logo: This allows the player to choose a logo from a long list of pre-made logos or design their own, and even edit pre-made logos with an advanced designing tool that allows players to create almost any image. *Team Uniform: This section allows the player to choose what other members of their team as well as the player will wear. This is somewhat basic, the only option here is to choose the colour of the shirt that the players' teammate(s) will wear. Experience points and stats By playing in certain game types, the player earns experience points represented by gold markers on the left of the screen. Performing different actions earns different types of experience, for example, hitting a long drive will yield Power experience, while sinking a long putt will give Concentration experience. To use the experience points they have earned, players must go into the Game Face/My Team section and select the option \\"My Skills\\" - this section shows what level the player's stats currently are, how much experience they need to advance to the next level and how much experience they have. If the player has enough experience in either a particular stat, or a combination of that stat and \\"General\\" experience, they are allowed to increase the stat level by one. The roster Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 features an extensive roster of 53 golfers, 21 of which are real, and the other 32 are fictional golfers designed by EA. Many fictional golfers from previous games return in Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07, including as Edwin Masterson, Takeharu Moto and Moa Ta'a Vatu. Reception Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 received \\"mixed or average\\" and \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Detroit Free Press gave the Xbox 360 version a score of three stars out of four and stated that \\"The one real knock is that it takes a while for the screen to load in between holes. Also, a large grid that appears when you putt clunks up the play and takes away from the detailed graphics.\\" Charles Herold of The New York Times gave the Wii version a positive reception, saying, \\"I actually got the best results when I sat on my couch and swung the remote from side to side, which generally resulted in straight, powerful drives. But I just didn‚Äôt feel right playing the game that way; I‚Äôm sure Tiger Woods wouldn‚Äôt approve.\\" The A.V. Club gave the same version a B and said, \\"Every golf and back-injury enthusiast should give this a try. The controls will aggravate for a while, but with enough practice, they're a non-issue.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald, however, gave the game a score of three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, \\"The Xbox 360 version Icon tested features 12 beautifully recreated courses, astonishingly realistic player animation and convincing crowds that even react when you hit a wayward drive in their direction.\\" Notes References External links * Category:2006 video games Category:EA Sports games Category:Golf video games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:Tiger Woods video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in Australia Category:Video games set in California Category:Video games set in Canada Category:Video games set in Florida Category:Video games set in Hawaii Category:Video games set in Ireland Category:Video games set in Japan Category:Video games set in Nevada Category:Video games set in North Carolina Category:Video games set in Ohio Category:Video games set in Oregon Category:Video games set in Scotland Category:Video games set in South Carolina Category:Video games set in Texas Category:Video games set in Washington (state) Category:Wii games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox games Category:Xbox 360 games ","title":"Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07"},{"id":"7125352","text":"Remains of the station in 1970 Botanic Gardens railway station was a railway station serving the Botanic Gardens located in the Kelvinside area in the West End of Glasgow. History The station was opened on 10 August 1896 by the Glasgow Central Railway.Butt, page 40 The station building was on ground level, and the platforms were underground, beneath the Glasgow Botanic Gardens. It was closed between 1 January 1917 and 2 March 1919 due to wartime economy, and closed permanently to passengers on 6 February 1939, with the line being closed on 5 October 1964. Architecture The station building was an ornate red brick structure with two towers sporting a clock and Caledonian Railway monogram, topped by domes reminiscent of a Russian orthodox church. The extant, but disused, station building at Possil is of a similar design. It was a well-known landmark along Great Western Road and was designed by the renowned Glasgow railway architect of the period, James Miller.Worsdall (1981), \\"Botanic Gardens Station, 740 Great Western Road\\". Page 142. Miller also designed the next station on the line at Kelvinbridge and went on to design the main buildings for the 1901 Glasgow International Exhibition in nearby Kelvingrove Park and the interiors of the famous Clyde-built ocean liners, the RMS Lusitania in 1907 and RMS Aquitania in 1914. Use following closure The building was converted into shops after the station's 1939 closure and by the late 1960s was occupied by a popular caf√© called 'The Silver Slipper', a nightclub called 'Sgt. Peppers' and a plumbers shop, 'Morton's'. It was ravaged by fire on the night of 22 March 1970.http://www.rockingscots.co.uk/other.htmhttp://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSA01240 Destruction by fire Local Glasgow newspapers, the Evening Times and the Evening Citizen, of 23 March 1970 stated the fire started after a 'Battle of the Bands' contest had been held in the nightclub and it was likely someone had left a cigarette burning in the attic as it was primarily the roof space that had burned resulting in the decision of the Fire Brigade to pull down the two domed towers for safety reasons the following day. The cafe owner's German Shepherd dog died of smoke inhalation but no humans were injured. Despite the outer walls of the building remaining intact and the damage confined largely to the roof area, the decision was taken by the then Glasgow Corporation not to undertake repairs and instead to completely demolish the building. At the time of the fire, plans were being considered to demolish the building as part of a controversial scheme to widen Great Western Road and this might lie behind the decision not to repair the building despite its prominent and recognisable presence in the West End for seventy-four years and its housing of three viable local businesses. Today The site of Botanic Gardens Station remains derelict to this day, over forty years after the fire. The platforms still remain underground where they can be seen from above through still open air vents in the Botanic Gardens, and the floor of the building is still visible within the fenced-off section of the gardens marking where it stood. The platforms are accessible via the tunnel portal at the Kirklee end of the Gardens. An abandoned tramway kiosk designed in the same style as the building and built in 1903 is still present at the site. The site is heavily overgrown, vandalised and dilapidated and is considered dangerous to enter.Urquhart, Chapter on West End Railways Redevelopment In September 2007, it was reported plans were under consideration to redevelop the site as a Bar/Restaurant/Nightclub/Exhibition Space and miniature railway which would involve completely rebuilding the station building to its original design on its footprint. The plans were met with considerable opposition from local people who organised a campaign group largely objecting to the idea of a nightclub appearing in a tranquil place like the Gardens. It was reported on 17 April 2008 that the campaign against the plans had been successful and Glasgow City Council had abandoned the plans. There are no current plans to redevelop the site.

They are found in the sweat glands, mammary glands, lacrimal glands, and salivary glands. Myoepithelial cells in these cases constitute the basal cell layer of an epithelium that harbors the epithelial progenitor. In the case of wound healing, myoepithelial cells reactively proliferate.

Byrne (1864‚Äì1938)Edward Abraham Byrne (1864‚Äì1938) was an American civil engineer responsible for the construction of a number of bridges in the boroughs of New York. He was of Irish descent. Biography Byrne was born in New York, N. Y., on January 27, 1864, the son of Frederick John and Susan Mary (Power) Byrne, and the descendant of an old New York family of Irish heritage. Educated in the Public Schools of the city, he was graduated from the College of the City of New York in 1884. Engineering career Edward Byrne began his civil engineering career in 1886 with the New York City Aqueduct Commission on the construction of the Croton Water Supply System. It is of interest that on this project he met Robert Ridgway, who also was destined to become a distinguished engineer and an outstanding civil servant. From 1889 to the close of 1897, Byrne worked on highways and bridges for the old Department of Public Works of New York City. On January 1, 1898, he joined the Department of Bridges and began a striking and noteworthy service which ended in November, 1933, with his resignation from the position of Chief Engineer of the Department of Plant and Structures (the successor of the Bridge Department), in order to assume the duties of Chief Engineer of the Triborough Bridge. His thirty-six years of service in the Department of Bridges, and its successor, the Department of Plant and Structures, may be divided into two periods. Hunterspoint Avenue Bridge 1898 - 1911 Borden Avenue Bridge During this period, he was in charge of bridge construction and maintenance, supervising the construction of the Willis Avenue Bridge over the Harlem River, the Vernon Avenue Bridge, the Borden Avenue and Hunters Point Bridges over Dutch Kills, and the old bridge over Flushing River. 1912 onwards The second period began with his assumption of the office of Deputy Chief Engineer in 1912, followed by his appointment as Chief Engineer in 1915. At the close of World War I, the Department of Plant and Structures began a period of intense activity which was cut short only by the Great Depression of 1930. Not less than fifteen new bridges of major importance, of which ten were of the bascule type, were built in this period. In addition, under Byrne's direction, the Department designed and constructed a number of large incinerator plants and many other structures for the several departments of the City. He increased the capacity of the Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges over the East River by the construction of additional vehicular roadways on their upper decks. =Triborough Bridge= Byrne was greatly preoccupied with the study of traffic facilities. As far back as 1916 he conceived the idea of the Triborough Bridge to link the Boroughs of Manhattan, Bronx, and Queens. He fostered this idea until he thought the time was ripe for its materialization. The actual work on the foundations and anchorages was begun in 1929 under his direction, while Chief Engineer of the Department of Plant and Structures.Aerial View of the Proposed Triborough Bridge - Planned by Edward A. Byrne - January, 1927 Then, in November, 1933, upon the organization of the Triborough Bridge Authority, he became its first Chief Engineer. There is no doubt that Byrne looked upon the construction of the Triborough Bridge as the culmination of his career, but he was forced to relinquish his post in February, 1934, only several months after he had entered upon it with such high anticipation. Primarily, Byrne was an engineer and executive, and because of character, integrity, and devotion, held his position, independent of politics, throughout successive administrations. The administration headed by Fiorello H. La Guardia assumed the Mayor's office on January 1, 1934, with a mandate for a \\"clean sweep\\", and the complete reorganization of the Triborough Bridge Authority was among the changes which followed. \\"It is fitting that credit for the initiation of the Triborough Bridge should be accorded Edward Byrne\\". *Newspaper Article from The New York Sun (dated July 11th, 1936) *Letter to the Editor of The New York Sun (dated July 16th, 1936) *Letter to the Editor of The New York Sun (dated July 20th, 1936) =Other New York City Projects= Another instance of Byrne's active concern with traffic facilities is his advocacy of a vehicular tunnel from the Battery to Hamilton Avenue, in Brooklyn, N. Y., by way of Governors Island. He prepared preliminary plans for this project which was an exceedingly live story in 1939. In 1929, also, he prepared preliminary plans and estimates for a vehicular tunnel under the East River from Manhattan Island at Thirty-eight Street to the Borough of Queens. Personal life Edward Byrne was married to Elizabeth Mary Dillon in 1902. She died in 1912, leaving him two young sons. Byrne did not remarry. He participated in the lives of his children until they were safely through college. Byrne was deeply religious and loyally attached to the Roman Catholic Church. He possessed power, energy, and a driving force which overcame apparently unsurmountable obstacles. The uncompromising integrity with which he conducted his responsible office was felt throughout his department. Beneath an exterior which years of command and responsibility had rendered somewhat stern, he fostered a kindly, generous, and charitable disposition ‚Äì always ready with help and sympathy for fellow humans in distress. His engineers will remember the pleasure he derived from the genial luncheon intermissions when out on some job. No matter how serious the business might have been, Byrne would relax completely and, with a generosity which became proverbial, play the host to his party. He was fond of the theater, particularly musical comedy, and delighted in attending football games and other sports. When his sons were at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, he attended religiously all the Notre Dame games, enthusiastically supporting them as any undergraduate. Edward Byrne died in Rye, New York, on December 6, 1938, at the home of his son Edward. He was buried in Calvary Cemetery, in Queens, Long Island, and thus his last ride was over the bridge which played so great a part in the drama of his last years. At the time, he was survived by two sons, Edward and George Dillon; and by two granddaughters, Elizabeth and Barbara Byrne, the children of Edward.  Professional associations Byrne was a Consulting Engineer of the New York State Bridge and Tunnel Commission, and of the Camden-Philadelphia Bridge. He was a Past- President of the Society of Municipal Engineers of New York; a Past-President of the Kings County Chapter of the New York State Society of Professional Engineers a member of the Brooklyn Engineers Club, and of the Catholic Club. He was a trustee of the Greenpoint Savings Bank. Byrne was elected a Member of the ASCE on April 16, 1918.

Their athletic mascot is the Falcon. The school has almost 200 classes, and over 2,000 students. The school, along with Davenport Central and Davenport North, make up the three traditional high schools of the Davenport Community School District (DCSD). West was built in the 1960s and the current principal is Cory Williams. In addition to portions of Davenport, the school serves Buffalo, Blue Grass, and almost all of Walcott. \\\\- West High School detail map Facilities The school has been undergoing renovations as a part of continued district-wide remodeling after approval of a 1% Local Option Sales Tax, as well as continuing a Physical Plant and Equipment Levy. Science classrooms are set to be remodeled this summer (2007). A YMCA partnered with the school district was built in 2003 attached to the high school. The facility is open to the public as well as providing facilities to P.E. classes. The YMCA took over management and maintenance of the school's swimming pool when it opened. The school is attached to a YMCA branch with weight room, gymnasium with two full basketball courts, two racquetball courts, and a swimming pool which is available for use by both the public and West gym classes. The swimming pool was existing and taken over by the Y when it was built in 2003. The school's gymnasium has two full basketball courts as well as a weight training room. The gymnasium floor was recently resurfaced as a part of ongoing renovations. The school has a practice football field and track on campus along with a separate field used by the band. The school shares district-owned Brady Street Stadium with Davenport Central and North for football and track and field events. Soccer games are held at city-owned Davenport Soccer Complex. Golf meets are held at nearby city-owned Emeis Municipal Golf Course. Baseball and Softball games are held at the district- owned West High Sports Complex, an off campus baseball park that was built as a part of the ongoing renovations district-wide. The school's cafeteria was remodeled in 2006 to bring it to a style similar to the food court style being used by Davenport North High School, which received national recognition when it was featured on ABC's 20-20. The \\"Falcon's Perch\\" features a variety of food choices, a variety of caf√© style beverages, round tables, and automatic compacting trash cans. Members of the school's Student Senate worked with architects toward the end of the previous year to help design the look and feel of the new cafeteria, according to the Beak 'n' Eye, the school newspaper. The library was moved from the upstairs of the building to the main level into a newly renovated media center in 2001. The new library has four computer labs as well. The building offices were remodeled in 2001 as well as the main entrance. Academics The school offers a number of College Board certified Advanced Placement courses, including AP English, AP Calculus AB, AP Chemistry, and AP Biology. The school has an average of 20.3 on the ACT exams, below the district average of 21.0. The school was placed on the Schools in Need of Assistance watch list under the No Child Left Behind Act in 2005. However, scores have risen from 52.6 percent proficiency that year to 67.8 percent proficiency in 2006. Scores are still being analyzed for the 2006-07 school year; however, initial findings show another increase in proficiency.

In the Southern Hemisphere, the monsoon trough associated with the Australian monsoon reaches its most southerly latitude in February, oriented along a west-northwest/east- southeast axis. Effect of wind surges Increases in the relative vorticity, or spin, with the monsoon trough are normally a product of increased wind convergence within the convergence zone of the monsoon trough. Wind surges can lead to this increase in convergence. A strengthening or equatorward movement in the subtropical ridge can cause a strengthening of a monsoon trough as a wind surge moves towards the location of the monsoon trough. As fronts move through the subtropics and tropics of one hemisphere during their winter, normally as shear lines when their temperature gradient becomes minimal, wind surges can cross the equator in oceanic regions and enhance a monsoon trough in the other hemisphere's summer.Chih-Lyeu Chen.

Since the monsoon trough is an area of convergence in the wind pattern, and an elongated area of low pressure at the surface, the trough focuses low level moisture and is defined by one or more elongated bands of thunderstorms when viewing satellite imagery. Its abrupt movement to the north between May and June is coincident with the beginning of the monsoon regime and rainy seasons across South and East Asia.

In tropical cyclogenesis Months of peak tropical cyclone activity worldwide A monsoon trough is a significant genesis region for tropical cyclones. Vorticity-rich low level environments, with significant low level spin, lead to a better than average chance of tropical cyclone formation due to their inherent rotation. This is because a pre-existing near-surface disturbance with sufficient spin and convergence is one of the six requirements for tropical cyclogenesis.Christopher Landsea.

Whenever the monsoon trough on the eastern side of the summertime Asian monsoon is in its normal orientation (oriented east-southeast to west-northwest), tropical cyclones along its periphery will move with a westward motion.

The failure of the monsoon trough, or the ITCZ, to move south of the equator in the eastern Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean during the southern hemisphere summer, is considered one of the factors causing tropical cyclones to not normally form in those regions. It has also been noted that when the monsoon trough lies near 20 degrees north latitude in the Pacific, the frequency of tropical cyclones is 2 to 3 times greater than when it lies closer to 10 degrees north.

He led the family business, National Bank of Alaska, for many decades as president and later chairman. He also served as Mayor of Anchorage from 1964 to 1967 and was the Republican nominee for United States Senator from Alaska in the 1968 election, losing the general election to Mike Gravel. Early life Elmer Edwin Rasmuson was born in Yakutat, Alaska to Edward Anton Rasmuson (1882‚Äì1949) and Jenny Olson Rasmuson, Swedish immigrants and missionaries of the Evangelical Covenant Church who had met in Yakutat. Elmer had an older sister, Evangeline, who born in 1906. Elmer's father took correspondence courses in law, and in 1915, moved the family to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he passed the bar examination. The family moved back to Alaska within the year, stopping first in Juneau before settling in Skagway, where Edward found work as a magistrate. Elmer attended Skagway School. In his memoirs, he called Skagway a \\"good town in which to grow up.\\" While he was still in school, he worked for the Bank of Alaska, which his father had taken over in 1918. He graduated from Queen Anne High School in Seattle, Washington in 1925, and after a couple of years at the University of Washington, transferred to Harvard University in 1928, earning a Bachelor of Science in 1930 and a Master of Arts in 1935. Family and work He went to work for Arthur Andersen, and in 1939, married Lile Bernard of New Jersey. They had three children: Edward Bernard (born 1940), Lile Gibbons, and Judy. In 1940, Andersen sent Elmer to work in Houston, Texas, mostly for Texaco. Elmer returned to Skagway in 1943, recalled by his father, who began to suffer from heart disease. Elmer was installed as president of the National Bank of Alaska. In 1945, the bank's headquarters were moved to Anchorage. Edward Anton Rasmuson died in 1949, leaving the bank to his son. In 1954, together with brother-in-law Robert Atwood (who had married Evangeline in 1932), Elmer invested in Richfield Oil's exploration of the Kenai Peninsula. The investment yielded great profits after oil was discovered in 1957 near the Swanson River. In 1955, Elmer created, with his mother, the charitable Rasmuson Foundation. It was to become \\"the most generous private donor in Alaska history.\\" Elmer's wife, Lile, died of cancer in 1960. The same year, a merger made National Bank of Alaska the largest bank in the state. In 1961, Elmer married Mary Louise Milligan, national director of the Women's Army Corps. In 1972, Elmer received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. Political career and legacy Critical of government response to the Good Friday earthquake of 1964, Rasmuson ran for Mayor of Anchorage, and was elected. He served a three-year term, overseeing reconstruction of the city. In 1967, he organized the foundation of the Anchorage Historical and Fine Arts Museum, intended to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Purchase of Alaska. In 1968, he ran for the U.S. Senate in the Republican primary, beating out Ted Stevens for the party's nomination. But he lost the general election, coming second to Democrat Mike Gravel. Incumbent Senator Ernest Gruening, who had lost his party's nomination to Gravel, placed third. In 1969, Rasmuson stepped down as Regent of the University of Alaska Fairbanks, a position he had held since 1950. In 1970, the Elmer E. Rasmuson Library was dedicated to his service. In 1974, Elmer Rasmuson retired from work at the National Bank of Alaska, transferring the business to his son, Edward B. Rasmuson. In 1980, Elmer Rasmuson was elected as the first chairman of the Board of Trustees of the newly formed Alaska Permanent Fund. He would hold this position until 1982. Elmer E. Rasmuson died December 1, 2000, in Seattle, as a result of congestive heart failure. He concluded decades of philanthropic work by leaving his fortune to charity, including $19 million for the University of Alaska Fairbanks and $400 million for Rasmuson Foundation.

Here is a table of known server/cablenumber combinations: * eServer 326 uses cable 73P9312 * x345 uses cable 02R1661 Older servers use what is known as the \\"planar cable\\". Newer servers use the cable shown in the adjacent image: One type of IBM Remote Supervisor Adapter II internal cable (73P9312) Remote Supervisor Adapter II Slimline (RSA-II Slimline) This is a special version of the RSA-II that does not need a PCI slot. Instead it is plugged into a dedicated slot on the systemboard, like a mini-pci adapter. This version also does not have a video controller anymore like the RSA-II. Out-band management is provided by a dedicated Ethernet port on the server, which is not connected if the RSA-II Slimline is not installed. In-Band management is provided by the same USB driver as the RSA-II. Supported servers: * IBM eServer xSeries 236, 260 * IBM eServer xSeries 336, 346, 366 * IBM eServer xSeries 460, MXE-460 * IBM System x 3200, 3250, 3350, 3400, 3500, 3550, 3650, 3655, 3755, 3800, 3850, 3950 Related BladeCenter Management Module (BCMM) This is the first management module of the IBM BladeCenter. Its function is very similar to that of the RSA-II The BCMM provides an external 10/100Mbit Ethernet connection (used for out-of-band management) and shared VGA, PS/2 Keyboard and PS/2 Mouse ports. Internally the VGA and PS/2 ports are switchable between blades. The PS/2 ports are internally seen to the blades as USB. This has since been phased out and replaced by the BCAMM. It is no longer supported by IBM. BladeCenter Advanced Management Module (BCAMM) This is a hardware refresh of the management module for the IBM BladeCenter. The PS/2 ports for keyboard and mouse were replaced with two USB ports. The BCAMM is currently under active development and its firmware offers more capabilities than the original BCMM. Advanced Systems Management Processor (ASMP) This is an integrated Service Processor on select IBM Intel-based servers. It was succeeded by the ISMP. Out-of-band management is possible using a serial port (shared with the OS), or by adding the Advanced Systems Management Adapter (ASMA). These servers have ASMP functionality: * IBM Netfinity 4500R * IBM Netfinity 5000, 5100, 5500, 5600 * IBM Netfinity 6000R * IBM Netfinity 7100, 7600 * IBM xSeries 130 (8654), 135 (8654), 150 * IBM xSeries 230, 240, 250 * IBM xSeries 330, 340, 350 Integrated Systems Management Processor (ISMP) This is an integrated Service Processor on select IBM Intel-based servers. It was succeeded by the BMC (Baseboard Management Controller). Out-of-band management is possible by adding the RSA or RSA II. These servers have ISMP functionality: * IBM xSeries 232, 235, 236, 255 * IBM xSeries 335, 342, 345 Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) On many legacy IBM Intel-based servers the BMC is standard with the RSA II or RSA II Slimline as an Option device. Integrated Management Module (IMM) The IBM Integrated Management Module (IMM) is the next generation of System Management devices for UEFI based servers and comprises features and functionality of the legacy Baseboard Management Controller (BMC), Remote Supervisor Adapter II (RSA II) while incorporating the Super I/O controller and Video controller. The IMM interfaces with the server's UEFI System firmware (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) to provide system management monitoring and functionality. Although some issues known to both the RSA II and BMC may have been migrated to the early IMM generations (in addition to the IMM's own unique issues), most of these issues have been resolved while adding some of greatly improved features and Administrator / User experience over the BMC and RSA II predecessors. For example: * Advanced Predictive Failure Analysis (PFA) * Configurable IMM Dedicated or Shared Ethernet connection * Virtual Light Path Diagnostic * Email alerts * Remote Firmware updating * Remote Power control, Remote Console / control of both hardware and Operating System * OS failure screen shot capture * Remote Mounting of Virtual Devices such as CD/DVD drive, USB Flash Drives, ISO / Disk images and Diskette drive See also * HP iLO * Dell DRAC * Sun SSP * Real Weasel * Cisco CIMC References *Remote graphics session shows blank screen - IBM Remote Supervisor Adapter II *IBM Remote supervisor adapter User's Guide *IBM RSA-II and RSA-II Slimline User's Guide *IBM RSA-II - Overview *IBM Service Processors support matrix *How to use the IBM RSA keyboard/video remote control without a browser Category:Out-of-band management Category:IBM server computers ","title":"IBM Remote Supervisor Adapter"},{"id":"7125535","text":"William Windham ( - 2 April 1730), of Earsham, Norfolk, was a British Army officer, landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1722 to 1730.

It is situated some north-northeast of Cavan Town. It is approximately a 15-minute drive or 11 km via the N54 to the border with Northern Ireland. The River Annalee flows near the village. Location The village of Ballyhaise is located within the parish of Castletara and contains both Roman Catholic and Church of Ireland churches. Notable buildings Ballyhaise House, situated on the Annalee river (a tributary of the Erne), was built for the Newburghs, a local landowning family, in the 1730s. It is said to contain the earliest surviving oval room in Ireland and Britain. The building was traditionally credited to Richard Cassels, a German architect living in Dublin, who designed many of the capital's finest buildings and squares (including Leinster House). It is more recently thought that Ballyhaise house is actually by the architect of the Irish Houses of Parliament in Dublin, Sir Edward Lovett Pearce. Ballyhaise House has been used as a Teagasc agricultural college (Ballyhaise College) since the beginning of the 20th century; celebrating its centenary in 2006. The bridge near the house is reputed to be nearly 300 years old. Ballyhaise Market House is a five bay, two-storey building. Transport Bus Local Link route C1 links the village with Cavan and Butlersbridge several times daily Mondays to Saturdays inclusive. Route C3 from Redhills to Cavan also serves the village with three services each way Mondays to Saturdays. Rail Ballyhaise railway station opened on 1 April 1862, closed for passenger traffic on 14 October 1957, and finally closed altogether on 1 January 1963. Community and sporting groups The village is home to Ballyhaise GFC, the local Gaelic football team, their home pitch being Annalee Park. In addition to this the village was for many years home to Castletara Youth Band - an accordion marching band which won multiple All-Ireland titles in the late 1990s and early 21st century. Ballyhaise Celtic Football Club was established in the village in 1990. Most recently they opened their home venue, Ballyhaise Celtic Park, located in Glenconnor, Ballyhaise. The club has an established senior team competing in the Cavan Monaghan Senior League and am underage set-up competing in the Cavan Monaghan Underage League. Weather station Met √âireann records climate data for Cavan from their station in Ballyhaise. On 21 December 2010 the maximum temperature recorded in Ballyhaise was -9C and the minimum -14C (average for the day -12C). This was the lowest daily maximum temperature recorded on the island of Ireland since records began in the 1800s. From Saturday 18 December to Christmas Day (25th) the temperature in Ballyhaise never exceeded -2C and fell to a minimum each day of between -11C and -15C. Notable people * The Most Rev.

Hamilton was born in Peculiar, Missouri, and grew up on a farm next door to the Harry S. Truman family farm. In the Missouri State High School championship meet in 1918, he won the high jump, pole vault, broad jump, and shot put. After that, he went on to the University of Missouri, where he won the U.S. decathlon and pentathlon championships in 1920. This qualified him for the U.S. Olympic team. At the 1920 Summer Olympics he won the silver medal in the decathlon, losing to the Norwegian Helge L√∏vland by only four points, and finished sixth in the pentathlon. He placed seventh in the pentathlon at the 1924 Summer Olympics. Besides athletics Hamilton was a second-string end on the 1921 Walter Camp All-American football team, and in 1923 he played on the Kansas City Athletic Club basketball team that won the National AAU Championship. After the 1924 Olympics, Hamilton coached track and field at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, where he also instructed students in English and history. At Westminster, his teams won their conference championships from 1926 to 1929. In 1930, Hamilton moved to the University of Kansas, where his team won the Big Six title in 1930 and 1931 and came in second in 1932. At Kansas he coached the miler Glenn Cunningham and the decathlon world record holder Jim Bausch. In the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles, Hamilton was the U.S. decathlon coach; Bausch won the gold medal. Following the 1932 Olympics, Hamilton became coach of the track and field team at the University of California in Berkeley. He coached at Cal from then until his retirement in 1965, with time off to serve as a major in the U.S. Air Intelligence in England during World War II. He was athletic director at Berkeley from 1946 to 1955, during which time he recruited both Lynn (Pappy) Waldorf and Pete Newell, two of Cal's greatest coaches; he was an assistant dean of students; and he chaired the NCAA Track and Field Rules Committee for 10 years. At Cal, Hamilton coached many athletes of great ability, among them Archie Williams, Hal Davis, Grover Klemmer, Guinn Smith, Jack Yerman, Jerry Siebert, Leamon King, Don Bowden (the first American to break the 4-minute mile barrier), Lon Spurrier, Willie White, Dave Archibald, Forrest Beaty, and Dave Maggard. Majored eventually replaced him in both positions at Cal. In 1936, when he was for a second time the U.S. decathlon coach, his athletes swept the event and Archie Willams took the gold medal in the 400 meters. In 1952, Hamilton coached the U.S. Olympic track and field team in Helsinki; in 1953, he was the U.S. track and field coach for the Maccabean Games in Israel; and in 1965, he coached the U.S. team in the USA-USSR meet. Brutus, as he was known to all, was not only an admired and influential coach. A brilliant writer, he was an accomplished poet, and anyone fortunate enough to receive a letter from him saved it as a work of art. A collection of his letters was published in 1975. He frequently quoted Shakespeare and John Donne by heart, he was a skilled story teller, he played the harmonica well, and he was an avid fisherman of salmon and striped bass in the Sacramento River delta. Brutus Hamilton died in Berkeley, California, on December 28, 1970. In 1974 he was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame. Earlier in 1950 he was selected as Missouri‚Äôs Greatest Amateur Athlete.

She recognized her niece's gifts and encouraged them. As Marian grew older, she realized that she needed to study in Europe, a basis for being taken seriously as a performer or artist at the time. With a chaperone, she left for Frankfurt in 1880 intending to study with Clara Schumann at the Hoch Conservatory. Finding that Clara Schumann was away, Nevins asked for advice in getting another teacher and was referred to Edward MacDowell, a young American composer. After working together for several years, they decided to marry on July 24, 1884. They had one child who was stillborn. From the beginning Marian had great faith in her husband's talent and wanted him to devote himself to composing.Robin Rausch. The House That Marian Built: The MacDowell Colony, American Women: A Library of Congress Guide for the Study of Women's History and Culture in the United States , Library of Congress, 2001. Family and career During their life together, Marian MacDowell realized that quietness and tranquility of the rural settings would positively affect her husband's work. In 1896, she bought Hillcrest, a farm in Peterborough, New Hampshire, for their summer residence. Marian MacDowell had a log studio built in the woods where Edward MacDowell composed. He appreciated the place, which was visited by their artistic friends. The MacDowells realized that artists can be stimulated by interacting with people from other disciplines, and they developed plans of creating a place where artists could come, live and interact together. In 1904, Edward MacDowell began to show evidence of a nervous disorder with bouts of dementia that ended his composing and teaching career. He lost virtually all mental capacity. Marian cared for him to the end of his life in 1908, in his last years with the help of a nurse Anna Baetz, who later became known as the nurse of Edward MacDowell. After Edward's death, Anna Baetz stayed with Marian MacDowell for eighteen years helping with the MacDowell Colony. In 1907, Marian MacDowell initiated her and Edward's plans for an artists' colony, founding a residential institution in Peterborough, New Hampshire where artists could live in residence and work. She conceived of ways to support both artists' need for solitude and for interaction, and transferred the deed of property for Hillcrest Farm to the Edward MacDowell Association.Marian MacDowell. MacDowell's Peterborough Idea, Musical Quarterly, 1932, Volume 18. In the summer of 1907, the first artists were invited: Helen Mears, a sculptor, and her sister Mary Mears (1876-1943), a writer. The latter published an article about the colony in the July 1909 issue of The Craftsman, which gave it much needed publicity.Mary Mears. The Work and Home of Edward MacDowell, Musician. The Craftsman, 16 (July 1909). The MacDowell Colony started to receive support from benefactors, such as Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge. In 1923, the Pictorial Review awarded Marian MacDowell $5,000 Annual Achievement Award for \\"the most valuable contribution to American life during the year.\\"Ida Clyde Clarke. Mrs. Edward MacDowell and Her Great Work for America, Pictorial Review, March 1925. At that time, the MacDowell Colony had nineteen studios on 500 acres and 300 applications for residency. (In 1997, there were 32 studios to accommodate MacDowell fellows and residents.Grace Glueck. Fruitful Months in the Country, The New York Times, January 31, 1997.) To raise funds, Marian MacDowell began lecturing to women's clubs and musical groups. Encouraged at one session, she resumed her performing career at the age of fifty, and became the foremost interpreter of Edward MacDowell's music. She shared her insights in Random Notes on Edward MacDowell and his Music (1950).MacDowell, Marian. Random Notes on Edward MacDowell and his Music. Boston: Arthur P. Schmidt and Co., 1950. During twenty-five years she performed more than 400 recitals in the United States and Canada raising money for the endowment of MacDowell Colony of Peterborough. Ernest Hutcheson thought of her and Amy Beach as \\"remarkably good concert pianists\\".Crawford, Richard. America's Musical Life: A History. New York: Norton, 2001, p. 370. Marian MacDowell frequently performed concerts for women's musical clubs named after Edward MacDowell ‚Äî the MacDowell clubs. She inspired the formation of some of the MacDowell clubs and united ones that previously existed. These clubs, a total of 400 at the peak of their popularity,Yackley, Elizabeth A. Marian MacDowell and the Macdowell Clubs. M.A. thesis. University of Maryland, College Park, 2008, p. 64. became to serve as significant donors to the MacDowell Colony and, in turn, brought the arts to their local communities.See: Elizabeth Yackley. Marian MacDowell and the MacDowell Clubs. M.A. Thesis, University of Maryland, College Park, 2008. Marian MacDowell maintained close relationships with many of these clubs throughout her life, in addition to umbrella organizations such as the National Federation of Music Clubs and professional music sororities: Sigma Alpha Iota, Delta Omicron, Phi Beta, and Alpha Chi Omega. She said that women's groups raised far more money than did men's fraternities. Marian MacDowell was traveling in the United States and Canada giving lectures and recitals until 1938. In 1947, she stepped down from executive directorship at the Edward MacDowell Association. Marian MacDowell died on August 23, 1956 in Los Angeles, California. Legacy Through her unceasing efforts to support both female and male artists in all disciplines, Marian MacDowell became a leading figure for the arts in the United States. The colony supported generations of artists in her lifetime, whose work expressed and contributed to American life. It continues to do so as around 250 artists-in-residence arrive there yearly to create and interact. In 1997, the MacDowell Colony received the National Medal of Arts in recognition of \\"nurturing and inspiring many of this century's finest artists.\\"The Colony Today, Information Bulletin (Library of Congress), March 2007, Vol. 66, No. 3. It was counted in 1997 that, \\"more 1,300 visual artists (besides lots of writers, composers, film makers and architects) have put in quality time at MacDowell, the country's oldest and largest cultural retreat.\\" Among the nationally known artists who were MacDowell fellows are: composers Aaron Copland, Leonard Bernstein, and Amy Beach; printmakers Benny Andrews, Tomei Arai, Milton Avery, Cynthia Back, Robert Cottingham, Janet Fish, and Sandy Gellis; photographers Marion Belanger and Rosalind Solomon; poets Galway Kinnell, Kay Boyle and Edwin Arlington Robinson; novelists Willa Cather, James Baldwin, and Spalding Gray; and playwrights Thornton Wilder, Dorothy and DuBose Heyward, to name a few.A Century of Creativity The MacDowell Colony, 1907-2007, Information Bulletin (Library of Congress), March 2007, Vol. 66, No. 3. Such American classics as Thornton Wilder's Our Town, Aaron Copland's ballet Billy the Kid, and Dorothy and DuBose Heyward's play Porgy are directly connected to the MacDowell Colony.A Century of Creativity - The MacDowell Colony 1907-2007, Library of Congress exhibition.

The Valley of Josaphat (variants: Valley of Jehoshaphat and Valley of Yehoshephat) is a Biblical place mentioned by name in and : \\"I will gather together all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Josaphat: \\"Then I will enter into judgment with them there\\", on behalf of my people and for My inheritance Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations and they have divided up My land.\\"; \\"Let the nations be roused; Let the nations be aroused And come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, for there I will sit to judge all the nations on every side\\". This location is also referred to as the Valley of Decision. Identification In the Judean desert near Teqo'a By one interpretation, this describes the place where, in the presence of Jehoshaphat/Josaphat, King of Judah, YAHWEH annihilated the Gentile coalition of Moab, Ammon and Edom. This may have indicated an actual valley euphemistically called by the Jews √™m√™q Ber√¢k√¢h (\\"valley of blessing\\"), situated in the desert of Teqo'a near Khirbet Ber√™k√ªt, west of Khirbet Teq√ª'a (about eleven miles from Jerusalem). Upper Kidron Valley segment In the fourth century, in the Bordeaux itinerary, the Cedron takes the name of Valley of Josaphat. Eusebius and St. Jerome strengthen this view (Onomasticon, s.v.), while Cyril of Alexandria appears to indicate a different place; early Jewish tradition denied the reality of this valley. Subsequently to the fourth century, Christians, Jews and Muslims regard Cedron as the place of the Last Judgment. What has lent colour to this popular belief is the fact that since the time of the kings of Judah, Cedron has been the principal necropolis of Jerusalem. Josias scattered upon the tombs of the children of Israel the ashes of the idol of the goddess Astarte which he burned in Cedron (). The designation of a Valley of Jehoshaphat is applied as a specific toponym for the first time by the Pilgrim of Bordeaux in 333. Since then it has become a general designation for the Kidron Valley, between Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives, which is repeatedly mentioned in the Old and New Testaments under its own name. Symbolic, indeterminate place Alternatively, it may refer to an indeterminate valley of judgment, since \\"Josaphat\\" means \\"YHWH judges\\". In the same valley is called \\"valley of destruction\\" or the \\"valley of decision\\". The chapter in question describes how the nations that afflicted Judah and Jerusalem during their Babylonian captivity and return from exile shall receive Divine Judgment. According to the Midrash Tehillim, no \\"valley called Jehoshaphat\\" exists.Quoted by Adolf Neubauer (1868), La G√©ographie du Talmud , p. 51Jewish Encyclopedia, \\"Valley of Jehoshaphat\\" Gallery Image:JPF - Old City From Mount Scopus.jpg|Old City of Jerusalem from Mount Scopus.

Set in Rome and Britannia in AD 75, the novel stars Marcus Didius Falco, informer and imperial agent. The title refers to the discovery of a corpse hidden beneath the floor of one bath house and a murder which takes place in another. American editions spell \\"bathhouse\\" in the title as one word. Plot summary When Marcus Didius Falco discovers a corpse hidden under the floor of his new bath house, he starts to track down the men responsible - Glaucus and Cotta. He also receives a commission from the Emperor Vespasian. A building project for the British Chieftain Togidubnus is running late and over-budget. The first phase of construction had gone smoothly - the first buildings on site were granaries, providing a supply base for the Roman army, constructed in the early part of the conquest. But progress had stalled on the stone-walled house and bath suite that would be Togidubnus's residence. Suspecting that the men he seeks have fled to Britain, Falco accepts the mission and travels there with his wife, two baby daughters, their nurse, and his two brothers-in-law Aelianus and Justinus. Falco arrives at Fishbourne and starts by investigating corrupt practices. However events quickly take a turn for the worse when the Chief Architect is found murdered in the bath-house of the British King. Falco takes over the project and investigates the killings.

History When the Sandinistas overthrew the Somoza regime in Nicaragua in 1979, there were only two private television stations broadcasting in Nicaragua. Televicentro (Canal 2), founded in 1965 and owned by Televicentro de Nicaragua, S.A. of the Sacasa family and Canal 6 owned by the Somoza family and founded in 1959. The SSTV was officially constituted by law on February 10, 1984 but both TV stations were confiscated by the Sandinista government already in July 1979 and the SSTV existed de facto since then. The network was under the administration of a Board of Directors with representants from the Council of National Reconstruction, the president of The Superior Education National Council, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Telecommunications, the National Teacher's Association and the Nicaraguan Journalist Union. In 1989 the Sandinista government decided to return Televicentro (Canal 2) to the Sacasa family. That was interpreted as an evidence of the political circumstances in the last years of Sandinistas rule with a more open and tolerant policy towards the opposition. With Violeta Chamorro's triumph in the 1990 elections, the network was dismantled and Canal 6 became part of The National Television System (Sistema Nacional de Televisi√≥n - SNTV) until 1997 when it was legally declared in bankruptcy under Arnoldo Alem√°n's government. After 16 years of abandonment, on September 14, 2011, Channel 6 was again on the air, due to the investments made by the Nicaraguan government in the restoration of the channel. Programming In the beginning, because of the economic blockade imposed by the United States, the SSTV programming was composed of US series and Cuban productions used to educate according to the new government's ideology. However, with the help of European professionals (especially from Soviet bloc countries) and Cubans, the network created programs of ample remembrance among the Nicaraguan population while at the same time forming talents that would influence the Nicaraguan television scene. Among the programs produced by SSTV are La Liga del Saber, El Chocoyito Chimbar√≥n, Domingos Espectaculares (Spectacular Sundays) and several documentaries about the Sandinista Revolution. Channel 6 offered a generalist programming while Channel 2 specialized in educational and cultural programming.

Glenn H. Mullin is present Erdne Ombadykow (born 27 October 1972 in Philadelphia), also known as Telo Tulku Rinpoche, is the Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader of the Kalmyk people. He received his formal training as a bhik·π£u in India and was recognized by the 14th Dalai Lama as the current reincarnation of mahasiddha Tilopa. Since 1992, Telo Tulku has served as the spiritual head (Shadjin Lama) of the Buddhists of Kalmykia. He divides his time between Kalmykia and his family in Erie, Colorado. Early life and career Erdne Ombadykow was born in Philadelphia to working class, immigrant parents of Kalmyk origin as the youngest of brothers Tschon, Tseren, Dava, Jigmid, Jaba and sisters Marguerite, Gerel and Rolma. As a child, Erdne determined that he wanted to be a Buddhist monk, the way other boys want to be policemen or firemen. By the age of seven, Erdne's parents permitted him to move to India where he would study Buddhism at a monastery until 1992. It was reported on ChessBase News, when asked why was he was sent to a monastery in India to be trained as a Buddhist monk at age seven, he said his family wanted one of the sons to become a monk, and he had shown the greatest interest. In New York he met the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, who recommended that he go to the Drepung Gomang Monastery in South India for proper training. While studying at the Drepung Gomang Monastery for 13 years, Erdne Ombadykow was recognized as the current reincarnation (Tulku) of Tilopa, a revered Buddhist saint.  Initial visit to Russia  After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1992, Erdne joined the Dalai Lama on his first visit to Kalmykia, a region whose once-rich Buddhist heritage was destroyed in the 1930s by the dual Soviet policies of collectivization and atheism. Upon arrival, the Dalai Lama named Erdne as the ≈†ajin (Supreme) Lama of the Kalmyk people. As the spiritual leader, Erdne's role was to lead a Buddhist revival among the approximately 160,000 Kalmyks who live in Kalmykia. As the only Kalmyk person with proper Buddhist training, Erdne soon determined that his responsibility as the ≈†ajin Lama was too great a burden for he himself to bear as a 22-year-old. Moreover, he found that his formal monastic training did not prepare him for the role he was assigned. He neither spoke the Kalmyk language nor was he familiar with the mentality of the people or the government.  Return to the USA  Presumably these obstacles made him return to the United States in late 1994, renounce monkhood and get married in 1995. However, after a self-imposed two-year exile, Erdne re-embraced his mission and returned to Kalmykia. Return to Kalmykia Since his return to Kalmykia, Erdne has successfully led the revival of Buddhism. For example, as the ≈†ajin Lama, Erdne now administers 27 newly constructed temples and prayer houses and oversees the work of seven Tibetan lamas. He also has dispatched dozens of young Kalmyk men to India for formal monastic training. Finally, he has learned to speak Kalmyk and Russian. Erdne spends six months of the year in Elista and the remainder with his wife and son in the United States.

The turning radius or turning circle of a vehicle is the radius (or, depending on usage, diameter) of the smallest circular turn (i.e. U-turn) that the vehicle is capable of making. Turning radius of a vehicle depends on the vehicle type Usage The term turning radius is a technical term that has become popular automotive jargon. In the jargon sense, it is commonly used to mean the full diameter of the smallest circle, but in technical usage the turning radius is still used to denote the radius. The less ambiguous term turning circle avoids the mistaken jargon use of the word radius. As an example, Motor Trend refers to a curb-to-curb turning circle of a 2008 Cadillac CTS as , but the terminology is not yet settled. AutoChannel.com refers to the turning radius of the same car as . It is often used as a generalized term rather than a numerical figure. For example, a vehicle with a very small turning circle may be described as having a \\"tight turning radius\\". Curb to curb Two different measurements can be quoted for a vehicle. A curb or curb-to-curb turning circle will show the straight-line distance from one side of the circle to the other, through the center. The name \\"curb-to- curb\\" indicates that a street would have to be this wide before this car can make a U-turn and not hit a street curb with a wheel. If you took the street curb and built it higher, as high as the car, and tried to make a U-turn in the street, parts of the car (bumper) would hit the wall. The name wall or wall-to-wall turning circle denotes how far apart the two walls would have to be to allow a U-turn without scraping the walls. One can find these two ways of measuring the turning circle used in auto specifications, for example, a van might be listed as having a turning circle (in meters) of 12.1(C)/12.4(W). A notable exception in this description is of vehicles that are capable of spinning around their central axis, such as certain lawnmowers and wheelchairs as they do not follow a circular path as they turn. In this case the vehicle is referred to as a \\"zero turning radius\\" vehicle. Some camera dollies used in the film industry have a \\"round\\" mode which allows them to spin around their z axis by allowing synchronized inverse rotation of their front and rear wheel sets, effectively giving them \\"zero\\" turning radius.

It began operations in 1992, and was sold to Southwest Airlines in December 1993 for over $120 million in stock.History: Morris Air Service The airline officially became part of Southwest in the autumn of 1994. Morris Air was the first airline in the world to invent e-ticket (ticketless) travel based on the suggestion of Stuart Thatcher, an employee at the time. Although Southwest Airlines is often credited with offering the first e-ticketing system, it was in fact created and implemented by Morris Air and later integrated into Southwest Airlines after their purchase of Morris Air. History The airline began charter operations as Morris Air Service in 1984. It was launched by Utah businesswoman June Morris, who also founded Morris Travel in 1970, and David Neeleman who also co-founded WestJet and JetBlue. Neeleman worked with Southwest for a short period and when his non- compete agreement expired, he founded JetBlue Airways. June Morris sat on the board of directors of Southwest Airlines until she retired at the annual shareholders' meeting on May 17, 2006. Charter flights were operated by Ryan International Airlines during 1992, and by both Ryan International and Sierra Pacific Airlines prior to 1992. Morris obtained its own FAR 121 operating certificate in December 1992 and then began operating as its own carrier. The airline was based at Salt Lake City International Airport where it operated a hubhttp://www.departedflights.com, Morris Air route maps and flew a number of routes primarily in the western U.S. using Boeing 737-300 aircraft.

The Americas, volume 33, issue 2, October 1976, pp. 267‚Äì281 () eleven of the twelve ships of this fleet were lost in a hurricane near present-day Vero Beach, Florida. Because the fleet was carrying silver, it is also known as the 1715 Plate Fleet (plata being the Spanish word for silver). Some artifacts and even coins still wash up on Florida beaches from time to time. Around 1,500 (confirmed by Cuban records) sailors perished while a small number survived on lifeboats. Many ships, including pirates, took part in the initial salvage. Initially a privateer, Henry Jennings, was first accused of piracy for attacking such salvage ships and claiming their salvages. Rare 8 escudos lima dated 1710, recovered from the 1715 Fleet. Exhibits and preserves Treasure hunter Kip Wagner's team built an exhibit held at National Geographic \\"Explorers Hall\\" in Washington, D.C. that was featured in the January 1965 issue of National Geographic. This was the beginning of a fine collection of 1715 plate fleet treasure that brought hundreds of visitors from around the world. Wagner published his book Pieces of Eight (Recovering The Riches Of A Lost Spanish Fleet) in 1966. This is a detailed account of the finding and exploration of many of these shipwrecks along the Florida \\"Treasure Coast.\\" An exhibit was set up with a grand opening on May 1, 1967, at the First National Bank of Satellite Beach, Florida. In 1987, another ship in the fleet, the Urca de Lima, became the first shipwreck in the Florida Underwater Archaeological Preserves. Mel Fisher's company, Mel Fisher's Treasures, sold the rights to the 1715 Fleet shipwreck to Queens Jewels, LLC. In 2015, 1715 Fleet - Queens Jewels, LLC and their founder Brent Brisben discovered $4.5 million in gold coins off the coast of Florida; the coins come from the 1715 Fleet shipwreck.

The treasure fleet was used as the backdrop for a scene in the video game Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. The main character, Edward Kenway, is aboard one of the ships in the fleet as a prisoner, and manages to escape with the help of his future quartermaster, Ad√©wal√©, recruiting other captive pirates as a crew. The pirates eventually manage to escape the fleet and the hurricane by stealing the twelfth ship, the brig El Dorado, which Edward keeps and renames the Jackdaw, becoming the player's ship for the rest of the game. Edward later makes reference to the event when Blackbeard inquires as to how he got the Jackdaw, and the latter then suggests visiting the site to salvage some of the lost treasure. In the 1977 movie The Deep \\"David Sanders (Nick Nolte) and his British girlfriend Gail Berke (Jacqueline Bisset) recover a number of artifacts (from a diving expedition off the coast of Bermuda), including an ampule of amber-colored liquid and a medallion bearing the image of a woman and the letters 'S.C.O.P.N' (an abbreviation of the Latin 'Santa Clara Ora Pro Nobis' that translates to English as 'Santa Clara Pray For Us') and a date, 1714. St. David's Lighthouse keeper and treasure-hunter Romer Treece (Robert Shaw), believes the medallion had come from the wreckage of the surviving twelfth ship [of the 1715 Treasure Fleet], thought to be a French tobacco ship that was being protected by the 1715 fleet and named Grifon (spelt \\"El Grif√≥n\\" in Peter Benchley's novel The Deep). The ship was thought to be returning to Havana, Cuba for repairs but instead sank off the coast of Bermuda.\\" The plot of the Starz show Black Sails revolves heavily around the 1715 Treasure Fleet in its first season. The largest of the ships, the Urca de Lima, is wrecked during the hurricane off the coast of Florida, carrying five million Spanish dollars' worth in gold, silver and other precious materials, pursued by Captain Flint and his crew.

He pioneered the art form, ART ECO. His work has been showcased at museums and galleries internationally.  Biography  Fredric Hobbs (full name Charles Fredric Hobbs) was born in Philadelphia on December 30, 1931. He attended Menlo School in Menlo Park California and in 1953 earned B.A. in History from Cornell University. After service as an Air Force Officer, Hobbs maintained a studio in Madrid where he attended the Academia de San Fernando de Bellas Artes. In recent years, his studio has been located in San Francisco and Carmel, California. Since the 1950s, the artist's work has concerned spiritual and environmental consciousness. In 1963, Hobbs created a radical new automobile art called \\"Parade Sculpture\\". This concept had its origin in ancient religious processions and self-propelled tableaux. During the 60s, three parade pieces (\\"Sun Chariot\\", \\"Three Thieves\\", \\"Trojan Horse\\") removed art from its museum environment, thereby confronting a mass audience under circumstances of everyday life. Driveable sculpture was exhibited in New York, California and as part of the famous national traveling show entitled \\"The Highway\\". In the early 1970s, Fredric Hobbs pioneered another art form known as ART ECO. ART ECO combines environmental technology, fine art, solar/nomadic architecture, and interactive communications with an ecologically balanced lifestyle. Hobbs also wrote and produced four films, Troika (1969), Roseland (1971), Alabama Flats (1973) and Godmonster of Indian Flats (1973). Godmonster of Indian Flats didn't get a theatrical run, but was released on DVD by Something Weird Video in 2001. In 1978, with Warren Hinckle, Hobbs wrote and illustrated \\"The Richest Place on Earth,\\" a history of Nevada's Comstock Lode in the 1860s and '70s, published by Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston. Once an owner of the Silver Dollar Hotel in Virginia City, NV, Hobbs has had a long and multifaceted relationship with Virginia City and environs.

Conaithe Verified 2011-03-20. is a village in County Cork, Ireland. It is situated on the River Bride, not far from the town of Fermoy. The village contains several pubs, a shop, a post office, a Roman Catholic church and a nearby Church of Ireland chapel. The village is dominated by Conna castle, a five-story tower house situated on a limestone outcrop near the river. History of the castle In 1554, the Fitzgeralds, Earls of Desmond, began building Conna Castle on a high limestone rock overlooking the River Bride. Construction was completed ten years later. The castle and its estate was seized by the English and passed into the hands of Walter Raleigh, the English settler. The rightful heir to the castle, James FitzThomas (The Sug√°n Earl) staged a rebellion to capture the castle. He failed, was captured and imprisoned in the Tower of London. The castle then went through a series of different owners before ending up in the hands of the Earl of Cork. It is believed that Oliver Cromwell passed by the castle and fired cannons at it before moving on.The Illustrated Dublin Journal. Volume 1, Number 24. February 15, 1862. In 1653, the castle suffered a fire in which three of the steward's daughters were killed. The castle continued to move from owner to owner until Hilary L‚ÄôEstrange purchased the castle in 1851. He passed it on to his son, Rev A. G. K. L'Estrange, on whose death in 1915, the castle was willed into the care of the state, the first such property to be so willed. Residents In 1970, actress Angela Lansbury and her husband Peter Shaw moved to a farmhouse, named Knockmourne Glebe and originally constructed in the 1820s, that was located near Conna.

Location  To the west of the station was a triangular set of junctions. Immediately to the west was Maryhill Central junction where the line to Kirklee diverged to the south and the Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway headed east to Bellshaugh Junction where the western side of the triangle (from Kirklee Junction at the southern point of the junctions) and the Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway met before the line to Dawsholm diverged to the north. The station served the nearby Maryhill Barracks and it was from this station that tanks and soldiers departed for Buchanan Street station in order to be deployed at George Square in the 'Red Scare' of January 1919. There was another Maryhill station to the north.  Closure  It was closed to passengers on 2 November 1959 on the Glasgow Central Railway route and on 5 October 1964 on the Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway between Possil and Partick, with the lines in the area being closed on 5 October 1964.  Current site usage  The site of the station is now occupied by Maryhill Shopping Centre which was built in the early 1980s this was rebuilt in around 2010 to consist of a Large supermarket with 4 retail units and car parking below. However, a space was left in the basement of the shopping centre to allow the line to be re-opened in future; this was still considered an option in the mid 1990s with the building of a large bingo hall on the cutting east of site left a channel for the original line to be re-opened below ground. In 1999, however, this prospect was put to rest with the sale of land for housing along many parts of the track in the Kirklee and Cleveden sections of the track along with the demolition of many of the bridges around the same area for safety reasons. Maryhill Shopping Centre was demolished in early 2010 and replaced by a new Tesco supermarket.

It was originally a large radar-guided missile using pulse-Doppler radar to guide itself against enemy bombers. When this proved to be beyond the state of the art, further development as a semi-active radar homing followed, but this produced a very large missile with a range similar to the much smaller AIM-7 Sparrow. Development was cancelled along with the thin-wing Javelin in 1956. A somewhat smaller version was briefly considered under the name Red Hebe. History The Red Dean project was split off from the Red Hawk missile project in 1951 as a missile to be developed by Folland. Folland had been involved in the RTV.2 test vehicle, this and the recent appointment of Teddy Petter as chief engineer led to them being awarded the contract in mid 1951. Following problems with increasing size and weight as the design progressed, not to mention cost overruns and problems with the seeking head (being developed by E.K. Coles), Folland felt unable to continue the work and the Ministry of Supply cancelled the contract in November and passed it to Vickers. Vickers started the design studies in July 1952 and the development contract was placed in March 1953. However, the Vickers version of Red Dean, Vickers Type 888, was no more fortunate. It continued to suffer from numerous development problems, not the least of which was that ongoing issues with the active radar seeker (for which the designers GEC were pilloried on numerous grounds) caused a size and weight spiral. This in turn detracted grossly from the flight performance, which was dismal for such a large missile. Poor seeker performance in turn demanded a large warhead, which exacerbated the weight problems, while design limitations inherent in the light alloy structure made it unsuitable for use on highly supersonic interceptors. Operational Requirement F.155 for a fighter to engage enemy bombers with radar and infra- red guided missiles (the missiles were specified under OR.1131) included a scaled-down Red Dean under the codename Red Hebe. Gloster offered a development of their Javelin with Red Dean. The \\"thin wing\\" Gloster Javelin development was cancelled in 1956 and Red Dean went with it, despite a major redesign and abandonment of the requirement for autonomous active homing. The limitations on supersonic carriage still remained, and the planned new generation of Mach 2.5 interceptors would need something better.

Assyrians, like their Armenian neighbors, suffered during a genocide by the Ottoman Turks, in which an estimated over 750000 Assyrians perished.Joseph Yacoub, La question assyro- chald√©enne, les Puissances europ√©ennes et la SDN (1908-1938), 4 vol., th√®se Lyon, 1985, p.156 As many Armenians fled Anatolia for what is today Armenia, many Assyrians followed as well, citing it as the only \\"Christian haven\\" in the region, although many also fled to Georgia (see Assyrians in Georgia). Throughout history, relations between the Assyrians and Armenian majority have tended to be very friendly, as both groups have practiced Christianity since ancient times and have suffered through persecution under Muslim rulers.the Assyrian and Armenian are the best friend for each other The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Awakening to International Human Rights By Peter Balakian. Nonetheless, the Assyrian Church of the East is considered heretical by the Armenian Apostolic Church, as the latter condemns the patron saint of the former, Nestorius. However, the Armenian Catholic Church and the Assyrian Chaldean Catholic Church are in full communion, and have brotherly relations. Distribution A multilingual (Armenian, Assyrian, Russian) sign at the entrance of Arzni. The Assyrian population in Armenia is mainly rural. Out of 3,409 Assyrians in Armenia 2,885 (84.6%) was rural and 524 (15.4%) urban.COE - Ethnic minorities in Armenia According to the Council of Europe European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages there were four rural settlements with significant Assyrian population: #Arzni in Kotayk Province - Assyrians and Armenians #Verin Dvin, Ararat Province - Assyrians and Armenians #Dimitrov, Ararat Province - Assyrians and Armenians #Nor Artagers in Armavir Province - Assyrians, Armenians and Yezidis  Armenia  Memorial to the Assyrian Genocide, Yerevan The Assyrians have managed to both integrate with Armenian society and maintain their own ethnic identity, as there are classes teaching the Aramaic language. Most Assyrians in the country are fluent in Armenian and Russian as well. Assyrians in Armenia today mostly belong to Assyrian Church of the East, but there is a small community belonging to the Chaldean Catholic Church as well. They mostly work in the fields of gardening, agriculture and viniculture. There are big Assyrian communities in the region of Verin Dvin and Dimitrov of the Ararat Marz, and Arzni of the Kotayk Marz. There is an Assyrian Youth Center in the Armenian capital, Yerevan. Mixed marriages between Assyrians and Armenians are becoming more common today, whereas Assyrians were strictly self-isolated in the two centuries before. In 2003, the community established the \\"Assyrian Center BetNahrain\\", a club that promotes the studying and dissemination of the Assyrian language, culture, history and traditions, to the general public. Education There are four public schools that are providing instructions in Assyrian: * The Secondary School of Verin Dvin village (250 students in 2008) * The Secondary School of Arzni village (114 students in 2008) * The Secondary School of Dimitrov village (68 students in 2008) * Alexander Pushkin no. 8 secondary School of Yerevan (8 students in 2008) See also *Armenian-Assyrian relations *Assyrian people *Assyrian diaspora *Assyrian genocide References External links *Assyrian Association of Armenia *Nineveh: Assyrian Woman in the Days of Mourning *Three Essential Issues Facing Assyrians in Armenia *The Ethnic Minorities of Armenia Yerevan *The Armenian Term ƒÄs≈çrƒ´ Category:Ethnic groups in Armenia Category:Assyrian diaspora ","title":"Assyrians in Armenia"},{"id":"7126038","text":"Albert Delannoy (born 1881) was a French long jumper who competed in the late 19th century and early 20th century.

Ancient beliefs  Anubis conducts Hunefer to judgment, where his heart will be weighed against the feather of truth; the fourteen gods above sit in order of judgment, with the underworld ruler Osiris, flanked by Isis and Nephthys, to the right, and the monstrous Ammit waiting next to the scales to devour the souls of those whose hearts are heavier than the feather In ancient Sumerian religion, the sun-god Utu and his twin sister Inanna were believed to be the enforcers of divine justice. Utu, as the god of the sun, was believed to see all things that happened during the day and Inanna was believed to hunt down and punish those who had committed acts of transgression. After she was raped in her sleep by the gardener Shukaletuda, she unleashed a series of plagues upon the whole world before tracking him down and killing him in the mountains. In another story, she hunted down the old bandit woman Bilulu, who had murdered her husband Dumuzid, and turned her into a waterskin. The Sumerians, as well as later Mesopotamian peoples, believed that all mortals went to the same afterlife: Kur, a cold, dark, cavern deep beneath the earth. Kur was miserable for all people and a person's actions during life had no impact whatsoever on how he or she would be treated in the afterlife. The idea of a final readjustment beyond the grave, which would rectify the sharp contrast so often observed between the conduct and the fortune of men, was prevalent among all nations in pre-Christian times. Such was the doctrine of metempsychosis or the transmigration of souls, as a justification of the ways of God to man, prevailing among the Hindus of all classes and sects, the Pythagoreans, the Orphic mystics and the Druids among the Celts. The doctrine of a forensic judgment in the unseen world, by which the eternal lot of departed souls is determined, was also widely prevalent in pre-Christian times.McHugh, John. \\"Divine Judgment.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 3 September 2016 The Pharaonic Egyptian idea of the judgment is set forth with great precision of detail in the \\"Book of the Dead\\", a collection of formulas designed to aid the dead in their passage through the underworld. Greco-Roman beliefs Hermes as Guide of Souls prepares to lead a woman to the afterlife (5th century BC lekythos) The \\"Book of the Dead\\" (Nekyia) in the Odyssey depicts judgment in the afterlife by Minos, the \\"radiant son of Zeus\\" who in his mortal life had been king of Crete.Odyssey 11.568‚Äì71. Three egregious sinners are singled out for eternal punishment, but the theological implications of the scene are unclear. Plato elaborates on the concept in the myth of Er at the end of the Republic. Each misdeed receives a tenfold penalty, with rewards also proportional. Elsewhere,Plato, Apologia 41 A. Plato names the judges as Minos and Rhadamanthys, but he also draws on the tenets of Orphic religion. A third judge was Aeacus; all three were once mortal kings whose excellence as rulers among the living was transferred to the dead.Radcliffe Guest Edmonds, Myths of the Underworld Journey: Plato, Aristophanes, and the 'Orphic' Gold Tablets (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 148. Vergil's depiction of the afterlife in the AeneidVergil, Aeneid Book 6. is consonant with the Homeric view as well as that of Plato, and he makes it clear that everyone faces judgment. The mystery religions of the Hellenistic era offered initiates the hope of salvation through confession, judgment, and forgiveness, as well as ritual purity. The Isaic mysteries were influenced by the traditional religion of ancient Egypt, which had symbolized the judgment of the soul through its weight on the scale of truth.J. Gwyn Griffiths, The Divine Verdict: A Study of Divine Judgement in the Ancient Religions (Brill, 1991), passim, especially pp. 294‚Äì295 on Homeric, Platonic, and Vergilian views; pp. 313‚Äì322 online on confession, judgment, and forgiveness. Citations of ancient sources are those of Griffiths. Orphic initiates were buried with devotional texts that provided instructions for navigating the hazards of the underworld and addressing the judges; the soul who speaks correctly will be given a drink from the pool of Memory before joining the heroes who have gone before.Richard Janko, ‚ÄúForgetfulness in the Golden Tablets of Memory,‚Äù Classical Quarterly 34 (1984) 89‚Äì100; W.K.C. Guthrie, \\"The Future Life as Seen by Orpheus,\\" in Orpheus and Greek Religion: A Study of the Orphic Movement (New York: Norton, 1966, revised edition), pp. 148‚Äì191 online. Judaism Justice and righteousness are such essential attributes of God as to have led to the conviction upon every believer that every evil deed will meet with its due punishment. \\"Shall not the Judge of all the earth do righteous judgment?\\" (Gen. 18:25). Great catastrophes as Noah's flood, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, the earthquake that swallowed up Korah and his followers, the plagues of Egypt and the evil that came upon other oppressors of Israel are represented in the Bible as Divine judgments. The end of history, therefore, was conceived to be the execution of the divine judgment upon all the nations. This divine judgment is to take place, according to the Biblical view, on earth, and is intended to be particularly a vindication of Israel.Kohler, Kauffmann. \\"Judgement, Divine\\", Jewish Encyclopedia, 1906 This Day of Judgment (\\"Day of the Lord\\") is portrayed vividly in the Book of Jubilees and particularly in Enoch. The leading idea in Enoch is that the Deluge was the first world-judgment, and that the final judgment of the world is to take place at the beginning or at the close of the Messianic kingdom. The one at the beginning of the Messianic kingdom is more national in its character; the one at the close is to consign all souls either to Paradise or to Gehenna. The fire of the latter consumes the wicked, the heathen often being represented as types of wickedness, while the Israelites are supposed to be saved by their own merit or by that of their fathers. The divine judgment described in the Testament of Abraham is one concerning all souls in the life to come. There is also a divine judgment which takes place in this world and is continual. \\"Man is judged daily,\\" says R. Jose (Tosef., R. H. 13). According to the Mishnah, \\"There are four seasons of the year when the world is judged: in spring [Pesa·∏•], in regard to the yearly produce; in early summer [Shabu'ot], in regard to the fruitage of the trees; on Sukkot, in regard to the winter's rain; and on New-Year's Day, when man is judged.\\" It is owing to these views that the 1st of Tishri became-the Day of Judgment in the Jewish liturgy. Not yet recognized as such in the time of Josephus and Philo, this season of repentance and penitential prayer removed from the Jew that gloom and dread of the Last Judgment Day so prevalent in Essene life and literature and gave to Jewish ethics its more practical, healthy character. Christian St. Michael weighing souls, Abtenau Catholic doctrine Objective and subjective judgment In Catholic doctrine, divine judgment (Latin judicium divinum), as an imminent act of God, denotes the action of God's retributive justice by which the destiny of rational creatures is decided according to their merits and demerits. This includes: *God's knowledge of the moral worth of the acts of free creatures, and His decree determining the just consequences of such acts; *the Divine verdict upon a creature amenable to the moral law, and the execution of this sentence by way of reward and punishment. In the beginning, God pronounced judgment upon the whole race, as a consequence of the fall of its representatives, the first parents (). Death and the infirmities and miseries of this were the consequences of that original sentence. Besides this common judgment there have been special judgments on particular individuals and peoples. The fear of God is such a fundamental idea in the Old Testament that it insists mainly on the punitive aspect of the judgment (cf. ; ). There is also a judgment of God in the world that is subjective. By their acts a person adheres to or deviates from the law of God, and thereby places themselves within the sphere of approval or condemnation. In a sense then, each individual exercises judgment on themselves. Hence it is declared that Christ came not to judge but to save (John 3:17; 8:15; 12:47). The internal judgment proceeds according to a person's attitude: towards Christ (). The eternal destiny of creatures will be decided at the end of time. As there is a twofold end of time, so there is likewise a twofold eternal judgment: the particular judgment, at the hour of death, which is the end of time for the individual, and the general judgment, at the final epoch of the world's existence, which is the end of time for the human race. Presbyterian The idea that God is now and will be at the end the judge of every human life is both biblical teaching or doctrine that is fundamental to understanding Christian faith. The Lord's present judgment of human life anticipates that perfect and final judgment that he will impose upon mankind at the end of the age. Christians will also have to face the judgment of the Lord and receive what is due them for the deeds done in the body, whether good or evil. Islam \\"But Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ\\". Historical St Gildas interpreted the Saxon invasions of England in 5th-6th centuries as just punishment for the sins of the Britons. The Viking attacks of the 8th-11th centuries were widely interpreted as being divine punishment upon Christians.Studies in the Early History of Shaftesbury Abbey. Dorset County Council, 1999 Plagues, earthquakes and other similar disasters were also often looked upon as punishment in much of Christian history. The Reformation was sometimes interpreted by Catholics as a divine punishment upon the Church. In his Second Inaugural Address Abraham Lincoln cited the then on- going war as Divine Judgment visited upon the nation for the offense of slavery. > The Almighty has His own purposes. \\"Woe unto the world because of offenses; > for it must needs be that offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the > offense cometh.\\" If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those > offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having > continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He > gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by > whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those > divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him? > Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may > speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth > piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall > be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by > another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still > it must be said \\"the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous > altogether.Lincoln, Abraham. \\"Second Inaugural Address\\", March 4, 1865 See also *Divine retribution *General judgment **Particular judgment **Last Judgment *Last judgment *Divine command theory *Revenge *Dongti (divine punishment in Korean mythology) *Mandate of Heaven *Category:Justice deities References Category:Judgment in religion Category:Judgment in Islam Category:Judgment in Christianity ","title":"Divine judgment"},{"id":"7126068","text":"Aleksander Klumberg (since 1936 Kolmpere; 17 April 1899 ‚Äì 10 February 1958) was an Estonian decathlete.

It was formed in 1990 as part of the privatisation process of the UK Electricity Supply Industry. In 1996, it was amalgamated into a new company ‚Äì British Energy, which was eventually purchased by EDF Energy in 2010. History Background (Before 1990) Before 1990, the generation and transmission activities in England and Wales were under the responsibility of Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB). The present electricity market in the UK was built upon the break-up of the CEGB into four separate companies in the 1990s. Its generation (or upstream) activities were transferred to three generating companies ‚Äì 'PowerGen', 'National Power', and 'Nuclear Electric' (later 'British Energy', eventually 'EDF Energy'); and its transmission (or downstream) activities to ‚Äì the National Grid Company. Nuclear Electric (1990‚Äì1995) When the CEGB split up was announced, its power stations were decided to be divided between PowerGen and National Power. The nuclear stations, Magnox, AGR and the then under construction Sizewell B (PWR), were allocated to National Power in their nuclear division. However, the privatisation process in National Power was delayed as it was concluded that the 'earlier decided nuclear power plant assets in National Power' would not be included in the private company ‚Äì 'National Power' A new company was formed, Nuclear Electric, which would eventually own and operate the nuclear power assets; and the nuclear power stations were held in public ownership for a number of years. John G. Collier, formerly chair of UKAEA, was its first chairman, and its corporate headquarters were at Barnwood, formerly the site of the Generation Design and Construction Division of the CEGB. Transition to British Energy, later EDF Energy (1995‚Äì2010) In 1995, the assets of Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear were combined as well as split. The combination process merged operations of UK's eight most advanced nuclear plants ‚Äì seven Advanced Gas Cooled Reactor (AGR) and one Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR) ‚Äì into a new private company founded in 1996, 'British Energy'. The splitting process created a separate company in 1996 called 'Magnox Electric' ‚Äì which would hold a proportion of the old CEGB's nuclear stations, its older Magnox reactors.

He first became prominent when after his cousin Erzhu Rong overthrew Emperor Xiaoming's mother Empress Dowager Hu (after she poisoned Emperor Xiaoming) and made Emperor Xiaozhuang emperor. Later, when Emperor Xiaozhuang killed Erzhu Rong in 530, Erzhu Shilong participated in the counterattack that overthrew Emperor Xiaozhuang, and thereafter controlled the imperial government during the reign of Emperor Jiemin. When the general Gao Huan, in turn, rebelled in response to Emperor Xiaozhuang's death, the officials in the imperial capital Luoyang rebelled against the Erzhus, and Erzhu Shilong was executed after failing to flee Luoyang. Background Erzhu Shilong was a cousin of Erzhu Rong and a fellow member of the ethnic Xiongnu Qihu (Â•ëËÉ°) tribe, of which Erzhu Rong was chief. (They were at most as close as second cousins, as they did not have the same grandfather.) Unlike Erzhu Rong, who served his entire career as a general and not a civilian official, Erzhu Shilong was part of the imperial administration during the reign of Emperor Xiaoming, although he became a commander of the imperial guards as well. In 528, Emperor Xiaoming, in a dispute with his mother Empress Dowager Hu over the continued control of the imperial administration along with her lover Zheng Yan (ÈÑ≠ÂÑº) and Zheng's associate Xu Ge (ÂæêÁ¥á), conspired with Erzhu Rong to have Erzhu Rong advance on the capital Luoyang to force Empress Dowager Hu to yield power. When Empress Dowager Hu discovered this, she poisoned Emperor Xiaoming to death and made his distant toddler nephew, Yuan Zhao, emperor. Erzhu Rong immediately denounced her publicly. In order to try to calm Erzhu Rong, Empress Dowager Hu sent Erzhu Shilong to him to try to explain her actions, and while Erzhu Rong wanted to keep Erzhu Shilong with him, Erzhu Shilong chose to return to Luoyang, reasoning that if he did not, Empress Dowager Hu would be aware that Erzhu Rong was planning to attack Luoyang and would take precautions. Erzhu Rong soon advanced quickly on Luoyang; as he did, Erzhu Shilong secretly fled out of Luoyang and joined him at Shangdang (‰∏äÈª®, in modern Changzhi, Shanxi). Empress Dowager Hu's forces surrendered without significant combat. Erzhu Rong made Yuan Ziyou the Prince of Changle emperor (as Emperor Xiaozhuang), while throwing Empress Dowager Hu and Yuan Zhao into the Yellow River to drown. He also slaughtered a large number of imperial officials, and he installed a number of his close associates, among whom was Erzhu Shilong, into high positions in the imperial government. Under Erzhu Rong's command Emperor Xiaozhuang made Erzhu Shilong ' (ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ) -- a high level imperial official‚Äîand made him in charge of the civil service system. Erzhu Shilong, initially fearing that he was not capable for the position, spent much time and energy studying the laws and regulations, and reformed the system so that it was no longer strictly seniority-based. He received much praise for the reforms. Emperor Xiaozhuang also created him the Duke of Leping. In 529, when Yuan Hao the Prince of Beihai, claimed the throne with the support by rival Liang Dynasty's troops, and Yuan Hao invaded and advanced toward Luoyang, Emperor Xiaozhuang made Erzhu Shilong be in charge of the key fortress of Hulao (ËôéÁâ¢, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan). Erzhu Shilong, however, lacked military talent, and when the Liang general Chen Qingzhi (Èô≥ÊÖ∂‰πã) captured the nearby city of Yingyang (ÊªéÈôΩ, also in modern Zhengzhou), Erzhu Shilong, in panic, abandoned Hulao and fled back to Luoyang, causing Emperor Xiaozhuang to flee the capital. Because of this, when Emperor Xiaozhuang was north of the Yellow River, he demoted Erzhu Shilong to be the governor of Xiang Province (Áõ∏Â∑û, roughly modern Handan, Hebei), but after Emperor Xiaozhuang returned to Luoyang later that year after Erzhu Rong defeated Yuan Hao, Erzhu Shilong was restored to his position as '. Emperor Xiaozhuang eventually came to fear that Erzhu Rong had designs on the throne. These fears were exacerbated by the chilly relationship that Emperor Xiaozhuang had with his wife, Erzhu Rong's daughter Empress Erzhu Ying'e, because of Empress Erzhu's jealousy. Emperor Xiaozhuang once asked Erzhu Shilong to try to ask Empress Erzhu to change her ways, and during the conversation Erzhu Shilong had with Empress Erzhu, she remarked that the Erzhus made Emperor Xiaozhuang emperor and that the situation was still changeable. Erzhu Shilong commented that if Erzhu Rong had taken the throne, he would have been an imperial prince. In 530, when Empress Erzhu became pregnant, Erzhu Rong arrived in the capital to attend to her birth, and it around this time that Emperor Xiaozhuang plotted with the officials Yuan Hui (ÂÖÉÂæΩ) the Prince of Chengyang, Li Yu (ÊùéÂΩß), Yang Kan (Ê•ä‰æÉ), and Yuan Luo (ÂÖÉÁæÖ) to ambush Erzhu Rong. Erzhu Shilong heard rumors of this, and he personally wrote a warning to Erzhu Rong, but Erzhu Rong failed to heed the warning. Subsequently, when Erzhu Rong was in the palace, Emperor Xiaozhuang ambushed and killed him. Erzhu Shilong and Erzhu Rong's wife Princess Beixiang fought their way out of the capital. Campaign against Emperor Xiaozhuang Initially, Erzhu Shilong was going to lead the remnants of Erzhu Rong's guards immediately to the Erzhus' stronghold of Jinyang (ÊôâÈôΩ, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), then guarded by Erzhu Rong's nephew Erzhu Zhao. Erzhu Rong's strategist Sima Ziru (Âè∏È¶¨Â≠êÂ¶Ç) advised Erzhu Shilong that he needed to quickly make a show of strength to Emperor Xiaozhuang before doing so, and Erzhu Shilong therefore attacked and seized both Beizhong (Âåó‰∏≠, a fortress directly north of Luoyang across the Yellow River) and the Yellow River bridge connecting Luoyang and Beizhong. Emperor Xiaozhuang tried to get Erzhu Shilong to submit by offering him an \\"iron certificate\\" (ÈêµÂà∏, tie quan, which could be used against a death-eligible crime) to Erzhu Shilong if he would be willing to give up resisting. Erzhu Shilong refused‚Äîdeclaring that if Erzhu Rong could be killed after accomplishing so much, the certificate was meaningless. Emperor Xiaozhuang's troops and the Erzhus' troops stalemated for half a month, before an ambush by Emperor Xiaozhuang's official Li Miao (ÊùéËãó) destroyed the Yellow River bridge, causing Erzhu Shilong to decide to march north. Erzhu Shilong met with Erzhu Zhao at Zhangzi (Èï∑Â≠ê, in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), and they jointly declared Princess Beixiang's nephew Yuan Ye the Prince of Changguang emperor, as a competing candidate for the throne. Yuan Ye created Erzhu Shilong the Prince of Leping. Soon, the Erzhu forces, under Erzhu Zhao's command, advanced south and caught Emperor Xiaozhuang, who did not expect Erzhu Zhao to be able to cross the Yellow River easily, by surprise when he had his army ride on horsebacks across the river around the new year 531. Emperor Xiaozhuang's imperial guards collapsed, and he was captured by Erzhu Zhao's cavalry soldiers and imprisoned, less than three months after he killed Erzhu Rong. Erzhu Zhao killed Emperor Xiaozhuang's infant son (by Empress Erzhu), while allowing his soldiers to pillage Luoyang, killing many officials and raping many honored women. Erzhu Zhao, believing that he had accomplished much, was arrogant in his attitude toward Erzhu Shilong, blaming Erzhu Shilong for failing to sufficiently warn Erzhu Rong. Erzhu Shilong apologized profusely, but bore resentment against Erzhu Zhao after that point. However, Erzhu Zhao soon returned to Jinyang, leaving Erzhu Shilong in control of Luoyang and the imperial administration. Erzhu Shilong, meanwhile, apprehensive that Yuan Ye's mother Lady Wei might exert political influence, had her assassinated, but staging the assassination to look like a robbery. Subsequent control of power Erzhu Zhao soon had Emperor Xiaozhuang strangled to death. In light of the Erzhus' death, they controlled all the important functions of the government, and Erzhu Shilong controlled the imperial government, quickly reorganizing it and restoring order in Luoyang. Erzhu Zhao was recognized the paramount military authority, and controlled the provinces north of the Yellow River, while Erzhu Rong's nephew Erzhu Tianguang controlled the Guanzhong region, and Erzhu Shilong's brother Erzhu Zhongyuan (ÁàæÊú±‰ª≤ÈÅ†) controlled the southeastern provinces. In early 531, before the new emperor Yuan Ye could arrive in Luoyang, Erzhu Shilong and his brothers Erzhu Zhongyuan and Erzhu Yanbo (ÁàæÊú±ÂΩ•‰ºØ), as well as Erzhu Tianguang, because Yuan Ye's lineage was distant from that of recent emperors, believed him to be an inappropriate choice as emperor. Erzhu Tianguang proposed Yuan Gong the Prince of Guangling, a grandson of Emperor Xianwen, who had been well regarded by the populace. Erzhu Shilong sent Erzhu Yanbo to force Yuan Gong to accept the throne, and Yuan Gong agreed. When Yuan Ye arrived in Luoyang, Erzhu Shilong forced him to yield the throne to Yuan Gong, who took the throne as Emperor Jiemin. (Erzhu Zhao, who was not consulted, was initially angry and considered attacking Erzhu Shilong. He only calmed down after Erzhu Shilong sent Erzhu Yanbo to Jinyang to explain the decision to him.) Erzhu Shilong, by this point, had grown complacent and arrogant, and no longer paid as much attention to handling his duties as well as he had done during Emperor Xiaozhuang's reign. He tried to appease military commanders by promoting most of them to generals, and as a result, the \\"general\\" title became no longer a valued one. Defeat by Gao Huan and death Meanwhile, the other members of the Erzhu clan were also growing corrupt, particularly Erzhu Zhongyuan. The general Gao Huan, who had been a follower of Erzhu Rong, believed that the Erzhus could be overthrown, and rebelled in summer 531. The members of the Erzhu clan were largely unconcerned, due to Gao's inferiority in numbers, but Erzhu Shilong, knowing Gao's abilities, was concerned. Gao soon declared another distant member of the imperial Yuan clan, Yuan Lang, emperor. When the Erzhu forces converged at Guang'a (Âª£Èòø, in modern Xingtai, Hebei) to face Gao, Gao used false rumors to make them suspicious of each other‚Äîby making Erzhu Zhao believe that Erzhu Shilong and his brothers were conspiring against him, and by making Erzhu Shilong and Erzhu Zhongyuan believing that Erzhu Zhao was conspiring with Gao. As a result, after a major quarrel between Erzhu Zhao and Erzhu Zhongyuan, Erzhu Zhongyuan and Erzhu Rong's cousin Erzhu Dul√º (ÁàæÊú±Â∫¶Âæã) withdrew, leaving Erzhu Zhao, albeit with still a much larger army than Gao's, alone against Gao. Gao subsequently defeated him, and, brushing his army aside, continued to advance south, entering the important city Yecheng in spring 532. The Erzhu forces recoalesced, and to cement the unity, under Erzhu Shilong's suggestion, Emperor Jiemin married a daughter of Erzhu Zhao as his empress. Erzhu Zhao thereafter made a counterattack, trying to capture Yecheng, but was defeated by Gao. After the defeat, instead of turning his army back to Luoyang to join with Erzhu Shilong and Erzhu Tianguang (who had by this point arrived from his base in Chang'an), Erzhu Zhao returned to Jinyang. The general Husi Chun rose against the Erzhus at Luoyang, capturing Erzhu Shilong and Erzhu Yanbo, and then beheaded them outside the city gates.

Design and development  The RB.106 was a two-shaft design with two axial flow compressors each driven by its own single stage turbine and reheat. It was of similar size to the Rolls-Royce Avon, allowing it to be used as a drop-in replacement, but it would have produced about twice the thrust (with reheat) at 21,750 lbf (96.7 kN). The two-shaft layout was relatively advanced for the era; the single-shaft de Havilland Gyron matched it in power terms, while the two-spool Bristol Olympus was much less powerful at its then-current state of development. Apart from being expected to power British aircraft such as those competing for Operational Requirement F.155 it was selected to be the powerplant for the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow. The American company Westinghouse was reported in 1956 to be serious about acquiring a licence to build the RB.106. A scaled-up version of the RB.106 intended for F.155 was the Rolls-Royce RB.122. The competing Bristol two-spool engine to the same specification was to have been the Bristol Zeus. However funding was cut with the 1957 Defence White Paper which terminated most aircraft development then under way.

He is also known as Justin de Jacobis and Saint Giustino de Jacobis. Life Giustino de Jacobis was born on 9 October 1800 at San Fele in the Province of Potenza. On 17 October 1818 he entered the Congregation of the Mission at Naples and made his religious vows there on 18 October 1820. He was ordained to the priesthood at Brindisi on 12 June 1824. After spending some time in the care of souls at Oria and Monopoli he became superior first at Lecce and then at Naples. In 1839 he was appointed as the first Prefect Apostolic of Ethiopia and entrusted with the foundation of Catholic missions there. After laboring with great success in Ethiopia for almost a decade he was appointed as the Titular Bishop of Nilopolis in 1847 and not long afterwards the Vicar Apostolic. However he refused the episcopal honor until it was forced upon him in 1849, when he received his episcopal consecration. Despite imprisonment and exile combined with other kinds of persecution from the local Ethiopian Church he founded numerous Catholic missions. Jacobis also built schools in Agame and Akele Guzay for the training of a native priesthood and in the process founding the beginnings of the Ethiopian Catholic Church and the Eritrean Catholic Church. He died in 1860 at Hebo of what is now the Southern Administrative Region of Eritrea, while en route to Halai, where he hoped to regain his health.  Gabra Mika'el  Jacobis befriended an Orthodox monk named Gabra Mika'el. After some time Jacobis converted his friend to Catholicism and eventually ordained him to the priesthood. Together they co- wrote a catechism and established a seminary. Gabra was imprisoned at the same time as Jacobis, but he did not survive the maltreatment by his jailers. For his martyrdom, Gabra was beatified in 1926. The pair's friendship is recognized in a preamble to Catholic prayer: \\"Eternal Father, through the intercession of Saint Justin de Jacobis, grant me friends who will accompany me in joy and in suffering.\\" Sainthood The canonization process commenced in Ethiopia in 1891 in an informative process that finished in 1894. Theologians approved his writings in 1902 as being in line with the magisterium of the faith. The apostolic process then opened not long after in 1904 and concluded less than a decade later in 1913. The two processes received formal validation in Rome on 9 December 1915. The formal commencement of the cause - in the pontificate of Pope Pius X - came on 13 July 1904 after having received the approval of the Congregation of Rites. Jacobis was declared to be Venerable on 28 July 1935 after Pope Pius XI acknowledged the late bishop's life of heroic virtue. Pope Pius XII beatified him on 25 June 1939 while Pope Paul VI canonized him as a saint on 26 October 1975.[Solenne rito di canonizzazione del vescovo Giustino de Jocobis] vatican.ve, article in Italian References Sources Devin, A., (English trans by Lady Elizabeth Herbert of Lea), Abyssinia and its Apostle (biography) (1867) London: Burns and Oates. *Edition of A.

It was promoted independently but supported by the Caledonian Railway, and it was designed to connect Balloch (on Loch Lomond) and Dumbarton with central Glasgow, linking in heavy industry on the north bank of the River Clyde. From Dumbarton to Balloch the line would have closely duplicated an existing railway, and negotiation led to the latter being made jointly operated, and the L&DR; terminated immediately east of Dumbarton, trains continuing on the joint section. Since the twentieth century the county is now spelled Dunbartonshire, but at the time of formation of the Company, Dumbartonshire was in common use, and that is the spelling the company adopted. The line opened progressively from 1894 to 1896. It was very successful in attracting goods traffic from heavy industry on Clydeside, and in carrying workers to and from their places of work. This was enhanced by the connection to the Glasgow Central Railway. Heavy industry declined after 1950 and passenger and goods use of the line declined similarly, and the British Railways modernisation plan proposed electrification and upgrading of the parallel former North British Railway route, and closure of the former L&DR; line. The electrification was commissioned in 1960 and the L&DR; route closed in 1964 except for a short section near Dumbarton. History The Caledonian and Dumbartonshire Junction Railway System map of the Lanarkshire and Dumbarton RailwayThe Caledonian Railway was authorised in 1845 to build its trunk line from Glasgow and Edinburgh to Carlisle: that line opened in 1847 - 1848. During the lengthy period of planning the route and obtaining its Act of Parliament, the Caledonian set about gaining control of other Scottish railway companies. Many other lines were being promoted at that time of easy availability of capital, and the Caledonian quickly secured the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway and agreed leases of several other lines, mostly north of the central belt. There was much industry in the valley of the River Leven and at Dumbarton itself, and independent promoters put forward a line that would run from Glasgow to Dumbarton and Balloch. The connection in Glasgow was to be with the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway (E&GR;) near Cowlairs, broadly following the present-day Westerton route. In 1846 the line obtained an authorising Act of Parliament; it was to be called the Caledonian and Dumbartonshire Junction Railway (C&DJR;).The use of \\"Caledonian\\" in the title appears to have referred to Scotland rather than the trunk railway. The Caledonian expressed interest in the line and offered to lease the line on its completion, and subscribed to some shares. The C&DJR; decided that the Caledonian Railway would be a better partner than the E&GR;, and in 1847 successfully presented another Bill to Parliament, proposing an alteration of the terminal in Glasgow so as to connect with the Caledonian. In fact the G&DJR; had serious trouble raising capital, and only succeeded in constructing its line from Bowling through Dumbarton to Balloch. The terminal at Bowling was at the basin of the Forth and Clyde Canal; the canal was in the process of being acquired by the Caledonian Railway at the time. The G&DJR; opened in 1850.David Ross, The Caledonian: Scotland's Imperial Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, Stewart Noble, The Vanished Railways of Old Western Dunbartonshire, The History Press, Stroud, 2010, The Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway Money for railway construction had been difficult to come by, but the situation eased after 1850 and the attraction of connecting Dumbarton to Glasgow resulted in a new proposal: the Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway. This was authorised in 1855 and opened in 1858. It connected end on to the C&DJR; at Bowling, and extended from Dalreoch to Helensburgh. The C&DJR; formed the central section of the route, and a revenue apportioning system was agreed. The company was taken over by the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway in 1862 and that company formed part of the North British Railway in 1865.David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, The line ran from Glasgow to Bowling on the north side of the River Clyde, but at some distance from the shore. In the years following the construction, industry developed with increasing intensity close to the shore, especially at Yoker and Clydebank. As navigation on the Clyde was improved, larger port facilities were developed, and the Queens Dock was opened in 1880 at Stobcross (now the location of the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre).Construction of Queen's Dock at The Glasgow Story website The North British Railway built a branch to the dock. The Glasgow Central Railway In 1888 the Glasgow Central Railway was authorised; supported by the Caledonian Railway, it was to run from Dalmarnock to Maryhill through the centre of Glasgow, with a low level station under Glasgow Central, and making a connection at Stobcross to the extensive dock sidings there. The line was prodigiously difficult to construct, and it did not open throughout until 1896. It was heavily used for suburban passenger purposes, but also by goods trains to and from the dock. The Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Railway approved The Caledonian Railway had no access to any of the industry and dock sites on the north bank of the Clyde west of Stobcross (except at the Bowling canal basin of the Forth and Clyde Canal, having bought out the canal in 1853). The company used a variant spelling of 'Dunbartonshire'. In 1891 a Parliamentary Bill was submitted for the Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Railway (L&DR;). It was nominally independent, although promoted with heavy Caledonian support, and the authorising Act was passed on 5 August 1891.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 Coming later than the urban development of the city, the line was forced to take a circuitous route with several tunnel sections to penetrate the hilly topography. The Glasgow Central Railway joined the Caledonian on the south side, but the L&DR; was to spring from junctions at Balornock, near Provanmill on the line out of the Buchanan Street terminus, on the north-east side of the city. A branch from Balornock to Hamiltonhill had been promoted in 1883; intended to serve iron foundries and other industry along the route of the Forth and Clyde Canal there. The route arched round north of Springburn Park, but land acquisition problems prevented the line from being completed at Hamiltonhill. The L&DR; route was now to use the first part of the Hamiltonhill line as far as Possil, then continuing west and crossing under the River Kelvin to a new through station at Maryhill, joining the Glasgow Central Railway near there, giving onward access to Stobcross. From Maryhill the L&DR; continued west and then south in tunnel to a triangular junction near the bank of the Clyde. An eastward arm led through Partick to the Stobcross station of the Central line; the westward arm continued close to the river through Scotstoun and Yoker, serving numerous industrial sites, then looping north at Clydebank. Crossing over and then under the North British line, it continued between the Forth and Clyde Canal and the Clyde to Bowling, where it crossed to the north of the canal and the NBR line, then looping south of the NBR at Dumbuck to a new Dumbarton East station, finally joining the North British line at Dumbarton Junction. The Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire line was originally proposed (in 1891) to run through Dumbarton to Aber Bay, near Ross Priory on the east shore of Loch Lomond. This would have closely followed the North British line in the confines of the valley of the River Leven. The duplication aroused considerable opposition from residents and shareholders, and the compromise had been reached that the section of the existing line from Dumbarton to Balloch would be made joint. This arrangement was confirmed by Act of Parliament of 27 July 1892, and incidentally included transfer to joint control of steamers on Loch Lomond. From Dumbarton Junction the NBR line to Balloch was to be transferred to joint control, between the NBR, the L&DR; and the Caledonian Railway, on the day that the L&DR; opened its line for passengers to that point. The joint section would be called the Dumbarton and Balloch Joint Railway.David Turnock, The Historical Geography of Scotland Since 1707, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1982, Construction and opening The Caledonian Railway subscribed ¬£82,000 to the building of the line, but the majority of the capital was readily subscribed by industrialists in the area to be served; efficient and convenient transport was essential to the heavy industries. The Caledonian agreed to work the line for 4% of the capital. Work on construction started on 6 October 1891. On 26 November 1894 the line opened for goods between Maryhill and Balornock Junction. The stub of the Hamiltonhill branch remained connected for the time being, and after 1901 it came into good use delivering supplies to the Ruchill Hospital. (Some of the residual unused land was sold in May 1919.) The next section opened from Maryhill Central via Kelvinside and Crow Road to the triangular junction at Partick, and between Stobcross and Clydebank on 1 May 1896. The line was extended to Dumbarton on 15 June 1896. Also opened from Maryhill Central via Kelvinside and Crow Road to a triangular junction at Partick on 1 May 1896. These openings were for goods trains only: Maryhill had passenger services from 10 August 1896, Possil from 1 Feb 1897 for workmen only, and was fully open from 1 October 1897; on the same day passenger services reached Dawsholm (Glasgow Central Railway). The line to Dumbarton was fully open from 1 October 1896, from which date the Dumbarton and Balloch Joint Railway was created.John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, The L&DR; generated considerable business from the many heavy industrial sites along the Clyde; the company provided sidings connections from its main line free of charge. However the very large Singer factory provided no goods traffic during the L&DR; period: the North British Railway already served it, and concluded a long term exclusive traffic agreement with it before completion of the L&DR; line. Taken over by the Caledonian Railway Map showing the line from Maryhill to Springburn Park (Robroyston) in 1923The L&DR; line was worked by the Caledonian and its income was guaranteed by that company; moreover the Caledonian had increased its shareholding substantially, and on 1 August 1909 the L&DR; was vested in the Caledonian Railway. As shipping activity increased, a new Rothesay Dock opened at Clydebank on 25 April 1907. This abstracted much export traffic from traditional ports and docks. The Caledonian Railway built a connecting line from the LD&R; line in anticipation of this. Because the line was on viaduct at the locality, the branch diverged from the main line further east, at Scotstoun, and ran north of Dumbarton Road, crossing back under the road and the L&DR; main line west of the Yoker - Renfrew Ferry and Kelso Street. The intensive concentration of industry along the north bank of the Clyde brought enormous traffic volumes of goods and passengers to the line: workers travelled considerable distances, on trains making use of the Glasgow Central Railway. Tramway competition was severe for ordinary passenger travel, but the concentrated volumes of travel to and from work could only be handled by railways, and the Caledonian and the North British between them controlled that. In 1947 the Forth and Clyde Canal and the Bowling basin were still important: > The quays extend to 740 feet with six lines of rails, and there is a wharf > of a length of 460 feet fronting the River Clyde. A considerable quantity of > exported coal and imported ores, minerals , iron and steel and general > traffic is handled at Bowling ...Stephenson Locomotive Society, Caledonian > Railway Centenary: 1847 to 1947, London, 1947 The Railways Act 1921 brought about the \\"grouping\\" of the main line railways of Great Britain, and from 1923 the Caledonian Railway was a constituent of the new London Midland and Scottish Railway; the rival NBR was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway, so the competition continued, and the Dumbarton and Balloch Joint Railway was now joint between those two companies. From 1948 The railways were nationalised in 1948, and the lines in Scotland formed part of the new Scottish Region of British Railways. Although the competitive pressure was abated, the former L&DR; route and the NBR route served different residential and industrial areas, and for some time both routes continued largely unchanged. However industrial patterns were changing substantially, especially from the rise of low-cost heavy industry and mineral extraction in Asia and South America, and the exhaustion of many of the Lanarkshire coal and iron pits. This led to the decline of the industries served by the railway. At the same time motor bus services improved in efficiency substantially, and it was clear that the parallel railways needed to be modernised and simplified. It was decided to electrify the line between Glasgow and Balloch and Helensburgh, but to retain only one of the duplicate routes: the former NBR route. However immediately east of Dumbarton the former L&DR; line served industrial complexes as well as Dumbarton East station in a large residential area, so that part of the route was retained. The two lines came close to one another at Dunglass, a little east of Bowling, and a connection was installed there, so that trains from Glasgow on the NBR route could switch to the L&DR; line. The new arrangement started with a skeleton service on 5 November 1960, when electric trains between Glasgow and Balloch and Helensburgh were in operation. A full service ran from the following day. Steam trains on the L&DR; route from Glasgow to Balloch continued for the time being. On 30 October 1960, during trial running, a transformer explosion occurred in an electric train at Charing Cross, Glasgow; and on 13 December a serious explosion occurred in the guard's compartment of an electric train at Renton, and this was followed by other serious problems and the electric service was suspended.Ministry of Transport, Failures of Multiple-unit Electric Trains on British Railways: Final Report, HMSO, London, 1962 Steam trains resumed (although some steam engines had been taken out of service permanently). The normal electric service was finally resumed after modifications to the electrical equipment in the trains on 1 October 1961.J C Gillham, The Age of the Electric Train, Ian Allan Limited, London, 1988, The ordinary running of steam trains on the L&DR; route to Glasgow continued until 1964, when that line was closed. The entire former L&DR; network was now closed to passenger operation, except for the section between Dunglass and Dumbarton Junction, which carried the new frequent electric passenger service, currently (2015) operated by Abellio ScotRail. Goods services were maintained over certain sections of the route to serve industrial premises. From Old Kilpatrick to Glasgow continued until 1993; in 1976 a connection to the NBR line was laid in between Kilbowie and Clydebank, and the L&DR; section eastwards was closed. The dock at Clydebank continued to be served from Stobcross until 1980; from Stobcross to Possil continued in use until 1966; and the section from Possil to Balornock closed in 1965.

Pathmanaban () is a former Malaysian deputy minister, vice-president of Malaysian Indian Congress and founder of Melaka Manipal Medical College. Early life Born in Bukit Bertam Estate, Linggi, Negeri Sembilan, he obtained his Master of Arts in Public Administration in Economic Development from Harvard University. He was among the first batch of Bachelor of Arts graduates majoring in Economics from the University of Malaya in Singapore in 1959. Before venturing into politics, he served as Assistant Secretary of the Labour and Manpower Ministry from 1960 and Director of Social Economics in the Economic Planning Unit (EPU) in the Prime Minister's Department from 1968 until his resignation to contest the Teluk Kemang parliamentary seat in 1974. Political career Pathmanaban was initially encouraged to join the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) and enter politics by Tun Abdul Razak, who saw his potential and his education from a prestigious university as invaluable. He was inducted by the then president of MIC, Tan Sri V. Manickavasagam, as part of his process of infusing new blood into the party, especially those who are young, well-educated and could contribute to the party. He served as Teluk Kemang Member of Parliament for four terms. Prior to that, he joined the Malaysian Indian Congress in 1974 and the following year was a member of the MIC Central Working Committee. Pathmanaban served as MIC vice-president for three terms from 1979 until his retirement from active politics in 1991. Pathmanaban actively fought for the rights of Malaysian Indians, especially in the field of education. He realised the importance education could bring about in uplifting the Indian community. He headed the MIC's Education Bureau and used to collect information on all students rejected by government universities. Pathmanaban used to lead MIC delegations to visit every vice-chancellor to give more places to Malaysian Indian students who had just missed the cut-off point. In fact, the Malaysian Chinese Association used to be jealous of the MIC in having this special privilege.Samy Vellu and the Blue Book The former MIC vice-president was Deputy Labour and Manpower Minister for five years from 1976. Pathmanaban was Deputy Health Minister for seven years from 1981. He last served in the government as Deputy Human Resources Minister from June 1989 to October 1990. His retirement from politics was apparently due to differences with MIC president, Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu. Social Service Following his retirement, Pathmanaban was active in social service. He felt there was nothing greater than helping a fellow man. He actively sought ways to help the poor and disadvantaged Indian community in Malaysia. He also served as a member of the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (Suhakam) following the setting up of the commission until his demise. Pathmanaban was the founding chairman of Melaka Manipal Medical College. He was instrumental in getting both the Prime Ministers and governments of Malaysia and India to give their nod for his pet project which offers a twinning medical programme between both countries. His main purpose of setting up the medical college was to provide high quality medical education opportunities to Malaysians at an affordable price, particularly for Malaysians of Indian ethnicity. Demise Datuk K. Pathmanaban died due to kidney and liver failure at the Pantai Medical Centre in Kuala Lumpur at around 1am on 9 June 2001. He was just one day short of his 64th birthday. His remains were cremated at the Hindu crematorium in Cheras and the ashes were taken to Port Dickson to be scattered in the sea according to Hindu rites.

The collection includes paintings, sculptures, objects and photographs from the 20th century, plus over 2,500 graphics, spanning Expressionism through classic modern art to the present day. History The museum's original location, from 1947 until 2009, was a building on the Ostwall (a road in central Dortmund following the old city walls), including a small sculpture garden. The previous building on the site had been the Museum f√ºr Kunst und Kulturgeschichte (MKK), a municipal art collection, from 1911 until its destruction in World War II; before 1911 it housed the old Westphalia Mining Authority.Die Geschichte des Museums Ostwall im Dortmunder U - ehemals Museum am Ostwall History of the museum. A gradual rebuilding, using construction materials from the ruins of the MKK, began in the late 1940s. The first exhibition at the Museum am Ostwall was held in 1949 ‚Äì making it one of Germany's first post-war museums of 20th-century art ‚Äì and it continued to be expanded until 1956. The MKK, meanwhile, was provisionally rehomed in Cappenberg Castle until its return to Dortmund in 1983. In June 2009 the original building closed its doors, and the museum began relocating into the U-Tower, where it reopened under the new, shortened name Museum Ostwall in October 2010.

At the heart of the collection are works by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Otto Mueller, Emil Nolde and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, who founded the movement Die Br√ºcke in Dresden in 1905. The avant-garde Blaue Reiter group, started in 1912, is represented here by the works of Wassily Kandinsky, Franz Marc, August Macke and Alexej von Jawlensky. The collection of Jawlensky is the second-largest in Germany, after that of the Museum Wiesbaden. The museum also owns 26 graphics by Pablo Picasso from the 1940s and '50s, plus others by Joan Mir√≥, Marc Chagall and Salvador Dal√≠. The collection includes a single work each by Otto Dix, Lyonel Feininger, Alberto Giacometti, Paul Klee, Oskar Kokoschka and Oskar Schlemmer. Among the still lifes, the highlight is Christian Rohlfs. In the early 1990s the museum acquired over 1,000 works from the collection of the artist Siegfried Cremer, by artists including Marcel Duchamp, Joseph Beuys, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell, G√ºnther Uecker and Jean Tinguely, strengthening the museum's coverage of the Fluxus, ZERO and \\"informal art\\" movements.

Biography He was born at M√ºnster in Westphalia on 1 March 1833; died at Leuven (Louvain), 12 January 1895. He belonged to an intensely Catholic family of Westphalia; like him, two of his brothers entered the Catholic clergy, one joining the Society of Jesus and the other becoming a missionary in the United States. After finishing his studies with brilliant success at the public schools of his native town, he entered the German College at Rome through the mediation of the bishop's secretary, afterwards Cardinal Melchers, and made his philosophical and theological studies in the Gregorian College. In 1854 he received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy; he was ordained priest in Rome on 8 June 1857, and two years later received the degree of Doctor of Theology. He then returned to Germany, and worked for a short time as chaplain in the church of St. Adelgunde at Emmerich. Malou, bishop of Bruges, in Rome in 1854 when Jungmann made his public defence of the philosophical theses, called him in September, 1861, to the chair of philosophy in the Petit S√©minaire at Roeselare. Four years later (1865) he became professor of theology in the ecclesiastical seminary at Bruges. Even at Roeselare, while performing his duties as teacher, he began that literary activity, which was thenceforth ever associated with his professorial duties. His appointment to the chair of ecclesiastical history at Leuven University, in succession to G. Henry Wouters, opened in 1871 a wider field for his great ability. A keen intellect with powers of clear exposition, joined to the spirited delivery which distinguished his lectures, ensured him great success. He enlarged the field of ecclesiastico-historical studies by delivering special lectures on patrology, and establishing in 1890 a seminary for ecclesiastical history, in which students were to receive a scientific and methodical training in original historical research. Jungmann remained to the end of his life a professor at Leuven, declining the honour of a call to be professor of dogmatic theology in the newly founded Catholic University at Washington. He was seized with a fit of apoplexy at the burial of a colleague, and died at Leuven in 1895. Works His activity as a writer was equal to his energy as a lecturer. As professor of philosophy he wrote \\"Demonstratio christiana. I. Demonstrationis christian√¶ pr√¶ambula philosophica\\" (Roeselare, 1864; 2nd ed., 1867). In the domain of theology he wrote his \\"Institutiones theologi√¶ dogmatic√¶ specialis\\" in five tracts, widely used and much appreciated for their clear style: \\"De Gratia\\" (Bruges, 1866; 5th ed., Ratisbon, 1882); \\"De Deo uno et trino\\" (Bruges, 1867; 4th ed., Ratisbon, 1882); \\"De Deo Creatore\\" (Bruges, 1868; 4th ed., Ratisbon, 1883); \\"De Verbo incarnato\\" (Bruges, 1869; 4th ed., Ratisbon, 1884); \\"De quattuor novissimis\\" (Ratisbon, 1871; 3rd ed., 1885). He wrote also the \\"Institutiones theologi√¶ dogmatic√¶ generalis\\" (Bruges, 1871; 4th ed., Ratisbon, 1886). In church history he first re-edited Wouter's \\"Histori√¶ ecclesiastic√¶ compendium\\" (3 volumes, Louvain, 1879), and later published special studies, particularly on theological controversies and on the papacy: \\"Dissertationes select√¶ in historiam ecclesiasticam\\" (5 volumes, Ratisbon, 1880). In patrology, he issued Josef Fessler's Institutiones Patrologi√¶ in a new and much enlarged edition (2 volumes, Innsbruck, 1890, 1892, 1896). He contributed numerous articles to German and French journals, particularly worthy of mention being: \\"Die neue franz√∂sische Fortschrittsphilosophie\\" in the \\"Katholik\\" (Mainz, 1865); \\"Die hl. M√§rtyrer von Gorkum\\", ibid. (1867); \\"Clemens V. und die Aufhebung des Templerordens\\" in the \\"Zeitschrift f√ºr kath.

The well-preserved funeral bundles of the Paracas have allowed archaeologists to study their funeral rituals in detail. Over 429 funeral bundes containing gift textiles, reams of plain cloth, and various ritual paraphernalia have been excavated from a necropolis at Cerro Colorado. These artifacts offer the largest source of pre-Columbian Andean textile arts known to date. The naked body of the deceased is bundled in the fetal position before rigor mortis sets in. A long strip of coarse cotton cloth was then wrapped around the body. Along with the bodies, different kinds of memorabilia have been found, including clothing, food, scraps of cloth or clothed dolls with religious embroidered motifs, and small badges of gold, and these \\"gifts\\" form the nucleus of the bundle. Many fabrics interred with the dead were created for expressly for the funerary ritual, and were not worn during life. In adult burials, one usually finds on this nucleus an additional layer, formed of pieces of ceremonial garments, decorated with embroideries and protected by several sheets of cotton fabric. These were cooked and tied with cord to facilitate the transportation of the bundle to the burial site. Facing the bundle, mourners would place between one and seven ceramic pieces. A pole or a cane indicated the precise place of the burial. Individuals of major status received more textile gifts and, in this case, the number of layers increased substantially: up to three successive layers could be added onto the nucleus. These layers, and in particular the last one, usually contained decorative embroidered cloaks. The burials have a collective character, as it is thought that related individuals were generally buried together in the caverns dug in the rock or in the sand. In several cases, it has been determined that remains were transported and re-interred some years after death. Burial areas are located next to established living places. Often, an area that was inhabited earlier by the living, such as the ruins of houses and public buildings, were used for a necropolis.

It is one of the three Hessian State museums, in addition to the museums in Kassel and Darmstadt.  History  The foundation of the originally three museums traces back to the citizens of the city and to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who stayed in Wiesbaden in 1814/1815 for a rehabilitation measure, and worked hard to establish such a cultural institution. In 1825 he persuaded the Frankfurter private collector to donate his extensive collections of works of art, antiquities and in kind to the Duchy of Nassau in return for the payment of an annuity for life. Under the responsibility of the newly founded associations, but controlled by the ducal government, the citizens of Wiesbaden and the region were able to quickly expand these collections. Together with the pieces of the (\\"Association for Nassauian Antiquity and Historical Research\\") founded in 1812, three originally independent museums emerged. In addition to the Verein f√ºr Nassauische Altertumskunde und Geschichtsforschung the (\\"Nassau Society of Natural Science)\\" and the (\\"Nassau Kunstverein\\") (art society) were responsible for these museums. Following the death of the Duke, the Hereditary Prince's Palace at Wilhelmstra√üe, built for his son, was now available for other purposes. In contrast to other cities, at a very early stage it was possible to find rooms for the cultural assets collected by the citizenry. In 1821 the three museums and the regional library of Hessen were thus able to move into the palace, which is nowadays the seat of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Wiesbaden. Around the middle of the 19th century the building became too small, due to the busy collection activities and new acquisitions. The call for a new building became louder and louder. After the three museums came under Prussian control in 1866, the city of Wiesbaden took over these institutions in 1899. This change was generally accepted because Wiesbaden had sufficient funds at the end of the 19th century to promote culture. According to plans by architect Theodor Fischer, the foundation stone for a new building with three wings was laid at the corner of Wilhelmstra√üe/Rheinstra√üe in 1913. Previously, the banker's mansion Mons had stood there, in which the reception building of Ludwigsbahnhof was housed until 1906. The interior design of the three houses was influenced to a large extent by the three directors and the curators, as there were different needs. The first to open was the Gem√§ldegalerie on October 1, 1915. In the same year the Natural Sciences Collection was also able to move into the new building, but it was not until after the end of the First World War that the Natural Sciences Museum and the Museum of Nassau Antiquities reopened on 15 July 1920. Half of the picture gallery was to be used for changing exhibitions, which were carried out by the Nassauischer Kunstverein in the 1920s and early 1930s. During this time, citizens of Wiesbaden also contributed to important additions to the collections. The natural science collections showed systematic exhibitions on topics of geology, paleontology and biology. Ecological aspects were also presented for the first time. During the Second World War, the building was partly used for military purposes. With few exceptions, the collections survived the war unscathed. However, the exhibitions were dismantled and most of the showcases were damaged. Only slowly the rooms were able to regain their original function after renovation. This delay had another reason: the Americans, who moved to Wiesbaden after 1945, turned the museum into a Central Collecting Point. Temporarily stored art treasures were shown, such as the bust of Nefertiti or the painting The Man with the Golden Helmet, which was attributed to Rembrandt at the time. After their return, a collection was rebuilt from the 1950s onwards with very few resources. Clemens Weiler played a major role in the construction of the Alexej von Jawlensky-Collection, which is today the most important collection of the house. The Natural Science Museum was largely rebuilt by Friedrich Heineck, who was impeached of office during the war. It was the aim of the museum to show in particular info on the biomes in the exhibitions. The reconstruction was not entirely successful, partly because rooms were still being used by other people (e. g. by an American library and an urban archive). In 1973 the three museums came into the possession of the state of Hesse. Since that time they have been united in a three-division house, the Museum Wiesbaden. The (\\"Nassau Kunstverein\\"), which had previously been housed in the museum, was moved to the historic villa on Wilhelmstra√üe 15 in the immediate vicinity. Since 2010 Alexander Klar has been director of the museum. He succeeds Volker Rattemeyer, who ran the museum for 23 years. Under his leadership, in 2007 it was elected by the International Association of Art Critics (Association Internationale des Critiques d' Art (AICA)) as Museum of the Year. From 1994 to 1997, the Kassel architects Schultze and Schulze completely renovated the rooms of the art collection, from 2003 to 2006 the roofs, the entrance area and the lecture hall and opened up new exhibition rooms of the art collection. From 2007 to 2012, the north and south wings were to be renovated. In the north wing, the natural history collection can be shown again from 2013 onwards. According to press reports and reports from the state government, the collection of Nassauian antiquities SNA was handed over to the city of Wiesbaden in 2009. The Old Masters are to be shown in the freed south wing. From 1994 to 1997, the Kassel architects Schultze and Schulze completely renovated the rooms of the art collection, from 2003 to 2006 the roofs, the entrance area and the lecture hall and opened up new exhibition rooms of the art collection. From 2007 to 2012, the north and south wings were renovated. Since 2013, the natural history collection is now on show in the north wing. The Collection of Nassau Antiquities is now shown at the Stadtmuseum am Markt in Wiesbaden. In the freed south wing, the Old Masters are presented in connection with contemporary art The chronological sequence was abandoned in favour of spaces on the themes \\"religion\\", \\"portrait\\", \\"mythology\\", \\"still life\\" and \\"landscape\\".  Art collection  The museum's art collection dates back to the former collection of Johann Isaak von Gerning from Frankfurt. Through purchases, donations and loans, the art collection has become one of the most important in Germany, especially in the area of the 19th and 20th centuries. The Museum Wiesbaden endeavours to identify Nazi plunder in its own collection and, if necessary, to return it to the legitimate heirs. In October 2014, the museum therefore launched a spectacular campaign entitled Wiesbaden schafft die Wende! (\\"Wiesbaden is making the turn!\\") The painting Die Labung by Hans von Mar√©es, stolen by the Nazi regime in 1935, came into the possession of the museum in 1980. It was still shown in the context of this action, but only the reverse of the painting. It was not until the beginning of November, by which time donations had already raised enough money for the now legitimate purchase, that the painting could be turned back.  Sculptures  Sculptures do not play a significant role in the art collection of the Museum Wiesbaden. However, some interesting works are represented. French sculpture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries is presented with a work by one of its main representatives, Aristide Maillol's Badende. The German sculptors of the first half of the 20th century are represented by Max Klinger (portrait bust of Friedrich Nietzsche, ca. 1910), Franz von Stuck, Georg Kolbe, Wilhelm Lehmbruck, Gerhard Marcks, Emy Roeder and Ernst Barlach (Der Tod, 1925).  Graphic art  Compared to the collection of paintings, the graphic art collection is less important. Work before 1800 is scarce. In the 19th century, on the other hand, there are a number of works by Ludwig Knaus, Arnold B√∂cklin, Hans von Mar√©es and Max Slevogt, among others. In the first half of the 20th century, the expressionists stand out, especially Alexej von Jawlensky (see Alexej von Jawlensky-Collection, excellently represented with drawings, woodcuts and Lithographs). These include works by Die Br√ºcke-artists such as Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Erich Heckel and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, as well as works by the artists of the Blaue Reiter-Editorial Association. Of particular note are works by Franz Marc, August Macke and above all Wassily Kandinsky's watercolour Allerheiligen (\\"All Saints\\", 1910) from the collection of . Works by other artists of the time, such as Edvard Munch, Otto Dix, Oskar Kokoschka, K√§the Kollwitz and Pablo Picasso, can also be found. Constructivist works, including those by L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy, the artist couple Robert Michel and Ella Bergmann-Michel, as well as Friedrich Vordemberge-Gildewart, form another focal point of the collection. The graphic art collection after 1945 is extensive, which is why only a few names are mentioned here. Informalism is represented by works by Karl Otto G√∂tz, Otto Greis and Bernard Schultze. Further sheets from the 1940s and 1950s come from Willi Baumeister, HAP Grieshaber and above all from the extensive Ernst Wilhelm Nay collection. Minimalist tendencies are shown in the works of Sol LeWitt. Pop art is represented by Thomas Bayrle, among others.  Old Masters  Compared to the 19th and 20th century collections, the Old Masters are rarely represented in the Museum. The focus is on Italian and Dutch artists from the 15th century onwards. The most important Italians are Prospero Fontana, Albertino Piazza (Heimsuchung Mariae, \\"Visitation of Mary\\")), Domenico Tintoretto, Marietta Robusti, Sebastiano del Piombo, Alessandro Rosi, Luca Giordano, Francesco Solimena, Sebastiano Ricci, Cristoforo Munari and Gennaro Greco. Dutch painting is represented by artists such as Joos van Cleve (Christuskind mit Weintraube, \\"Christ Child with Grape\\"), Albrecht Bouts, Otto van Veen, Joos de Momper, Frans Floris, Roelant Savery, Gerard van Honthorst, Willem van de Velde, Willem van de Velde, Jan Lievens, Frans Snyders (Stillleben, \\"Still life\\") and Nicolaes Berchem. Late German Gothic and Renaissance art is represented by the Master of the Heisterbach Altar, the Master of the Holy Family, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Bartholomew Bruyn the Elder and Hans Muelich. The German Baroque and Classicism is represented by Johann Conrad Seekatz and January Zick, Nicolas Treu, Johann Georg Platzer und Angelika Kauffmann (Bildnis Johann Isaak von Gerning, 1798 ‚Äì \\"Portrait of Johann Isaak von Gerning\\"). English painting is represented by Joshua Reynolds.  19th- century collection  The 19th century is excellently represented in the collection. Although the great names and French Impressionism are missing, a broad overview for this period is guaranteed. With artists such as Wilhelm von Kobell, Carl Morgenstern and Georg Waldmueller, German genre painting is particularly well represented. Ludwig Knaus from Wiesbaden, who at his time was equally important as Adolph von Menzel, is represented in practically no other museum here. His Spaziergang im Tuileriengarten (\\"Walk in the Tuilerie Garden\\") of around 1855 is an early approach to Impressionism, from which he later withdrew. The D√ºsseldorf school of painting is represented by several works of the brothers Andreas Achenbach and Oswald Achenbach. The Deutschr√∂mer ‚Äì German artists and writers who lived in Rome ‚Äì are represented by Anselm Feuerbach (Nanna, 1861), Arnold B√∂cklin and Hans von Mar√©es. Karl Friedrich Lessing and Johann Wilhelm Schirmer are also featured. Carl Spitzweg (The Butterflycatcher, around 1840), Wilhelm von Kaulbach, Franz von Lenbach and Franz von Stuck form the counterpart of the Munich School. The Leibl-Kreis in Munich is represented extensively, especially by Wilhelm Tr√ºbner, but also Hans Thoma, Carl Schuch and Otto Scholderer are present with paintings in the collection. French realism is featured with works by Gustave Courbet, Jean- Fran√ßois Millet and Charles-Fran√ßois Daubigny, while Russian realism is represented by a work by the Alexej von Jawlensky teacher Ilya Repin from the Ernst Alfred Aye Collection. The collection of this century ends with the works of the main representatives of German Impressionism, Max Liebermann and above all Lovis Corinth, of whom the museum owns five paintings (Portrait von Frau Halbe, 1898) as well as Oskar Moll (Havelk√§hne, 1907) and Christian Rohlfs.  Jawlensky-Collection  The works of the Russian artist Alexej von Jawlensky, who spent the last twenty years of his life in Wiesbaden, are outstanding in the collection of the Museum Wiesbaden. With 57 paintings and 35 graphics, the museum has the largest collection of this artist besides the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena. The collection includes early works such as Stillleben mit Krug und Buch (\\"Still Life with Jug and Book\\", around 1902), many expressive major works such as Dame mit F√§cher (\\"Woman with a Fan\\", 1909), Nikita (1910) or Selbstbildnis (\\"Self-portrait\\", 1912) and, above all, many works of the paintings in series, such as the variations Von Fr√ºhling, Gl√ºck und Sonne (\\"Of Spring, Happiness and Sun\\", 1917) or the Abstract Heads created in Wiesbaden as Kopf in Rot-Wei√ü-Gold (\\"Head in Red-White-Gold\\", 1927) and the meditations as Mein Geist wird weiterleben (\\"My Spirit will live on\\", 1935). Remarkable among the Still lifes is the painting Stillleben mit schwarzer Vase (\\"Still Life with Black Vase\\", 1910) and among the paintings of landscapes by Jawlensky the work Blaue Berge (\\"Blue Mountains\\", 1912). The collection of graphics include lithographs such as Liegender weiblicher Akt(\\"Lying female nude\\", 1912) and drawings including Konstantinowka mit geneigtem Kopf (\\"Konstantinovka with inclined head\\", circa 1912). Most recently, the collection has been extended by eleven paintings and three drawings from the Hanna Bekker vom Rath Collection in 1987, including the portrait Bildnis Marianne von Werefkin (\\"Portrait of Marianne von Werefkin\\") from 1906.  Expressionists and the Hanna Bekker vom Rath collection  Even before World War II, the Museum Wiesbaden had an important collection of works by the Expressionists. In addition, the collection of the Wiesbaden art collector and patron Heinrich Kirchhoff was regularly exhibited, with which many modernist works could be shown. With the Nazi confiscation campaign under the title Entartete Kunst all modern works of art were removed from the museum, so that one had to start again after the war. High quality works were purchased from Paula Modersohn-Becker, Otto Mueller (Liebespaar) (\\"Love Couple\\", 1925), Emil Nolde, Walter Jacob, Conrad Felixm√ºller (Familienbildnis Kirchhoff, \\"Kirchhoff family portrait\\", 1920), Karl Hofer and above all from Jawlensky's companion Marianne von Werefkin (Schindelfabrik, \\"Schindel Factory\\", around 1910). In addition, a work of the Russian Natalia Goncharova was acquired. A milestone in the history of the art collection was the acquisition of a large part of the collection. With this collection, the museum not only received 11 paintings and three drawings by Jawlensky, but also 16 other works of Classical Modernism. Graphics by Wassily Kandinsky and August Macke as well as paintings by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Erich Heckel (painting Maske vor Buschbockfell, \\"Mask in front of Buschbockfell\\", 1913), Adolf H√∂lzel, Ida Kerkovius, Willi Baumeister and Ernst Wilhelm Nay have enriched the collection ever since. In addition, there are five paintings by Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, among which the painting Selbstportrait (\\"Self portrait\\", 1919), and two paintings by Max Beckmann, including the famous painting Weiblicher Akt mit Hund (\\"Female Nude with Dog\\", 1927). After this great enrichment, further individual works from this collection were acquired, to mention above all Jawlensky's painting Heilandsgesicht: Ruhendes Licht (\\"Face of Salvation: Resting Light\\") from 1921.  Constructivist artists  Constructivist art is a focal theme in the collection of the Museum Wiesbaden. Although some of the big names are missing, the collection still offers a good overview. Among others, L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy with his painting Architektur III (1920), Erich Buchholz, Walter Dexel as well as the post-war artists Klaus Staudt, G√ºnter Fruhtrunk and Fran√ßois Morellet are included here. There are large complexes of works by the artist couple Robert Michel and Ella Bergmann- Michel, Anton Stankowski, and above all by Friedrich Vordemberge-Gildewart with the painting complex K 116 (1940). His archive is maintained by the museum.  Art since 1945  The Art collection of the Museum Wiesbaden is one of the most important art collections in Germany after 1945. It starts with Art Informel. Here the German artists Karl Otto G√∂tz (Krakmo, 1958), Otto Greis, Heinz Kreutz, Fred Thieler, Emil Schumacher, Hann Trier, Gerhard Hoehme and Bernard Schultze (Venen und Tang, \\"Veins and Seaweed\\", 1955) are shown. The museum owns several of Bernard Schultze's Migofs, a title which he attached to his sculptural works. The other positions of art of the 1940s and 1950s are envisioned by Ernst Wilhelm Nay with his painting Afrikanisch (\\"African\\", 1954), Willi Baumeister, Max Ackermann, Rolf Cavael, Fritz Winter and above all the painter Otto Ritschl from Wiesbaden with his painting Komposition (1955). These artists are followed by abstract painting artists such as Rupprecht Geiger, Ulrich Erben, Bruno Erdmann and Gotthard Graubner. The ZERO group and kinetic art are featured by artists such as G√ºnther Uecker with his work Spirale Wei√ü (\\"White spiral\\", 1963), Rolf Kissel, Hermann Goepfert, Heinz Mack and Adolf Luther. Also Sigmar Polke and, above all, Gerhard Richter belong to the collection. The museum possesses five paintings by Richter, including the famous Ein Wunder rettete (\\"A Miracle Saved\\", 1964). Surrealism is illustrated by two paintings by Max Ernst. In 1962 the legendary first Fluxus Festival took place in the museum. Of this period, the museum holds works by Joseph Beuys, Wolf Vostell and Nam June Paik. His work Zen for Head (1962) is part of the collection. The American post-war art is featured by some of its main protagonists by works of Mark Rothko, Ad Reinhardt and Agnes Martin. Also listed in the collection are artists such as Sol LeWitt, Donald Judd, Robert Mangold, Fred Sandback, Dan Flavin and Brice Marden. The museum also has the largest collection of works (graphics, paintings and objects) by the German-American Eva Hesse. One of her works is the wall object Eighter from Decatur (1965). The painting of the 1970s and 1980s is portrayed by artists such as Georg Baselitz with his work Stillleben (\\"Still Life\\", 1969), Eugen Sch√∂nebeck, J√∂rg Immendorff and Thomas Bayrle. An outstanding focus of the collection is the installation- and object art of the last thirty years. The most important artists in the collection are Dietrich Helms, Jeppe Hein, Rebecca Horn, Thomas Huber, Vollrad Kutscher, Ingeborg L√ºscher, Christiane M√∂bus, Norbert Radermacher, Franz Erhard Walther and Dorothee von Windheim with her work Fassade III (in English Facade III) (1979). In addition, there are works of international artists such as Ilya Kabakov with his work Der Rote Waggon (\\"The Red Wagon\\", 1991), Micha Ullman, Richard Serra, Jochen Gerz with his composition Der Transsibirische-Prospekt (\\"Trans-Siberian View\\", 1977) and Christian Boltanski. Modernist sculpture is represented by Katsura Funakoshi with his work of art A Tale of the Sphinx (2004).  Art awards  Although the Museum Wiesbaden does not award any art awards itself, two of them are closely linked to the museum.  Alexej von Jawlensky Prize  On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his death in 1991, the city of Wiesbaden established the Alexei von Jawlensky Prize, endowed with 18,000 Euros. Alexei von Jawlensky (1865‚Äì1941) was an important Russian artist in the first half of the 20th century who spent the last twenty years of his life in Wiesbaden. The prize is awarded every five years and has so far been awarded six times. The prize includes the purchase of a work for the Museum Wiesbaden and a special exhibition on the work of the winner in the Museum Wiesbaden. The previous laureates were: * 1991: Agnes Martin * 1996: Robert Mangold * 2001: Brice Marden * 2006: Rebecca Horn * 2010: Ellsworth Kelly * 2014: Richard Serra  Otto Ritschl Prize  The Otto Ritschl Prize was established by the Museumsverein Otto Ritschl e. V. in 2001. Otto Ritschl (1885‚Äì1976) was an important German post-war artist who lived in Wiesbaden until his death. An international jury awards the prize at irregular intervals, which is associated with a cash reward and an exhibition at the Museum Wiesbaden. The previous laureates were: * 2001 Gotthard Graubner * 2003 Ulrich Erben * 2009 Kazuo Katase * 2015 Katharina Grosse  Natural history collections  Exhibition Movemant The originally independent Museum of Natural History in Wiesbaden was founded in 1829 by citizens of the region with the support of the Duke together with the (Nassau Association for Natural History). The beginning of the 19th century was marked by industrialization and enormous discoveries in the natural sciences. This is how the desire for a permanent institution was born. On the one hand, this offered the opportunity to establish an important place of education for the public and, on the other hand, to promote internal research. These goals are still pursued by today's natural history collections. One can find more information on this at the site of the Museum Wiesbaden.  Scientific collections  Originally the collection was intended to cover nature of the Duchy of Nassau. However, as the duchy lacked a university and international collections had to be integrated with the founding of the museum, this approach was abandoned. Nowadays the Natural History Collections belong to the larger ones in Germany with material from all regions of the world. About one million individual objects and series are available to science and public relations. Several thousand first described specimens serve in particular research into biodiversity. With few exceptions, the collection survived the Second World War. A large part of the collection is documented in catalog, on index cards and digitally. Larger gaps exist especially in the areas of geology and invertebrate animals. Digital photographs are also available of numerous items in the collection.  General geology and mineralogy  The mineral collection is still completely in its 19th-century form, as the exhibition combines both scientific and display collections in vitrines. In addition to a general mineral collection of worldwide origin, the focus is on finds from the region, which document in particular the mining industry, which was important until a few decades ago. The scientific collection comprises about 14,000 pieces, currently listed in a computerized catalog.  Geological history  Three geological eras are particularly represented in the immediate region of Wiesbaden. About 50,000 fossils are documented. From the recent history of the earth there are testimonies from the Pleistocene, which originate in particular from the . Regularly Rhine and Main had dammed up in front of the Middle Rhine Valley and bones carried along remained in the sediment. Especially from the warm periods numerous fossils are preserved. A second focal point is the find area at the Caves of Steeden, where the oldest artefacts of Hesse were found. One of the most important collections is related to the following two earth ages. It is the largest part of the legacy of the brothers Guido and Fridolin Sandberger. The Mainz Basin bears witness to the impressive world of life in the Paleogene. In this warmer phase after the extinction of the dinosaurs, the Mainz basin was regularly connected to the surrounding seas, in between these connections were lost, the inland sea sweetened out, a lake was formed and finally the water disappeared completely. In this change numerous animal species lived here, so there are traces of, amongst others, Manatees, Basking sharks, reef-forming mussel banks, but also land creatures, such as the Deinotherium, which was found in Eppelsheim. Especially artefacts from the Taunus originate from the Devonian, an equally warm time with a high sea level. Therefore, the collection contains evidence of an enormous marine fauna: trilobites, conodonts and graptolites. Beside it are worth mentioning: a Palaeozoic and mesozoic fish collection, an extensive Mesozoic vertebrate collection, a large and complete ichthyosaur specimen of Holzmaden, a well sorted paleontological reference collection from the hydrobiic layer of the Mainz Basin, an extensive Cephalopods collection, a well sorted Brachiopodes collection and an extensive collection of fossils from the Taunus quartzite (incl. Trace fossils).

Alongside his personal publishing history, his position as Director of The Center For Writers at The University of Southern Mississippi and Editor of the nationally prominent literary journal Mississippi Review (1977 - 2010) have placed him at the forefront of the contemporary American literary scene. He is currently the editor of New World Writinghttp://newworldwriting.net/forgiveness/ (formerly Blip Magazine) Early life Barthelme was born in Houston, Texas. His father, Donald Barthelme, Sr., was a well-known and highly active Modernist architect in the city. The atmosphere of intellectual and aesthetic vigor encouraged by their father, pervasive in Barthelme family life, is described in Double Down: Reflections on Gambling and Loss, a memoir co-written by Frederick and his brother, Steven. His other brothers, Donald and Peter, emerged from the creative household to become authors as well. Frederick pursued his widely- ranging talents in multiple creative fields, including painting and music: he was a founding member of the avant-garde psychedelic rock band The Red Krayola. He eventually chose to focus on fiction writing: receiving his M.A. in creative writing from Johns Hopkins University, where he studied with John Barth. Style Barthelme's works are known for their focus on the landscape of the New South. Along with his reputation as a minimalist (similar to Raymond Carver, Ann Beattie, Amy Hempel, and Mary Robison), Barthelme's work has also been described by terms such as \\"dirty realism\\" and \\"Kmart realism\\".http://www.southernscribe.com/zine/authors/Barthelme_Frederick.htm He published his first short story in The New Yorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/bios/frederick_barthelme/search?contributorName=frederick%20barthelme and has claimed that a rotisserie chicken helped him understand that he needed to write about ordinary people.http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/missouri_review/v027/27.2oates.html He has moved away from the postmodern stylings of his older brother, Donald Barthelme, though his brother's influence can be seen in his earliest works, Rangoon and War and War. Barthelme was thirty-three-year editor of Mississippi Review,http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Barthelmes-Departure-Leave/25610/ known for recognizing and publishing once new talents such as Larry Brown, Curtis Sittenfeld, and Amy Hempel early in their careers.

He played in the Premier League for Manchester United, in the Football League for Stockport County, Huddersfield Town, Blackpool and Bury, and in the Scottish Premier League for Aberdeen. Playing career Manchester United Thornley was born in Bury, Greater Manchester. He is most widely known for his career as a youth and reserve team player at Manchester United, where he played in the left wing position from 1991 to 1998 (becoming a professional in 1992 after helping United win the FA Youth Cup) but was occasionally used as a striker. Thornley made his debut for United on 26 February 1994 as a substitute in the Premier League match against West Ham United which ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw at Boleyn Ground. A quick and tricky right-footed left winger, he was highly regarded by Alex Ferguson and at one point was expected to become a regular player at Old Trafford. Although he did make nine league appearances for United, serious injury and increasing competition for places prevented him from making the expected impact at first-team level. The most notable injury came in April 1994, when he suffered knee ligament damage in a reserve match against Blackburn Rovers due to a reckless tackle by opposing defender Nicky Marker; the injury kept him out of action for over a year. This came days before the FA Cup semi-final against Oldham Athletic, for which Alex Ferguson was reportedly considering selecting Thornley (at least for a place on the bench) in case Ryan Giggs was not fully fit. Thornley was not fit again until the start of the 1995‚Äì96 season. He was rated by contemporaries including David Beckham (one of the players who went on to eclipse him in the first team), as well as club legend and former youth coach Nobby Stiles, as one of the finest young players at the club during that era. In 1997, Thornley sued Marker and Blackburn Rovers for millions over the tackle, claiming a loss of earnings that resulted from him being kept out of the Manchester United first team because of the injury. In 1996, he won three caps for England at U-21 level. Huddersfield Town After loan spells at Stockport County and Huddersfield Town, Thornley finally left United on a free transfer in May 1998 and went on to make 127 appearances for Huddersfield Town, scoring 8 goals and helping them come close to a First Division play-off place ‚Äì and the chance of a place in the FA Premier League. From June 1999 until November 2000, he was playing under former Manchester United teammate Steve Bruce, who was Huddersfield's manager. When Bruce was dismissed, his successor was another former Manchester United player ‚Äì Lou Macari, who had left United before Thornley joined them. Thornley's spell at Huddersfield brought mixed fortunes. In his first season they finished 10th in the First Division and in his second they finished eighth (being in contention for a play-off place right up to the last match of the season), but in his final campaign they suffered relegation to the Second Division. Aberdeen In August 2001 he signed a two-year deal at Aberdeen, which gave him another crack at top division football ‚Äì this time north of the border in the Scottish Premier League. In 30 appearances for Aberdeen, he scored three goals ‚Äì the opening goal in a 4‚Äì2 victory against Motherwell, and both goals in a 2‚Äì0 victory over Kilmarnock. He also scored in the Scottish Cup against St Johnstone, and in the Scottish League Cup against Queen of the South. Blackpool He returned to England and signed for Second Division club Blackpool on an 18-month contract in November 2002, but was released from his contract at the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season. Bury Thornley signed for Bury in September 2003, but was released less than two months later after making just five appearances. Halifax Town Ben then joined Halifax Town on non-contract terms in March 2004, ending his professional career just before his 29th birthday to play in the Conference. Bacup Borough He then joined the non-League scene with Bacup Borough where he was joined by former Manchester United teammate David May. Salford City He spent a season with Bacup Borough before joining Salford City at the beginning of 2006. Witton Albion Alongside his younger brother, Rod, a striker, Thornley played for Witton Albion in the Northern Premier League between 2008 and 2010. Rod is also employed by Manchester United as a sports therapist. Post-playing career Thornley now works as a television commentator for MUTV.https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/10/ben-thornley-manchester- united-giggs-scholes-beckham-drinking-book Personal life His younger brother, Rod Thornley, also a former academy player at Manchester United, used to be a sports therapist at the club.

Taxonomy Some taxonomic authorities, including the International Ornithologists' Union, separate this species from the mountain pygmy owl, the Baja pygmy owl, and the Guatemalan pygmy owl, while others, such as the American Ornithological Society, do not recognize the split and consider this bird conspecific with the group, with the northern pygmy owl taking the English name for them all. Furthermore, if the group is considered conspecific, G. gnoma becomes the scientific name because it is older. Clear differences in the territorial calls by males are the basis for the proposed split, with birds in the high elevations of Arizona and Mexico giving a two- note call while their more northerly congeners give a repeated single-note call. Results from DNA sequence comparisons of cytochrome-b have been weak and inconclusive despite being referenced repeatedly as a justification for taxonomic splitting.Koenig, Weick and Becking. Owls: A Guide to the Owls of the World, 1999 Subspecies There are four recognized subspecies: * G. c. californicum (PL Sclater, 1857) - Pacific pygmy owl - central British Columbia to southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico * G. c. grinnelli (Ridgway, 1914) - Coastal pygmy owl - coniferous forests of southeastern Alaska to northern California * G. c. pinicola (Nelson, 1910) - Rocky Mountain pygmy owl - Rocky Mountains in west central United States * G. c. swarthi (Grinnell, 1913) - Vancouver pygmy owl - Vancouver Island in British Columbia Description Adults are 15‚Äì17 cm in overall length and are gray, brownish- gray or rufous in colour. This owl has a round white spotted head, weakly defined facial disc, and dark upper breast, wings and tail, the latter quite long compared to other owls. The eyes are yellow and the bill is yellowish- green. The bird has two black nape spots outlined in white on the back of its head, which look like eyes. The mid to lower breast is white with darker vertical streaking. Legs are feathered down to the four well-armed toes on each foot. Distribution and habitat The northern pygmy owl is native to Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Their habitat includes temperate, subtropical and tropical moist forest, savanna, and wetlands. In Oregon and Washington they are known to nest and forage in the center of dense, continuous forests, near streams. An example of their habitat is Forest Park in Portland, Oregon, USA. Their breeding habitat includes open to semi-open woodlands of foothills and mountains in western North America. Behavior Males will regularly perch at the top of the tallest available conifer trees to issue their territorial call, making them somewhat ventriloquistic in sloped landscapes, and causing distress and confusion among observers on the ground hoping to get a glimpse. They are incredibly hard to spot because of their size and color. Breeding They usually nest in a tree cavity and will often use old woodpecker holes. The female lays 2‚Äì7 eggs, typically 4‚Äì6. Nest tree species may include Douglas fir, western redcedar, western hemlock and red alder. Early in the breeding cycle males establish and defend a territory of perhaps 250 hectares (about 1 sq. mi.).Giese, A. \\"Breeding Season Habitat Use and Ecology of Male Mountain Pygmy Owls\\", Journal of Raptor Research, 2003 During the breeding cycle the female incubates the eggs, broods the young and guards the nest. The male hunts, making food deliveries approximately every 2 hours. The male must feed his mate, the young (typically 5) and himself. The male hunts from dawn to dusk as the young near fledging, and during the first weeks after they leave the nest. The young leave the nest (fledge) by making an initial flight that may be a short hop to a nearby branch, or an explosive burst into an adjacent tree where they land by grasping whatever branch is first contacted, sometimes clinging upside-down. Owls at this stage are sometimes called \\"branchers\\" for their clinging, dangling and climbing behaviors. The second day after fledging, the young gradually climb and fly upward into the forest canopy, where they spend their first few weeks, at times perched \\"shoulder-to-shoulder\\" with their siblings, begging for food. Despite many statements in popular literature, no reliable information exists on the seasonal movements of this species. It is not known whether these pygmy-owls maintain the same territory or same mate year to year, though these questions are being investigated. Dispersal of young and influences on their mortality are also poorly known, though barred owls and spotted owls are known to prey on pygmy owls. Feeding Pygmy owls are purportedly \\"sit-and-wait\\" predators, though they in fact hunt somewhat actively, moving from perch to perch with short flights, and pursuing prey at all levels of forest structure. They swoop down on prey; they may also catch insects in flight. They eat small mammals, birds and large insects, and may take a variety of other vertebrates and invertebrates. Mountain pygmy owls occasionally take prey species the same size or larger than themselves (e.g. California quail); however, small to medium-sized birds and small mammals are the norm.

Setting  By the time of war, Adzhimushkay was a small mining suburb located five kilometers away from the city of Kerch, where a complex network of catacombs is located. Limestone was extracted there from 1830, using both the surface quarry and the underground mines. The latter resulted in the network of tunnels (catacombs), known as the Great and Small Adzhimushkay catacombs. They were first used for military purposes by the pro-Bolshevik armed groups during the Russian Civil War. Events When Kerch was occupied by the Wehrmacht in November 1941, a squad of partisans already operated in the catacombs. By May 1942, a counteroffensive was staged by the Wehrmacht in order to expel the Red Army both from the Kerch Peninsula and the city of Sevastopol. The Red Army was overrun and had to evacuate the bridgehead, sustaining heavy casualties. By May 19, 1942 the regular fighting in the area was over, and, to ensure the evacuation of the Soviet troops across the Strait of Kerch, a defense group was left in Adzhimushkay, led by Colonel . The group absorbed retreating soldiers, along with numerous civilians fleeing the city, and eventually grew to several thousand strong. When it became obvious that the bridgehead over the strait could not be held, the Adzhimushkay group found refuge in the catacombs. It is estimated that more than 10,000 fled to the Great Adzhimushkay catacombs system, and 3,000 to the Small catacombs system. The larger garrison was led by Yagunov, Parakhin and Burmin and the smaller one by Yermakov, Povazhny, and Karpekin. The catacombs were ill-suited for defense, as there were no supplies prepared and all wells were located outside. Any supply of water had to be taken by force since a sortie was needed to reach a well. The Soviet group attempted several counterattacks, including one resulting in the defeat of the Wehrmacht garrison in Adzhimushkay on the night of 8 and 9 July 1942. Colonel Yagunov was killed in that assault. Most Soviet guerrillas died, as the groups ran out of ammunition, food and water. The group resorted to extreme techniques of survival that included preparing meat of the dead livestock earlier killed in the mine entrances and gathering water condensed on the mine ceilings. The defenders also attempted to dig their own wells in the catacombs, as deep as 14 m, in order to reach the phreatic water layer. The German forces surrounded the quarries with barbed wire fencing, blocked the entrances and exits and bombed and shelled them. General , chief of the chemical forces, proposed that a non-lethal irritant gas be used to smoke the partisans out of such hiding places. Permission to carry out the attack was denied,Halder, F., Kriegstagebuch. T√§gliche Aufzeichnungen des Chefs des Generalstabes des Heeres 1939‚Äì1942.

Plaque in the foreground states that Ivan Parakhin and other three Soviet fighters were captured alive after the Soviet defeat and later executed by Nazis in a Simferopol prison. On October 30, 1942, German forces entered the catacombs and captured the remaining defenders. The estimates of the number of guerrilla fighters surviving the 170-day siege and final clash, and their subsequent treatment by Nazis, varied from 48 to 300 out of the initial 13,000 strength of the Soviet group.

It is an Italian, Spanish and Portuguese variant of the Roman Marianus which derived from Marius, and Marius derived from the Roman god Mars (see also Ares) or from the Latin maris \\"male\\". Mariano and Marian are sometimes seen as a conjunction of the two female names Mary and Ann. This name is an homage to The Virgin Mary, Mother of Jesus. Mariano, as a surname, is of Italian, Spanish and Portuguese origin from the personal name Mariano, from the Latin family name Marianus (a derivative of the ancient personal name Marius, of Etruscan origin). In the early Christian era it came to be taken as an adjective derived from Maria, and was associated with the cult of the Virgin Mary. It was borne by various early saints, including a 3rd-century martyr in Numibia and a 5th-century hermit of Berry, France. It is also a Sephardic Jewish surname derived from the term Merano. The term, which is frequently derived from the New Testament phrase \\"maran atha\\" (\\"our Lord hath come\\"), denotes in Spanish \\"damned,\\" \\"accursed,\\" \\"banned\\"; also \\"hog,\\" and in Portuguese it is used as an opprobrious epithet of the Jews because they do not eat pork. The name was applied to the Spanish Jews who, through compulsion or for form's sake, became converted to Christianity in consequence of the cruel persecutions of 1391 and of Vicente Ferrer's missionary sermons. These \\"conversos\\" (converts), as they were called in Spain, or \\"Christ√£os Novos\\" (Neo-Christians) in Portugal, or \\"Chuetas\\" in the Balearic Isles, or \\"Anusim\\" (constrained) in Hebrew, numbered more than 100,000. With them the history of the Pyrenean Peninsula, and indirectly that of the Jews also, enters upon a new phase; for they were the immediate cause both of the introduction of the Inquisition into Spain and of the expulsion of the Jews from that country.

History  The Cannery was initially set for a mid-December 2002 opening. By October 2002, more than 5,000 people had been interviewed for nearly 1,000 job positions at the Cannery. That month, the opening was delayed to early January 2003. The delay allowed the owners to save $90,000 in taxes and fees, and also simplified the Cannery's job search. Prior to its opening, Cannery executives chose not to affiliate the hotel with a brand name, which was deemed as expensive and unnecessary. The Cannery opened on January 2, 2003, with 201 rooms and a casino. The Cannery is known for its 120-foot smokestack. In May 2004, the Cannery received final approval for a $35 million expansion project. The expansion took place in 2006, and added and a 3,571-seat Galaxy Movie Theater.

Located on the dirt Garnet Range Road, it is an abandoned mining town that dates from the 1860s. In First Chance Gulch in western Montana, the town is located 11 miles up the Garnet Range Road, in mountains and forest. The town is at approximately elevation. The town was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Garnet Historic District, a historic district, in 2010. The listing included 82 contributing buildings, 46 contributing structures, and 56 contributing sites, as well as four non-contributing buildings, on . Garnet is located north of the junction of Interstate 90, U.S. Route 12 and Bear Gulch Rd. in the Bureau of Land Management's Garnet Resource Area. Garnet, established in the 1890s, was the residential and commercial center for an area that was extensively mined between 1870 and 1920. The buildings are mostly at the north end of Last Chance Gulch, but the listing includes mining structures in a wider area extending in all directions from the town site. Several of Garnet's remaining miner's cabins In 2010, much of the area was owned by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and was included in its Garnet Resource Area. Includes maps and 68 photos from 2008. Architects/builders included Ole Dahl, who built Dahl Saloon (also known as Ole's and as \\"The Joint\\") and the Dahl House, Robert Moore who built Kelly's Saloon, Hugh Hannifen who built Hannifen House, Judson and Blaidsell who built the F.A. Davey Store, and John and Winifred Wells who built the Wells Hotel. Garnet was originally named Mitchell in 1895 and had ten buildings. The main part of the town was built on the Garnet Lode. Later changing its name to Garnet, it was a rich gold mining area. In 1898, as many as 1,000 people lived here; it was abandoned 20 years later when the gold ran out. A fire in 1912 destroyed half the town, which was never rebuilt. Supplies needed in Garnet were generally obtained from nearby Bearmouth. Despite this, Garnet is one of the state's best preserved with 16,000 visitors annually. The annual celebration the third Saturday of each year is Garnet Day. Garnet's oldest living member, Mary Jane Adams Morin, came to visit every year. The nearest city is Missoula, approximately to the west. The closest city to the east is Butte, about away. Garnet has the Wells hotels, Kelly Saloon, Daveys Store and many outer buildings, preserved and intact. During the 1890s, it had close to thirteen saloons (bars), as well as food stores, a barber shop, mercantile store, and three hotels. The hotels were started for passersby, or people coming to pick up gold. Their rates typically ranged from $1‚Äì3, and the poor miners who could not afford that price could sleep in the attic without any windows for a quarter. It is suspected that Garnet even had a brothel, but prices and the exact whereabouts are uncertain. Garnet was famous for its saloons; at its peak, the saloons were one of the hottest spots in Garnet.

Both kinglists describe Neferkara I as the immediate successor of king Senedj and as the predecessor of king Neferkasokar.Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards: The Cambridge ancient history Vol. 1, Pt. 2: Early history of the Middle East, 3rd volume (Reprint).

Identity  There is no contemporary name source for this king and no Horus name could be connected to Neferkara I up to this day. In contrast, Egyptologists such as Kim Ryholt believe that Neferkara/Neferka was identical with a sparsely attested king named Sneferka, which is also thought to be a name used by king Qa'a (the last ruler of the 1st dynasty) for a short time only. Ryholt thinks that Ramesside scribes misleadingly added the symbol of the sun to the name ‚Äú(S)neferka‚Äù, ignoring the fact that the sun itself was no object of divine adoration yet during the 2nd dynasty. For a comparison he points to cartouche names such as Neferkara II from the kinglist of Abydos and Nebkara I from the Sakkara table.Kim Ryholt, in: Journal of Egyptian History; vol.1. BRILL, Leiden 2008, ISSN 1874-1657, pp. 159‚Äì173. The ancient historian Manetho called Neferkara I ‚ÄúN√©pherch√™res‚Äù and reported that during this king's rulership ‚Äúthe Nile was flowing with honey for eleven days‚Äù. Egyptologists think that this collocation was meant to show that the realm was flourishing under king Nephercheres.Walter Bryan Emery: √Ñgypten, Geschichte und Kultur der Fr√ºhzeit, 3200-2800 v. Chr. p. 19.  Reign  Egyptologists such as Wolfgang Helck, Nicolas Grimal, Hermann Alexander Schl√∂gl and Francesco Tiradritti believe that king Nynetjer, the third ruler of second dynasty, left a realm that was suffering from an overly complex state administration and that Ninetjer decided to split Egypt to leave it to his two sons (or, at least, rightful throne successors) who would rule two separate kingdoms, in the hope that the two rulers could better administer the states.Nicolas Grimal: A History of Ancient Egypt. Wiley-Blackwell, Weinheim 1994, , p. 55.Francesco Tiradritti & Anna Maria Donadoni Roveri: Kemet: Alle Sorgenti Del Tempo. Electa, Milano 1998, , p. 80‚Äì85. In contrast, Egyptologists such as Barbara Bell believe that an economic catastrophe like a famine or a long lasting drought affected Egypt. Therefore, to address the problem of feeding the Egyptian population, Ninetjer split the realm and his successors founded two independent realms, until the famine came to an end. Bell points to the inscriptions of the Palermo stone, where, in her opinion, the records of the annual Nile floods show constantly low levels during this period.Barbara Bell: Oldest Records of the Nile Floods, In: Geographical Journal, No. 136. 1970, p. 569‚Äì573; M. Goedike: Journal of Egypt Archaeology, No. 42. 1998, page 50. Bell's theory is refuted today by Egyptologists such as Stephan Seidlmayer, who corrected Bell's calculations. Seidlmayer has shown that the annual Nile floods were at usual levels at Ninetjer's time up to the period of the Old Kingdom. Bell had overlooked, that the heights of the Nile floods in the Palermo stone inscription only takes the measurements of the nilometers around Memphis into account, but not elsewhere in Egypt. Any long-lasting drought can therefore be excluded.Stephan Seidlmayer: Historische und moderne Nilst√§nde: Historische und moderne Nilst√§nde: Untersuchungen zu den Pegelablesungen des Nils von der Fr√ºhzeit bis in die Gegenwart. Achet, Berlin 2001, , pp. 87‚Äì89. It is a commonly accepted theory, that Neferkara I had to share his throne with another ruler. It is just unclear yet, with whom. Later kinglists such as the Sakkara list and the Turin canon list the kings Neferkasokar and Hudjefa I as immediate successors. The Abydos list skips all these three rulers and name a king Djadjay (identical with king Khasekhemwy). If Egypt was already divided when Neferkara I gained the throne, kings like Sekhemib and Peribsen would have ruled Upper Egypt, whilst Neferkara I and his successors would have ruled Lower Egypt. The division of Egypt was brought to an end by king Khasekhemwy.Hermann Alexander Schl√∂gl: Das Alte √Ñgypten: Geschichte und Kultur von der Fr√ºhzeit bis zu Kleopatra. Beck, Hamburg 2006, , pp. 77‚Äì78 & 415.

It was provoked when an important number of National Peasants' Party (PN≈¢) leaders, including party vice president Ion Mihalache, had been offered a chance to flee Romania, where the Communist Party (PCR), the main force inside the Petru Groza government, already had a tight grip on power with backing from the Soviet Union (see Soviet occupation of Romania). The affair signalled some of the first official measures taken against opposition parties, as a step leading to the proclamation of a People's Republic at the end of the same year (see Communist Romania). Background The PCR victory in the 1946 general election, achieved through widespread electoral fraud,FrunzƒÉ, p.287-292, 297 was followed by the first attempts at anti- Communist resistance (including the creation of a \\"military circle\\" led by Mihalache).FrunzƒÉ, p.292-293, 295 As the main adversary of Stalinism and committed supporter of the Western Allies, the PN≈¢ was the main target for PCR hostility. According to journalist Victor FrunzƒÉ, the PN≈¢ and the National Liberal Party were already targeted for having backed attempts (during World War II) by the ConducƒÉtor Marshal Ion Antonescu to sign a separate peace with the Allies (see Romania during World War II).FrunzƒÉ, p.293-295 In late October 1946, the PN≈¢ entered into open conflict with the authorities; the first volley was to send a secret report to the Secretary General of the United Nations, heavily critical of government policies.FrunzƒÉ, p.297-298 The Communist press alleged that the National Peasants' Party had been organizing a wide network of armed resistance (groups cited in that context may have indeed existed as early as 1947, and probably merged into the resistance movement of the 1950s).FrunzƒÉ, p.296 At the same time, the Communists press applauded the dissidence of various PN≈¢ leaders such as Anton Alexandrescu, Nicolae L. Lupu, and Victor Eftimiu.FrunzƒÉ, p.299 Events Several details of the Affair are still unclear. The offer to flee Romania was quickly discovered (as the government declared) or, as claimed by journalist Victor FrunzƒÉ, had already been investigated, and, in the hope of discrediting the opposition party, partly facilitated by agents of Teohari Georgescu, Minister of the Interior.FrunzƒÉ, p.300-301 In October 1947, Maniu declared that: > The idea for Mr. Mihalache and a few friends to go abroad was an older one > and I had decided at some point to leave myself, in case Mr. Mihalache would > not allow himself to leave. This discussion between us lasted for a while, > and we were thinking how we could find a means of locomotion. When the > question was being debated between the two of us with no one else aware of > it, Dr. Emil Ha≈£ieganu came to see me. [...] He said: I have two aviators > who have a plane at their disposal and have let me know that they have > secured 3‚Äì4 seats, as they are to leave on an official military mission to > Istanbul. I said that I was satisfied by the offer and I that I would > designate 3‚Äì4 persons to leave.Maniu, in LƒÉcustƒÉ Early on the morning of July 14, 1947, at the TƒÉmƒÉdƒÉu airfield (46 km from Bucharest), Siguran≈£a Statului and armed soldiers arrested a number of prominent PN≈¢ politicians, including Mihalache, Nicolae Penescu, Ilie LazƒÉr, Nicolae Carandino, Dumitru and Eugen Borcea, all of whom were waiting for airplanes to transport them out of the country. A photo reporter was also present in order to provide maximum exposure to the flight attempt.Cioroianu, p.95; FrunzƒÉ, p.301; Vohn The scandal was centered on the charge of treason (\\"of the people's interests\\"), provoked by the allegation that those arrested had attempted to establish a government in exile. Victor FrunzƒÉ argues that \\"in democratic states\\" citizens should have an \\"unconditional right to a passport\\" in order to leave the country whenever they want and therefore the accusations of illegal border crossing, flight and treason should not have been brought.FrunzƒÉ, p.301 Calls for a trial of the entire party were voiced by the Communist press (notably by Silviu Brucan), and Maniu himself, although not present at TƒÉmƒÉdƒÉu, was argued to have planned the escape. Arrested while under treatment in a sanatorium,Cioroianu, p.96; Vohn Maniu later admitted to the fact, and indicated that he was prepared to assume complete responsibility: > [After Ha≈£ieganu's offer] I spoke to Mr. Mihalache, I specifically asked him > to make use of this opportunity and he accepted. Indeed, the moral and > political responsibility for the departure of Mr. Mihalache and our friends > is mine. He denied, however, any subversive goal: > The purpose as designed by me was that, through going abroad, they were to > inform foreign countries of the situation in Romania. Outcome Later the same day (July 14, 1947), authorities stormed into the PN≈¢ headquarters and confiscated all documents held in the archive, a move followed by other searches for documents in various locations.Vohn On July 19, the Assembly of Deputies of Romania voted to outlaw the party press (including Dreptatea), and to lift the parliamentary immunity of PN≈¢ deputies -- the entire party leadership was arrested on the same day, and the party was banned on July 30 (on the basis of a report filed by Teohari Georgescu).FrunzƒÉ, p.302-303 In parallel, Soviet authorities handed Teohari Georgescu the handwritten testimony of a former Abwehr agent, Alfred Petermann, who alleged that Maniu had worked as an agent for the British Secret Intelligence Service during the war, keeping contact with Alfred Gardyne de Chastelain.Pokivailova & Chiper, p.44-49 All those involved and those judged to have been involved were sentenced to harsh penal labour sentences: Maniu died in Sighet prison in 1953, and Mihalache in R√¢mnicu SƒÉrat ten years after.Both Maniu and Mihalache had been sentenced to life in prison; upon sentencing, Maniu, who was 75, was required to pay 50,000 lei (FrunzƒÉ, p.388)Cioroianu, p.96 Most other important party activists were sentenced in the following years;FrunzƒÉ, p.388 Corneliu Coposu, who was to lead the reestablished party after the Romanian Revolution of 1989, was also arrested and imprisoned in connection with the TƒÉmƒÉdƒÉu Affair. Constantin Titel Petrescu, leader of a splinter group of the Social Democratic Party (one which had refused cooperation with the Communists), also came up during the trial -- he was later tried and convicted.FrunzƒÉ, p.389; Petrescu was released in 1955, after the United Kingdom Labour Party interceded with Nikita Khrushchev -- he consequently declared his loyalty to the Communist party(FrunzƒÉ, p.390) The diplomat Neagu Djuvara, who was present at the Romanian Legation in Sweden, was mentioned in one of the testimonies at the trial, and opted not to return to his country.Roman The episode was soon after used against the Foreign Minister, Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu, leader of the National Liberal Party-TƒÉtƒÉrescu (which, although aligned with the Communists, had by then criticized several Communist policies). He was attacked by the PCR newspaper Sc√Ænteia for having allegedly failed to act against a pro-Maniu conspiracy inside his ministry, unceremoniously demoted, and replaced by the Communist activist Ana Pauker.FrunzƒÉ, p.307-308 Notes References *Adrian Cioroianu, Pe umerii lui Marx.

When the main fuel is exhausted, the motor will stop running, prompting the rider to change the position knob to continue riding with a known smaller quantity of fuel. Often when a rider notices the motor start to sputter, he or she can access the reserve before the engine shuts down. In most cases, the main and the reserve settings are actually drawing from the same tank, but there are two outlets through which the fuel may leave. One outlet is located a short distance above the other, when the fuel selector is set to the 'main' position, the fuel will flow from the upper outlet, and will stop flowing when the fuel level gets below the outlet. When the selector is on 'reserve', the lower outlet will be used, which allows all the fuel to be drawn from the tank. Because in most cases the 'reserve' setting simply allows access to all the fuel, rather than a dedicated tank, the 'reserve' selection allows the rider to deplete the main fuel supply as well as the reserve.

Hot coolant from the vehicle's engine is passed through a winding tube of the core, a heat exchanger between coolant and cabin air. Fins attached to the core tubes serve to increase surface area for heat transfer to air that is forced past them by a fan, thereby heating the passenger compartment.  How it works  Heater core (arrowed) in the partially disassembled dashboard of a BMW E32. The internal combustion engine in most cars and trucks is cooled by a water and antifreeze mixture that is circulated through the engine and radiator by a water pump to enable the radiator to give off engine heat to the atmosphere. Some of that coolant can be diverted through the heater core to give some engine heat to the cabin, or adjust the temperature of the conditioned air. A heater core is a small radiator located under the dashboard of the vehicle, and it consists of conductive aluminium or brass tubing with cooling fins to increase surface area. Hot coolant passing through the heater core gives off heat before returning to the engine cooling circuit. The squirrel cage fan of the vehicle's ventilation system forces air through the heater core to transfer heat from the coolant to the cabin air, which is directed into the vehicle through vents at various points. Control Once the engine has warmed up, the coolant is kept at a more or less constant temperature by the thermostat. The temperature of the air entering the vehicle's interior can be controlled by using a valve limiting the amount of coolant that goes through the heater core. Another method is blocking off the heater core with a door, directing part (or all) of the incoming air around the heater core completely, so it does not get heated (or re-heated if the air conditioning compressor is active). Some cars use a combination of these systems. Simpler systems allow the driver to control the valve or door directly (usually by means of a rotary knob, or a lever). More complicated systems use a combination of electromechanical actuators and thermistors to control the valve or doors to deliver air at a precise temperature value selected by the user. Cars with dual climate function (allowing driver and passenger to each set a different temperature) may use a heater core split in two, where different amounts of coolant flow through the heater core on either side to obtain the desired heating. Air conditioning In a car equipped with air conditioning, outside air, or cabin air if the recirculation flap has been set to close the external air passages, is first forced, often after being filtered by a cabin air filter, through the air conditioner's evaporator coil. This can be thought of as a heater core filled with very cold liquid that is undergoing a phase change to gas (the evaporation), a process which cools rather than heats the incoming air. In order to obtain the desired temperature incoming air may first be cooled by the air conditioning and then heated again by the heater core. In a vehicle fitted with manual controls for the heater and air conditioning compressor, using both systems together will dehumidify the air in the cabin, as the evaporator coil removes moisture from the air due to condensation. This can result in increased air comfort levels inside the vehicle. Automatic temperature control systems can take the best course of action in regulating the compressor operation, amount of reheating and blower speed depending upon the external air temperature, the internal one and the cabin air temperature value or a rapid defrost effect requested by the user.  Engine cooling function  Because the heater core cools the heated coolant from the engine by transferring its heat to the cabin air, it can also act as an auxiliary radiator for the engine. If the radiator is working improperly, the operator may turn the heat on (together with the cabin blower fan placed on full speed, and with the windows opened) in the passenger cabin, resulting in a certain cooling effect on the overheated engine coolant. This idea only works to a certain degree, as the heater core is not large enough nor does it have enough cold air going through it to cool large amounts of coolant significantly.  Possible problems  Replacing a heater core in a Volkswagen Passat. The heater core is made up of small piping that has numerous bends. Clogging of the piping may occur if the coolant system is not flushed or if the coolant is not changed regularly. If clogging occurs the heater core will not work properly. If coolant flow is restricted, heating capacity will be reduced or even lost altogether if the heater core becomes blocked. Control valves may also clog or get stuck. Where a blend door is used instead of a control valve as a method of controlling the air's heating amount, the door itself or its control mechanism can become stuck due to thermal expansion. If the climate control unit is automatic, actuators can also fail. Another possible problem is a leak in one of the connections to the heater core. This may first be noticeable by smell (ethylene glycol is widely used as coolant and has a sweet smell); it may also cause (somewhat greasy) fogging of the windshield above the windshield heater vent. Glycol may also leak directly into the car, causing wet upholstery or carpeting. Electrolysis can cause excessive corrosion leading to the heater core rupturing. Coolant will spray directly into the passenger compartment followed with white colored smoke, a significant driving hazard. Because the heater core is usually located under the dashboard inside of the vehicle and is enclosed in the ventilation system's ducting, servicing it often requires disassembling a large part of the dashboard, which can be labour-intensive and therefore expensive. Since the heater core relies on the coolant's heat to warm the cabin air up, it obviously won't begin working until the engine's coolant warms up enough. This problem can be resolved by equipping the vehicle with an auxiliary heating system, which can either use electricity or burn the vehicle's fuel in order to rapidly bring the engine's coolant to operating temperatures.  Air cooled engines  Engines that do not have a water cooling system cannot heat the cabin via a heater core; one alternative is to guide air around the (very hot) engine exhaust manifold and then into the vehicle's interior. Temperature control is achieved by mixing with unheated outside air. Air-cooled Volkswagen engines use this method. Depending on the design, this can cause a safety issue where a leak in the exhaust system will begin to fill the passenger cabin with deadly fumes. Reuse for other purposes Car heat cores are also used for D.I.Y. projects, such as for cooling homemade liquid cooling systems for computers.Reuse of heater cores for PC liquid cooling system  See also  * Air cooling * Internal combustion engine cooling * Radiator (engine cooling) * Radiator (heating) * Water cooling References  External links  * entire cooling system Category:Automotive technologies Category:Cooling technology Category:Engine cooling systems Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning Category:Heat exchangers ","title":"Heater core"},{"id":"7126740","text":"Tunnel entrance The Wesertunnel crosses the river Weser in northwestern Germany between the villages of Rodenkirchen and Dedesdorf, offering a connection between the cities of Nordenham and Bremerhaven on a regional level.

The ship was en route from Tubar√£o in Brazil to Japan with iron ore when contact was lost with the vessel in the Pacific (near the island of Mindanao, Philippines), the last contact was on December 30, 1975. After one week, on January 7, 1976, the ship was reported missing, but the ensuing search operation yielded no results and was called off on January 16 of that year. Thirty people lost their lives.

MS Berge Istra was, like its sister ship which disappeared under similar circumstances four years later, an ore-bulk-oil carrier - a ship which could transport both oil and iron ore. Even 30 years later, the shipping company maintained secrecy with regards to the cause of the accident. During an interview in Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet in January 2011, the retired Bergesen captain Johnny Eilers gave his view on what happened: The inert (neutral gas) systems were often unreliable those days, and many officers lacked education in how to measure gas levels. Berge Istra was loaded with ore in the main holds. But the wingtanks were not cleaned after the previous cargo of oil, thus producing oil vapor. Also the deck water seal was unreliable in heavy seas, allowing this vapor to enter the inert gas system and generator. That generator would be started on their way east, as Japan demanded inerted wingtanks on arrival. Starting the generator would then cause the ‚Äúwhole deck to open up‚Äù, just as the two survivors had explained it did. Thus the Berge Istra and Berge Vanga disasters.

Naval Station \\"Lima\\" was constructed in April 1986, consisting of a small living-cum-operations centre. In 1989, the government decided to develop the island into a tourist spot. By 1991, the resort had completed construction and had developed into a comfortable and popular diving spot. By 1995, more buildings were added, including two air- conditioned accommodation blocks, an aircraft landing strip, two hangars, a radar station, an air traffic control tower, watchtowers and a jetty. On 20 July 2003, the Layang-Layang Airport expansion which increased the length of the runway from to was completed. As a result, the length of the island increased from 1.2 kilometres to over 1.5 kilometres. In July 2004, a marine research facility, MARSAL (Marine Research Station Pulau Layang-Layang) was opened. On 5 March 2009, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, the Malaysian Prime Minister of the time, visited the island. Tourism File:Swallow Reef sea1.jpg File:Swallow Reef sea2.jpg File:Swallow Reef sea3.jpg The island has a reputation as a destination for scuba divers, with clear water and a variety of marine life including hammerhead sharks, pygmy seahorses, jack fish, barracuda and manta rays.

The airport consists of a paved aircraft runway, two aircraft hangars, a radar station, an air traffic control tower and watchtowers. The runway, made of concrete, is 1367m long and 28m wide. The runway has a Pavement Classification Number of 032RBXU, indicating that the runway is a medium strength rigid pavement, with a high maximum tire pressure. The aviation facilities on the island allow the operation of C130 Hercules transport planes and CN-235 maritime patrol aircraft of the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF). Layang Layang Aerospace offers flights for civilians to and from the airport.  Layang-Layang Resort  Layang-Layang is a 3 star resort located on the island open from 28 February ‚Äì 1 September. It has 86 rooms and shares the look of a Borneo Longhouse, the traditional community homes of Borneo's tribal people. The resort's restaurant serves Asian and Western Cuisine. There are also fresh water swimming pools and a body massage and foot reflexology centre called Raba Raba House.Layang Layang Island Resort, www.layanglayang.com File:Swallow Reef10.jpg File:Swallow Reef3.jpg File:Swallow Reef8.jpg  Naval Station Lima  Station Lima jetty. The Royal Malaysian Navy has maintained an \\"offshore naval station\\" on the island since 1983, and CB90 assault craft based in the station patrol the surrounding waters. Several anti-ship and anti-aircraft guns are placed around the reef, and the personnel operate a Starburst air defence system to prevent low level attacks on the island. The jetty is located inside the lagoon of the submerged atoll, and has access to the sea through a man-made path cleared of corals. The naval personnel are normally stationed on the island on a three-month rotational deployment, transferring from Kota Kinabalu, where the Naval Area Base II (Mawila II) is located.  Marine Research Station  The Malaysian Fisheries department operates a marine research facility, MARSAL (Marine Research Station Pulau Layang-Layang) on the island.  Utilities   Electricity  The main power source of the island comes from diesel generators. On the naval station, there is a large windmill maintained by state-owned power company Tenaga Nasional which harnesses power from wind speeds of up to 50 knots to provide additional electricity supply to the base.  Water  The island's clean water supply of 57 tons per day is obtained from a distilled water processing plant.  Post service  In 2015, Malaysia launched a postcode for those living on the island.  Internet and mobile cellular connectivities  Internet services are currently been improved and mobile connectivities will be improved from 2G to 3G by Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission.  Climate  Swallow Reef is located within the equatorial belt and has an equatorial climate. It is closed to tourists from November to January each year due to heavy monsoon rains, however, Malaysian Armed Forces personnel operate on the island year-long. Temperatures range from 24 to 32 ¬∞C. Although an equatorial climate comes with fairly high humidity, there are cooling sea breezes.  Accessibility  The only civilian flight route to Swallow Reef is a one-hour flight from Sabah's capital Kota Kinabalu. Layang Layang Aerospace is the only airline that services this route, using its fleet of Nomad N22C planes. A return ticket must be purchased before departure from Kota Kinabalu International Airport. The Royal Malaysian Navy uses CB90 boats for access to the area and also stations the boats on the island for patrols in the area. The Royal Malaysian Air Force uses CN235 and C130 Hercules aircraft as well as Nuri helicopters for access to the island.

(9 August 1811 ‚Äì 19 November 1891) was an English Jesuit Roman Catholic church historian. Biography He was born at Astley in Worcestershire, England on 9 August 1811. His father was the Protestant curate in charge at Astley. After his early education at home and at a private school at Woodchester, Henry was articled to a firm of solicitors in Worcester, and in the course of time practised as a solicitor, at first in partnership with another, then by himself. Under the influence of the Oxford Movement he was led to embrace the Catholic faith in 1846, and five years later, on the death of his wife Anne, daughter of John Vezard of Gloucestershire, he sought admission as a lay brother into the Society of Jesus. Urged to enter as a scholastic and to prepare for the priesthood, he said it was Our Lady's wish that he should be a lay brother. For thirty years he occupied the post of lay brother socius to the English provincial superior. During that time he produced his gigantic work, The Records of the English Province of the Society of Jesus (eight octavo volumes), a compilation of immense labour and original research and an invaluable store of historical detail put together with a persevering assiduity rarely found even in the most painstaking of historians. Brother Foley deserves to share with Father Henry More the title of historian of the Society. He also wrote Jesuits in Conflict, a work describing the sufferings of some of the English Jesuit confessors of the Faith. As a religious, Brother Foley was a model of every virtue. His bodily austerities were remarkable, while his spirit of prayer led him at all free moments to the chapel. He died at Manresa House, Roehampton, on 19 November 1891. Works * Jesuits in Conflict.

It is one of the few natural harbours on the north coast of south-west England and during the prehistoric and early medieval periods was important for trade and the movement of people and ideas. The estuary of the River Hayle consists of a main channel, with several other nearby tidal areas, including Lelant Saltings, Copperhouse Creek (, meaning eastern inlet) and Carnsew Pool (also known as Carnsew Basin). It is included in the Hayle Estuary and Carrack Gladden Site of Special Scientific Interest. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds manages a nature reserve at the site. History Due to the estuary being one of the few natural harbours on the north coast of south- west England, it was important for trade and the movement of people and ideas. A hillfort, overlooks the estuary at Carnsew, and dates from the later prehistoric period. Prehistoric artifacts with Irish connections have been found around the estuary, and in the early medieval period some of the earliest post-Roman evidence for Christianity in Cornwall, which also had strong Irish influences. Set into the lower slope of the hillfort is an early- Christian memorial stone known as the ‚Ä≥Cunaide Stone‚Ä≥, which was discovered in 1843. Research on the inscription suggests it dates to the 5th-century AD, has European inspiration and the name is possibly Irish in origin. Religion and trade continued during the early medieval period with pilgrimages to St Michael's Mount and European shrines, but trade declined during the later medieval period when the estuary became choked by silt due to tin extraction up river. The Cornish Copper Company moved to Hayle in 1757 and built a copper smelting works the following year on the eastern part of the estuary, on what is now known as Copperhouse Pool. Access to the open sea was difficult and one of the earliest surviving industrial buildings in Hayle. a canal and dock, was completed in 1769. Harvey's Foundry was established in 1779 at the head of Penpol Creek by John Harvey to serve local mines. Harvey's built South Quay in 1819 which increased silting in shipping channels; a problem initially resolved by impounding Copperhouse Pool. Carnsew Pool was created in 1834 to impound tidal water, following the building of East Quay by the Cornish Copper Company, which caused the deep water channels used by Harvey's to fill with silt. The sides of Carnsew Pool are built of rubble and slag, and New Pier was also built, to direct water through sluices, into the estuary; thus flushing silt out of the river channel adjacent to Harvey's foundry. The complex system maintained the port facilies which allowed the two competing foundries to increase their national and international roles. As well as building steam engines, Harvey's developed their business with overseas exports, shipbuilding and ship-breaking. Harvey's fleet of 79 ships built at Hayle including the 4000 ton SS Ramleh in 1891; the largest ship to be built in Cornwall. The two rival companies were responsible for the development of Hayle into a major industrial port in the 18th and 19th-centuries, servicing the tin and copper mining industry of West Cornwall. About 1811, Sea Lane (or Black Road) was built across Copperhouse Creek to further improve access between the works at Copperhouse and the company's main shipping facilities at North Quay. The buildings around the creek was mostly built from blocks of slag, called scoria; waste material from the smelter, providing a distinctive building material. Hence the name ‚Ä≥Black Road‚Ä≥. Transport In 1825 an Act of Parliament established the Hayle Bridge Causeway Turnpike Trust which was required to construct a bridge, causeway and turnpike over the Hayle River from Griggs Quay () in the west to Phillack in the east. The turnpike was needed to ease the transport of copper ore to thport at Hayle for export. A second Act was passed in 1837 to establish the Griggs Quay to Penzance Turnpike and in 1839 an Act formed a third trust, the Hayle and Redruth Turnpike to complete the turnpike to Redruth. The running of the turnpike was overseen by the winner of a public auction. For the year 1880, the winning bid was ¬£591 10s. The Hayle Railway was built in the 1830s, as a single-track for the movement of minerals from the mines at Camborne and Redruth. Its western terminal was at Penpol (under the viaduct of the current railway), followed part of the northern shore of Copperhouse Pool and then via an inclined plane at Angarrack,on to Redruth.

The simplest and most common type of warrantless searches in the United States are searches based upon consent. No warrant, probable cause or reasonable suspicion is required to perform a search if a person, or someone else with the proper authority, consents to a search. A consent search assumes the individual, whose person or property is being searched, is aware that they have the right to refuse a search in a situation when confronted by law enforcement agents. By giving consent they are assumed to waive, freely and voluntarily, his or her Fourth Amendment rights, granting the officer permission to perform the search. Where consent is obtained through \\"deception\\" on the part of the police officer, the search may be determined to be an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The three main categories of searches are a search of a house, automobile or pedestrian. In the case of an automobile, it is assumed the officer has already seized the car and the encounter is a terry stop. When an officer returns a driver's identification, the encounter has been transformed into a consensual encounter. In the case of a pedestrian, a consensual encounter can lead to a terry stop based on information gathered during conversation. Some states and cities pass laws that require officer to notify a right to refuse in one case, but not the others. The person has the right to refuse to give consent, and except in limited cases may revoke consent at any point during the search. In addition, the prosecution in any trial using the search results as evidence is required to prove that the consent was voluntary and not a result of coercion. In contrast to Miranda rights, officers conducting a consent search are not required to warn people of their right to withhold consent in order for consent to be valid, as determined by the U.S. Supreme Court in Schneckloth v. Bustamonte. Police are not required to conduct a search in a way that gives the individual an opportunity to revoke consent, as determined in United States v. Rich, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected the argument that ‚Äúofficials must conduct all searches in plain view of the suspect, and in a manner slowly enough that he may withdraw or delimit his consent at any time during the search.‚Äù Different categories of Consent searches Pedestrian encounters Oftentimes an officer will have neither reasonable suspicion to stop an individual nor probable cause to arrest that person. A common tactic is to engage in conversation with the individual in an attempt to get them to incriminate themselves. This can, possibly, include a consent search. Traffic stops A traffic stop is automatically a terry stop. In Ohio v. Robinette (1996) the Supreme Court decided an officer does not need to inform the driver that the stop has ended. He can continue questioning and request a search of the vehicle. Since the encounter has now become a consensual encounter it is outside the protection of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court assumed that a reasonable person would know the encounter was over and feel free to drive away. Home search Consent searches on people's homes have been given a higher level of scrutiny by the Supreme Court. This is because they happen in private without outside observers. The court is much more sensitive to the possibility of coercion and more guidelines have been put in place to protect against this. Consent given by third parties The person conducting the consent search does not necessarily have to be identified as a law enforcement officer, and the person granting consent need not be the person police suspect or ultimately charge. In cases such as Lee v. United States, Lopez v. United States, and Hoffa v. United States, the courts have ruled that evidence found in searches based on consent obtained by an undercover officer or as an informer to be admissible. A party other than the defendant can, in some limited cases, grant consent. The consenting party needs to actually possess or be believed by the searching officer to possess ‚Äúcommon authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected.‚Äù For example, the Supreme Court in United States v. Matlock (1974) held that co-occupant of a house had actual authority to consent to a search of the house. In Illinois v. Rodriguez (1990), the Supreme Court held that a search was valid if the police reasonably believed that the party giving consent had actual authority over the premises, but were incorrect in their belief. When two co-occupants are present, and one consents to a search but the other expressly objects, the Supreme Court has found that the police cannot validly search the premises.Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U.S. 103 (2006) However, if the objecting party is subsequently lawfully arrested and removed from the premises, the Court has held in Fernandez v. California (2014) that the police may search with the consent of the co-occupant remaining on the premises. Revoking consent and exceptions Usually, Consent can be revoked at almost any time during a consent-based search. If consent is revoked, the officer or officers performing the search are required to immediately stop searching. However, the right to revoke consent is not recognized in two specific cases: airport passenger screening and prison visitation. Withdrawing consent Once consent to search is given, an individual may withdraw or restrict a search. Consent is considered withdrawn if an unequivocal statement is made either through statements, actions, or a combination of both. Exceptions to revoking consent Most courts have found the right to revoke consent is removed once a passenger has begun X-ray screening. In United States v. Herzbrun (1984), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit found Herzbrun ‚Äúhad no constitutional right to revoke his consent to a search of his bag once it entered the X-ray machine and he walked through the magnetometer.‚Äù And in United States v. Pulido-Baquerizo (9th Cir. 1986), the court explained that ‚Äú[a] rule allowing a passenger to leave without a search after an inconclusive X-ray scan would encourage airline terrorism by providing a secure exit where detection was threatened.‚Äù A similar argument is applied to searches of prison visitors, for example, in United States v. Spriggs (1993). As long as a prison visitor is warned that all visitors will be searched and consents to the search, consent cannot be revoked once the search has begun. Allowing consent to be withdrawn, the court reasoned, would encourage the smuggling of contraband into prisons by providing a secure escape to the smuggler. During the course of a search an officer may develop reasonable suspicion or probable cause; once this has been developed the individual loses the right to revoke consent. However, in United States v. Fuentes (1997), the court found the ‚Äú[m]ere refusal to consent to a stop or search does not give rise to reasonable suspicion or probable cause.‚Äù Cities and states requiring informed consent Colorado In May 2010, the state of Colorado enacted an informed consent law requiring police to inform drivers of their right to decline a consent search. The law was enacted in an effort to reduce racial profiling. It extends not only to drivers but also pedestrians. Because the law focused on Fourth Amendment protections, it was able to get bipartisan agreement and was signed by the governor, a former tough-on-crime District Attorney. Fayetteville, North Carolina Fayetteville, North Carolina, (population 209,889) came under criticism after a study showed between 2009 and 2010 black motorists were three times more likely than whites to be searched after a stop. The city manager was forced out and the police chief retired. A law was passed requiring police to get written consent before performing a search beginning March, 2012. A new police chief was given a mandate to rebuild community trust.  Durham, North Carolina  In October, 2014 Durham, North Carolina (pop. 267,743), in response to a collection of groups lead by the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, adopted a written-consent policy for all searches. This was after the city was presented with clear documentation that blacks motorist were searched well above their share to the city's population. In implementing the policy, the city manager said it was in the interests of regaining the trust of the community.  New York City  The Right to Know Act was passed in 2017 by New York City's city council in response to the aggressive use of Stop-and- frisk in New York City by the police department. The law consists of two parts. One is the \\"Consent to Search\\" law which requires an officer to inform someone they have the right to deny a search and to make sure that person understands that right. The other is the \\"NYPD ID\\" law which requires the officer, in certain situations, to hand out business cards with their name, rank, badge number and command.

History  Chaghan- Khudah rule During its early history, the region often shifted between Sasanian and Hephthalite control. By the early 7th-century, Chaghaniyan became independent from Hephthalite rule, and came under the control of local Iranian rulers known as the ‚ÄúChaghan Khudah‚Äù. During the Muslim conquest of Persia, the Chaghan Khudah aided the Sasanians against the Rashidun Arabs. However, the Arabs, after having dealt with the Sasanian Empire, began focusing on the local rulers of Khorasan, which included the Chaghan Khudah and many other local rulers. In 652, the Chaghan Khudah, along with the rulers of Talaqan, Guzgan, and Faryab, aided the ruler of southern Tokharistan against the Arabs. Nevertheless, the Arabs managed to emerge victorious. However, the Rashidun Caliphate soon fell into civil war, and was conquered by another Arab family, who founded the Umayyad Caliphate in 661. During the early 660s, the Chaghan Khudah, named Turantash, sent an envoy under his chancellor Pukarzate to Varkhuman, the Sogdian king of Samarkand. Map of Khurasan, Transoxiana and Tokharistan in the 8th-century. Under the leadership of Ziyad ibn Abihi, the Umayyad viceroy of the eastern Caliphate, the Arab raids into Central Asia became more organized and his lieutenant governor of Khurasan, al-Hakam ibn Amr al-Ghifari, crossed the Oxus and raided Chaghaniyan in 667. His successor Rabi ibn Ziyad al-Harithi also launched an expedition into the region. According to H. A. R. Gibb, the expeditions against Chaghaniyan and other areas east of the Oxus river seemingly indicated ‚Äúa methodical plan of conquest‚Äù of Soghdiana by Ziyad. In 705, the Arab general Qutayba ibn Muslim managed to make the Chaghan Khudah, whose name is mentioned as Tish, acknowledge Umayyad authority. The real reason for Tish's submission, however, was to gain aid in defeating the local rulers of Akharun and Shuman in northern Tokharistan, who had been making incursions against him. Qutayba shortly defeated the two rulers, and forced them to acknowledge Umayyad authority. However, in 718, Tish, along with Gurak, the king of Samarkand, Narayana, the king of Kumadh, and Tughshada, the Bukhar Khudah of Bukhara, sent an embassy to the Tang dynasty of China, where they asked for aid against the Arabs. Nevertheless, the principality of Chaghaniyan still aided the Arabs against the Turgesh, and were present at the side of the Arabs during the Battle of the Baggage, where they were defeated and the Chaghan Khudah was killed. After the battle, most of Khorasan except Chaghaniyan remained under Arab control. Under Nasr ibn Sayyar, Chaghaniyan was once again a vassal of the Umayyad Caliphate. After this, the Chaghan Khudahs begin to fade from the sources. In the late 8th-century Chaghaniyan fell under the direct control of the Abbasid Caliphate, which had succeeded the Umayyad Caliphate in 750. The Muhtajids, an Iranian dynasty which in the 10th-century gained control over Chaghaniyan, may have been descended from the Chaghan Khudahs. Muhtajid rule and aftermath The founder of the Muhtajid dynasty was Abu Bakr Muhammad, who was a vassal of the Samanids, another Iranian dynasty. He was a loyal supporter of the Samanid ruler Nasr II (914-943), who in return, rewarded him by appointing him as the governor of Khorasan. In 939, Abu Bakr Muhammad fell ill and was replaced from his post by his son Abu 'Ali Chaghani. In 945, the Samanid ruler Nuh I dismissed Abu 'Ali from the governorship of Khurasan after hearing complaints of the latter's harsh rule, and sought to replace him with a Turk, the Simjurid Ibrahim ibn Simjur. Abu 'Ali refused to accept his dismissal and rebelled. He was joined by several prominent Iranian figures such as Abu Mansur Muhammad, whom he appointed as the commander of Khurasan. Abu 'Ali also convinced a Samanid, Nuh's uncle Ibrahim ibn Ahmad, to come from Iraq and installed him as ruler in Bukhara when he took the city in 947. Abu 'Ali, now having secured his position, returned to Chaghaniyan. Ibrahim, however, was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers. Iran in the mid-10th century. When the news of the re-capture of Bukhara arrived to Abu 'Ali, he once again marched towards Bukhara, but was defeated by an army sent by Nuh and withdrew back to Chaghaniyan. After some time, he left the region and tried to obtain support from other Samanid vassals. Meanwhile, Nuh had Chaghaniyan ravaged and its capital sacked. Another battle shortly ensured between Abu 'Ali and a Samanid army in Tokharistan, which resulted in a Samanid victory. Fortunately for Abu 'Ali, he managed to secure the support of other Samanid vassals, such as the rulers of Khuttal, and the Kumiji mountain people, and in the end made peace with Nuh, who allowed him to keep Chaghaniyan in return for sending his son Abu'l Muzaffar Abdallah as hostage to Bukhara. Some time later, Abu 'Ali was sent on an expedition to quell a rebellion near Chaghaniyan under a self-proclaimed prophet known as Mahdi. Abu 'Ali managed to successfully defeat and capture the latter and then had his head sent to Bukhara. In ca. 951/2, Abu 'Ali's son Abu'l Muzaffar Abdallah died in an accident and his corpse was shortly sent to Chaghaniyan, where he was buried. In 955, Abu 'Ali and one of his sons died of the plague. Their bodies were shortly brought to Chaghaniyan where they were buried. A certain Muhtajid prince, Abu'l Muzaffar ibn Muhammad, probably the grandson of 'Abu Ali, was then appointed as the new ruler of Chaghaniyan. However, according to some other sources, Abu 'Ali was succeeded by his relative Abu'l-Hasan Taher. By the end of the 10th-century, the Muhtajid dynasty became a vassal of the Ghaznavids, who had replaced the Samanids as the dominant power in Transoxiana and Khurasan. In 1025, an unnamed Muhtajid ruler and other Ghaznavid vassals joined the Ghaznavid ruler Mahmud of Ghazna when he crossed the Oxus River to meet his ally, the Karakhanid ruler of Kashgar Qadir-khan Yusuf. During the reign of Mahmud's successor Mas'ud, the governor of Chaghaniyan was a certain Abu'l-Qasem, who was the son-in-law of Mas'ud, and may have been a Muhtajid. Some years later, Abu'l-Qasem had to temporarily leave the province due to an invasion by Karakhanids. No more rulers of Chaghaniyan are mentioned after this, and only a few years later the Seljuks took control of the region. During the reign of the Alp Arslan (r. 1063‚Äì1072), his brother Ilyas ibn Chaghri Beg was appointed as the governor of Chaghaniyan. By the 12th-century, the name of the region itself ceases to be used.

Biography He was son of Edward More, and great-grandson of Sir Thomas More, lord chancellor of England. He must not be confused with his cousin, Henry More (born 1567), who was son of Thomas More and Mary Scrope. More was born in 1586 in Essex, according to the majority of the provincial catalogues, though a few of them give Cambridgeshire as the county of his birth. He made his humanity studies in the college of the English Jesuits at St. Omer, and entered the novitiate of St. John's, Louvain, 19 November 1607. His higher studies were probably made in Spain. In 1614, he filled the office of minister in the English college of St. Alban at Valladolid ; he held the same office in the college at St. Omer in 1621 ; and he was professed of the four vows 12 May 1622. From 1622 until 1632, he was a missioner in the London district, and he was one of the Jesuits arrested at the Clerkenwell residence, by the officers of the privy council in March 1628. In 1632, he was in confinement in the New Prison, London, and was released in December 1633. He then became chaplain to Lord Petre at Ingatestone and Thorndon Hall, Essex. In 1635, he was declared provincial superior of his order. Again imprisoned, he was set free in July 1640. In 1642, he was vice-provincial of the order, residing in London, and acting for Father Matthew Wilson, alias Edward Knott, the provincial, who was absent in Belgium. In 1645, he was rector of the college of St. Ignatius, which comprised the London district. He became rector of the college at St. Omer, and in 1655 he was again residing in Essex. In 1657, he was for the second time rector of the college at St. Omer, and he died at Watten, near that city, on 8 December 1661. Works During these latter years he wrote his important history of the English Jesuits: Historia Missionis Anglican√¶, ab anno MDLXXX ad MDCXXXV (St. Omer, 1660, fol.). Besides translating Jerome Platus's Happiness of the Religious State (1632), and the Manual of Meditations by Thomas de Villa Castin (1618), he wrote Vita et Doctrina Christi Domini in meditationes quotidianas per annum digesta (Antwerp, 1649), followed by an English version, entitled, Life and Doctrines of our Saviour Jesus Christ (Ghent, 1656, in two parts; London, 1880).

He was decorated as Knight in the L√©gion d'honneur. Life Von B√∂nninghausen was born on the estate Herinckhave near Fleringen in the province of Overijssel in the Netherlands as descendant of an old titled family. His father was Lodewijk Ernst von B√∂nninghausen, representative of the people from Overijssel, officer and chamberlain of the Prince-Bishop from K√∂ln. His mother was Theresia von Weichs zur Wenne. He attended the Gymnasium Paulinum in M√ºnster, studied law at the University of Groningen and graduated on Roman and old-Dutch law in 1806.

He was appointed head of the Botanical Gardens in M√ºnster from 1826 till 1845 and taught at what would later become the University of M√ºnster.http://www.lwl.org/westfaelische- geschichte/portal/Internet/finde/langDatensatz.php?urlID=741&url;_tabelle=tab_person He also led the constitutional commission of experts in the investigation of the nun Anne Catherine Emmerick. They concluded that her wounds were mechanically inflicted and not supernatural. However, her beatification in 2004 by Paus Johannes Paulus II was based on a supernatural origin.Schultz und Wundermann, Geschichte und vorl√§ufige Resultate der Untersuchung √ºber die Erscheinungen an der ehemaligen Nonne A.C.

Emmerich zu D√ºlmen mit autentischen Bel√§gen von Clemens von B√∂nninghausen, Landr√§thlichen Kommissar des Kreises Coesfeld, Coesfeld, 1820. Sickness and recovery In 1827, B√∂nninghausen contracted tuberculosis, followed by an intractable lung disease. Certain that he was about to die, he began writing farewell letters to his friends. One of them, friend and fellow botanist Carl Ernst August Weihe, urged him to use the herb Pulsatilla, believed to be the cure of his ailment. Von B√∂nninghausen was cured, and thus became a convert to the new therapy. In less than two years he wrote seven extensive works. He became a close associate and confidant of his teacher Samuel Hahnemann, founder of the homeopathy, who admired B√∂nninghausen's ability to systematize the expanding homeopathic knowledge of materia medica. Hahnemann was so enthusiastic that he called him his Lieblingssch√ºler (Favourite student). He said: \\"Am I to become sick myself, then I would trust no other physician in the world, except for him.\\" Scientific career Michigan. B√∂nninghausen's Therapeutic Pocketbook of 1846 was the first homeopathic repertory to grade individual remedies by their strength of relationship with each symptom, and each other. This so-called von B√∂nninghausen (or von Boenninghausen)-method has remained in use until the present day. He proposed that disparate symptoms associated with a remedy could be grouped as a single overarching tendency, hence the importance of generalities and modalities in his system of case analysis. His method was sometimes misunderstood by later homeopaths such as C. Hering and J.T. Kent. Latter did this on purpose, just to promote his own repertory. However, recent translations and revisions point to a revival of interest in B√∂nninghausen's approach. An early advocate of high potencies, he conducted a successful prospective trial of 200C in domestic animals and livestock, reasoning that veterinary homeopathy was harder to dismiss as a placebo effect. Because of his own miraculous healing and thanks to his public fame the people massively sought well-being at the doctor. Practising homeopathy successfully on a small scale without a medical degree, fascinated and ultimately led to von B√∂nninghausen receiving a medical licence by personal royal degree from Frederick William IV, King of Prussia in 1843. This made him a doctor and ensured that he could effectively treat patients. Among his growing international clientele, he saw some notable patients. One of the first was the poet Annette von Droste-H√ºlshoff. She was cured of tuberculosis. Also among them was the French Empress Eug√©nie de Montijo, wife of Napoleon III. In 1854 von B√∂nninghausen received an honorary degree from the Medical College in Cleveland (North America). And in 1861 the French Emperor Napoleon III decorated him as Knight in the L√©gion d'honneur. The standard author abbreviation Boenn. is used to indicate von B√∂nninghausen as the author when citing a botanical name. A list of plants discovered by him can be found in the IPNI. Descendants The two oldest of his seven sons became a homeopath as well. Karl von B√∂nninghausen, the eldest, went to Paris where he had access to the private library and manuscripts of Hahnemann and married Sophie, the adopted daughter of Melanie Hahnemann (Hahnemann's widow). Post mortem His grave on the old H√∂rster graveyard in M√ºnster was destroyed in a bombardment during the Second World War. Nowadays the scholar is being remembered at this very place with a sandstone monument displaying a picture of the baron. Also, several streets and plants are named after him, like the Boenninghausenia altiflora, Boeninghausia vincentina and a genus of the Rutaceae, Boenninghausenia. In 1990 the Clemens von B√∂nninghausen Academy was founded, and in 2009 the Von B√∂nninghausen Institute. A memorial to von B√∂nninghausen was installed in 2005 at the University of M√ºnster, on the celebration of the 250th birthday of Samuel Hahnemann's birth.

The museum has the largest aviation collection between Yorkshire and Scotland and houses over 30 aircraft and a wide collection of aero engines. The museum also has a small collection of other items such as weaponry, vehicles and other historical exhibits. The museum also has special displays showing a replica of a Second World War British street and one honouring No. 607 Squadron RAF, which was based at RAF Usworth. NELSAM is an English registered charity. History The North East Land, Sea and Air Museums traces its origins back to the formation of the North East Vintage and Veteran Aircraft Association (NEAVVAA) , which started meeting in March 1974 at the Sunderland Airport, which had been RAF Usworth. In March 1975 the group purchased a Westland WS-51 Dragonfly helicopter from a scrapyard and this became its first aircraft. The group continued to accumulate aircraft and in May 1977 changed its name to the Northumbian Aeronautical Collection. In 1979 the name was changed again, to North East Aircraft Museum. More aircraft were added, including an Avro Vulcan in January 1983. The logo used when the museum was called the North East Aircraft Museum In April 1984 the local government, Sunderland Council announced that the airport would be closed to make way for an automobile manufacturing plant. After protracted negotiations the museum was given a lease on a four acre site just outside the airfield. In 1987 the museum was opened to the public on a full-time basis. In 1989 the museum started to fund raise to construct buildings to house at last some of the collection indoors and in 1991 planning authority was granted for a new hangar to be built, actual construction of which was started in 1993. The museum used the old Sunderland Airport control tower for storage and administrative use and it was burnt in an arsonist attack in September 1996.Paul Wilkinson, \\"Museum Vandals Destroy 50 Years of Flying History\\", The Times, 25 January 1997, archived from the original, 11 April 2017 On 23 January 1997, arsonists destroyed the museum's Vickers Valetta C2 (VX577), which was one of only three Valettas in existence.Aircraft and Air Display International, Arsonist destroys Valetta, March 1997, p. 89 The Valletta's restoration work had taken two years and was completed the previous summer.Paul Wilkinson, \\"Museum Vandals Destroy 50 Years of Flying History\\", The Times, 25 January 1997 A military vehicle collection previously displayed in Newcastle upon Tyne began relocation to the museum's new large Romney hut in early 2012.

He was also a diplomat whose accomplishments included helping end the Russo-Japanese War favorably for Japan and obtaining former German possessions in the Pacific for Japan following World War I. In addition, he was a patron and practitioner of the Japanese martial arts, especially judo, sumo, and aikido.  Early years  Born Yamamoto Jiro into a samurai class family in Kagoshima, Satsuma domain (present-day Kagoshima prefecture), he was adopted into the Takeshita family as a boy.Pranin, Stanley. \\"Takeshita, Isamu,\\" The Encyclopedia of Aikido Naval and diplomatic career Takeshita entered the 15th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1892, and he graduated third in a class of eighty students. He entered naval service as a midshipman in 1889; his first ship was the armored corvette Kongo. In 1898, he attended the Japanese Naval War College, which had been founded that same year. Because he was fluent in English, Takeshita was posted overseas at various times as a naval attach√©. In October 1902, he was appointed Japan's naval attach√© to the United States. In this role, Takeshita was an active participant in negotiations mediated by President Theodore Roosevelt that led to the Treaty of Portsmouth, ending the Russo-Japanese War. During 1904, he also helped Roosevelt obtain the services of judo teacher Yamashita Yoshitsugu, first for Roosevelt himself and then for the United States Naval Academy.Svinth, Joseph R. \\"Professor Yamashita Goes to Washington\\". Takeshita's commands included the cruisers Suma, Kasuga, Izumo, Tsukuba and the battleship Shikishima. Takeshita was a member of the Japanese diplomatic mission to the United States in 1917,The Imperial Japanese Mission 1917, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, ; New York Times, October 3, 1917 the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, and the League of Nations. In these positions, he played a leading role in Japan's obtaining former German holdings in the Central and Western Pacific.Gow, I.T.M. Military Intervention in Pre-War Japanese Politics: Admiral Kato Kanji and the 'Washington System'. London: Routledge, 2004, p. 71.Peattie, Mark R. Nan'yo: The Rise and Fall of the Japanese in Micronesia, 1885-1945. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i, 1988, p.50. For these efforts, he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (1st class). Takeshita returned to Japan to accept a posting as commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet on 1 December 1922, a position he held until January 1924. His subsequent billets included Commander of the Kure Naval District. He was placed on the retired list in November 1929.  Activities after retirement  During late summer 1935, Takeshita made his fifth trip to the United States.New York Times, September 5, 1935. His mission was to try to explain to American audiences that Japan's invasion of China in the Second Sino-Japanese War, was to stop the spread of Communism.Japanese-American Courier, August 31, 1935, p. 1; Great Northern Daily News, September 7, 1935, p. 8; New York Times, September 25, 1935; New York Times, September 27, 1935. As for Japan's relationship with the United States, Takeshita stated that \\"No Japanese warship has ever crossed the Pacific except on a mission of peace,\\" he said during a radio broadcast in San Francisco. \\"No Japanese soldier has ever come to these shores except on a similar mission.\\"Great Northern Daily News, September 5, 1935, p. 8. In February 1937, Takeshita was appointed head of the Japanese Boy Scouts, Sea Scouts, and YMCA. This was part of the general militarization of Japanese sports and athletics taking place at that time.Abe, Ikuo, Kiyohara,Yasuharu, and Nakajima, Ken. \\"Sport and physical education under fascistization in Japan,\\" Bulletin of Health and Sport Sciences, University of Tsukuba, 13, 1990, pp. 25-46. Later that year, he was also approached about becoming the head of the Japanese Amateur Athletic Federation, but he declined this offer.Japan Times and Mail, December 17, 1936, p. 5. In May 1939, Takeshita became the third president of the Japan Sumo Association.Japan Times and Mail, May 4, 1939 He held this post until November 1945.Nippon Times, November 28, 1945, p. 3 In April 1941, he became head of Japan's New Sword Society. This organization supported makers of modern Japanese swords that were handmade in the traditional fashion.Nippon Times, April 11, 1941, p. 2; Nippon Times, June 4, 1941, p.8. Takeshita died in Tokyo in July 1949.New York Times, July 7, 1949. Takeshita Street in Shibuya, Tokyo takes its name from the location of Isamu Takeshita‚Äôs residence. Connection with aikido  Encounter with Morihei Ueshiba  Takeshita first heard of Morihei Ueshiba through his colleague at the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, Admiral Seikyo Asano, who was studying Daito-ryu aiki jujutsu (the forerunner of aikido) under Ueshiba at Ayabe. In 1925, Takeshita went to Ayabe to see Ueshiba and was so impressed that he recommended Ueshiba to Yamamoto Gonnohyoe, a retired admiral and former Prime Minister of Japan. This recommendation caused Yamamoto to invite Ueshiba to Tokyo to provide demonstrations to the Japanese military and political elite. Ueshiba's stay was however interrupted by sickness and he had to return to his hometown of Tanabe. In February 1927, Takeshita invited Ueshiba to Tokyo again, and this time, Ueshiba settled there.Ueshiba, Morihei and Ueshiba, Kiss≈çmaru. Budo: Teachings of the Founder of Aikido. Translated by John Stevens. Tokyo: Kodansha International, 1996, p. 14. Takeshita's influence was such that many military officers, government officials and members of the wealthy class began practicing Ueshiba's martial art. Takeshita was not only an admirer but also an ardent practitioner of aikido, despite his age (he was almost 50). He filled notebooks with descriptions of Ueshiba's techniques, and these descriptions provide insights into the development of aikido.Pranin, Stanley A. \\"Morihei Ueshiba and Admiral Isamu Takeshita,\\" Aiki News, 97, Fall/Winter 1993.  Role in the promotion of aikido  In 1935, Takeshita gave a demonstration of Ueshiba's art at the first Nihon Kobudo Shinkokai (Society for the Promotion of Japanese Classical Martial Arts) demonstration. Later that same year, Takeshita gave public demonstrations of aikido in Seattle, Washington and Washington, D.C; this was the introduction of aikido to the United States.Svinth, Joseph R. \\"Aikido Comes to America: September 1935.\\"; New York Times, September 21, 1935. In 1940, Takeshita was instrumental in providing a legal identity to Ueshiba's Kobukan organization by founding the Kobukai Foundation and becoming its first president. Also, in 1941, Takeshita used his influence to arrange a demonstration of aikido by Ueshiba at the Imperial Palace. The demonstration took place in front of the Imperial family. Although ill, Ueshiba gave a spectacular exhibition, which greatly impressed the nobility.

Swarthbeck Gill on the east - which separates the fell from its twin, Arthur's Pike - falls to Ullswater through a ravine. The western boundary is formed by Fusedale Beck which also flows to the lake. Bonscale Pike would be unlikely to register as a separate fell, but for the craggy western face. This is seen to best effect from Howtown or from a steamer on Ullswater, and swayed Wainwright to give the top a chapter in its own right.Wainwright, A:A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 2: Summit Depending upon their state of repair, two fine beacons (columnar cairns) may be prominent in the views from below. Bonscale Tower is the lower one, and both are placed on the rim of the crags. The actual summit is marked by a small cairn on a grassy mound, some yards behind. The view is masked to the south by Loadpot Hill, but the Helvellyns are well seen across the lake. Ascents Ascent is usually from Howtown, a path slanting up across the breast of the fell. The crags can either be rounded to the north via the beacons, or via a more direct line to the south. The latter has no clear path. A fair path runs along the ridge to Loadpot Hill, crossing the High Street Roman road to the south of Brock Crag, a number of old boundary stones being encountered on this route. A traverse can also be made to Arthur's Pike, crossing Swarthbeck Gill near its source.

Peter Mahon was born into an Irish Roman Catholic family in Bootle which was immersed in Liverpool Labour politics. He joined the Labour Party in 1924, at the age of 15. His father, Alderman Simon Mahon (1886‚Äì1961), was a local politician, who also stood unsuccessfully for Parliament. His brother, Simon Mahon, was elected MP for Bootle in 1955. His great-nephew, Peter Dowd, is the present Labour MP for Bootle, and served as Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury until 2020. In 1954, Mahon was selected as parliamentary candidate for the marginal seat of Blackburn West, but the seat was abolished by redistribution prior to the 1955 general election. Almost a decade later he was selected for the \\"bellwether\\" marginal seat of Preston South, a constituency with a significant Catholic population. At the 1964 general election, he was elected as member of parliament for Preston South, defeating the sitting Conservative MP Alan Green by only 348 votes. He held the seat at the 1966 election with an increased majority, but at the 1970 general election, Green retook the seat with a majority of over 1,300. On his election, Mahon introduced a Private Members Bill, to remove the necessity of applying for Probate in winding-up the estate of a poor person. The bill passed into law as the Administration of Estates (Small Payments) Act 1965. During his time in parliament, Mahon was a vociferous opponent of relaxation of the Abortion Laws, and in 1966 was responsible for the failure of David Steel's first attempt to introduce an Abortion reform bill, by his use of the parliamentary device of \\"talking out.\\" In 1971, Mahon sought the Labour party nomination in the Liverpool Scotland by-election, the seat with the largest Irish Catholic electorate in Britain; his brother Simon Mahon was Labour MP for the adjoining seat of Bootle. Peter Mahon was not selected, and instead stood in the by-election as an Independent \\"Labour and Anti-Abortion\\" candidate, securing a respectable 10.3% of the vote. He was expelled from the Labour party, and in 1973 he joined the Liberals. He subsequently sat as a Liberal councillor on Liverpool City Council and Liverpool Metropolitan District Council. His grandson, Peter Garrett (b. 1966), former research director of LIFE, was a member of the Labour party until he resigned in 2000 in opposition to the party's stance on human cloning. He stood in the 2000 Preston by-election for the Preston Alliance, a group which campaigned for respect for human life and was endorsed by the Christian Peoples' Alliance.

In most cases, a search warrant pursuant to the Fourth Amendment is required to perform a lawful search; an exception to this requirement is SITA. Related case law 1940s *In Harris v. United States (1947), the United States Supreme Court held that a law enforcement officer was permitted to perform a warrantless search during or immediately after a lawful arrest of the arrestee and their premises, regardless of what the arrest was for. 1950s *In United States v. Rabinowitz (1950), the court narrowed its ruling to searches of the area within the arrestee's \\"immediate control.\\" 1960s *In Chimel v. California (1969), the Court further limited the exception to the person arrested and the area within their immediate control \\"in order to remove any weapons that the [arrestee] might seek to use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape\\" and to prevent the \\"concealment or destruction\\" of evidence. 1970s *United States v. Robinson (1973) ‚Äì The U.S. Supreme Court held that \\"in the case of a lawful custodial arrest a full search of the person is not only an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, but is also a reasonable search under that Amendment.\\" 1990s *Maryland v. Buie (1990) ‚Äì The U.S. Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment permits a properly limited protective sweep in conjunction with an in-home arrest when the searching officer possesses a reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts that the area to be swept harbors an individual posing a danger to those on the arrest scene. 2000s *Arizona v. Gant (2009) ‚Äì The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that law enforcement officers can search automobiles following arrest only if the person arrested \\"could have accessed his car at the time of the search.\\" In other words, if the person arrested could conceivably reach into his car for a weapon, then a search based on officer safety is permitted. Otherwise, the old practice of allowing officers to \\"search [a car] incident to arrest\\" is no longer allowed, unless the police have reason to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest. 2010s * Missouri v. McNeely (2013) The United States Supreme Court ruled that police must generally obtain a warrant before subjecting a drunken-driving suspect to a blood test, and that the natural metabolism of blood alcohol does not establish a per se exigency that would justify a blood draw without consent. *Riley v. California (2014) ‚Äì The U.S. Supreme Court held that \\"police generally may not, without a warrant, search digital information on a cell phone seized from an individual who has been arrested.\\" In other words, unless an exigent circumstance is present, police may not search an arrestee's cell phone without a warrant. *Birchfield v. North Dakota (2016) - The U.S. Supreme Court held that for driving under the influence investigations warrantless breathalyzer tests are permissible under the fourth amendment given that impact on privacy is \\"slight\\" while more intrusive blood tests involving piercing the skin are not. In the opinion of the court, the court states that \\"there must be a limit to the consequences to which motorists may be deemed to have consented by virtue of a decision to drive on public roads\\" under implied consent laws and \\"that motorists could be deemed to have consented to only those conditions that are 'reasonable' in that they have a 'nexus' to the privilege of driving\\".

The motor vehicle exception is a legal rule in the United States that modifies the normal probable cause requirement of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and, when applicable, allows a police officer to search a motor vehicle without a search warrant. Description The motor vehicle exception was first established by the United States Supreme Court in 1925, in Carroll v. United States. The motor vehicle exception allows officers to search a vehicle without a search warrant if they have probable cause to believe that evidence or contraband is in the vehicle.Hendrie, E. (August 2005). \\"The Motor Vehicle Exception.\\" FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, 74, Retrieved August 14, 2006 The exception is based on the idea that there is a lower expectation of privacy in motor vehicles because of the regulations under which they operate. Also, the ease of mobility creates an inherent exigency to prevent the removal of evidence and contraband. In Pennsylvania v. Labron the US Supreme Court stated, \\"If a car is readily mobile and probable cause exists to believe it contains contraband, the Fourth Amendment permits the police to search the vehicle without more.\\" The scope of the search is limited to only the area that the officers have probable cause to search. The area can encompass the entire vehicle, including the trunk. The motor vehicle exception, in addition to allowing officers to search the vehicle, allows officers to search any containers found inside the vehicle that could contain the evidence or contraband for which is searched. The objects searched do not need to belong to the owner of the vehicle. In Wyoming v. Houghton, the US Supreme Court ruled that the ownership of objects searched in the vehicle is irrelevant to the legitimacy of the search. Some states' constitutions require officers to show there was not enough time to obtain a warrant. Except for states with that requirement, officers are not required to obtain a warrant even if it may be possible to do so. In United States v. Ludwig, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals found that a search warrant is not required even if there is little or no risk of the vehicle being driven off. The court stated, \\"If police have probable cause to search a car, they need not get a search warrant first even if they have time and opportunity.\\" In United States v. Johns, the US Supreme Court upheld a search of a vehicle that had been seized and was in police custody for three days prior to the search: \\"A vehicle lawfully in police custody may be searched on the basis of probable cause to believe it contains contraband, and there is no requirement of exigent circumstances to justify such a warrantless search.\\" The US Supreme Court in California v. Carney found the motor vehicle exception to apply to a motor home. The court, however, made a distinction between readily-mobile motor homes and parked mobile homes. A number of factors, including the home being elevated on blocks, the vehicle being licensed, and its connection to utilities determine if the motor vehicle exception applies. In United States v. Johns, the motor vehicle exception was applied to trucks. In United States v. Forrest, it was applied to trailers pulled by trucks and to boats. In United States v. Hill, it was applied to house boats. In United States v. Nigro and United States v. Montgomery, the motor vehicle exception was found to apply to airplanes. Development The motor vehicle exception has gone through five phases as marked by Supreme Court cases:1-18 Search and Seizure ¬ß 18.3.

Part II of the act is a statutory code governing business tenancies. Part I of the act, which deals with the protection of residential tenancies, is now largely superseded. Part II of the act gives business tenants a degree of security of tenure. A business tenant protected by the act may not be evicted simply by the giving of notice to quit or by the ending of a fixed term of the tenancy. The landlord must serve a notice on the tenant, stating which of the seven grounds of opposition they wish to rely upon to oppose a new tenancy.  Applicability  Part II of the Act applies to any tenancy where the property \\"is or includes premises which are occupied by the tenant and are so occupied for the purposes of a business carried on by him or for those and other purposes\\".section 23 There are some exceptions from the Act. These are included in S.43. These include mining leases and agricultural premises. The Act doesn't protect leases under a period of 6 months which hold no scope to renew. Both parties can agree not to be covered. Additionally, a tenancy granted by reason of employment by the grantor is excluded from the Act - providing that there is clear agreement in writing which states the purpose of the tenancy In Graysim Holdings Ltd v P.&O.; Property Holdings Ltd[1996] 1 AC 329 the House of Lords considered the situation of a lease of a market hall to a tenant who then let individual market stalls to market traders. The questions was, whether the tenant could take advantage of the protection offered by the act. The House of Lords decided that the tenant could not be said to occupy for the purposes of the business that was being carried on there (which was being carried out by the market traders). This decision was followed in Bassairi Limited v London Borough of Camden,Court of Appeal, Thursday 19 February 1998 (unreported) where the tenant let out the bulk of the premises as furnished apartments. Again, it was held that the tenant did not occupy for the purposes of a business.

The SPEAK test continues to be administered to non-native English speakers, though it is no longer supported by ETS. No new versions of this test exist. The test aims to evaluate the examinee's proficiency in spoken English; however, most academic institutions recognize that it is limited in that capacity, and have therefore abandoned using it. It is usually taken as a professional certification, especially for graduate teaching assistants in the American college and university system, who are often required to hold office hours and converse in English with students. It is also used in the medical profession, where communication with patients is required. The SPEAK test has been routinely criticized for not accurately testing how a speaker will perform in the real world, in part because it is administered by recording the individual speaking into a recording device rather than speaking to a person. The SPEAK test has also been criticized for using native speaker norms to judge non-native speakers. In fact, independent audits of the SPEAK test conducted in 2012 on some of the few institutions found to still administer this test revealed that the assessment standards provided by ETS were not even being used by the assessors. In fact, in some cases, the assessors of the test were not trained in any way to conduct the assessments, and were found to be assigning arbitrary grades to the candidates. Some of the raters audited were found to themselves have limited functional spoken grammar. The SPEAK test is no longer offered at most academic institutions. However, some institutions still recognize the SPEAK test for enrollment in certain degree programs where the proficiency of an individual's spoken English is deemed to be the priority. The SPEAK test is very similar to the Test of Spoken English (TSE) and is in fact a form of the TSE developed for institutions by using retired forms of the TSE. The SPEAK test is no longer supported by ETS. There are no new versions of this test being produced. In fact, there may only be a few versions of the test still in existence. Therefore, academic institutions and other agencies that would recognize this test as a valid assessment of an individual's capabilities in spoken English should be aware that this test highly susceptible to fraud. Versions of the test that may still be in use by academic institutions administering this test are compromised, and it is highly likely that people with results from this test have had the opportunity to take exactly the same test multiple times. ETS developed the four skills (listening, reading, speaking and writing) TOEFL iBT test. The Speaking section of the TOEFL is not available separately from the other sections, but institutions wishing to test speaking skills only may want to use the TOEIC ( of English for International Communication) Speaking Test, also developed by ETS and available as a stand-alone assessment.

The film follows a photographer, George, and his family who experience the presence of a dark force in a cabin during their wintry weekend at upstate New York while being antagonized by a local hunter after accidentally hitting a deer on the road. Meanwhile, George's son, Miles, begins to have vivid hallucinations of the legendary Wendigo, who he believes to be responsible for the dark forces The film was released to theatres on January 23, 2001, for a limited time, and received mixed reviews by critics. The film was not a major box office attraction and bombed as it scored $1.1 thousand on opening weekend. Plot George (Jake Weber) is a highly-strung professional photographer who is starting to unravel from the stress of his work with a Manhattan advertising agency. Needing some time away from the city, his wife Kim (Patricia Clarkson), and their 10-year-old son Miles (Erik Per Sullivan) head to upstate New York to take in the winter sights, though the drive up is hardly relaxing for any of them. George accidentally hits and severely injures a deer that ran onto the icy road. After George stops to inspect the damage, he's confronted by an angry local named Otis who flies into a rage, telling George that he and his fellow hunters had been tracking the deer for some time. An argument breaks out, which leaves George feeling deeply shaken. When George and Kim arrive at their cabin, they discover that a dark and intimidating presence seems to have taken it over. The next day, when they stop at a store in a town near the cabin, a shopkeeper tells Miles about the legend of the Wendigo, a deformed beast from Native American folklore who changes from a human to a hideous beast after engaging in cannibalism. The shopkeeper also tells him that the Wendigo also has supernatural powers and the ability to change its appearance at will. The shopkeeper then gives him a small figurine of a Wendigo. Miles can't help but think the Wendigo has something to do with the dark forces at work in the woods near the cabin. Later that day, while sledding together, George suddenly falls to the ground, leaving Miles alone and lost in the woods. Frightened, Miles approaches his dad when he is chased by the Wendigo and passes out. He is awakened later by a frightened Kim, who went looking for her family once they didn't come home. Kim and Miles begin a trek deep into the forest, until they end up at the house, where they find a bloody George crawling towards the car claiming Otis shot him. Frantic, Kim and Miles put George in the car and drive to the nearest hospital. It is revealed that George and Miles were sledding near a shooting range and Otis shot George in the liver with a hunting rifle. George undergoes emergency surgery and Miles walks into the hospital, hallucinates that his father is being assaulted by the Wendigo and faints. He awakens only to find that George has died. Otis is confronted by the local sheriff, but he kills the sheriff and drives away into the night, being stalked by the Wendigo until he crashes into a tree and runs away into the forest, eventually ending up on a road where he is hit by the deputy sheriff's squad car. The movie ends with Otis being carted into the emergency room of the hospital, and being followed by the Indian shopkeeper while Miles watches it all, caressing the Wendigo figurine.  Connections to the Wendigo  Despite its title, the film does not bear much resemblance to the legend whatsoever. The movie Ravenous is arguably closer; the term wendigo is only mentioned by a Native American scout. Fessenden would later revisit the Wendigo story in his script for the 2015 video game Until Dawn.

Home media The film was released on DVD by Live/Artisan on Dec 17, 2002. It was re-released by Cinema Club on Jun 16, 2003.  Reception  Wendigo was met with mixed reviews by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 60% based on , with a weighted average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"An artsy horror flick, Wendigo effectively creates an eerie atmosphere.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \\"Generally favorable reviews\\". Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half out of four stars. In his review, Ebert wrote, Wendigo is a good movie with an ending that doesn't work. While it was not working I felt a keen disappointment, because the rest of the movie works so well\\". Dave Kehr of The New York Times gave the film a positive review stating, \\"As in his previous films, Mr. Fessenden carefully blurs the line between psychology and the supernatural, suggesting that each is strongly implicated in the other. The rampaging Wendigo may be a manifestation of Miles's incipient Oedipal rage, but at the same time it is a force embedded in nature and history. Such abstract notions may put off fans of the genre in its most elemental, slice-and-dice form. But for those in search of something different, Wendigo is a genuinely bone-chilling tale\\". Felix Vasquez, Jr. from Cinema Crazed.com gave the film a positive review, praising the film's ending and suspense. AllMovie called the film \\"effectively creepy\\" and \\"surprisingly unsettling\\", \\"despite its inherent cheesiness\\".

Hardy himself described this work as \\"an epic-drama of the war with Napoleon, in three parts, nineteen acts and one hundred and thirty scenes\\". Not counting the Forescene and the Afterscene, the exact total number of scenes is 131. The three parts were published in 1904, 1906 and 1908. Because of the ambition and scale of the work, Hardy acknowledged that The Dynasts was not a work that could be conventionally staged in the theatre, and described the work as \\"the longest English drama in existence\\". Scholars have noted that Hardy remembered war stories of the veterans of the Napoleonic wars in his youth, and used them as partial inspiration for writing The Dynasts many years later in his own old age. In addition, Hardy was a distant relative of Captain Thomas Hardy, who had served with Admiral Horatio Nelson at Trafalgar. Hardy consulted a number of histories and also visited Waterloo, Belgium, as part of his research.Orel, Harold, \\"Thomas Hardy's Epic-Drama: A Study of The Dynasts\\". University of Kansas Publications (Humanistic Studies No 36), Lawrence, Kansas, USA, 1963. George Orwell wrote that Hardy had \\"set free his genius\\" by writing this drama and thought its main appeal was \\"in the grandiose and rather evil vision of armies marching and counter-marching through the mists, and men dying by hundreds of thousands in the Russian snows, and all for absolutely nothing.\\"Orwell, 'Thomas Hardy Looks at War' in Tribune, 18 September 1942 Synopsis In addition to the various historical figures, The Dynasts also contains an extensive tragic chorus of metaphysical figures (\\"Spirits\\" and \\"Ancient Spirits\\") who observe and discuss the events.

The Overworld Analysis Hardy regarded The Dynasts as his magnum opus and devoted much of his later life to its completion, but the work was not well received, and later critics have seen little reason to reverse that judgement. There is a case to be made, however, for the drama's having pioneered techniques that would later be regarded as characterising literary Modernism. Moreover, The Dynasts remains of interest to those studying Hardy's novels, both for the insight into his world-view and for its examination of a character mentioned famously but briefly at the end of Tess of the d'Urbervilles: the \\"President of the Immortals\\". The design of The Dynasts is extremely ambitious, and because of its coverage of historical events of the same era, has received comparison to Tolstoy's War and Peace. Emma Clifford has written that Hardy used Tolstoy's novel as one of many sources of inspiration for the work, and in fact owned an early translation. However, it was not necessarily as a primary source, as Hardy also drew on the History of Europe by Archibald Alison, among others. Hardy juxtaposes scenes of ordinary life with scenes involving the principal historical figures of the age, and concentrating on their desire to found dynasties to preserve their power. There are extensive descriptions of landscape and battle scenes that are characterised by shifts of visual perspective that, in the opinion of John Wain,Wain, John, Introduction to The Dynasts by Thomas Hardy, St Martin's Press (Papermac), 1965 printing. anticipate cinematic techniques. George Witter Sherman has postulated on Hardy's observations of life in London as influences on elements of The Dynasts. Elna Sherman has discussed Hardy's references to music and songs in the work. Anna Henchman has written about Hardy's use of imagery in the manner of astronomical observation at great distances from the earth in this work. Lawrence Jones has analysed Hardy's idiosyncrasies in his manner of narrative in The Dynasts. J.O. Bailey has postulated an analogy of the Spirits in The Dynasts with other Mephistopheles- like figures in literature, and in relation to the Book of Job.

Early life  Pratt was born in Brooklyn, New York, on December 25, 1873. He was one of six children born to industrialist and Standard Oil co-founder Charles Pratt and Mary Helen (n√©e Richardson) Pratt. His siblings included brothers Frederic Bayley Pratt, George Dupont Pratt, Herbert Lee Pratt, and Harold Irving Pratt. From his father's first marriage, he had two half-siblings including Charles Millard Pratt. After graduating from Amherst College in 1896, he studied at Harvard Law School, graduating in 1900. Career He worked as a lawyer for the prestigious firm of Carter and Ledyard at 54 Wall Street in New York. Pratt became a director in the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad, and a trustee in the Pratt Institute which was founded by his father. He was also a partner in the Stock Exchange firm of Grayson M.P. Murphy & Co. and a director of several banks.  Personal life  Pratt's wife, U.S. Representative from New York, Ruth Baker Pratt, c. 1933 In 1904, Pratt was married to Ruth Sears Baker (1877‚Äì1965), a Wellesley College graduate and the daughter of Edwin K. Baker, a Massachusetts dry-goods merchant. In 1929, two years after his eventual death in 1927, Ruth became the first woman elected to the United States Congress from the State of New York. Together, they were the parents of five children: * John Teele Pratt Jr. (1903‚Äì1969), who was married to Mary Christy Tiffany (1905‚Äì1980), the daughter of George Shepley Tiffany. They divorced and he later married Elizabeth Ogden Woodward (1907‚Äì1986), the daughter of William Woodward Sr. and the former wife of Robert Livingston Stevens Jr. After his death, she married Alexander Cochrane Cushing, founder of Squaw Valley Ski Resort. * Virginia Pratt (1905‚Äì1979), who married Robert Helyer Thayer (1901‚àí1984), a U.S. Minister to Romania, in 1926. * Sally Sears Pratt (1908‚Äì1973), who married James Tracy Jackson III (1905‚Äì1986) in 1928. * Phyllis Pratt (1912‚Äì1987), who married Paul Henry Nitze (1907‚Äì2004), the Secretary of the Navy and Deputy Secretary of Defense under President Lyndon B.

Pratt died suddenly in his Broadway office on June 17, 1927, aged 53, of heart disease. Thirty six years earlier, his father, Charles Pratt, had died of heart disease in offices at the same address.  Legacy  In 1910, Pratt and his wife had a brick neo-Georgian mansion, known as \\"The Manor\\", designed by architect Charles A. Platt built at their 55-acre Glen Cove estate. In 1913, it was considered by Country Life Magazine to be one of the best twelve country houses in America. The home served as the summer White House for Herbert Hoover. It is now the Glen Cove Mansion Hotel and Conference Center. The John Teele Pratt residence, at 11 East 61st St. in New York City was purchased by the Pratts, who hired Charles Pierrepont Henry Gilbert to remodel the 1872 home in April 1907. In 1914, Pratt purchased the neighboring homes at 7 and 9 East 61st Street and hired Platt to tear them down and design a new residence. Descendants Through his eldest son John, he was the grandfather of Mary Christy Pratt (1923‚Äì1960), who was married to Bayard Cutting Auchincloss (1922‚Äì2001), the nephew of U.S. Representative James C.

Life Carmichael was born in Quincy, Illinois, the son of a Pentecostal minister, who allowed his son to play the violin and listen to the radio. \\"I was captivated by the chordal explosions I heard on the radio. I felt a sadness that we didn't have that in our church. Our church orchestra sounded weak and terrible by comparison. It was embarrassing. Why? Why did we have to settle? Why couldn't we use those gorgeous rhythms, sweeping strings, the brass, the stirring chords? That started to control everything I did.\\"Vanguard Magazine (Vanguard University), Costa Mesa, California, Fall 2005, interview with Ralph Carmichael As a teenager he played violin with the San Jose Civic Symphony. At 17 he enrolled at Southern California Bible College, now Vanguard University, to become a preacher like his father, grandfather, three uncles and five cousins. He started a campus men's quartet, ensembles and mixed groups of all kinds, blending jazz and classical music techniques with gospel songs and hymns. His musical \\"experiments\\" proved instantly controversial. His bands were unwelcome at many churches, and he was not allowed to store the baritone saxophone on campus because of its worldly associations with big band music. After college, reaction to his band was mixed from the Christian community. One church made them hide the drums behind a curtain; a pastor in Oakland stopped the band mid-song because the music sounded too worldly. After a performance at a men's fellowship in Pasadena, however, Carmichael's band was invited to audition for television. This program drew so much mail from Christians that the station asked for more shows. In 1951, he was invited to score a film for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association; in all he wrote the musical score for twenty of their films. For BGEA, he made the funky urban soundtrack for the 1970 film The Cross and the Switchblade. By the late 1950s, secular producers had taken notice of Carmichael's radio and film work. He was invited to assist the composer at the television sitcom I Love Lucy and was soon arranging music for that show as well as Bonanza and The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Show and for singer Rosemary Clooney. In 1958, Carmichael was hired by producer Jack H. Harris to score his science fiction film, The Blob. With the success of the film, Carmichael was brought back to score Harris' follow-up film, 4D Man. He arranged and composed music for a Bing Crosby Christmas special television program, which prompted his denomination to strongly suggest he not apply for renewal of his ordination. He also composed and conducted the theme music for the 1965 sitcom, My Mother the Car. Nat King Cole His big break came at the end of the 1950s, when his work came to the attention of Capitol Records, who asked him to provide the arrangements for an album of mainly sacred Christmas songs by one of the label's biggest stars, Nat King Cole. The result, The Magic of Christmas, was released for the 1960 festive season, by which time Capitol had already set Carmichael to work with Cole on more secular albums. Carmichael duly became Cole's most regularly utilized arranger from then until the singer's death in early 1965, their first mainstream pop collaboration being The Touch of Your Lips (also 1960), an album of romantic ballads backed by lush strings, and their final team-up being Cole's last album, L-O-V-E, with jazzy big band arrangements, recorded in December 1964, only two months before Cole succumbed to the lung cancer which was already in its advanced stages. Other performers Carmichael wrote arrangements for many other top performers, including Ella Fitzgerald, Bing Crosby, Jack Jones, Peggy Lee, Julie London, Al Martino and Roger Williams. He arranged most of the carols on the 1961 Stan Kenton album A Merry Christmas!. Christian music It is in the field of Christian music that Carmichael has been most prolific. In particular, his experiments in pop-rock style in the 1960s and 1970s have brought him recognition as the \\"Father of Contemporary Christian Music\\". He founded Light Records in order to widen the audience for the music of the Jesus People. He was subject to controversy from within the church, being called a heretic for his use of guitars in worship and his adaptations of Gospel songs to big band stylings. Manna Music Inc founders Tim and Hal Spencer introduced Andra√© Crouch to Carmichael, helping to launch Crouch's recording career. Carmichael also provided the backing for a number of RCA albums by Gospel singer George Beverly Shea, including The Love of God in 1958, and How Great Thou Art in 1969. In 1969, Carmichael and Kurt Kaiser collaborated on Tell It Like It Is, a folk musical about God. The record album of the musical, which included the song \\"Pass It On\\", sold 2,500 copies, completely selling out the first run; it then completely sold out its second run of 100,000 copies. One of Carmichael's contemporary hymns, \\"Reach Out to Jesus\\", was recorded by Elvis Presley, on the singer's 1972 Grammy Award- winning album of sacred songs, He Touched Me. His album Strike Up the Band won a Dove Award for \\"Instrumental Album of the Year\\" at the 25th GMA Dove Awards in 1994.\\"Dove Award Recipients for 1995 \\".

Personal life In 1948, he married singer Evangeline Otto; they divorced in 1964. Their daughter Carol Celeste Carmichael, later Carol Parks (1949-2010), was a vocalist and assistant record producer.\\"In Memoriam: Evangeline Carmichael McPherson\\" The Tolucan Times (July 15, 2009) Retrieved August 26, 2017 He is now married to Marvella.

According to their singer, Dolk, their name is an ancient Norse battle cry which means Odin or Wotan. The music of Kampfar can be described as Black Metal inspired by Norwegian folklore and nature. The band is currently signed to Indie Recordings. Singer Dolk at Rockharz Open Air 2016 Bassist Jon at Rockharz 2016 History Kampfar was formed by Dolk in 1994 when he left his former band, Mock, and was joined by Thomas. Two years later the duo released their first self-titled EP. This was followed by the release of the band's first full- length album Mellom skogkledde aaser in 1997. The band released their second album Fra underverdenen in 1999; the album is significant for featuring the song \\"Norse\\", which was the band's first song written in English, as opposed to their other songs which were written in Norwegian language;Kampfar on metal-archives.com Retrieved on 3 July 2016 the song was also featured on the band's second EP Norse, released in 1998. The sound on Fra Underverdenen moved away from some of the folk aspects that were featured on band's past releases and concentrated more on Thomas' fondness for classical music. Following the release of Fra Underverdenen, Kampfar was put on hold. The band became active again during 2003, when they were joined by the bass player Jon Bakker and drummer and vocalist Ask. Despite the creation of new lineup, the band didn't perform live until 2004. The band made their first appearance at the Moshfest festival in Halden, not far from their hometown Fredrikstad. Their 2006 album Kvass was recorded between November 2005 and January 2006 with producer Rune J√∏rgensen in Silvertone Studio in Gamle Fredrikstad. The band used the same studio and producer again for Heimgang in 2008. In 2010 Kampfar went to the famous Abyss Studio in Sweden to record their next album Mare with producer Peter T√§gtgren. Long serving guitarist Thomas quit the band even before the album was released and was replaced by Ole (Mistur, Emancer) for the upcoming live shows. Ole later joined the band permanently and Kampfar went on to tour Norway, North America and Europe twice to support the album. In 2013 the band went back to Abyss Studio to record their sixth studio album Djevelmakt, this time working with Jonas Kjellgren as producer and Peter T√§gtgren doing the mixing. Djevelmakt was released worldwide 27 January 2014. A little more than a year later, on 13 November 2015, the band released their seventh full-length album Profan. The album was given Norway's 2015 Spellemann Award for best metal album of the year.Kampfar - Spellemann Prisen Vinner Retrieved on 3 July 2016 On 3 May 2019, Kampfar released their eighth album, Ofidians Manifest.

The concept was realized by Peer Swinkels, the chairman of Bavaria. The leeuwenhosen may have been inspired by the coincidence that the Dutch team's icon is a lion, as is the 2006 FIFA World Cup mascot Goleo VI. The word \\"leeuwenhosen\\" is a mix of the Dutch word for \\"lions\\" and the German word for \\"trousers\\", in the same style as the German article of clothing called lederhosen, meaning \\"leather trousers\\".  2006 Controversy  During the 2006 FIFA World Cup Bavaria distributed orange Leeuwenhosen (orange being the Dutch national colour, representing the royal House of Orange) with their company logo in cases of beer in the Netherlands in support of the Dutch national football team. The problem with this was that Bavaria was not an official sponsor of the World Cup; Budweiser was the official beer sponsor. During the 16 June 2006 match between the Dutch team and the Ivory Coast team, spectators wearing Bavaria-branded Leeuwenhosen were ordered to disrobe by officials in Stuttgart, and many of these Dutch supporters watched the game in their underwear. FIFA reportedly anticipated this act of \\"ambush marketing\\" and instructed officials to distribute orange shorts to fans who required them after removing the Leeuwenhosen. The Leeuwenhosen are no longer distributed by Bavaria, and they are now regarded as a collector's item by fans of the 2006 World Cup and breweriana collectors.  2010 Controversy  Bavaria again distributed orange memorabilia in the Netherlands before the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, as is customary of breweries in the Netherlands. Unbranded orange minidresses were one of the promotional items, but FIFA officials again felt that this was an attempt at ambush marketing by Bavaria, who was not the official beer sponsor (Budweiser was again the official sponsor). Following the Netherlands-Denmark match in Johannesburg, FIFA forcibly removed 36 female fans because they wore the dresses and detained and questioned the three Dutch nationals for three hours (the other 33 were South African). Bavaria Chairman Peter Swinkels said of the incident, \\"There is not even a logo on those dresses, so what are we doing wrong? Since when is there a dress code at games?\\" Lawyers for FIFA investigated the incident, and found that many of the tickets were distributed to the British television network ITV.http://www.dutchdailynews.com/fifa-bans-dutch-babes/ The tickets were sold to Bavaria by ITV pundit Robbie Earle, who was sacked by the network for the incident.World Cup 2010: ITV sacks Robbie Earle for breaking ticket regulations.

This sequence is present only in streams carrying gravel or coarser sediments. Riffles are formed in shallow areas by coarser materials, such as gravel deposits, over which water flows. Pools are deeper, calmer areas whose bed load (in general) is made up of finer material such as silt. Streams with only sand or silt laden beds do not develop the feature. The sequence within a stream bed commonly occurs at intervals of from 5 to 7 stream widths. Meandering streams with relatively coarse bed load tend to develop a riffle-pool sequence with pools in the outsides of the bends and riffles in the crossovers between one meander to the next on the opposite margin of the stream.

He was featured on David Sanborn's series Night Music, and has performed worldwide, both as a leader and as a sideman with many jazz greats, including Gerry Mulligan, Art Farmer, Phil Woods, Bob Brookmeyer, and Jon Faddis. Rosenthal has released 15 CDs as a leader, which include new treatments and \\"derangements\\" of great American standards, jazz tunes and classical themes, as well as his original compositions. His ability to communicate both the creative and analytical aspects of jazz translates from the bandstand to the educational arena: he holds faculty positions at the Juilliard School, Manhattan School of Music, and The New School. Early life Rosenthal was born and raised in Great Neck, Long Island, New York. He began playing by ear at a young age, and started studying at 12 with Tony Aless, a sideman with Charlie Parker and Stan Getz. In high school, he studied briefly with Jaki Byard and Lennie Tristano, and attended workshops with Billy Taylor, Woody Shaw and others. Although jazz was Rosenthal's main passion, at the time there were limited opportunities to study jazz at the conservatory level. Since he also found satisfaction and joy in classical music, he pursued classical piano studies at Manhattan School of Music. He received bachelor's and master's degrees in piano performance while continuing to pursue his love of jazz outside the classroom. After college, he continued his classical piano studies with Phillip Kawin while playing jazz in and around New York. Later life and career Rosenthal was the winner of the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition in 1988, which launched his career as a solo artist, leading to the release of his first CD as a leader New Tunes, New Traditions, featuring Ron Carter, Billy Higgins and Tom Harrell; the album interweaves Thelonious Monk's with Rosenthal's original compositions. Rosenthal toured in the early 1990s with the last Gerry Mulligan Quartet, recording three CDs with Mulligan and performed in major jazz festivals throughout the world. One critic noted, \\"The rapport of the [Mulligan] group was amazing, particularly Gerry‚Äôs telepathic communication with outstanding pianist Ted Rosenthal [...] The byplay with Rosenthal left me with my jaw hanging down\\" (Gene Lees, The Jazz Letter). After Mulligan's death, Rosenthal became musical director of The Gerry Mulligan All Star Tribute Band, featuring Lee Konitz, Bob Brookmeyer and Randy Brecker. The group's CD, Thank You, Gerry!, was nominated for a Grammy award in 1998. As a sideman, Rosenthal has performed in small groups led by Art Farmer, Jon Faddis, Phil Woods, and Jay Leonhart. He has also performed with Wynton Marsalis and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band, the Westchester Jazz Orchestra and the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra. Rosenthal is the pianist of choice for many top jazz vocalists including Helen Merrill, Mark Murphy and Ann Hampton Callaway. He accompanied the latter one in various editions of the annual Jazz Cruise, supported by Martin WInd (b) and Tim Horner (dr). Serving on the faculty at both the Juilliard School and Manhattan School of Music in New York City, he is also a member of the Juilliard Jazz Quintet. Rosenthals's CDs as a leader showcase both his creative approach to standards and classics as well as his original compositions. His latest, The King and I (2006), features Rosenthal's jazz takes (with George Mraz on bass, Lewis Nash on drums) on songs from the classic musical. One Night in Vermont (2004), a duo performance with trombonist Bob Brookmeyer, explores great American standards in an inventive and improvisatory style. Rosenthal regularly performs in jazz piano concerts, including at the 92nd Street Y with Bill Charlap and Dick Hyman. At the 2003 JVC Jazz Festival, he performed in, and co-produced with George Wein, \\"Piano Starts Here\\", also featuring Kenny Barron and Cedar Walton. Rosenthal has also appeared on Marian McPartland's Piano Jazz on National Public Radio and on NBC's Night Music with David Sanborn. A recipient of three grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, Rosenthal currently composes large-scale works as well as jazz tunes. \\"The Survivor\\", a concerto for piano and orchestra that combines written and improvised sections for the soloist, has been performed by Rosenthal with the Rockland Symphony and with the Manhattan Jazz Philharmonic. Rosenthal often adds improvisations to his performances of Gershwin's works for piano and orchestra, adding an extra dimension of vitality and spontaneity to the music.

Steinkuhler played college football for the University of Nebraska, and was recognized as an All-American. He was selected in the first round of the 1984 NFL Draft, and played professionally for the Houston Oilers of the NFL. College career Steinkuhler attended the University of Nebraska, where he won the Outland Trophy, given to the nation's top offensive lineman, in 1983. This marked the third consecutive time a Cornhusker had won the award as Dave Rimington had won back to back Outland Trophies in 1981 and 1982. Steinkuhler also won the Lombardi Award in 1983, marking the second consecutive year a Nebraska player had won that award as Rimington had also won the Lombardi in 1982. Nebraska is the only team that has had consecutive winners of both of these awards. Steinkuhler is one of eight Nebraska winners of the Outland Trophy and one of five Nebraska winners of the Lombardi Award. Nebraska players have won nine Outland Trophys overall, by far the most in the nation. Oklahoma has the second most with four. He is, along with fellow Nebraska Cornhuskers Rich Glover, Dave Rimington and Ndamukong Suh, one of only thirteen players to have won both the Outland Trophy and the Lombardi Award. In 1999 Steinkuhler was selected to the Nebraska All-Century Football Team via fan poll and was named to the All- Century Nebraska football team by Gannett News Service. He is one of only sixteen Cornhuskers to have his jersey (#71) retired by the team. Steinkuhler is also remembered for being the player who picked up quarterback Turner Gill's intentional fumble in the 1984 Orange Bowl and ran it 19 yards for a touchdown in a play dubbed the \\"Fumblerooski\\". Collegiate All-Century Teams In 1999 Steinkuhler was selected as a third team offensive guard by Sports Illustrated in their \\"NCAA Football All-Century Team\\". The starters were Jim Parker of Ohio State and John Hannah of Alabama, the second team consisted of Bob Suffridge of Tennessee and Bill Fischer of Notre Dame and the other third team player was Aaron Taylor of Nebraska. Steinkuhler was one of six Nebraska Cornhuskers on this All-Century Team 85 man roster; the others being Glover, Johnny Rodgers, Rimington, Tommie Frazier and Taylor. In 1999 Steinkuhler was selected as an offensive guard to the Walter Camp Football Foundation College Football All Century Team. The other offensive guards selected were John Hannah of Alabama, Aaron Taylor of Nebraska, Brad Budde of USC, Will Shields of Nebraska and Jim Parker of Ohio State. Steinkuhler was one of six Nebraska Cornhuskers selected to this team; the others being Rodgers, Rimington, Shields, Frazier and Taylor. Steinkuhler is one of 54 players and one of five Cornhuskers named to both the Sports Illustrated and Walter Camp All-Century teams. Professional career Steinkuhler was the second overall pick in the 1984 NFL Draft, taken by the Houston Oilers. He was an Oilers co-rookie of the year. He played both offensive guard and offensive tackle with the Oilers after playing solely offensive guard in college. He played eight seasons with the Oilers (some of those alongside fellow former Husker teammate Mike Rozier) before retiring in 1991. Personal Steinkuhler hailed from Burr, Nebraska, which, according to the 2000 census, has a population of just 66 people. It is thought to be the smallest town to ever produce an All-American. He played both eight-man and eleven-man football at nearby Sterling High School. His sons Ty and Baker have followed in his footsteps. Both are defensive tackles and both graduated from Nebraska. Ty and Baker played at Lincoln Southwest High School and Syracuse-Dunbar-Avoca High School.

At its peak, the firm was made up of approximately 365 attorneys with offices in New York City; Washington, D.C.; Mexico City; White Plains, New York; and Summit, New Jersey. The firm traces its founding back to 1848, when Benjamin Franklin Butler opened a legal practice with his son, William Allen Butler, at 29 Wall Street in New York City. The firm was headquartered in downtown Manhattan from 1848 until 2001, eventually occupying floors 38 through 40 of the 2 World Trade Center building prior to the building's destruction in the September 11 attacks. All of the firm's employees survived the attacks, and the firm temporarily relocated to midtown Manhattan before moving to 2 World Financial Center in September 2003. Thacher Proffitt was a market leader in the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market, and in fact was instrumental in the creation of the residential MBS and commercial MBS markets. The firm so controlled the market that the standard documentation used by mortgage traders was known as \\"Thacher docs\\" and \\"TP&W; forms.\\" The firm grew from 177 lawyers in 2003 to 350 lawyers in 2007, mostly due to the strength of its structured finance practice, which came to constitute 70% of the firm's revenue. The firm also had highly regarded real estate, litigation, corporate, tax and derivatives practices. In 2006, the firm was ranked among the top 200 by The American Lawyer. It was also ranked among the top 80 most prestigious law firms in the nation by Vault. The financial crisis of 2007-2008, and in particular the collapse of Bear Stearns (which had been the firm's largest client), significantly impacted the firm, leading to a breach of the firm's financing covenants and giving its lender, Citigroup, substantial control. The firm's offices in Mexico City and White Plains, New York decamped to Chadbourne & Parke and Greenberg Traurig respectively. The firm had merger talks at one point with King & Spalding, but these talks collapsed in December 2008. On December 21, 2008, approximately 100 lawyers (including 40 partners) left Thacher Proffitt & Wood to work for Sonnenschein, Nath & Rosenthal. Two days later, on December 23, the firm's management officially announced dissolution of the firm.  Notable representations  * Shortly prior to its dissolution in December 2008, the firm was hired to advise the United States Department of the Treasury in connection with the Troubled Asset Relief Program.

Function Prior to the British reorganisation of the area now known as Kerala, it was divided into around ten feudal states. Each of these was governed by a rajah (king) and was subdivided into organisational units known as nads. In turn, the nads were divided into dƒìsams, which anthropologist Kathleen Gough considers to be villages. However, the early 20th-century historian Kavalam Panikkar states that the dƒìsams were themselves divided into amsas, and that these were the villages. He believes that generally only the amsas survived the reorganisation. The person who governed the nad was known as the naduvazhi. It was an inherited role, originally bestowed by a king, and of a lower ritual rank than the royal lineages. Although Nair families, they generally used the title of Samantan and were treated as vassals. However, some naduvazhi were feudatory chiefs, former kings whose territory had been taken over by, for example, the Zamorins of Calicut. In these instances, although they were obeisant to the rajah they held a higher ritual rank than the Zamorin as a consequence of their longer history of government; they also had more power than the vassal chiefs. The naduvazhi families each saw themselves as a distinct caste in the same manner as did the rajahs; they did not recognise other naduvazhi families as being equal to them. The naduvazhi maintained criminal and civil order and could demand military service from all Nairs below him. There was usually a permanent force of between 500 and 1000 men available and these were called upon by the rajah when required. All fighting was usually suspended during the monsoon period of May to September, when movement around the country was almost impossible. Beaten roads and wheeled vehicle transport were rare until mid 18th century. Titles Naduvazhis of Kerala used different titles common among them are Raja, Achhan, Karthavu, Kaimal, Thampan, Thirumalpad, Unnithan, Unnithiri, Muppil Nair etc.Historians, including Robin Jeffry, Faucett and Samuel Mateer, are of the opinion that as with all other Kings of Malabar (Kerala), the Cochin Raja (Perumpadapum Moopil) and Venadu Swarupam was also of Nair origin. Mateer states: \\"There seems reason to believe that the whole of the kings of Malabar also, notwithstanding the pretensions set up for them of late by their dependents, belong to the same great body, and are homogeneous with the mass of the people called Nairs.Culture and society: a festschrift to Dr. A. Aiyappan Sometimes the naduvazhi was given the additional title of Prabhu by the Raja, if he had a higher than average number of Nairs under his command. He was called Ayyayira Prabhu, if he had 5,000 Nairs, and if he had 10,000 or more, then he was called a Pathinayira Prabhu.

Salas has been critical of the Iraq War and has formulated a concept he calls the colonial matrix. In this theory, Salas says that Foundation Myth is what every American is raised up with and consists of half-truths, omissions, lies distortions and erasures of how the United States was formed. Racial myths are at the core of American education and serve as a mechanism to control the thought processes from birth to death, seeking to present a false narrative in history, culture, and the belief systems of individuals. He cites several examples, one being the Battle of the Alamo. In supporting Dr. Phillip Tucker's research, Salas argues that the Battle lasted only about 20 minutes and most of the Alamo defenders ran and were killed outside of the walls. Hence, the Alamo story is basically white racialized fiction.Mario Salas, FBI Spied on Civil Rights Leaders , African-American News and Issues Under this theory, Salas claims that the racist colonial structures that were in place when America was settled are still operating in a \\"morphed form.\\" In addition to teaching at the University of Texas at San Antonio, as of 2017 he has been writing for the San Antonio Observerhttps://www.saobserver.com/mario-salas References  External links  * \\"Civil Rights Leader Speaks at MLK activities\\" * A Guide to the Mario Marcel Salas Papers, University of Texas at San Antonio Libraries (UTSA Libraries) Special Collections Category:Activists for African-American civil rights Category:Living people Category:1949 births Category:People from San Antonio Category:Our Lady of the Lake University alumni Category:San Antonio City Council members Category:Activists from Texas Category:University of Texas at San Antonio alumni ","title":"Mario Marcel Salas"},{"id":"7127638","text":"Santo Ant√¥nio do I√ß√° is a community and a municipality in the state of Amazonas near the Colombian border in Brazil.

He is best known for negotiating with suspects during hostage situations. His 60-year career as a legal chronicler started in 1960 when he did the description of a bank robbery. He continued to do the job for several months without receiving a salary. Soon after, he covered the assassinations of U.S. former president John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert F. Kennedy as well as civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. during the 1960s. In Quebec, he covered the kidnapping and subsequent murder of former Quebec Liberal Minister of Labor Pierre Laporte, by the FLQ militant group in 1970. He has, perhaps unwillingly, rebaptised the RCMP (Gendarmerie Royale du Canada in French) la \\"Genmarderie Royale du Canada\\" (\\"marde\\" is a slang term for excrement in French). Rumour has it that he does it on purpose because of a grudge he has against them. Due to such events, he is often the central character of several funny anecdotes in comedy routines. During his career he participated in numerous inquiries and trials as an expert and as a witness. He covered the publicized biker gang war that occurred in the province of Quebec during the 1990s as well as criminal trials of well-publicized murder or other crime cases such as the trial of several biker gang members arrested during a province-wide police raid operation called \\"Printemps 2001\\" which significantly reduced their criminal activities around the province. During hostage situations or other events, some criminals often asked police for a negotiation with Poirier. In August 2007, he has been heavily involved over the well-publicized case of the disappearance of a 10-year-old girl, C√©drika Provencher, in Trois-Rivi√®res, in a possible case of abduction. He received the Medal of Bravery by the Canadian government in 1977 while the Quebec government honoured him five times during his career. Today, he still gives his comments on recent crime cases or cold ones on the TVA Nouvelles broadcast at 5:00 p.m. EDT on weekdays and during the LCN morning show. During his commentary, he also discusses the juridical system as well as federal or provincial governmental intervention or laws related to crime measures such as gun control, prison sentences and many more. He is also the host of Le Vrai N√©gociateur on LCN, a 60-minute show that discusses various cases involving the juridical system in Quebec or Canada as well as various crime or disappearance cases. He also plays an important role in the production of the television series \\"Le Negociateur\\" which aired in 2005. The second season began on October 23, 2006, on the TVA television network. The series features well-known figures in Quebec culture such as Elvis Gratton star actor Julien Poulin, Frederick de Grandpr√©, Pierre Curzi, Les Boys actors Serge Th√©riault and Roc Lafortune, 2004 Star Acad√©mie winner Stephanie Lapointe and Guillaume Lemay-Thivierge.

The OSP enforces all of Oregon's criminal laws and assists local law enforcement agencies. Travis Hampton has served as Superintendent since July 1, 2016. The agency differs from other state police highway patrol agencies in that OSP has many other areas of specialization and responsibility. In addition to the Patrol Division, OSP has a Criminal Division (detectives, arson, explosives), SWAT, DPU (Dignitary Protection Unit), MRT (Mobile Response Team), a Forensic Services Division (crime labs), a Fish and Wildlife Division (game wardens), a Medical Examiner's Division, an Oregon State Fire Marshal Division, and it is one of the few law enforcement agencies in the United States that monitors the security of the state lottery. Oregon State Police has primary jurisdiction on state highways and all other state owned property, including state prisons and other facilities. It also frequently responds to incidents in rural areas when local agencies lack capacity or otherwise require assistance. History The Oregon State Police began operating on August 1, 1931. The organization was designed by a committee appointed by Governor Julius L. Meier, who made a survey of some of the most successful state law enforcement agencies across North America, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the New Jersey State Police, the Texas Rangers, the Pennsylvania State Police, and others. They took on the responsibilities that were previously handled by the State Highway Commission, the Fish and Game Commission, the Secretary of State, the Prohibition Commissioner, and the State Fire Marshal. OSP's first Superintendent (head) was Charles Pray, State Parole Officer and a former Department of Justice Agent. Mr. Pray set up four OSP districts in the state and thirty-one patrol stations. He began his duties on June 7, 1931, about two months before the State Police began operating. Harold Maison, formerly with the State Traffic Division, was appointed Chief Clerk and was stationed at General Headquarters in Salem. He was charged with setting up and maintaining a system of reports and records for the OSP. Captain George Alexander was placed in charge of the Bureau of Identification and Investigation and charged with the investigational activities of the Department. On January 1, 1932, he was appointed Deputy Superintendent, a served a position he held until his installment as Warden of the State Penitentiary in 1938. Charles McClees, previously with the State Game Commission, was appointed captain and placed in charge of game and commercial fish enforcement.

Within the Criminal Investigation Division there are sub-divisions, those are Major Crimes Section; Drug Enforcement Section; Arson/Explosives Section; and Investigative Reports Section. Members of the Criminal Division participate on teams with more than 40 local, county, and federal agencies. Fish and wildlife *The Fish and Wildlife division primarily enforces laws and ordinances protecting Oregon wildlife and natural resources, though the Fish and Wildlife troopers also enforce traffic code and all other Oregon criminal laws. Recent changes In 1993, the Oregon Legislature approved legislation that included the previously autonomous organizations of the Oregon State Fire Marshal's Office, Law Enforcement Data System, Oregon Emergency Management, and the Oregon Boxing and Wrestling Commission within the Department of State Police.

Traditionally the term referred to vehicles built on passenger car chassis and with the cargo tray integrated with the passenger body. However, present-day usage of the term \\"ute\\" in Australia and New Zealand has expanded to include any vehicle with an open cargo area at the rear, which would be called a pickup truck in other countries. The Australian ute is claimed to have been invented by Ford in 1934; however, similar vehicles had been in production in the United States since the 1920s. Production of Australian designed utes ceased in 2017, when local production of the Holden Commodore finished. Etymology Historically, the term \\"ute\\" (short for 'utility vehicle') has been used to describe a 2-door vehicle based on a passenger car chassis, such as the Holden Commodore, Australian Ford Falcon, Chevrolet El Camino and Subaru BRAT. Australian-produced utes were traditionally rear-wheel drive and with the cargo tray integrated with the passenger body (as opposed to a pickup truck, where the cargo tray is separated from the passenger body). In the 21st century, the term has become more broadly used, for any vehicle with a cargo tray at the rear (which would be called a pickup truck in other countries). History The concept of a two-door vehicle based on a passenger car chassis with a tray at the rear began in the United States in the 1920s with the roadster utility (also called \\"roadster pickup\\" or \\"light delivery\\") models. These vehicles were soft-top convertibles, compared with the fixed steel roof used by most utes. Ford Australia is claimed to be the first company to produce an Australian \\"ute\\", which was released in 1934. This was the result of a 1932 letter from the unnamed wife of a farmer in Australia asking for \\"a vehicle to go to church in on a Sunday and which can carry our pigs to market on Mondays\\". In response, Ford designer Lew Bandt designed a two-door body with a tray at the rear for the American Ford Model A chassis, and the model was named \\"coupe utility\\". When the Australian version was displayed in the US, Henry Ford nicknamed it the \\"Kangaroo Chaser\\". A convertible version, known as the roadster utility was produced in limited numbers by Ford in the 1930s. In 1951, Holden released a \\"utility\\" model, which was based on the 48‚Äì215 sedan. With both Ford and Holden now producing utes, this started the long-standing tradition of Australian-designed 2 door vehicles with a tray at the back, based on a passenger-car sedan chassis. Cultural impact 2010 HSV Maloo R8 Australia has developed a culture around utes, particularly in rural areas with events known as ute musters. It is common, particularly in rural areas, to customise utes in the \\"B&S; style\\" with bullbars, spotlights, oversized mudflaps, exhaust pipe flaps and UHF aerials. Since 1998, the \\"Deni Ute Muster\\" has been held in the town of Deniliquin, which has become a major attraction for the area. High performance utes were also sold in Australia, including the FPV F6 and the HSV Maloo. The 2017 HSV GTSR Maloo is powered by a supercharged V8 engine producing . The Australian V8 Utes is a racing series based on lightly modified production Holden and Ford utes. Australian models Ford The ute variant of the Ford Falcon was produced from 1961-2016. For the first 38 years, the design used a monocoque chassis, which is the traditional design for a ute. Since the 1999 AU Falcon, the Falcon ute switched to a cargo bed that is separate from the cabin, while still retaining the Falcon sedan front-end and cabin. The cargo bed was separated so that both \\"utility\\" and \\"cab chassis\\" body styles could be produced together. This separate cab-chassis design challenged the notion that the word \\"ute\\" referred to a monocoque body style.

It was the second best selling new car in Australia in 2019. Holden From 1951‚Äì1968, the \\"utility\\" was sold as part of the 48‚Äì215 to HR model ranges. From 1968‚Äì1984 the \\"utility\\" was included in the Holden Belmont/Kingswood range. In 1984, Holden discontinued the ute variant and it was not part of the VB to VL Commodore ranges. The model returned in 1990 based on the VN Commodore chassis and remained part of the model range until Australian production ended in 2017. In 2000, the Holden Commodore was the first Australian ute to feature independent rear suspension, the Ford Falcon ute retained a live axle rear suspension design until production ended in 2016. In 2008, the VE Commodore Ute was proposed to be exported to North America as the Pontiac G8 ST. At least one prototype was built, but GM decided not to proceed with production due to the Global Financial Crisis.

The company provided stem fiberoptic cable network in Norway along the railway and power grid. The company had its headquarters in Oslo. The company only offered the central network capacity, not any content. Along with Telenor it was the only company to offer central network services, covering 70 cities north to Troms√∏. The company sold its products to smaller customers through agents or other operators while larger customers could purchase directly from BaneTele. In total the BaneTele network was 12,500 km long. History The Norwegian State Railways (NSB) built a parallel copper network along the railway for internal communication and signaling; by 1899 this network was complete. In 1985 NSB started the construction of a fibre network. By 1996 this was made a division of the Jernbaneverket, the newly created track operator, with the name BaneTele. The division was made a limited company in 2001. The same year BaneTele bought the remains of the bankrupt company Enitel which was created by numerous Norwegian electricity companies to build a national fibre network along the power grid. Enitel had also bought Telia Norway after the failed merge between Telia and Telenor. Enitel went bankrupt in 2001 and the power grid network was merged with the railway network. In 2002 the ownership of BaneTele was transferred from Jernbaneverket to the government. In 2006 50% of BaneTele was sold to Bredb√•ndsalliansen, which in turn is owned by 6 Norwegian electricity companies, thereby reinstating some of the ownership that was lost when Enitel went bankrupt.
