Established in 1818 as an iron foundry, with time it rose to become a large holding company specialising in iron and steel production, as well as all sorts of machinery and metal products. The largest factory was in Warsaw. Between the 1860s and World War II the company was the largest Polish producer of machinery, cars, lorries and railway equipment. The range of products designed and produced by Lilpop included train engines, rails, railway cars and equipment for railroads, automotive engines, license-built lorries (Chevrolet and Buick), steam turbines, electric appliances and many other types of machinery. The main factory of Lilpop, Rau i Loewenstein in Warsaw was looted by the Germans during World War II and the buildings demolished. The company was not rebuilt after the war.  History  = Early years (1818‚Äì1855) = The predecessor to the Lilpop, Rau i Loewenstein company was the Odlewnia i RzƒÖdowa Fabryka Machin (\\"Foundry and Government Machinery Factory\\"), the first iron foundry in Warsaw. Established in 1818, it was initially headed by Thomas Evans and Joseph Morris, two British nationals active in the Kingdom of Poland at the time. In 1824 Morris left the business and it was taken over by Thomas Evans and his brother Andrew, hence it was renamed to \\"Bracia Evans\\" ‚Äì the Evans Brothers Co. They were later joined by Douglas Evans, Alfred Evans and engineer Joshua Routledge. The company was producing mostly cast iron agricultural equipment and had a crew of approximately 150 workers. Initially occupying a small plot of land at Piesza Street, soon it was moved to the ground of a former convent and a defrocked St. George's Church at ≈öwiƒôtojerska Street. A modern factory, it was the first venue in Warsaw to use gas lighting. During the November Uprising the factory extended its product range to include cannons for the Polish Army. The company prospered until the outbreak of the Crimean War in 1854, when all British citizens, including Alfred and Douglas Evans, had to leave the Russian Empire and its dependencies. Soon before their departure in 1855 the Evans brothers invited two new people to the company: Wilhelm Rau and Stanis≈Çaw Lilpop. Lilpop, a son of a watchmaker who had moved to Warsaw from Styria in the late 18th century, graduated from the Warsaw Piarist School in 1833 and joined the Evans Brothers company as a trainee. A promising engineer, the Bank of Poland financed a scholarship for him and he was sent to Germany, England and France to train in steam engine construction. Upon his return he took over the former State Machinery Factory (then headed by Wilhelm Rau, who continued to work for Lilpop), initially as its managing director and then as its owner. Production of various agricultural machines of his own design, notably a reaper based on William Manning's design, allowed him to gather significant wealth and soon his firm was merged with that of the Evans brothers under a new name of \\"Evans, Lilpop et Comp.\\" = Rise to power (1855‚Äì1866) = A 1920s gas compressor bearing the LRL name The new company was now the first true concern in Poland: it owned not only the mechanical works in Warsaw, but also two iron ore mines and steel mills in Drzewica and Rozwady, both near Radom. Lilpop modernised the production, turning the Warsaw plant from a simple manufactory to a modern, mechanised factory. He also started cooperation with banks and introduced credit sale of his agricultural machines, a novelty in Poland at the time. By 1866 the Warsaw factory included iron and brass foundries, along with mechanical workshops, all powered by a 40-horsepower steam engine. That year the factory sold 22 steam engines and 1422 various machines for 360,000 roubles, the steel mills of Rozwady and Drzewica brought additional 300,000 in income. The crew of the factory rose from 300 to 450 workers, plus 250 working in Rozwady and Drzewica. One of the best-selling products of the company was a reaper dubbed Amerykanka ‚Äì The American, based on Lilpop's earlier designs. The reaper was very successful commercially (over 90 sold between 1857 and 1863 alone) and British Ransomes & Sims bought license for its production in the United Kingdom. It received a silver medal at the 1867 International Exposition in Paris and remained in production almost until the end of the century. The company started producing equipment for railway companies, including rails and rail cars, notably for the Warsaw‚ÄìVienna railway. By 1866 Lilpop and Rau bought remaining shares of the Evans Brothers firm and renamed it to \\"Lilpop i Rau\\". Lilpop died later the same year in Biarritz, but his widow, Joanna Lilpop, took over both his shares and his seat in the board. She was the first, and for many years the only woman to hold a seat on the board of any large industrial firm in Poland. She was later joined by their sons: Karol Lilpop (1849‚Äì1924), Wiktor Lilpop (1851‚Äì1922) and Marian Lilpop (1855‚Äì1889). = Before the Great War (1866‚Äì1914) = After Lilpop's death, Bonawentura Toeplitz became the new general director and in 1868 was invited into the partnership. Loewenstein, a Jewish entrepreneur from Berlin, was both the nephew and son-in-law of Leopold Kronenberg, the richest banker, industrialist and railroad tycoon of Poland. With Kronenberg's financial support (initially direct, later through his Commercial Bank), the then- renamed Lilpop, Rau i Loewenstein company rose to become the largest industrial conglomerate of Poland, and one of largest companies of Imperial Russia. Most importantly, both Jan Gotlib Bloch and Kronenberg placed huge orders for train engines and cars at the Lilpop factory, for their ever- expanding train empires. Because of that, by 1877 Lilpop, Rau i Loewenstein was responsible for over a quarter of all industrial production of Poland. In addition, the company produced all sorts of iron and steel constructions, pipes, machinery, artillery shells, field kitchens and military equipment. 1923 stock certificate of LRL company, denominated in Polish marka A crisis came in 1877, when Russia turned to mercantilism to protect its own markets. High tariffs were imposed on import of, among others, coal, ores, iron and steel; also a customs boundary was created between Congress Poland and the rest of Russia. To counter the threat of being deprived of raw materials, in 1879 Lilpop company entered into a partnership with several bankers and turned their old iron foundry into a modern steel plant, the largest such factory in Poland. Also, a gigantic iron-rolling mill was constructed shortly afterwards. By the end of the century the total production of steel in the Kingdom of Poland rose from 18,000 tons in 1877 to 270,000 tons, with roughly a quarter produced by Lilpop, Rau i Loewenstein. In addition, the company opened new factories on the other side of the new customs boundary, in Bila Tserkva (until 1878) and Slavuta (until 1910). It also had permanent trade offices in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Tbilisi, Odessa and Baku. In 1885 the factory was electrified as one of the first buildings in Warsaw, the company also started experimenting with arc welding, a novelty at the time. By the end of the century the Warsaw plant alone had over 1300 workers. In 1905 Bonawentura Toeplitz died, having led the company for 39 years. One of his last plans, completed over the next decade, was the move of the main factory and its main offices to a new, more modern venue at Bema Street. = The last decades (1914‚Äì1945) = A license-built Chevrolet bus in Bielsko-Bia≈Ça, 1937 A license-built Chevrolet Master Sedan in Poland (1936-1939) After the outbreak of World War I, in 1915 the factory, along with most of the staff (roughly 2000 workers in 1914), was evacuated to Kremenchug by tsarist authorities. There the equipment of the factory was captured by the Reds in the course of the Russian Civil War and only a small part was brought back to Warsaw after the Polish-Soviet War and the Peace of Riga. The factory in Warsaw was nevertheless rebuilt and continued to prosper as one of principal industrial centres of the country. Between 1921 and 1931 the factory was modernised and further expanded, extending the line of products by addition of internal combustion engines. The Lilpop factory produced train engines, railway and tramway cars, bus bodies, lorry undercarriages (in cooperation with Hanomag), water turbines, industrial washing machines, rotodynamic pumps and many other products. In 1925 Lilpop factory introduced the Lilpop C electric tram, a reverse-engineered and slightly improved version of the ageing Typ A tram by a German consortium including Van der Zyper & Charlier, Siemens-Schuckert, MAN and Falkenried companies. While based on a tram introduced 20 years before, the C type (bought in small numbers by the city of Warsaw) became the first in a long line of modern trams based on it, starting with Lilpop I (1927), Lilpop II and Lilpop LRL (1929), Lilpop G (1932) and Lilpop III (1939). The trams were in use in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ until 1973, some were also bought by other cities. In 1936 Lilpop also entered the automotive industry. In the early 1930s the state- owned Pa≈Ñstwowe Zak≈Çady In≈ºynieryjne (PZIn≈º) holding had a virtual state- imposed monopoly on assembling cars. The monopoly was lifted in 1936 and Lilpop immediately signed a contract with General Motors and Opel to assemble cars in their Warsaw and Lublin factories. The decision to lift the monopoly led to entire leadership of PZIn≈º resigning their positions. In late 1930s LRL produced a number of General Motors vehicles, the most popular being Chevrolet 1.5 and 3 ton trucks Car production at Lilpop started less than a year later, with a large portfolio of locally assembled cars. Among them were passenger cars of several brands: Buick (41 and 90), Chevrolet (Master, Imperial, and Sedan Taxi), Opel (P4, Kadett, and Olimpia). In addition, the company offered a number of utility cars and lorries, including Chevrolet's 112 van, 121, 131 and 157 truck, and 183 bus. Between the world wars, Poland was primarily an agricultural country, with an underdeveloped road network and high luxury taxes on cars. Because of that the overall volume of production remained low, with roughly 7000 cars and lorries assembled in Poland during 1938-1939. Most of these were assembled by Lilpop. In 1938 the factory had 3900 workers. The same year the management started construction of a new car factory in Lublin that was to be completed in 1940 and was to take over the automotive part of the production. However, the war started before it could be completed. During World War II the factory was taken over by Germany and assigned to Reichswerke Hermann G√∂ring and continued the production, this time for the Wehrmacht. When the Warsaw Uprising broke out in 1944, the machinery was dismantled and sent to Germany, along with most of the workers. Perhaps the single best-known car produced by LRL was a Chevrolet 157 3-ton truck named Kubu≈õ, converted to an improvised armoured personnel carrier during the uprising. After the uprising the factory was levelled with explosives by German troops, along with rest of the city. Only the office buildings survived the war.  Legacy  After the war the new communist authorities of Poland nationalised virtually all privately held companies and there was no chance to rebuild the Lilpop, Rau i Loewenstein company as a private venture. The remaining buildings at Bema Street continue to be used as offices. Perhaps the only part of the once powerful LRL concern that still exists is the Fabryka Samochod√≥w Ciƒô≈ºarowych, the Lublin automotive branch of Lilpop, that was rebuilt after the war and continues to produce cars, notably the Tarpan Honker truck used by the Polish Army. Another part of the pre-war concern that continued production after the war was FSC Star, until 1939 a partially owned subsidiary producing truck components for Lilpop-made Chevrolets. Throughout its existence, the Lilpop, Rau i Loewenstein company also trained many of the most important Polish engineers. Among those who collaborated with the company were Karol Adamiecki and the pioneer of arc welding Stanis≈Çaw Olszewski. However, one of the best- known workers of Lilpop is Boles≈Çaw Prus, the famous Polish writer, who worked there for several years as an office clerk.  See also  * K.

As a result, the contents of the red blood cell are released into the general circulation, leading to hemoglobinemia and increasing the risk of ensuing hyperbilirubinemia. Mechanism Intravascular hemolysis is the state when the red blood cell ruptures as a result of the complex of complement autoantibodies attached (fixed) on the surfaces of RBCs attack and rupture RBCs' membranes, or a parasite such as Babesia exits the cell that ruptures the RBC's membrane as it goes. Upon RBC's rupture, components of which are released and circulating in the blood plasma. These components comprise hemoglobin and others. At this stage, the hemoglobin is called free hemoglobin. Free hemoglobin (also called naked hemoglobin) is the un-bound hemoglobin that is not enclosed in the red blood cell. The naked hemoglobin is devoid of its anti-oxidant sentries that are normally available within the RBC. Free hemoglobin is thus vulnerable to be oxidized. When the serum concentration of free hemoglobin is within the physiologic range of haptoglobin, the potential deleterious effects of free hemoglobin are prevented because haptoglobin will bind to \\"free hemoglobin\\" forming a complex of \\"free hemoglobin-haptoglobin\\" evidenced by reduced amount of haptoglobin. However, during hyper-hemolytic conditions or with chronic hemolysis, haptoglobin is depleted so the remaining free hemoglobin readily distribute to tissues where it might be exposed to oxidative conditions, thus some of the ferrous heme (FeII), the oxygen-binding component of hemoglobin, of the free hemoglobin are oxidized and becoming met-hemoglobin (ferric hemoglobin). In such conditions, heme along with globin chains can be released from further oxidization of met-hemoglobin (ferric Hb). In which, the free heme can then accelerate tissue damage by promoting peroxidative reactions and activation of inflammatory cascades. At this time, hemopexin, another plasma glycoprotein come to bind with heme with its privilege of high heme affinity, forming a complex of heme-hemopexin, which is non-toxic, and travel together to a receptor on hepatocytes and macrophages within the spleen, liver and bone marrow. (Note that the \\"free hemoglobin-haptoglobin\\" complex is taken up by hepatocytes and, to the lesser extent, macrophages.) Thereafter, these complexes will undergo the metabolic mechanisms like extravascular hemolysis. Nevertheless, if the binding capacities of haptoglobin and hemopexin are saturated, the remaining \\"free hemoglobin\\" in the plasma will be oxidized to met-hemoglobin eventually, and then further disassociates into free heme and others. At this stage, the \\"free heme\\" will bind to albumin, forming met- hemalbumin. As to the remaining unbound (met)hemoglobin is filtered into the primary urine and re-absorbed via proximal tubules of the kidney. In proximal tubules, the iron is extracted and stored as hemosiderin. (Long-term hemoglobinuria is associated with substantial deposition of hemosiderin in proximal tubule (excessive accumulation of hemosiderin in proximal tubule), Fanconi syndrome (damaged renal re-absorption capability of small molecules which give rises to hyper-aminoaciduria, glycosuria, hyperphosphaturia, and bicarbonate and dehydration), and chronic kidney failure.) In the end, if the plasma concentration of the \\"free met-hemoglobin\\" and/or \\"free hemoglobin\\" is still too high for proximal tubule to absorb back into the body, then hemoglobinuria occurs, indicating an extensive intravascular hemolysis. These remaining free hemoglobin entities also begin to consume nitric oxide, which is critical regulators of vascular homeostasis and basal and stress-mediated smooth muscle relaxation and vasomotor tone, endothelial adhesion molecule expression, and platelet activation and aggregation. The reduction of nitric oxide deeply disturbs the body's mechanism to maintain the stability of the hemodynamics. Additionally, free hemoglobin manifests direct cytotoxic, inflammatory, and pro-oxidant effects that in turn negatively impact endothelial function. At the meantime, free heme exerts its multiple pro- inflammatory and pro-oxidant effects to the tissues it goes through. It is important to note that although hemosiderins are also included in the urine in the setting of intravascular hemolytic hemoglobinuria, it will be detected only several days after the onset of the extensive intravascular hemolysis and will remain detectable several days after termination of intravascular hemolysis. The phenomenon tells that the detection of hemosiderin in urine is indicative of either ongoing or recent intravascular hemolysis characterized by excessive hemoglobin and/or met-hemoglobin filtered through the renal glomerulus as well as the loss of hemosiderin-laden necrotic tubular cells.

In June 2000, the Association published a report stating that Tibetan children older than six years are detained and tortured for political and religious offenses in China.

Eva Herzer, the founder of TJC, worked with the Tibetans in exile to consider a model of self-governance.Mayank Chhaya, Dalai Lama: The Revealing Life Story and His Struggle for Tibet, I.B.Tauris, 2008, , Dagmar Bernstorff and Hubertus von Welck note that publication on the subject by TJC prompt a conference that brought together experts in international law, ministers, parliamentarians and Tibetan leaders in November 1999 in New Delhi evaluating opportunities agreement between Tibet and China.Dagmar Bernstorff, Hubertus von Welck, Exile as Challenge: The Tibetan Diaspora, Orient Blackswan, 2003, , According to Michael C. Davis, Professor of Law at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the analysis by the association of indexes among 34 cases of territorial autonomy in the world reveals that Chinese policy of autonomy in Tibet is only nominal. A severe deficiency of real autonomy appears in the system established by the Chinese government. The TJC report highlights areas of autonomy in the world: cultural affairs, education, health and social services, taxes, economy, natural resources, environmental policies, posts and telecommunications, transport and the judicial police. These areas are covered by local autonomies in Chinese politics at Hong Kong, Macao, and that promised to Taiwan. In all these areas, the Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region is subordinate to the central government.Michael C.

In 2017, Tibetan Youth Association Europe, and Tibet Initiatives Deutschland joined as core groups. Over the past 6 years we have established a successful model to enable Tibet groups to build more coordinated, strategic advocacy at UN level. We have worked with Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy, International Campaign for Tibet, Tibet Watch, Free Tibet, World Uyghur Congress, Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center, Initiatives for China, Human Rights in China, Human Rights Watch, FIDH, and International Service for Human rights during the mentioned projects. The Coalition has a monitoring tool for progress in Tibet called the Human Rights Action Plan - Tibet, which collects together in one place all UN resolutions, recommendations, observations and action on Tibet on key human rights issues. Tibet Advocacy Coalition successes: * UN Human Rights Council‚Äôs second cycle Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of China saw an almost three-fold increase of direct mentions of Tibet compared to the first cycle, and saw China accept one of our key recommendations (that China agree to the visit of the UN High Commissioner to China and Tibet and Xinjiang) (October 2013) * 25% of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights‚Äô China review was on Tibet-related issues . Most significantly, Mr. Romero spoke on Article 15 (Cultural rights) and Article 1 (Self-determination), and Mr. Schrivjer talked on Article 11 (right to an adequate standard of living) in relation to resettlement of nomadic herders and rural residents. There were three direct mentions of Tibet during the proceedings, and seven mentions of ethnic minorities - a ratio repeated in the concluding observations. (May 2014) * The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture requested a visit to China as a result of our advocacy (October 2015) * Our sustained advocacy around the UN Committee Against Torture Review of China led to China being pressed to address Tenzin Delek Rinpoche‚Äôs case within the review - the only individual they mentioned - and led to the cases of 24 detained Tibetans being strongly raised, and very strong concluding observations relevant to Tibet (November 2015) * High- profile media coverage (including Reuters and the New York Times) during the UN CAT Review highlighting China‚Äôs use of torture and intimidation against Tibetans (November 2015 and 2016) * Facilitation of written and oral testimony to various UN offices i.e. diplomats, permanent Mission members, Special Procedures by Golok Jigme and Nyima Lhamo, the two highest-profile Tibetan political activists recently arrived in exile (ongoing) * Participation in invite-only residential roundtable for SR Freedom of Association and Assembly‚Äôs report on \\"Fundamentalism and its impact on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association\\" * Increased coordination on Tibet among UN diplomats, including the first joint statement on the situation in China from a group of states, led by USA, and hosting of HHDL at a side event in Geneva by US and Canadian embassies - this were not a direct result of our advocacy, but we believe our raising of Tibet more within UN provided a context for these to happen (March and June 2016) * Engagement and submissions to UN special rapporteurs leading to two press statements, five joint communications sent to China from groups of Special Procedures, and an Opinion from the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention between October 2016 and August 2018 raising concern about: ** Discriminatory passport practices in Tibet affecting Freedom of Movement ** Tashi Wangchuk, language rights defender ** Nyima Lhamo, Dolkar Lhamo and the Tibetans of Lithang and Nyakchu, in the wake of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche‚Äôs death ** Larung Gar, Yachen Gar, and mining in Amchok * Engagement with the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination led to a review of China that had a strong focus on Tibetan issues (August 2018) * UN Human Rights Council‚Äôs third cycle Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of China saw an increase of direct mentions of Tibet compared to the second cycle (November 2018)  Publications  * Margit Roos- Collins, The Relationship Between Environmental Management and Human Rights in Tibet: A Report Prepared for Mrs. Fatma Zohra Ksentini, Special Rapporteur, for the Study of Human Rights and the Environment Pursuant to Resolutions 1990/7 and 1990/27 of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, International Committee of Lawyers for Tibet, 1992 * Andrew G.

It was designed by Craig Rozynski with Hrant Papazian as a more modern, refined version of the ubiquitous, but often criticized, typeface, Comic Sans. Design Comparison of Comic Sans and Comic Neue; in creating the new typeface, Rozynski made the strokes straighter and more regular Comic Neue was designed by Craig Rozynski, an Australian graphic designer living in Japan, who wanted to create an informal script typeface similar to the ubiquitous Microsoft font Comic Sans, which was created by Vincent Connare in the 1990s. Comic Sans has been called \\"the world's most reviled typeface\\"; Rozynski aimed to update Comic Sans to be more suitable to the 2010s and more widely acceptable, including \\"the typographically savvy\\". Rozynski based his design on the original glyphs of Comic Sans and \\"beat [them] into shape\\" to create a new typeface. He wanted to refine the original letter forms to make them more sophisticated, to create \\"a version [of the original] you couldn't easily fault\\", while \\"maintaining the honesty that made Comic Sans so popular\\". When he first had the idea to \\"save\\" Comic Sans, Rozynski thought that the project would take him a month to complete; it actually took three years. He planned the typeface as a joke, but he began to take it seriously, commissioning Hrant Papazian of The MicroFoundry to improvements to outlines, spacing, and kerning of all 12 fonts in the family. It was released in April 2014 and a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign successfully raised $10,000 to expand the typeface to support non- English languages. The original typeface can be downloaded for free download from its official website, but Rozynski has suggested that he may sell future, more complete releases. He has said he hoped a type foundry or online type library such as Adobe's TypeKit would pick it up. Variants The typeface was originally released in two variants: Comic Neue and Comic Neue Angular. In the latter, the rounded terminals ending each stroke are made angular. Rozynski claims that the angular version was \\"a happy accident\\". Both variants include bold, regular, and light weights, and each weight is available in roman and italic fonts. Shortly after the initial release, plans were announced to develop characters to support other European languages. Response Commentary on the typeface has been mostly positive. Co.Design John Brownlee felt that Comic Neue succeeded in refining Comic Sans while remaining casual, writing: \\"If Comic Sans resembles the handwriting of a 10-year-old with excellent penmanship, Comic Neue is the block lettering of that same kid as a high school senior.\\" Amanda Kooser of CNET described Comic Neue as \\"Comic Sans' much more attractive and worldly brother\\" and opined that the new typeface had successfully redeemed the \\"much-maligned\\" original. The Washington Post reporter Caitlin Dewey also felt that Comic Neue was an improvement on the original typeface and made Comic Sans \\"cool again\\". Tyler McCarthy of The Huffington Post simply referred to Comic Neue as \\"a slightly less horrible version of Comic Sans\\", while Jacob Kastrenakes described it in The Verge as \\"a stylishly thin yet still playfully curly font that's generally much nicer to read than Comic Sans\\". On the other hand, comic book writer Mark Evanier said that the typeface was an improvement on Comic Sans, but that it still did not meet the standards of a professional cartoonist. He said the typeface worked well used in upper and lower case together, but not when used in all caps, which was how comic books were typically lettered. Vincent Connare, the original designer of Comic Sans, thought that Comic Neue was not casual enough. Rozynski has noted that most criticism of the typeface came from type designers rather than laypeople.

Am J Med Genet A doi: 10.1002/ajmg.a.36544 This gene encodes a protein - transducer mediating transforming growth factor beta. Some researchers believe that the SMAD4 gene mutations that cause Myhre syndrome impair the ability of the SMAD4 protein to attach (bind) properly with the other proteins involved in the signaling pathway. Other studies have suggested that these mutations result in an abnormally stable SMAD4 protein that remains active in the cell longer. Changes in SMAD4 binding or availability may result in abnormal signaling in many cell types, which affects development of several body systems and leads to the signs and symptoms of Myhre syndrome.Shi, Y. & Massague, J.

She was the wife of her cousin, king Bahram II (r. 274‚Äì293).  Biography  She was the only daughter of Shapur Meshanshah, a Sasanian prince who governed Meshan, and was the son of the Sasanian shah Shapur I. Her mother was a queen named Denag. Shapurdukhtak had many brothers: Hormizdag, Odabakht, Bahram, Shapur, Peroz, and Hormizd. She was probably raised in Meshan, which was then governed by her father. In 260, her father died and was probably succeeded by Denag as the governor of Meshan. In 274, her cousin Bahram II ascended the throne, and she was married shortly married to the latter, and was given the title of bƒÅnbishnƒÅn bƒÅnbishn, meaning \\"queen of queens\\". In c. 281, her brother Hormizd revolted against Bahram II, and was supported by the inhabitants of Eastern Iran, including the inhabitants of Gilan. Hormizd's revolt was finally suppressed in 283, and he was shortly executed under the orders of Bahram II, who appointed his and Shapurdukhtak's own son Bahram III as the governor of Sakastan. Shapurdukhtak is also portrayed on rock reliefs along with Bahram II. One of the reliefs is situated at Sar Mashhad south of Kazerun, which portrays Bahram as a hunter who has slayed a lion whilst throwing his sword at another. Shapurdukhtak is holding his right hand in a signal of safeguard, whilst Kartir and another figure, most likely a prince, are watching. The scenery has been the subject of several symbolic and metaphorical meanings, thought it is most likely supposed to portray a simple royal display of braveness during a real-life hunt. The other relief at Naqsh-e Rostam, portrays Bahram II standing whilst being surrounded by his family members and attendants; to his left are the sculptures of Shapurdukhtak, a prince, the crown prince Bahram III, Kartir, and Narseh. To his right are the sculptures of Papak, and two other grandees. Bahram II also minted several contains showing a portrait of himself along with Shapurdukhtak and Bahram III. Shapurdukhtak is wearing different headdress' on some of the coins, sometimes with a boar, griffin, horse or eagle. The precise meaning of this, however, is unclear. She seems to have still been living at the time of her husband's death in 293, and probably died some years later.

Traditional variations like Ramraj, Charmalia, Dhunslu, and Lobdi are woven in village clusters of Dedara, Vastadi, Godavari and Vadla in the district. The textile is usually used as shawl and wraparound skirt by women of the Bharwad shepherd community of the Wankaner, Amreli, Dehgam, Surendranagar, Joravarnagar, Botad, Bhavnagar and Kutch areas. Technique The shawls are woven in pit looms at homes and knot a contrast color thread with the warp, which are woven into the textile to create the effect of raised dots, which have become the signature style of the textile. Besides dots, several, geometric patterns like circles, straight lines, hyperbolic or parabolic designs etc.are also created. Revival In 2007, with the help of National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), in Gandhinagar, the Tangaliya Hastkala Association (Tangaliya Handicraft Association) was formed, which included 226 Tangaliya weavers from five villages as members. Over the subsequent years, NIFT conducted workshops for skill building, quality control and design development. Eventually, the Tangaliya Hastkala Association (THA) received GI registration status.

It stands on the site of four previous bridges, where the river passes through a deep gorge. The previous bridge was also a stone arch bridge, which was built in 1860 and collapsed (due to inferior construction) a few months later. It was designed by William Leonard Kingsbury, a local official; its builders are not known because the town's records were destroyed in a fire. The present bridge's vault is carefully constructed from dry-laid granite voussoirs that were shaped for a very precise fit, with larger stones at the lower ends of the arch, and a smaller ones at the crown. Some of the stones were left with rough surfaces, while others were hammered smooth. In contrast to the fine stonework of the arch, the abutments and retaining walls are constructed of split-faced granite in irregular courses, wedged in place by stone chips. The northeast abutment continues along the river as a wing wall up to a massive stone pier, the former site of a mill dam. The southeast abutment is a granite reconstruction of coursed ashlar over concrete, done in 1951. The original granite coping which lined the roadway shoulders has been replaced by concrete with steel guard cables, c. 1920s.

In recent years there has been increase of reported rape cases in France. Studies Rape has been documented across French history. Georges Vigarello in his 2001 book writes about the history of rape in France, highlighting events from 16th to 20th century. He states that rape has historically been seen as a form of violence, but not punished as such. Statistics Annual rape and all forms of sexual assaults per 100,000 people. In 1971, the rate of declared rapes stood at 2.0 per 100,000 people. In 1995, it was 12.5. In 2009, it stood at 16.2. According to a 2012 report, about 75,000 rapes take place each year. In 2012, there were 1,293 reported rapes in a population of 66 million, and 1,188 rapes in 2013 in a population of 66 million. Alleged rape of Th√©odore Luhaka 2017 The alleged rape of young black man Th√©odore Luhaka (aka Th√©o) by the police with a baton took place in the Aulnay-sous-Bois (Seine-Saint-Denis), a Paris suburb. Following the incident, Luhaka suffered from a longitudinal 10 cm wound to his anal canal and sphincter muscle, probably caused by the insertion of a telescopic stick, which resulted in a temporary disability (ITT) of sixty days. This resulted in riots and protests taking place between 4 and 15 February 2017, Following the initial reports of the assault on Th√©o, there was unrest for two nights in Aulnay-sous-Bois. Several cars were lit on fire, bus shelters had windows smashed and suburb had its street lighting knocked out. Five people were arrested. The unrest later spread to other suburbs of Paris. On Saturday 11 February, a crowd of people gathered to protest police brutality in Bobigny. While the protest was mostly peaceful, a small group of protestors began throwing objects at police and setting cars on fire. Police responded by deploying tear gas and arresting 37 people. The next night, 12 February, around 50 youths gathered in Argenteuil and began throwing objects at police. They also set cars and garbage bins on fire and attacked a public bus. The group assault the bus's driver and also assaulted a journalist. 11 people, eight of them minors, were arrested. On the night of the 15th, 49 people were arrested around Paris after engaging in similar behaviors with most of the unrest occurring near the Gare du Nord and Place de la R√©publique. 21 people were also arrested in Rouen the same night. French president Fran√ßois Hollande visited Th√©o in the hospital on 7 February. A policeman told Le Parisien that events were similar to the 2005 French riots. Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, called for better law enforcement on 7 February 2017, saying \\"I know how exposed the police and gendarmes are in the fight against terrorism and violence, but they must be absolutely exemplary at every moment.\\" Gang rape According to a 2014 report, about 5,000 to 7,000 of the rapes are gang rapes. Gang-rapes are referred to as tournantes, or \\"pass-arounds\\".

This land is on the boundary of the application site. Forge Wood is a residential area under construction in Crawley, a town and borough in West Sussex, England. Upon completion in 2026, it will be the fourteenth neighbourhood within Crawley New Town. The 1,900 houses and other facilities will be built on open land in the northeast of the borough, adjoining the ancient village of Tinsley Green and to the north of the Pound Hill neighbourhood. Forge Wood was known as the North East Sector until December 2013, when the present name was adopted in reference to an area of ancient woodland within its boundaries. The site has a long and complex planning history dating back to 1998. Crawley Borough Council, which owned much of the poor-quality pastureland which characterises the area, favoured developing it for housing; but opponents of the plans raised concerns over flooding, noise pollution and the proximity of the proposed second runway should expansion of Gatwick Airport go ahead. The airport lies a short distance to the north of the site, and a motorway and a main railway line are also adjacent. After many alterations, resubmissions and a legal challenge, outline planning permission for 1,900 houses was granted in February 2011, and construction began in 2014. Location OpenStreetMap of the development site. Phases of development are numbered; M = Manor Royal Industrial Estate; T = Tinsley Green. As indicated by its provisional name of North East Sector, the Forge Wood neighbourhood will occupy land in the northeast corner of Crawley borough. The roughly rectangular site is bordered by the Brighton Main Line to the west, the A2011 Crawley Avenue dual carriageway to the south, the M23 motorway to the east and the hamlet of Tinsley Green to the north. Balcombe Road, part of the B2028 road, cuts through the designated area from south to north. Some public rights of way run through the site. The first phase of development, on which work began in 2013, lies west of Balcombe Road around Steers Lane. Crawley town centre is about away. The neighbourhood was named after an area of ancient woodland within the development area, close to Steers Lane. The Surrey and Sussex Crematorium is in the middle of this woodland. Unrelated to the new development, Forgewood is also the name of a small group of industrial units within the nearby Manor Royal industrial estate. It lies at the south end of Gatwick Road, on the opposite side of the railway line from the Forge Wood neighbourhood, and consists of 13 units of around each. Development of the site will bring the eastern boundary of Crawley's built-up area closer to Copthorne, a nearby village east of the M23. In August 2014, outline planning permission was granted for a development of 500 houses on the west side of Copthorne which would in turn expand the village as far as the M23, \\"effectively merging\\" the two settlements. The application was approved after the developer, St. Modwen Properties, amended it to include more footpaths and cycle paths connecting the estate with Forge Wood. Parts of the development site will potentially be affected by noise from the Brighton Main Line and Manor Royal industrial estate to the west, the airport to the north and the motorway to the east. The developers will use \\"various attenuation techniques\\" such as landscaping and soundproof building techniques to overcome this. Likewise, there is a flood risk associated with the Gatwick Stream (a tributary of the River Mole); buildings will be sited away from the floodplain, sustainable drainage system techniques will be used, and excess water will be stored. The ancient woodland within the site provides habitats for protected species, and the maintenance of these habitats or the creation of replacements is a condition of the development. When Crawley was designated as a New Town in 1947, the present Forge Wood area was in the northeasternmost part of Worth parish within the Cuckfield Rural District of East Sussex. In 1953, it formed part of the of land transferred to West Sussex and the parish of Crawley. Accordingly it became part of Crawley Urban District in 1956 and the borough of Crawley in 1974 when these entities were created. The area east of Balcombe Road was not part of the designated area of the New Town, and was only transferred from Worth parish (by now part of Mid Sussex district) to the borough of Crawley in 1983. The county boundary between West Sussex and Surrey ran along the north side of Radford Road until 1974, when it moved northwards to take in Gatwick Airport and the surrounding land which had been in Surrey. Development The first house (pictured in September 2014 while under construction) faces Steers Lane. Crawley was built as a postwar new town in accordance with the New Towns Act 1946. Anthony Minoprio's master plan designated nine \\"neighbourhoods\\"‚Äîself-contained residential areas with mixed styles and tenure of housing, extensive open space and a central area with facilities such as a shopping parade, church, community centre and school. Crawley Development Corporation was responsible for developing these. After it was wound up another four neighbourhoods with a mix of private and council housing were added, most recently Maidenbower in the late 1980s. Forge Wood is therefore described as \\"Crawley's 14th neighbourhood\\". The development is being undertaken by a consortium consisting of Crawley Borough Council, housebuilders Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon Homes, and the Homes and Communities Agency‚Äîa non-departmental government body responsible for affordable housing. Of the 1,900 houses, 60% (1,140) will be for private ownership and 40% (760) will be classed as affordable housing: 532 council houses for rent and 228 shared ownership houses. The latter allow people to buy a majority share in a house at 20% less than its market value. All four phases of development will incorporate some council and affordable housing. The Borough's council housing stock, which will be developed by the council itself, will increase from about 8,100 houses to more than 8,600 by the time work finishes. \\"Phase 2\\" of the development will occupy fields east of the Balcombe Road and south of the footpath to Copthorne (behind the treeline on the left). The 1,900 houses will have 2, 3, 4 or 5 bedrooms. They will contribute towards the total of 4,895 which have been committed to in the draft Crawley Local Plan, which covers the proposed development of Crawley until 2030. This document was submitted for government approval in 2014. Public consultation exercises were held in the Bewbush and Broadfield neighbourhoods and at Crawley Library in September and October 2014 to discuss issues relating to the Local Plan, including the proposals for Forge Wood. Forge Wood will be built in four phases. The first phase will include most of the non-residential buildings, consisting of a community centre, shopping area, health centre and a school building. Playing fields, a hard-surface games court and an area of parkland alongside the Gatwick Stream will also be created. Two new road links will be created: one leading on to Steers Lane to the north at Tinsley Green, and one on to the A2011 Crawley Avenue. The \\"Phase 1\\" sector lies in the centre‚Äìwest of the development area, wholly to the west of Balcombe Road. Phase 2 will occupy the southeastern part of the development area, east of Balcombe Road and south of a footpath which crosses the M23 motorway; a small area south of the Phase 1 development will also be added at this time. Phase 3 will form the westernmost part of the neighbourhood, between the already developed area and the railway line; and Phase 4 covers the northeastern part of the development area immediately north of the \\"Phase 2\\" sector. Two blocks of land totalling have been reserved for \\"possible future extension\\" at the north ends of the Phase 3 and Phase 4 areas. Other areas of undeveloped land not owned by the council totalling have also been identified. Open space will make up more than two- thirds of the neighbourhood by area. As well as parks, meadows and play areas, areas of undeveloped ancient woodland will be retained. The main areas are Blackcorner Wood, adjacent to Balcombe Road within the Phase 4 sector; St Crispin's Wood and Forge Wood (after which the neighbourhood is named), which lie west of Balcombe Road and will separate the Phase 1 and 2 areas; and The Larches and The Birches in the southwest corner. The Surrey and Sussex Crematorium lies within Forge Wood and there is a gasholder inside The Larches. Footpaths will be laid out within St Crispin's Wood and Forge Wood to give pedestrian access between different parts of the neighbourhood. West Sussex County Council will be responsible for setting up the neighbourhood's school, which will cater for pupils between 4 and 11 years old. Several bodies expressed an interest in sponsoring and running the school, including the town's Hazelwick School and the Diocese of Chichester, and Glyn Learning Foundation Schools (GLF) were chosen. They adopted the name Forge Wood Primary School. The school will accommodate 420 pupils but may be expanded to 630 in the future. It is being built as part of the first phase of development: it is expected to open in September 2016, and applications for places will be accepted from September 2015. There are several other schools around away, and the nearest secondary and tertiary education institutions are respectively away (Hazelwick School) and away (the Crawley campus of Central Sussex College). Planning history The first formal proposal to develop the council-owned open land around the Balcombe Road north of Pound Hill came in 1998, when George Wimpey (predecessors of Taylor Wimpey) and Persimmon Homes jointly submitted a planning application for a new residential neighbourhood. It was lodged on 21 January 1998 with the following description: \\"Erection of up to 1,900 dwellings, of Use Class B1, B2 and B8 employment floorspace, of retail floorspace, a local centre/community centre (including a community hall), a new primary school, recreational open aspace, landscaping, the relocation of the 132kV OHV power line adjacent to the M23, infrastructure and means of access\\". The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government blocked this application before the council could take any action. When the companies submitted an appeal to the Planning Inspectorate, Crawley Borough Council it \\"due to changed circumstances\\". The Inspectorate then held a public inquiry in October‚ÄìNovember 2006; although this upheld the original refusal to grant planning permission, an appeal was made to the High Court of Justice and the original decision was quashed in 2008. The final decision on whether to approve the application on appeal therefore lay with the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. Another public inquiry was held in June 2009. The planning inspector's report was issued in October 2009. Responses from interested parties prompted the Secretary of State to ask for an additional report, which was provided in May 2010. In the same month, the newly elected coalition government issued a policy document, The Coalition: Our Programme for Government, which stated their intention to \\"...refuse permission for [an] additional runway at Gatwick\\". A second runway at the airport had been ruled out in 1979 in an agreement which was due to run out in 2019; but airport expansion in southeast England had been on the political agenda since the publication of the 2003 Air Transport White Paper, which among other things required land to be reserved at Gatwick for a potential new runway. The Secretary of State noted that while this \\"could not come about for some years, it cannot be ruled out as a longer term possibility.\\" Accordingly, he had to take into account the \\"extent to which North East Sector would prejudice a second runway\\", balancing this against the need for housing in Crawley and the surrounding area. He concluded that \\"the appeal scheme would place no physical impediment in the way of a second wide-spaced runway, and the sole concern remains the wider issue of noise on the surrounding residential communities\\". Following additional analysis by the planning inspector in the addendum produced in May 2010, the Secretary of State concluded that if a new \\"wide-spaced\\" runway was built to the south of the existing runway, aircraft noise levels would be close to the legally acceptable limit in certain parts of the North East Sector site, but that the use of suitable sound insulation in houses and other buildings would provide \\"acceptable ... environments\\". Opposition to the development was mostly based on potential noise pollution and the proximity of the North East Sector to the land safeguarded for a second runway. Also, as part of their campaign against the second runway, the Pound Hill North Residents Association have claimed that in the event of a new runway being built, \\"[m]any new North East Sector houses [could] potentially [be] purchased for buy to let\\". In allowing the appeal and granting planning permission, the Secretary of State imposed 68 conditions. Crawley Borough Council stated in May 2013 that the first houses were expected to be built in 2014 if approval was granted, following the approval that month of a planning application in respect of infrastructure developments for Phase 1. By December 2013, it was stated that \\"the first house [is] expected to be complete within the next 12 months\\" and that the full development would consist of four phases lasting about 12 years. Approval for the first 204 houses in Phase 1, of which 59 would be classed as affordable, was granted in March 2014. Legal agreements between the council, the Homes and Communities Agency and the developers were then signed in April 2014. At this time the Homes and Communities Agency stated that it was joint owner of the designated land along with the council. The name Forge Wood was approved by Crawley Borough councillors and announced to the public on 5 December 2013. Another option had been Tinsley Green, the name of the hamlet adjacent to the site, but the committee decided this could be confused with the name of Tinsley Lane, a residential road in the Three Bridges area of Crawley. Roads and transport Steers Lane is a single-carriageway road with a speed limit. Radford Road, Balcombe Road and Steers Lane are all two-way single-carriageway roads with a speed limit. Crawley Avenue is a dual carriageway which forms the main entry to Crawley from the east, including from the motorway network. New roads will connect Steers Lane, Balcombe Road and Crawley Avenue. Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey submitted a planning application for their construction in August 2012, with the intention of starting work on the junctions and the roads themselves as soon as permission was granted. The routes of minor connecting roads would then be decided later. Road improvements to be carried out as part of the development include the installation of new street lighting along the main roads, junction upgrades, the installation of pedestrian crossings and traffic lights in some locations, new cycle routes (in some cases these will be shared footpaths and cycle lanes) and road widening. Also, the present one-way slip roads from Crawley Avenue to Balcombe Road will be replaced with a two-way connecting road. In 2014 one local councillor raised concerns that having just one main road leading through the neighbourhood could result in traffic congestion. Short- lived Southdown PSV route 50 passed the south end of the Forge Wood site. Consultants WSP Development and Transportation carried out a transport assessment of the North East Sector in 2006. Among other things, this considered several options for bus services to the new development. In 2006 the only regular route \\"serving roads adjacent to the site\\", in the assessment's definition, were the hourly 526/527 circular services which served Crawley and Horley town centres among other places. More frequent routes ran nearby, for example to the top of the Pound Hill neighbourhood (near the south end of the development site) and along Gatwick Road (west of the new neighbourhood). The report concluded that the best way of serving Forge Wood would be to extend the Pound Hill routes to serve the whole of the neighbourhood, and to combine these with shuttle buses to Gatwick Airport via Manor Royal. In September 2014, Southdown PSV introduced hourly routes 40 and 50 to provide a service between several hotels and Gatwick Airport, also serving the north end of Pound Hill and then travelling along Crawley Avenue. This route was withdrawn in 2015. Metrobus introduced route 27 on 23 April 2016, running daily between Forge Wood and Crawley bus station via station. Route 27 will be replaced by new route 3 (branded \\"Magic Route 3\\") with effect from 3 February 2018.

It was the home ground of New Brighton A.F.C. from 1921 until World War II. History In 1921 the football club purchased a 3.5 acre, which had previously been used as a school playing field. A 1,000-seat covered stand with a terraced paddock was built on the northern touchline, and the ground was opened later in the same year. New Brighton were elected to the Third Division North of the Football League in 1923, and the first Football League match at Sandheys Park was played on 29 August 1923, with New Brighton and Chesterfield drawing 0‚Äì0 in front of 3,000 spectators.

He was a member of the New Zealand MƒÅori Council from 1964, and president from 1973. In 1987 he initiated a successful appeal against the State-Owned Enterprises Act leading to actions against the Crown relating to land, forests, fisheries and te reo MƒÅori (mortgaging his farm at Taipuha for the expenses). Biography Latimer was born on the Aupouri Peninsula south of Te Kao in Northland, then a depressed area. His mother Lillian was Irish- Scottish and his father Graham of mixed Anglo-Saxon and MƒÅori ancestry. As well as being a PƒÅkehƒÅ‚ÄìMƒÅori marriage, the bride was Catholic and the groom Anglican, so the couple married in the local police station. The family lived at Pamapuria seven kilometres from Kaitaia. He attended three primary schools, and then went to Kaitaia District High School. He left after two weeks, as he was needed to help hand-milk the small family herd of 14 dairy cows on 48 acres. When the herd was sold because of disputes within his (extended family), he worked on other farms. He enlisted in the Army in 1943, and went to Japan in 1946‚Äì47 in Jayforce as part of the army of occupation. In 1948, Latimer married Emily Moore, and worked for the New Zealand Railways until 1961, becoming stationmaster at Kaiwaka in 1952. From 1961 he was a farmer on the Kaipara Harbour; to 1979 at Tinopai and from 1979 to 1995 at Taipuha. In 1995 he returned to Pamapuria. Latimer was made a spokesman for NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua (though his own hap≈´ is NgƒÅti Kahu from the Aupouri Peninsula) and a MƒÅori warden in 1956. In 1963 he was elected to the Tai Tokerau District MƒÅori Council in 1963 and one of three members representing te Tai Tokerau on the New Zealand MƒÅori Council 1964. On the New Zealand MƒÅori Council he was vice- president 1969 and president from 1973. In 1977 he was appointed one of the first three members of the Waitangi Tribunal. He was chairman of the Crown Forest Rental Trust from 1990, and a member of the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission between 1993 and 1998. He retrieved t≈´puna MƒÅori from an English auction house in 1988, and stopped the public sale of human remains. Latimer was active in other organisations, the Anglican General Synod, on the board of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, a member of the Alcoholic Liquor Advisory Council and was a director of several commercial enterprises. He was a member of the National Party, and was MƒÅori vice- president from 1981 to 1992. He stood in the Northern Maori electorate in and , coming second for National both times.

The game, originally known as H1Z1 and later as H1Z1: Just Survive, is set during a zombie apocalypse in a rural area of the United States. In it, players attempt to survive against the natural elements such as wolves and bears, hordes of zombies, and thousands of potentially hostile survivors through interaction, scavenging for resources, building shelters, and crafting. The game released in early access in January 2015, selling over a million copies within two months, before being discontinued in October 2018.  Gameplay  The gameplay of Just Survive emphasized multiplayer cooperation, trading, and team- building. Players scavenge supplies, craft items, and build strongholds to defend against the zombie horde. The main focus of the game involved surviving against zombies through teamwork with other players, rather than having a player versus player (PvP) environment with zombies as a backdrop.  Release  The game was released on Steam as an early access title on January 15, 2015. At release, the game suffered from severe technical issues. Players reported that they could not login to their account or enter any active server. Framerate issues, lack of voice chat and AI problems were also among the problems reported. A new bug, which made all servers go offline, was also introduced to the game after the developer released a patch to fix other problems. Despite the unstable launch, the game sold over a million copies within two months. In February 2016, it was announced by Daybreak that the game originally known as simply H1Z1 had been split into two separate projects with their own dedicated development teams, subtitled Just Survive and King of the Kill. In August 2017, the game's title dropped the H1Z1 brand name, becoming simply Just Survive. The game was delisted for purchase on August 26, 2018, with its servers being shut down on October 24, 2018.

It was the home ground of both New Brighton Tower and New Brighton A.F.C.. History The Tower Athletic Ground was built by the New Brighton Tower company, and consisted of a football pitch surrounded by running and cycling tracks. There were covered seated stands on either side of the pitch and standing areas at each end.Paul Smith & Shirley Smith (2005) The Ultimate Directory of English & Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888‚Äì2005, Yore Publications, p128, It was the biggest sporting and motorcycling track in the North of England. The Tower company set up a football club to play at the ground, and the club was elected to the Second Division of the Football League in 1898. The first Football League match was played at the ground on 10 September 1898, with New Brighton Tower beating Gainsborough Trinity 3‚Äì2 in front of 2,000 spectators. Later in the same season New Brighton Tower's record league attendance was set when 10,000 watched a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Manchester City on 14 January 1899. =20th Century= Despite finishing fourth in the Second Division in 1900‚Äì01, financial problems led the directors of the club to make a decision to withdraw from the League in September 1901. New Brighton Tower's last match at the Tower Athletic Ground was a 1‚Äì0 win over Woolwich Arsenal on 27 April 1901 in front of 2,000 spectators. The ground was subsequently used by Harrowby A.F.C., but gradually fell into decline. However, it continued to be used for other sports. It hosted the World Cycling championships in July 1922. In 1933, the athletics track was replaced for use every Saturday by motorcycle speedway racing. It was also used for stock car racing in the 1970s. During World War II the site was used as a depot, and by the end of the war the pitch was covered in bricks and the stands were in a state of decay. However, due to the bomb damage to Sandheys Park ground and its subsequent requisitioning by the Wallasey Corporation to build temporary housing, New Brighton A.F.C. moved to the Tower Athletic Ground in 1946. A new stand was built on the southern touchline, the terrace behind the western goal was renovated and the pitch was returfed. Later improvements saw some covered areas installed. New Brighton's first League match at the Tower Athletic Ground on 4 September 1946 was a Third Division North game against Bradford City watched by 7,500 spectators, which finished 0‚Äì0. A derby match against Tranmere Rovers later in September saw the ground's record league attendance of 14,291 set. At the end of the 1950‚Äì51 season New Brighton were voted out of the Football League. Their last League game at the Tower Athletic Ground was a 1‚Äì0 win over Chester on 2 May. In 1954 the club was forced to leave the ground, but were returned a year later after being granted joint tenancy of the site alongside Wallasey Borough Council. The ground's overall record attendance of 16,000 was set for an FA Cup third round match against Torquay United on 5 January 1957. The football club bought the ground in 1958, remaining there until 1977 when it was sold to the Wallasey Housing Corporation. It is now the site of a housing estate.

Early life Kellogg was born in Omak, Washington in 1971. His parents, Ric and Peggy Kellogg, were missionaries, and as a result his family moved to Kenya for seven years before returning to the United States to settle in Seattle. He enrolled at the University of Washington in 1989 when he was 17 and graduated with a degree in economics. He trained with the U.S. national luge team for seven years in Lake Placid, New York, but gave up the sport after failing to qualify for the 1994 Winter Olympics. Mountaineering Kellogg began climbing in 1984 in the North Cascades but it was not until he left the national luge team that he began to pursue mountaineering as a career. He worked as a climbing ranger in Mount Rainier National Park in 1997‚Äì1998 and later ran a Seattle-based construction business to support his climbs. He became well known in the climbing community in 1998 as he began to break records for speed ascents. =Speed climbing= In 1998 Kellogg became the first person to climb and descend Mount Rainier in under five hours. He repeated the feat in 2004 when he ran from Paradise, Washington to the summit and back in 4 hours, 59 minutes. His record for the fastest climb has since been surpassed. Kellogg entered the 2003 Khan Tengri speed climbing competition in Kazakhstan, a race to climb the mountain, and won. He once held the record for the fastest ascent and descent on Mount McKinley's West Buttress route, making the round trip to the summit and back in 23 hours, 55 minutes; he was the first known person to ascend and descend in less than 24 hours. Kellogg made three attempts to break speed record on Mount Everest in 2010, 2011 and 2013, but never succeeded. =First ascents= Throughout his career, Kellogg claimed a number of first ascents. These included the Black Crystal Arete route on Kichatna Spire in Alaska (2005; with Joe Puryear), the southwest ridge of Mount Siguniang (2008; with Dylan Johnson), the Medicine Buddha route on Aconcagua in Argentina (2009), and Pangbuk Ri in Nepal (2011). In 2012, Kellogg traveled to Nepal with David Gottlieb to attempt the first ascent of Lunag Ri; they abandoned the attempt when Gottlieb fell sick, but in 2014 Kellogg won a Mugs Stump Award grant to return to the mountain for another attempt. =Death on Fitz Roy= Kellogg and his climbing partner Jens Holsten traveled to Patagonia, Argentina in 2014 on an expedition to climb Fitz Roy. Both Kellogg and Holsten reached the summit on the afternoon of February 14, but while they were descending that night, Kellogg was hit by a falling rock and died instantly. No attempts were made to recover his body. Personal life Kellogg met Lara-Karena Bitenieks, another climber, in 1994 while they were working at REI in Seattle. They began dating in 1999 and were married from 2000 until she died in 2007 while descending Mount Wake in Denali National Park, Alaska. A month after his wife's death, Kellogg was diagnosed with colorectal cancer, which later went into remission. Before his death in 2014, Kellogg was in a relationship with Mandy Kraus. He was a Buddhist.

Drawing was his outlet to escape from reality, and he began at a young age, with a four-frame comic strip in the newspaper of his elementary school in Gunsan, North Jeolla Province. His single-mindedness about art won him special treatment from his teachers, who would sometimes allow him to paint watercolors instead of finishing his homework. Career When he wasn't accepted by the university he applied for and with his family circumstances showing no signs of improving, Yoon moved to Seoul at the age of 19 to pursue his dream of becoming an artist. Since he didn't know anyone in the city, at first he was homeless for a while. He then met renowned manhwa artist Huh Young-man, and when he learned that Huh lived on the street close to where he was staying, Yoon hounded him until he was finally accepted as Huh's pupil and assistant in 1988. He also became an assistant to cartoonist Jo Woon-hak. Yoon described himself as an angry man during his twenties, always getting into fights with strangers whom he assumed looked down on him for his small physique. But his new job filled him with hope and passion, and he spent all of his free time at night practicing drawing. He was rejected eight times by publishers, before making his writing debut in 1993 with Emergency Landing (), a serial comic published in the magazine, Monthly Jump (). His own worst critic, he later derided his first work, \\"The story was terrible and the drawings were too showy.\\" So he put more emphasis on storylines rather than the details of the drawings, with the goal of reflecting the spirit of an era. Yoon became best known for writing the webtoon (called \\"webtoon\\" in Korea) Moss () and Misaeng (), leading literary critics to call him as one of the leading voices of the next generation of Korean cartoonists. Anchored in a classic murder mystery, Moss tells the story of one man's journey into the heart of darkness in a small town deep in the backwoods of the Korean countryside to uncover the truth behind his father's death. With twists and turns seemingly inspired by American southern gothic literature, the 80-part graphic novel was published online from 2008 to 2009, and it became an internet sensation. Readers praised the labyrinthine \\"whodunit\\" plot which was accentuated by the richly detailed illustrations of the decaying village that gave it an ambiance of dread, as well as its subtext of social commentary. In 2010, it was adapted into the film Moss starring Park Hae-il and Jung Jae-young and directed by Kang Woo-suk. It drew more than 3.4 million moviegoers, becoming the top grosser among webtoon-based films. Misaeng, which means \\"an incomplete life,\\" ran from 2012 to 2013 online and drew 1 billion hits; it was also published in paperback form in nine volumes and sold 900,000 copies. After failing to become a professional baduk player, the protagonist Jang Geu-rae takes a job as an intern at a Korean corporation, and the compelling narrative follows flawed and layered characters as they deal with the fierce competition for survival, claustrophobic work relationships and office politics. Yoon used the game of baduk as a metaphor for the cutthroat trading industry culture, and his painstaking research of the realities at trading companies provide a vivid description of life as a corporate underling. Misaeng gained immense popularity among white-collar workers in Korea and is considered a must-read comic in the country. In 2013, six 10-minute mobile short films were shown on internet portal Daum, with each short focusing on the six main characters of Misaeng (Yim Si-wan played Jang Geu-rae) but the storylines are prequels to the comic instead of a direct adaptation. Directed by Son Tae-gyum and Kim Tae-hui, these shorts were later compiled into the omnibus film titled Incomplete Life: Prequel (), which screened at the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival. Yim later reprised his role in the television series adaptation, also titled Misaeng. Directed by Kim Won-seok and written by Jung Yoon-jung, it was a ratings hit when it aired on cable channel tvN in 2014. With the TV series' popularity, Yoon confirmed that he will begin serializing a sequel to Misaeng in March 2015. In March 2012, Yoon led several groups of cartoonists (from the Korea Cartoonists' Association, the Cartoon and Animation Society in Korea, the Corea Cartoon Art Association, Cartoon Boomer and the Korea Comic Writers Association) in protesting the plan of state censorship body Korea Communications Standards Commission to designate 23 webtoons as \\"harmful to youth,\\" saying it undermines freedom of expression. Yoon said, \\"This is the sad reality of cartoons -- cartoons are praised and highlighted as a new cultural growth engine on the one hand, while they are the most frequently criticized contents for \\"harmfulness\\" on the other. The government hasn't taken much action on violence in other cultural genres, but has attacked cartoons only. With such repetitive attacks, we are losing our freedom to create.\\" In August 2013, Yoon launched A-Comics, a webzine specializing in comic books with content ranging from webtoons to mobile cartoons (regardless of origin), as well as reviews, recommendations, and interviews with cartoonists.http://acomics.co.kr/ Yoon said, \\"For a specific cultural genre to prosper, it is important for writers to come up with a good work, but at the same time a medium that bridges creators and consumers is very crucial. I hope A-Comics revitalizes the Korean comic book scene.\\" In 2014, Lee Byung-hun and Cho Seung-woo were cast in Inside Men (), an upcoming film adaptation directed by Woo Min-ho based on Yoon's 2010 webtoon The Insiders. Lee plays Sang-goo, a shady hoodlum who operates within the halls of powers, doing dirty work for crooked politicians. When the tables are turned against him, he sets out to get his revenge.

It is sung to an anonymous melody, Zahn No. 8326, which appeared in a tablature book for organ in 1577. The hymn is often used for funerals, especially the third and last stanza, \\"\\" (Ah Lord, let thine own angels dear). It appears in the current German Protestant hymnal (EG). Text The first theme of the hymn is the love to God and one's neighbour, following the Great Commandment. Schalling included thoughts from . The hymn is regarded as a (song for the dying), as Schalling expressed stations of the transition after death in the last stanza, according to Lutheran doctrine as understood in the 17th century. The soul is seen as carried by angels to (Abraham's bosom), according to , the body transforming in the grave, rising on the last day (\\"\\") to be reunited with the soul. The final line is \\"\\" (I want to praise you for ever!)  Music  Several composers used the tune, some also the text. chorale preludes were composed by Johann Friedrich Alberti and Bach (BWV 340 and BWV 1115), among others. Heinrich Sch√ºtz composed both a (Sacred concerto, SWV 348) and a motet (SWV 387). Dieterich Buxtehude wrote an extensive cantata (BuxWV 41), probably for a church concert at the Marienkirche in L√ºbeck, a work regarded as a major Baroque cantata because of its clear architecture and thoughtful interpretation of the text. Johann Ernst Bach composed a sacred cantata. Johann Sebastian Bach used the hymn in his cantatas and notably to conclude his St John Passion. In 1724, he used stanza 3, \\"\\" (Ah Lord, let thine own angels dear), in the first version of the work, and returned to it in the fourth and last version. In , composed in 1726 for St. Michael's Day, he quotes the melody instrumentally in the central tenor aria, played by the trumpet. Alfred D√ºrr writes that the Leipzig congregation would understand it as an allusion to the third stanza. Bach actually used this stanza to end , written for the same occasion two or three years later. Bach used the first stanza to conclude , written for Pentecost Monday of 1726. Hugo Distler composed a chorale motet for eight vocal parts a cappella, his Op. 2, which Karl Straube recommended for print as the work of a mature master of polyphony. \\"\\" is part of the current German Protestant hymnal (EG) under number 397.

It was a West German/French/Italian international co- production directed by Harald Reinl that was the second of the 1960s CCC Films Dr. Mabuse film series, being the sequel to Fritz Lang's The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse (1960). It starred Gert Fr√∂be, Daliah Lavi and in his first German film, Lex Barker. The film was co-written by Ladislas Fodor and in his first screenplay, Marc Behm who gives the film a science fictional plot that would be followed in the other films in the series. It was shot at the Spandau Studios and on location around Berlin. The film's sets were designed by the art directors Otto Erdmann and Hans J√ºrgen Kiebach. The German title Im Stahlnetz des Dr. Mabuse was a reference to the popular German police procedural television show of the time, Stahlnetz. In 1966 the 1960s Dr. Mabuse films were released in the United States to tie in with Gert Fr√∂be's fame in the role of Auric Goldfinger with this film being renamed The Phantom Fiend.  Plot  Inspector Lohmann's eagerly awaited fishing holiday is put on hold when he is called to investigate the murder of a man found in a railway tunnel. He was an Interpol courier carrying proof of the Chicago Syndicate's planned cooperation with a European criminal organisation that was in an attache case chained to, but now missing from his body. The Inspector gets word from Washington D.C. that a female representative of the Syndicate, Mrs. Pizarro is currently in Europe to meet up with the European criminals, and that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is sending Special Agent Joe Como to liaise with the German authorities. Lohmann visits a prison to have a meeting with one of the prisoners, Alberto Sandro, who was a member of the European criminal organisation in an unsuccessful bid to learn more about the upcoming events. Mrs. Pizarro is murdered by a flame thrower with Inspector Lohmann dodging questions from female reporter Maria Sabrehm who happens to be near the location of the murder, as is Joe Como. The only witness is a blind man who recalls the distinctive sound of a man with a wooden leg before he felt the heat of the flamethrower. Lohmann discovers a book on the charred body of Mrs. Pizarro called The Devil's Anatomy written by Reverend Briefenstein of St. Thomas Church. Lohmann looks through the book whose thesis is that though the Devil is a spirit, he can manifest himself into doing evil by taking the form of a werewolf, vampire or Dr. Mabuse. Lohmann, followed by Como and Maria meets the Pastor in his church to ask about Dr. Mabuse who everyone believes is dead. The Pastor says that though a man's body can die, his soul can infest the bodies of other men. The voice of Dr. Mabuse comes over the speaker system of the church warning Lohmann to stop his investigation. As Lohmann wanders through the church, Joe Como engages in a conversation with Mabuse saying he is really Nick Scappio, the representative of the Chicago Syndicate who is there to negotiate a shipment of a new drug into the United States. However, before the Chicago Syndicate will cooperate they demand to see proof of the power of the drug. Following his only lead, Lohmann goes to obtain further information from the blind witness who is run over and killed. Como and Lohmann pursue the murderer that turns out to be Alberto Sandro who has apparently escaped from the prison. Recapturing him, the prison authorities, who maintain an industrial laundry allowing trusted prisoners to deliver and pick up cleaning in the community, deny Sandro has left the prison. The warden insists Sandro is sedated in his cell. They discover that the person in Sandro's cell is a dead man with a wooden leg who the blind man had identified. Dr. Mabuse's drug, invented by Maria's scientist father who is a prisoner in the same prison as Sandro, is a mind control device capable of turning a person into a zombie whose actions can be controlled by radio transmissions. Mabuse not only has an army of criminals who can come and go from the prison but can be commanded to do criminal acts that they will have no recollection of later on. In the meantime Lohmann's assistant gets the fingerprints of Como and transmits them to FBI headquarters who declare that the fingerprints of the man calling himself Como is not the real Agent Como. Como/Scappio is sent to the prison. He discovers Dr. Mabuse's display of the power of his drug to the Chicago Syndicate will come on Friday the 13th (the date of the film's premiere); when every prisoner will be injected with the mind control drug, armed with weapons and released in order to launch an armed assault to destroy a nearby nuclear power plant. Cast Release The Return of Dr. Mabuse was distributed in West Germany by Constantin Film 13 October 1961. It was later released in Italy as F.B.I. contro Dr. Mabuse on 3 May 1962 and France on 10 June 1962 as Le retour du Docteur Mabuse.

The film revolves around a professional hitman (Jang Dong-gun) who is conflicted about killing his last target (Kim Min-hee). Plot At a restaurant, professional hitman Gon quietly interacts with a little girl sitting alone at her table. He then leaves and makes his way to the warehouse behind the restaurant where a man name named Ha Yun-guk is making a deal with a group of thugs. Gon kills them all and retrieves Yun-guk's laptop. Hearing a sound behind the door, he shoots through it, only to realize it is the little girl who had followed him. The girl dies, traumatizing Gon who later drinks himself into a stupor. Gon's close friend Chaoz takes him back to their boss. Gon is to go to South Korea to tie up the loose end - the little girl's mother Choi Mo-gyeong, a risk manager at an investment firm. At Seoul airport, Gon is received by his local contact Byun. As he studies Mo-gyeong's routine, he learns of her visits to her senile mother in a hospital, and watches as she mourns her daughter. Gon feels even more guilty and conflicted about his task. Mo-gyeong is approached by Detective Park from the financial crimes task force. Park reveals that her supervisor John Lee is heavily suspected to have ties with organized crimes. Yun-guk has somehow gain access to John Lee's accounts for money laundering, and was trying to sell them to the Russian Mob when he got killed. Park ask Mo-gyeong whether her husband left anything that can implicate John Lee. Meanwhile, as Gon still hasn't completed his assignment, his boss sends Chaoz and the rest of the team to South Korea. They quickly close in on Mo-gyeong's apartment. In her apartment, Mo-gyeong finds the file in a pen drive. Park's subordinate shoots him and takes the drive away. Immediately after giving the drive to John, he is killed by Byun. The team prepares to kill Mo-gyeong, but Gon warns her with a call, then intervenes and kills several of them. He creates a distraction, allowing her to escape with a promise to reveal the truth about what happened to her daughter. However, she was captured by the team. Gon He requests Chaoz to let Mo-gyeong go, but the latter declines. Gon then tips off the police about a bomb that goes off quickly and alerts them about another bomb. Mo-gyeong is taken to the financial building, which is soon surrounded by the cops who believe it will be bombed. Gon then takes out the two teammates one by one in a series of fights and improvised traps. On the other hand, Mo-gyeong succeeds in preventing money transfer to John Lee's account with the help of her computer. When John ignores Byun's money, the latter stabs him to death. At last, Gon battles Chaoz and both get severely wounded. Byun discovers Mo-gyeong and severely beats her up. He tries to rape her before she stabs him to death. After a conversation with Chaoz, Gon tells Mo-gyeong she needs to shoot the man coming to kill her since he is the one who killed her daughter. However, Gon himself arrives and is shot by Mo- gyeong. Chaoz also arrives, snatches the shotgun from Mo-gyeong and tries to shoot her, but a dying Gon requests not to do so. The elevator goes down with a dead Gon's hand held by Chaoz while Mo-gyeong tries to reach out to Gon via radio. A flashback shows how Gon's mother, who abandoned him in the states and killed herself early on in the film, tells him not to cry as they would have a good life once they move to America. However, Gon continues to cry: both as a kid and an adult.

He is Professor at CentraleSup√©lec (Paris Saclay University) and ESTIA Institute of Technology. He was University Professor and Dean (2015-2017) at Florida Institute of Technology (FIT), where he created the Human-Centered Design Institute in 2010. He was Senior Research Scientist at Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC). He was Chief Scientist for Human-Centered Design at NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) from 2010 to 2016. He is known for his work on intelligent assistance, cognitive function analysis, human-centered design (HCD), orchestration of life-critical systems, tangible interactive systems and human systems integration. Biography Guy Andr√© Boy is a computer scientist, an aerospace and control engineer, as well as a cognitive scientist. He obtained his PhD in automation and systems design in 1980 at √âcole nationale sup√©rieure de l'a√©ronautique et de l'espace (ISAE-SUPAERO), and his HDR (habilitation as research director) in Computer Science and Cognitive Science in 1992 at Pierre and Marie Curie University - Paris 6. His HDR thesis was titled Methods and Tools for Cognitive Human-Machine Interaction. His HDR Committee included Professors Jo√´lle Coutaz, Pierre Falzon, Jean-Gabriel Ganascia, Georges Duvaut, Brian R. Gaines, Yves Kodratoff, and Marc Pelegrin. He also obtained a master's degree in cognitive psychology at the University of Toulouse in 1983. His work mainly focuses on cognition, aerospace systems and organizations since the late seventies sharing his time between academia and industry. In the early eighties, he created and led the Cognitive Ergonomics Group at ONERA. In the late eighties, he created and headed the Advanced Interaction Media Group at NASA Ames Research Center, California. He was Founder and President of the European Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Engineering (EURISCO) in France ‚Äì a research institute of Airbus and Thales Group. He led EURISCO from its creation in 1992 until its closing in 2008. EURISCO was a multidisciplinary organization made up of cognitive and social scientists, computer scientists, engineers and human factors specialists. It served students from various universities and engineering schools that were part of EURISCO's network of excellence. EURISCO focused strongly on its associations with the European aeronautical industry, research and education. In 2004, Guy Andr√© Boy co- founded with Bernard Claverie the French Cognitive Engineering School and center of excellence ENSC: √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure de Cognitique in Bordeaux, France. He taught cognitive engineering and human-centered design in several universities including FIT, √âcole Polytechnique (Paris), ISAE-SUPAERO, INSA and ENAC (Toulouse), Paris Descartes University, Civil Aviation University of China (Tianjin), University of Valenciennes, and ENSC. In 2008, he joined IHMC as a senior research scientist. In 2009, he became University Professor at FIT where he created and directed HCDi, which supports the FIT HCD Ph.D. and Master's programs. In 2010, he was appointed Chief Scientist for HCD at NASA KSC (under an Intergovernmental Personal Act). He advised for several NASA projects including the Virtual Camera concept and tool for planetary exploration, which he created and developed, space robotics and the Glass Wall project for the renewal of launch control rooms. In 2013, he was nominated member of the Scientific Committee of European Commission's SESAR (Single European Sky Air Traffic Management) Joint Undertaking (SJU) Program, to provide advice to the SJU Executive Director, drafting of scientific opinions and provision of scientific advice. Boy was inducted as a Fellow of the Air and Space Academy (Europe) in 2006, and a Senior Member of the Association for Computing Machinery in 2009. Work Boy's early cognitive engineering research was on the first Glass cockpit, conducted with Airbus and the French aviation authorities (1980‚Äì1984). He actively contributed to develop human-centered methods for cockpit design and certification of the first two crewmen cockpits. This early leadership in cognitive engineering led to an award from the French Ministry of Defense that supported part of his work at NASA Ames, where he developed an operation assistant system to enhance the control of the Orbital Refueling System of Space Shuttle (1984-1986). He coined the term \\"intelligent assistant systems\\" to denote systems that support human operators in safety-critical situations. After two years in France (1987‚Äì1988), where he co-founded a start-up company on intelligent assistant systems, Dialogics/Dialexis, he returned to NASA Ames to work on electronic documentation for the Space Station Freedom (1989‚Äì1991). During this period, influenced by Douglas Englebart, who he worked with for a while, he developed an approach mixing hypertext and machine learning, leading to a system called Computer Integrated Documentation. This work led to a major publication on context-sensitive indexing. Back to France, he was nominated leading expert in Information Society and Technology for the European Commission. He served as an expert for the European Space Agency to establish the area of human-machine interaction and artificial intelligence (1991‚Äì1992). Creating and developing EURISCO, he became a legal expert for aircraft accident investigations (1992-1994). He then started new investigations in cockpit design and produced the Cognitive Function Analysis (CFA) method that was extensively used in industry for the design of safety-critical systems. Commercial aircraft cockpits became more computerized and generated more studies in human-computer interaction (HCI). He combined HCI and artificial Intelligence approaches not only in the aerospace domain, but also in education through the use of software agents. He also created the Group Elicitation Method (GEM) that is used for knowledge elicitation in HCD, and more specifically in participatory design. He helped in the restructuring of Air France at the highest level using GEM. GEM was used in many industrial settings, e.g., Airbus, Nokia, Daimler, Toyota Europe and in several European Integrated Projects funded by the European Commission. He collaborated to the Handbook of Human-Computer Interaction with a chapter in knowledge elicitation for the design of software agents. He wrote an introductory text under the auspices of UNESCO on theories of human cognition to better understand the co-adaptation of people and technology, in knowledge management, organizational intelligence and learning, and complexity. He coordinated the French Handbook of Cognitive Engineering: A Human-Computer Interaction and Cognition (Trait√© d'Ing√©nierie Cognitive: IHM et Cognition). He then contributed to develop the field of HCI in France, and was Co-Founder of AFIHM, the French national equivalent of Association for Computing Machinery SIGCHI. He co-founded the first French ACM SIGCHI local chapter in Toulouse. He was the first French CHI paper Co-Chair (Inter-CHI 1993) with Jakob Nielsen, and was elected Executive Vice Chair of ACM SIGCHI (1995‚Äì1999), making him the first European ACM SIGCHI top executive. This service to the HCI community, together with Richard Anderson, contributed to the creation of several local chapters worldwide. Within the human-computer interaction community, he collaborated with colleagues that were influential throughout his professional life, including Jeff Bradshaw, John Carroll, Jonathan Grudin, Don Norman, Terry Winograd, among many others. In 2015, he was elected Co-Chair of the INCOSE Human-Systems Integration Working Group. He also founded the HCI-Aero (Human-Computer Interaction in Aerospace) conference series in cooperation with ACM-SIGCHI, the International Ergonomics Association and the Air and Space Academy (Program Chair, 1998-2014). HCI-Aero conferences followed the Human-Machine Interaction and Artificial Intelligence in Aerospace conference series, also created by Boy (1986‚Äì1995). HCI-Aero conferences have become a major reference in the field of HCI in Aerospace (full papers are indexed in the ACM Digital Library). He also created the Technical Committee on Human-Factors and Ergonomics of the International Ergonomics Association (IEA), which he leads since 2008. He scientifically led two main projects regarding safety and human-computer interaction in aeronautics: DIVA, a European project that tried to understand aircrew's awareness of both aircraft internal states and external situations using cognitive function analysis (1998-2001); and PAUSA, a French national project on authority distribution in air traffic management that contributed to the emergence of the Orchestra model for socio-cognitive analysis of multi-agent life-critical systems (2006-2008). This model and the development of HCDi led to the publication of the book, Orchestrating Human-Centered Design where he promotes education and training of leaders who understand technology, organizations and people (the TOP model). This book presents a humanist approach to design, engineering and more globally education. With Jen Narkevicius, he proposed a unification of HCD and systems engineering for a better definition of human-systems integration. He extended this HCD research effort on safety-critical systems to nuclear power plant control and management with two of his Ph.D. students. His research work is globally summarized in the discussion on cognitive engineering he had with Jean Pinet, a former Experimental Test Pilot of Concorde, and his dedication to automation, aerospace and education. Influenced by the work of Hiroshi Iishii, he proposed the shift from automation to tangible interactive objects. He has participated in NASA Blue Sky Study Groups for the \\"Small Pressurized Rover,\\" (later called the \\"Lunar Electric Rover\\"). In 2012, he was the director of the International Space University Space Studies Program FIT/NASA-KSC local organizing committee and the chair of the team project of \\"what space can contribute to global STEM education.\\" The same year, he gave a TEDx talk on \\"Human-Centered Design: the STEAM Renaissance\\". He continues to work on risk taking and wrote an interdisciplinary book on the topic published by the Air and Space Academy. Selected works ;Books (in English) *Boy, G.A. (2020).

The parish is and covers . It includes a detached district of about to the south of the main part of the parish. Liscannor Bay forms the western boundary. The land is mostly low hills and is suitable for farming. It rises to on the eastern boundary. Antiquities The old church of Kilmanaheen stood on top of a hill in the Lissatunna townland. It has almost vanished now, but the large cemetery surrounding it was still in use in 1897. According to tradition the church stood on the same place as the former D√∫n, or residence, of Baoth Bronach, King of Corcomroe. He gave the place to Saint Mainch√≠n for the glory of God. There was a castle in Ennistymon, which in 1580 belonged to O‚ÄôConnor. It has since disappeared. Settlements In 1841 the population of the parish was 6,436 in 1,065 houses, of whom 4,494 lived in rural districts. Kilmanaheen contains the small town of Ennistymon and part of the village of Lahinch. Ennistymon lies at one end of the N85 road from Ennis, and on the N67 road between Galway and Tarbert (via the Shannon Ferry). It has shops selling local crafts, pubs, restaurants and a weekly market. The river Cullenagh runs through the town. Ennistymon is near to the edge of the Burren, a scenic area. Ennistymon was a stop on the West Clare Railway until it was closed in the late 1950s. Brian Merriman, the poet, was born in Ennistymon in 1749. Caitlin Macnamara of Ennistymon married the Welsh poet, Dylan Thomas. Catholic parish In 1837 the parish was part of the Catholic union or district of Ennistymon, which also included the parish of Clooney, and contained the chapels of Ennistymon, Lahinch, and Kilthomas.

It is an active Roman Catholic church in the diocese of Shrewsbury. Its parish is combined with that of St Thomas Becket, Tarporley. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. It is a small church with a detached campanile. History Mass was first said in the area in 1926 in a pavilion behind what was then the Station Hotel. In the 1950s, the owners of the hotel bought land to the south of the hotel and gave it to the diocese. The church was designed by F. X. Velarde, and was opened in September 1955 by John Murphy, Roman Catholic Bishop of Shrewsbury. The church cost ¬£7,000, and the detached campanile ¬£1,000. In about 1958 the church became part of Tarporley parish. The interior was reordered in 1976. Architecture =Exterior= St Cuthbert's is a small church designed to seat 72 people. Its design is influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement, together with some Gothic and Germanic references. The exterior is faced with brick, the dressings are in artificial stone, and the church is roofed in Staffordshire tiles. There is a detached campanile to the southeast of the church. The church is orientated with the sanctuary at the west end; the following description will use the liturgical orientation. Its plan consists of a three-bay nave with a south sacristy, a narthex at the west end, and an apsidal sanctuary. The narthex has two gables, each containing a diamond-shaped window, and a main entrance on the north side. The windows along the sides of the nave are paired lancets separated by artificial stone mullions carved with angels. The sacristy has a south doorway, and windows on the south, west and east walls, those on the east having angel mullions. The apse is without windows, but on the sides of the sanctuary are windows similar to those on the nave. On the roof of the nave are three decorative cross finials. The brick campanile is almost high, and it has a stone bellcote containing electronic speakers. On the top is a copper pyramidal roof with a cross finial. =Interior= The interior of the church is in brick, with the ceilings and apse plastered. In the nave are two wide diaphragm arches, and there is a similar arch at the entrance to the sanctuary. The windows contain cathedral glass, and the mullions are also carved on the interior with angels. The Stations of the Cross are in wood that was carved in the South Tyrol. Behind the altar is a shelf on which is a tabernacle. In the south wall of the nave are the entrances to the sacristy and the confessional. The narthex contains a small chapel.

The whole shop is decorated by many transparent plastic cupboards which are divided into five to six cubic boxes with around 35x35x35cm each. Individuals can consign their second-hand or designed products for sale by renting a cube at a low cost. Origin The concept of cube shop came from Japan in 2000, which was consigned for the sale of second-hand toys. This new concept of boutique was soon spread to Taiwan in 2001. In 2006, the mode of cube shop spread to Hong Kong and mainly located in the second-level of shopping centres in Mongkok and Causeway Bay. Products including toys, ornaments and cosmetics can be found, providing sales opportunities to cockroach capitalists and individuals. Currently, cube shops can be found in many shopping malls in Hong Kong, selling fashionable and trendy goods which attract mainly teenagers to buy. Thus, there are other elements find in cube shops in Hong Kong including the consignation of clothes and even services. Operation mode The storekeepers generally rent a shop in a shopping centre (e.g. Causeway Place in Causeway Bay) and design the shop with cubic cupboards. They usually display their items for sale in the cubes or rent the cubes to the tenants. Tenants could rent their desired cubes and sell their items (whatever that could be accommodated in the cubes). The rents for each cube ranges from as little as HKD100 TO HKD3,000 per month, depending on the size and position of the cubes. For example, if the cube is bigger and is located at the eye-level of the glass window, it has the most expensive rent as it is the most eye-catching. Apart from renting the cubes, some store owners also collect commissions from the cubes, the commission ranges from 10-40% of the total income of the cubes. Since there are so many cubes and it is impossible for every tenant to look after the cubes all the time, the storekeepers usually record down the products and transactions for both helping the tenants to manage their business and collecting commissions. The items in the cubes are usually small items of cheap costs. Since the cubes are not big, small items are good for accommodation and more styles of the products could be displayed. Some store owners would reserve some cubes for selling their own products, and renting most of the cubes to tenants. It can be seen that renting the cubes to tenants is more popular to the store owners as the income from renting is more steady and profitable. Potential risks =Grid owner= As the shopkeeper has the ultimate power to open or close the shop, the renters of the grids may not be able to get back their goods or money of rent from the shopkeeper. There are news about shopkeeper suddenly closed the shop and the grid owners had paid for six months rent and could not get back the money. =Purchaser= One of the main concerns is that the goods the cube shops sell may be a fake of a brand and there is quality concern. One example is color contact lenses sold in cube shops were tested and found that pigment was painted on the lenses only instead of paint under a cover. This would cause hygienic problem and were not regulated under medical equipment.

The Miis are voiced by a Nuance-based text- to-speech software and have unique personalities. Miis can then perform various actions, such as eating, trying on different outfits, falling in love with each other, and engaging in many leisure activities. As more Miis are added to the island, many strange and curious interactions can occur between them, such as friendship, romance, conflicts and even get-togethers and meetings. As the game goes by, the player unlocks more locations, clothes, food, and other things for the Miis to play with, visit and use. They can even unlock a port, where they can give and \\"trade\\" goods with other islands via StreetPass. In the American Version, there are 409 clothes. In the European Version, there are 412 clothes. In the Japanese Version, there are 401 clothes. As of May 16 2016 (2017 in Japan and Paneurope) SpotPass clothing are no longer released and distributed so the only ones currently available being the \\"Schoolgirl Uniform\\" outfit in the US and the \\"Flower Clip\\" headwear in Europe. Items in the game can be purchased via region-specific cash, the type corresponding to your version of the game and your device's set location. Sample, in the US there are US dollars, in the AU there are AU dollars, in the Europe there are euros, in the United Kingdom there are pounds, in the original country (the Japan) there are yen, and in South Korea there are won. Like Tomodachi Collection, the minimum amount of cash is 0 cents (0 Yen in Japan, 0 Euro cents in European countries and 0 pence in the UK) and the maximum is 999,999.99 dollars (99999.999 Yen in Japan, 999,999.99 Pounds in the UK and 999,999.99 Euro in European countries). Note that in Japan the comma is shift out at the unity, instead the tenth; es: 5000.00 : 500.000 Yen.  Development  In May 2014, a playable demo of the game was distributed to Platinum members of Club Nintendo in North America, the data of which could be transferred to the final version to unlock a bonus in-game item. The game is bundled with two Nintendo eShop download codes for a 'Welcome version' demo, which can be given to friends. A slightly different demo version was later publicly released for download via the Nintendo eShop. This version does not unlock any features in the full game. Following the announcement of a worldwide release, controversy arose concerning the impossibility of same-sex relationships. Nintendo stated, \\"The ability for same-sex relationships to occur in the game was not part of the original game that launched in Japan, and that game is made up of the same code that was used to localise it for other regions outside Japan.\\" In May 2013, it was widely reported that a bug in the original Japanese version of the game, which enabled same-sex relationships, was patched by Nintendo. This was refuted by Nintendo in a statement made April 2014, explaining that same-sex relationships were never possible, and that the patch in fact fixed a different issue. Despite various campaigns from users, Nintendo stated that it would not be possible to add same-sex relationships to the game, as they \\"never intended to make any form of social commentary with the launch of the game\\", and because it would require significant development alterations which would not be able to be released as a post-game patch. The company later apologised and stated that if they were to create a third game in the series they would \\"strive to design a gameplay experience from the ground up that is more inclusive, and better represents all players.\\"  Reception  Tomodachi Life has received positive reviews. It holds an average of 72% and 71/100 on review aggregate sites GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively. IGN gave the game a score of 8.4, calling it \\"a surprisingly funny and rewarding experience.\\" Polygon gave Tomodachi Life a 7.5 out of 10, praising its likeability despite certain aspects being repetitive. GamesRadar gave the game 4 out of 5 stars, praising its weird humor and relaxing gameplay, whilst criticising the minigames for being too simple. GameTrailers gave the game a score of 6.0, stating \\"the pervasive sense of quirkiness in Tomodachi Life works, but can‚Äôt sustain the entire game.\\" The game has received criticism for not enabling relationships between Mii characters of the same sex; Nintendo of America later apologized for failing to include same-sex relationships in Tomodachi Life, stating that it wasn't possible for NoA to change the game's design, or for Nintendo to change this aspect in a post-ship patch. It also noted that \\"if we create a next installment in the Tomodachi series, we will strive to design a game-play experience from the ground up that is more inclusive, and better represents all players.\\" Tomodachi Life was the best seller in the Japanese video game market during the week of its release, selling about 404,858 units. By September 2014, its global sales reached 3.12 million units. , Nintendo has sold 6.59 million units of the game worldwide, making it one of the top 10 best selling games on the 3DS. =Legacy= A stage based on Tomodachi Life appears in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Miitomo, a social networking mobile app for iOS and Android devices, was released in March 2016. The app was created by the same core team who developed Tomodachi Life, and features very similar ideas. In 2016, a similar game involving Miis, Miitopia, was released in Japan. It was released worldwide the following year.

Body worn video has a range of uses and designs, of which the best-known use is as a part of policing equipment. Other uses include action cameras for social and recreational (including cycling), within commerce, in healthcare and medical use, in military use, journalism, citizen sousveillance and covert surveillance. Nascent research on the impact of body-worn cameras in law enforcement shows mixed evidence as to the impact of cameras on the use of force by law enforcement and communities' trust in police.  Designs  Body worn cameras are often designed to be worn in one of three locations: on the torso, on or built into a helmet, and on or built into glasses. Some feature live streaming capabilities while others are based on local storage. The National Criminal Justice Technology Research, Test, and Evaluation Center has conducted market surveys on the body worn cameras to assist organisations in purchasing the best camera. The survey discusses device functionality, optics, audio, GPS, and several more categories. These cameras range in price from 200 dollars to 2,000 dollars. Applications =Law enforcement= Wearable cameras are used by police and other law enforcement organizations in countries around the world. The cameras are intended to improve interactions between officers and the public. The first generation of 'modern' police body cameras was introduced around 2005 in the United Kingdom, followed from 2014 onwards by large scale implementation in the United States, mainly to increase transparency and police accountability. Other countries have followed the trend. Early studies overwhelmingly showed positive results, but replications have led to mixed findings. Outcomes have been shown to differ depending on the local context and the guidelines regulating activation of the bodycams. Challenges include training, privacy, storage and the use of recordings further 'downstream' in the judicial system. =Military combat= US soldier in Afghanistan with a personal helmet camera, 2010 Body worn cameras, as well as helmet cameras are used in the military.Bud, T. K. (2016). The Rise and Risks of Police Body-Worn Cameras in Canada. Surveillance & Society, 14(1), 117‚Äì121. Video can either be stored locally, or streamed back to a command center or military outpost. A notable instance of this was the raid on Osama Bin Laden‚Äôs compound, where live video footage of the raid is believed to have been streamed to the White House. In 2013, a British Royal Marine soldier was convicted of murder after shooting to death an unarmed and injured Afghan insurgent, contrary to the Geneva Convention. The incident had been recorded by a helmet camera whose images and sound were used in evidence at a court martial relating to the incident. The helmet camera has been the focus of the Discovery Channel series Taking Fire about the 101st Airborne in the Korengal documenting their personal war footage. In 2016 \\"a camera recovered from the helmet of a dead fighter offers a contrasting picture of chaos and panic in a battle with Kurdish peshmerga.\\"Reuters, \\"Helmet cam footage shows Islamic State in chaos,\\" April 29, 2016 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast- crisis-iraq-idUSKCN0XQ134 = Firefighting = Firefighter with bodycam Firefighters use helmet cameras as a tool to assess fires and for communication and training purposes. Cameras in this occupation are often thermal cameras in order to be able to see in darkness and inside smoke-filled buildings. Augmented reality can be added to accentuate outlines of objects and people. = Healthcare = Body worn video has been suggested and explored in parts of the medical field. Data recorded from wearable cameras can assist in medical research and limit error caused by inaccurate self-reporting of data. It is speculated that under-reporting is common when conducting dietary and nutrition assessments. Research suggests body worn video reduces under- reporting of intake during such assessments. Cameras can for example be used as a memory prosthetic for conditions that affect the memory.Visual Memory Prosthetic, 1996 Body worn devices have been used to assist in clinical settings. In 2013, Google Glass was used to assist in surgery by providing a mostly hands-free way to broadcast and receive consultation from another surgeon. Body cameras were provided to hospital staff by the Cardiff and Vale Health Board in Wales, United Kingdom. The cameras were issued to reduce the likelihood of violent assaults against staff. According to the manager who provides support to staff who have been attacked, the cameras ‚Äì and especially the audio recording ‚Äì have been vital for successful prosecutions.  Privacy concerns  Concerns over privacy have been raised with this technology, most notably in the context of Google Glasses and policing. The advent of large- scale data collection, possibly in combination with facial recognition and other technologies capable of interpreting videos in bulk, means that all cameras, including body worn cameras, could create a means of tracking people anywhere they go. In policing, critics have warned that each police officer could become a \\"roving surveillance camera\\" Police will interact with citizens during vulnerable moments, such as in a hospital, or in a domestic violence situation. Concerns have also been raised that this algorithms not only infringe on privacy rights, but could also be ethnically biased. The American Civil Liberties Union has suggested policies to balance citizen's rights with the desire for more transparency and accountability.

The Afo-A-Kom, which means the Kom thing (also Mbang in the Kom language) is a wooden stylized carving of a standing man, crowned and holding a scepter, behind a stool supported on three carved buffalo heads. The core is iroko wood. His face is sheathed in copper and much of the body is covered with reddish and blue beads. (See the Arthemis link below for a photo online.) The Foyn/Fon (chief) cares for the statue, and it symbolizes \\"royal authority and the promise of continued succession.\\"Ellis, p. 142. The carver of this statue is unknown but it is speculated that Afo-A-Kom was carved by the second traditional leader (Foyn) of the Kom people in the 1920s. In 1966, the Afo-A- Kom was stolen from its sacred grove at Laikom (the seat of the Kom people, where the Foyn resides) by one of the princes, then sold to a middle man who later sold it to an art dealer who took it to the United States of America.Blakeslee.Ellis, p. 141-145. The Kom people believe that the Afo-A-Kom possesses mystical powers and that shortly after it arrived in the US it began disturbing its new owners by destroying everything around it. Its new owner took it and threw it into the sea but only to get back home and see the Afo-A- Kom. He took it to a New York art gallery where he sold it for circa 15 million CFA. While there it was recognized, and American art collector Warren M. Robbins raised an alarm. He raised funds together with other AmericansEllis, p. 145. and some Kom elite in the US to purchase the stolen statue back from the Manhattan art gallery for under $30,000.Afo-A-Kom. Returning the figure, Robbins was welcomed by the Fon of the Kom people Nsom Ngwe, and the President of Cameroon Ahmadou Ahidjo, among other dignitaries. During the reception of the statue in Yaounde, Ahidjo suggested to Fon Nsom Ngwe that Mbang be kept in the National Museum in Yaounde, but the Fon replied that if the President can provide enough space in Yaounde for him to go and bring the Kom people to stay with it there, then he would accept the president's proposal. Seeing that Kom and the Afo-A-Kom were inseparable, the president made it possible for the statue to be taken back to its habitual residence at Laikom. It was briefly put on display at the Tourism Office in Yaounde and then transported by air to Bamenda. It was then ferried by a delegation of the dignitaries of the region back to Fundong where it was handed back to the Kom people. It is now in the Laikom palace where it is put on display annually for the Kom people.Abang Njuosi. Notes References * Abang Njuosi (ed) (2008) Kom Folktales.

Mu (Î¨¥) is an ancient Korean word defining a shaman in the Korean traditional religion. Korean shamans hold rituals called gut (literally \\"good\\") for the welfare of the individuals and the society. In modern Korea different terms are used to define shamans, including mudang (mostly for females), baksu (only for males), tangol (for hereditary shamans) and musogin (\\"people who do shamanism\\", used in the context of organised shamanism). Etymology The Korean word Î¨¥ mu is related to the Chinese Â∑´ wu, which defines shamans of either sex. Korean shamanic terminology has, however, at least a partial origin in Siberian languages. Already in records from the Yi dynasty, mudang has a prevalent usage. Mudang itself is explained in relation to Chinese characters, as originally referring to the \\"hall\\", Â†Ç tang, of a shaman. A different etymology, however, explains mudang as stemming directly from the Siberian term for female shamans, utagan or utakan. Mudang is used mostly, but not exclusively, for female shamans. Male shamans are called by a variety of names, including sana mudang (literally \\"male mudang\\") in the Seoul area, or baksu mudang, also shortened baksu (\\"doctor\\", \\"healer\\"), in the Pyongyang area. According to some scholars, baksu is an ancient authentic designation of male shamans, and locutions like sana mudang or baksu mudang are recent coinages due to the prevalence of female shamans in recent centuries. Baksu may be a Korean adaptation of terms loaned from Siberian languages, such as baksi, balsi or bahsih. The theory of a Siberian origin of Korean shamanic terminology is more reasonable than theories which explain such terminology as originating in Chinese, given that Chinese culture influenced Korea only at a relatively recent stage of Korean history. Likely, when Koreans adopted Chinese characters they filtered their previously oral religious culture through the sieve of Chinese culture. Another term, mostly used in contemporary South Korea in the context of shamanic associations, is musogin, which means \\"people who do shamanism\\". Role of the mu The work of the mu is based on the holistic model, which takes into consideration, not only the whole person, but the individual's interaction with his environment, thus both the inner and outer world. The soul is considered the source of life breath, and any physical illness is considered to be inextricably linked with sickness of the soul. Illness of the mind has its cause in soul loss, intrusion or possession by malevolent spirits. The gut, rites practised by Korean shamans, have gone through a number of changes since the Silla and Goryeo periods. Even during the Joseon dynasty, which established Korean Confucianism as the state religion, shamanic rites persisted. In the past, such rites included agricultural rites, such as prayers for abundant harvest. With a shift away from agriculture in modern Korea, agricultural rites have largely been lost and modern-day shamans are more focused on the spiritual issues of urban life. Myths about the origin of Korean shamans Image of Dangun. The mythical first Korean king. In all the myths which figuratively explain the role of the shamans, it is implied that they are media, intermediaries, of higher forms of being. They are not ordained institutionally, but receive ordination from gods, spirits or human ghosts. Generally, these myths explain that shamans, whom in the most recent history of Korea are regarded as belonging to the lowest class of society (cheonmin Ï≤úÎØº), have a forgotten divine or princely nature, often coming from a blood lineage that may be traced back to the early founders of civilisation. Further features of these myths are symbols of divine presence, such as the holy mountain and the holy tree, and tragic or painful experiences. The bear is an animal often present in such myths, with parallels in the mythologies of Siberia. =Sungmo‚Äîthe Holy Mother= In a collection of myths, the origin of the shamans is linked to a mother goddess associated with a mountain and presented as either the mother or the spiritual daughter of the \\"Heavenly King\\". She has different names according to different regions and associated mountains: Sungmo (\\"Holy Mother\\"), Daemo (\\"Great Mother\\"), Jamo (\\"Benevolent Mother\\"), Sinmo (\\"Divine Mother\\"), Nogo (\\"Olden Maiden\\"), and others. In other myths she is a mortal princess who is later turned into a goddess. These myths usually tell of a man, Pobu Hwasang, who encountered the \\"Holy Mother [of the Heavenly King]\\" on the top of a mountain. The Holy Mother then became a human being and married the man who met her, giving birth to eight girls, the first mudang. According to some scholars, this myth was first elaborated in the Silla period, when Buddhism and influences from China had already penetrated the Korean peninsula. The myth of the princess is the most popular, and it differs from region to region. In one of the versions, the princess is Ahwang Kongju of the Yao kingdom, located on the Asian mainland. The princess had a strong link with divinity, granting welfare to her people. Her father sent the princess among the people, whom began to worship her for her healing powers. The first mudang were established as her successors. The princess is worshipped with seasonal offerings in Chungcheong. The yellow and red clothes worn by the mudang are regarded as Ahwang Kongju's robes. In the north of the Korean peninsula the princess is known as Chil Kongju (the \\"Seventh Princess\\"), seventh amongst the daughters of the king. The myth tells that she was rejected by her father, who sealed her in a stone coffin and cast it into a pond, but she was rescued by a Dragon King sent by the Heavenly King, and ascended to the western sky becoming the goddess of healing waters. Names of the goddess in other local traditions Pali Kongju and Kongsim. In the tradition of Jeju Island, where there are more male baksu than female mudang, the myth tells of a prince as the ancestor of all shamans. =Dangun‚Äîthe Sandalwood King= Dangun is traditionally considered to be the son of Hwanin, the \\"Heavenly King\\", and founder of the Korean nation. This myth is reputed to be older than that of the mother goddess. Myths similar to that of Dangun are found in Ainu and Siberian cultures. The myth starts with prince Hwanung (\\"Heavenly Prince\\"), son of Hwanin. The prince asked his father to grant him governance over Korea. Hwanin accepted, and Hwanung was sent to Earth bearing three Heavenly Seals and accompanied by three thousand followers. The prince arrived under the holy tree of sandalwood (Sintansu Ïã†Îã®Ïàò, Á•ûÊ™ÄÊ®π) on the holy mountain, where he founded his holy city. At the time of his reign, Ungnyeo or Ungnye (ÏõÖÎÖÄ, ÁÜäÂ•≥)‚Äîwho was a she-bear‚Äîand a tiger were living in a cave near the holy city, praying earnestly that their wish to become part of mankind might be fulfilled. Ungnyeo patiently endured weariness and hunger, and after twenty-one days she was transformed into a beautiful woman, while the tiger ran away for it could not tolerate the effort. The woman Ungnyeo was overjoyed, and visiting the sandalwood city she prayed that she might become the mother of a child. Ungnye's wish was fulfilled, so that she became the queen and gave birth to a prince who was given the royal name of Dangun, the \\"Sandalwood King\\". Dangun reigned as the first human king of Korea, giving to his kingdom the name of Joseon, \\"Land of the Morning Calm\\". According to some scholars, the name Dangun is related to the Siberian Tengri (\\"Heaven\\"), while the bear is a symbol of the Big Dipper (Ursa Major). Later in the myth, Dangun becomes the Sansin, the \\"Mountain God\\" (metaphorically of civilising growth, prosperity). Types of Korean shamans Korean shamans may be classified into two categories: ‚ù∂ sess«îmu or tangol (ÎãπÍ≥®), people who are shamans and have the right to perform rites by family lineage; and ‚ù∑ kangshinmu, people who become shamans through an initiation ceremony. Hereditary shamans were historically concentrated in the southern part of the Korean peninsula, while initiated shamans were found throughout the entire peninsula but were peculiar to the northern half, the contiguous areas of China inhabited by Koreans, and the central regions along the Han River. =Kangshinmu‚Äîinitiated shamans= Shin Yunbok in the late Joseon (1805). Kangshinmu (Í∞ïÏã†Î¨¥; ÈôçÁ•ûÂ∑´) are historically found throughout Korea, but they are peculiar to the central and northern regions of the peninsula and the lands of modern-day China contiguous to the northern part of the peninsula. The essential characteristic of the kangshinmu is that they acquire their status by being \\"chosen\\" and possessed by a god. There are two subtypes of kangshinmu: ‚ë† General mudang and ‚ë° my«íngdu. A person becomes a kangshinmu undergoing a period of shinbyeong (Á•ûÁóÖ), \\"divine illness\\". The possession by the god is said to be accompanied by physical pain and psychosis. Believers assert that the \\"divine illness\\" may not be healed through medical treatments, but only through the full communion with the spirit. Mudang are shamans who are possessed by a god or a spirit, called a momju. They perform fortune telling using spiritual powers derived from their possession, and lead gut rituals involving song and dance. A sub-type of mudang is the s«ínmudang or posal, who are thought to have acquired power through spiritual experience, but are still not worthy of holding an orthodox gut. Many male shamans, baksu, belong to this category. My«íngdu differ from the general mudang in that they channel the spirit of a dead person, usually a young child related to the my«íngdu himself, rather than a god, and invite such spirits to take residence into shrines set up in their homes. My«íngdu are found primarily in the Honam region of Korea. =Seseummu‚Äîhereditary shamans= Seseummu (ÏÑ∏ÏäµÎ¨¥; ‰∏ñË•≤Â∑´), found in the area south of the Han River, receive their status as shamans by family bloodline. There are two subtypes of seseummu: ‚ë† Simbang and ‚ë° tangol. The simbang-type shamans are found only in Jeju Island, and combine features of the mudang and dan'gol types. Like the mudang, the simbang of Jeju are associated with a specific set of gods. But these gods do not inhabit the shaman's body but are externalized in the form of the mengdu, a set of sacred ritual implements in which the gods and spirits of dead shamans are embodied. The simbang's basic task is to understand the divine message conveyed by their mengdu and to use the mengdu to worship the gods. Tangol are a type of shaman found predominantly in the southernmost regions of the Korean peninsula, especially in Yeongnam (Gyeongsang) and Honam area (Jeolla). Each one of the tangol families of Honam had districts of influence (tangolpan) in which they had the exclusive right to perform gut rites. Rituals performed by tangol involve song and dance to entertain a god or goddess. Both the rights of succession and the ceremonies have been systematised, so that they now bear the characteristics of a religious institution. Unlike other types of Korean shamans, tangol do not receive a particular god as part of an initiation ceremony and may therefore work with a variety of gods. They do not keep shrines in their homes.

A satirical take on artificial intelligence and transhumanism, the book is set in the year 2048, when life is lived entirely online, nobody ever leaving the confines of their tiny apartments, supplies brought to them by automated delivery drones. In a notable coincidence, the story predicted a pandemic and global quarantine in 2020. The story takes place decades later in a dystopian society still under quarantine, populated by a generation of people who have never experienced the outside world. A screenplay based on the Upgrade story won Best Scif-Fi Screenplay at the Shriekfest film festival and won the Grand Prize of the Cinestory Screenwriting Awards.

The last Football League match had been played at the ground on 25 April 1992, with just 1,602 watching a 0‚Äì0 draw with Mansfield Town. Maidstone's demise also led to Dartford folding. The ground improvements made by Maidstone were sold to Dartford for around ¬£500,000, which pushed the club's debt too far. Watling Street was sold to pay off creditors, and immediately demolished, with the site used for housing. The site is now Cugley Road, Burman Close and Horsfield Close (which are named after Dartford players), and The Terraces. References Defunct football venues in England Dartford F.C.

Scale: 1:25 000. Publisher:Ordnance Survey ‚Äì Southampton B2 edition. Publishing Date:2009. The station currently operates as an inshore lifeboat station but was originally a station for an all-weather lifeboat, however this boat was withdrawn in 1931. The original station was established in 1825. The current lifeboat (2014) is the Atlantic 85 RNLB Random Harvest (ON 852)  Location  The station is located in the marina area of the town and is co-ordinated from HM Coastguards at Lee-on-Solent. Being an inshore station, the majority of the station's services are within two miles of the station, often to leisure boats or beach-goers who have got into difficulties. The station is, on average, called to service sixty times a year. The present boathouse and station facilities were constructed and opened in 2000 at a cost of ¬£299,775.  History  The National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck, the fore-runner of the RNLI, first opened a lifeboat station in Brighton in 1824. The lifeboat supplied to this inaugural service was kept in a cave close to the Chain Pier. This was the first time that a lifeboat had been housed in a cave in Britain and the service operated from here until 1837, following the construction of the great Madeira sea-wall and Madeira DriveA Guide to the Buildings of BRIGHTON.

The site was opposite the Bedford Hotel close to the West Pier. The station operated from this site until 1868 when it was once again moved to a new location on the beach close by. In 1886 further improvements and alterations to the seafront in Brighton including the re-location of the station following the erection of groynes on the beach. The new station was located on the Western Esplanade, between the two piers, inside two of the spacious arches that were being constructed as part of the seafront re-developments at this time. Arch No. 109 was used to house the RNLI‚Äôs lifeboat whilst 110 was used to store all the equipment. In arch No. 111 the town council operated their own lifeboat. The site was used continually until 1931 when the RNLI withdrew the all-weather boat from the town as a result of the nearby Shoreham being equipped with a new motor lifeboat. These arches are now occupied by Brighton Sailing Club but there is a, now unreadable plaque, on the wall between arches 109 & 110 records the Robert Raikes, the first RNLI lifeboat of 1867. This lifeboat replaced the three lifeboats which until 1867 had operated in the town. The lifeboat was named after Robert Raikes, the founder of the Sunday School movement, because this boats funding had come from a collection made by the towns Sunday School children who had collected ¬£580 towards its cost. On the back wall of one of the arches there still remains a large ring anchored into the masonry. This was used to pull the lifeboat back into the arch. = Inshore Lifeboat = Following the withdrawal of cover in 1931 the town had no lifeboats for 34 years until an Inshore lifeboat was sent to the town in 1965. This inflatable D-class boat was kept in an arch under the promenade to the east of the Palace Pier. The lifeboat was funded from donations made by the patrons of a public house in London called The Rising Sun. This lifeboat was withdrawn before the winter of 1974 and the station was closed in 1975. This closure was to be a temporary measure until work was completed on the new Brighton Marina where new lifeboat facilities were included in the plans. During 1977 the station remained open but was none operational and this time was spent on training the crew and staff ready for the station to become operational. In 1978 the station re-opened within the new marine development where a pontoon was provided for the RNLI at the cost of ¬£10,000. The stations inshore lifeboat was kept afloat, and did not become fully operational until 1979. The lifeboat now had a small shelter constructed alongside the pontoon which gave the new Atlantic 21 Lions International (B 539) some protection. Inside the shelter the lifeboat was housed on a slipway. In 1981 a more permanent boat house was constructed and a temporary shelter was installed on the nearby quayside to house the crew facilities. The station had the distinction of becoming the institute‚Äôs first floating lifeboat station. In 1997 the station was provided with a larger Atlantic 75 lifeboat called Thelma Glossop (B 737). The new lifeboat arrived on the station on 1 July of that year. = Improvements = In 1999 work began on the construction of new shore facilities for the station on the quayside within the marina. The work was completed in 2000 at a cost of ¬£299.775. In January 2014 the stations facilities were closed down and the station was moved to temporary accommodation a short distance away. The building (Picture in the Information Box) erected in 2000 was demolished as part of the ¬£235 million re-development and expansion of the Brighton marine. These plans include the building of a new station close to the old location. This new station will include enhanced facilities for the crew and a souvenir shop to help with the institutes fund raising activities Location Template Awards From the earliest days of lifeboat services at Brighton, numerous medals and other awards have been presented, including - * 1824 Silver Medal to Charles Watts for the rescue of three people * 1838 Silver Medal to Lieutenant E.

Growing divisions in the Scottish kirk between the Evangelicals and the Moderate Party resulted in attempt to expand psalmondy to include hymns the singing of other scriptural paraphrases. From the late seventeenth century Church music in the Church of Scotland consisted of the singing of psalms to a limited number of common tunes. Differences between the Evangelicals and the Moderate Party resulted in a movement to reform church music. Common practice was lining out, by which the precentor sang or read out each line and it was then repeated by the congregation. New practices were introduced and the repertory was expanded. In the second half of the eighteenth century these innovations became linked to a choir movement that included the setting up of schools to teach new tunes and singing in four parts. Published paraphrases of passages of the Bible were adopted in many parishes. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the bagpipes had replaced the harp as the most popular instrument in the Scottish Highlands. There is also evidence of adoption of the European-style fiddle. There were numerous publications of traditional tunes in the period, particularly when the oppression of secular music and dancing by the kirk began to ease, between about 1715 and 1725. In the late eighteenth century the music of the Highland bagpipes began a revival, particularly the ce√≤l m√≥r (the great music), which had developed for ceremonial purposes for the Gaelic aristocracy from the seventeenth century. The Italian style of classical music was probably first brought to Scotland by the cellist and composer Lorenzo Bocchi, who travelled to Scotland in the 1720s. By the mid-eighteenth century there were several Italians resident in Scotland, acting as composers and performers. By 1775 Edinburgh was a minor, but functioning European musical centre, with foreign and native resident composers and professional musicians. In the mid- eighteenth century a group of Scottish composers began to attempt to create their own musical tradition, creating the \\"Scots drawing room style\\". A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs helped make Scottish songs part of the European cannon of classical music, but this championing of Scottish music associated with Robert Burns may have prevented the establishment of a tradition of European concert music in Scotland, which faltered towards the end of the century. Church music Philip Doddridge, one of the English hymnodists that had a major impact on the development of Scottish church music in the eighteenth century In the eighteenth century there were growing divisions in the Scottish kirk between the Evangelicals and the Moderate Party.J. T. Koch, Celtic Culture: a Historical Encyclopedia, Volumes 1‚Äì5 (London: ABC-CLIO, 2006), , pp. 416‚Äì7. While Evangelicals emphasised the authority of the Bible and the traditions and historical documents of the kirk, the Moderates tended to stress intellectualism in theology, the established hierarchy of the kirk an attempted to raise the social status of the clergy.J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), , pp. 303‚Äì4. In music the evangelicals tended to believe only the Psalms of the 1650 Psalter should be used in the services in the church. In contrast the Moderates believed that Psalmody was in need of reform and expansion. This movement had its origins in the influence of English psalmondist and hymnodist Isaac Watts (1674‚Äì1748) and became an attempt to expand psalmondy in the Church of Scotland to include hymns the singing of other scriptural paraphrases.B. D. Spinks, A Communion Sunday in Scotland ca. 1780: Liturgies and Sermons (Scarecrow Press, 2009), , p. 28. From the late seventeenth century the common practice had been lining out, by which the precentor sang or read out each line and it was then repeated by the congregation. From the second quarter of the eighteenth century it was argued that this should be abandoned in favour of the practice of singing stanza by stanza. This necessitated the use of practice verses and the pioneering work was Thomas Bruce's The Common Tunes, or, Scotland's Church Musick Made Plane (1726), which contained seven practice verses. The 30 tunes in this book marked the beginning of a renewal movement in Scottish Psalmody. New practices were introduced and the repertory was expanded, including both neglected sixteenth-century settings and new ones.B. D. Spinks, A Communion Sunday in Scotland ca. 1780: Liturgies and Sermons (Scarecrow Press, 2009), , pp. 143‚Äì4. In the second half of the eighteenth century these innovations became linked to a choir movement that included the setting up of schools to teach new tunes and singing in four parts.B. D. Spinks, A Communion Sunday in Scotland ca. 1780: Liturgies and Sermons (Scarecrow Press, 2009), , p. 26. More tune books appeared and the repertory further expanded, although there were still fewer than in counterpart churches in England and the US. More congregations abandoned lining out. In the period 1742‚Äì45 a committee of the General Assembly worked on a series of paraphrases, borrowing from Watts, Philip Doddridge (1702‚Äì51) and other Scottish and English writers, which were published as Translations and Paraphrases, in verse, of several passages of Sacred Scripture (1725). These were never formally adopted, as the Moderates, then dominant in the church, thought they were too evangelical. A corrected version was licensed for private use in 1751 and some individual congregations petitioned successful for their use in public worship and they were revised again and published 1781. These were formally adopted by the assembly, but there was considerable resistance to their introduction in some parishes.B. D. Spinks, A Communion Sunday in Scotland ca. 1780: Liturgies and Sermons (Scarecrow Press, 2009), , p. 32. After the Glorious Revolution episcopalianism retrained supporters, but they were divided between the \\"non- jurors\\", not subscribing to the right of William III and Mary II, and later the Hanoverians, to be monarchs,J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), , pp. 252‚Äì3. and Qualified Chapels, where congregations, led by priests ordained by bishops of the Church of England or the Church of Ireland, were willing to pray for the Hanoverians.N. Yates, Eighteenth-Century Britain: Religion and Politics 1714‚Äì1815 (London: Pearson Education, 2008), , p. 49. Such chapels drew their congregations from English people living in Scotland and from Scottish Episcopalians who were not bound to the Jacobite cause and used the English Book of Common Prayer. They could worship openly and installed organs and hired musicians, following practice in English parish churches, singing in the liturgy as well as metrical psalms, while the non-jurors had to worship covertly and less elaborately. The two branches united in the 1790s after the death of the last Stuart heir in the main line and the repeal of the penal laws in 1792. The non-juring branch soon absorbed the musical and liturgical traditions of the qualified churches.R. M. Wilson, Anglican Chant and Chanting in England, Scotland, and America, 1660 to 1820 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996, , p. 192. Traditional music David Allan, 1780 In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the bagpipes had replaced the harp as the most popular instrument in the Highlands. There is also evidence of adoption of the European style fiddle in the Highlands with Martin Martin noting in his A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland (1703) that he knew of eighteen players in Lewis alone.J. Porter, \\"Introduction\\" in J. Porter, ed., Defining Strains: The Musical Life of Scots in the Seventeenth Century (Peter Lang, 2007), , p. 35. Well-known fiddlers included Pattie Birnie (c. 1635‚Äì1721),J. Porter, \\"Introduction\\" in J. Porter, ed., Defining Strains: The Musical Life of Scots in the Seventeenth Century (Peter Lang, 2007), , p. 22. and later Neil (1727‚Äì1807) and his son Nathaniel Gow (1763‚Äì1831), who, along with a large number of anonymous musicians, composed hundreds of fiddle tunes and variations.J. R. Baxter, \\"Culture, Enlightenment (1660‚Äì1843): music\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 140‚Äì1. Publications early in the century included Playford's Collection of original Scotch-tunes, (full of the highland humours) for the violin (1700), Margaret Sinkler's Music Book (1710), James Watson's Choice Collection of Comic and Serious Scots Poems both Ancient and Modern 1711. The oppression of secular music and dancing by the kirk began to ease between about 1715 and 1725 and the level of musical activity was reflected in a flood musical publications in broadsheets and compendiums of music such as the makar Allan Ramsay's verse compendium The Tea Table Miscellany (1723), William Thomson's Orpheus Caledonius: or, A collection of Scots songs (1733), James Oswald's The Caledonian Pocket Companion (1751), and David Herd's Ancient and modern Scottish songs, heroic ballads, etc.: collected from memory, tradition and ancient authors (1776). These were drawn on for the most influential collection, The Scots Musical Museum published in six volumes from 1787 to 1803 by James Johnson and Robert Burns, which also included new words by Burns. A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs collected by George Thomson and published between 1799 and 1818 included contributions from Burns and Walter Scott and contributed to the combining of Scottish traditional music with European classical forms.M. Gardiner,Modern Scottish Culture (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), , pp. 193‚Äì4. In the late eighteenth century, partly as a reaction to the social upheavals of the Agricultural revolution and Highland Clearances that were seen as destroying the traditions and culture of the Highlands, the music of the Highland bagpipes began a revival. The Highland Society of London, formed in 1778, put an emphasis on bagpiping, particularly the ce√≤l m√≥r (the great music), which had developed for ceremonial purposes for the Gaelic aristocracy from the seventeenth century. From 1781 the society organised ce√≤l m√≥r competitions that became the basis for later gatherings in Scotland.J. Dickson, \\"'Tullochgorm' transformed: a case study in revivalism and the highland bagpipe\\", in J. Dickson, ed., The Highland Bagpipe: Music, History, Tradition (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2013), . Classical music George Thomson by Henry Raeburn The Italian style of classical music was probably first brought to Scotland by the cellist and composer Lorenzo Bocchi, who travelled to Scotland in the 1720s, introducing the cello to the country and then developing settings for Lowland Scots songs. He possibly had a hand in the first Scottish Opera, the pastoral The Gentle Shepherd (1725), with libretto by Allan Ramsay (1686‚Äì1758).R. Cowgill and P. Holman, \\"Introduction: centres and peripheries\\", in R. Cowgill and P. Holman, eds, Music in the British Provinces, 1690‚Äì1914 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), , p. 4. The growth of a musical culture in the capital was marked by the incorporation of the Musical Society of Edinburgh in 1728 as the successor to the St. Cecilia's Society.E. G. Breslaw, Doctor Alexander Hamilton and Provincial America (Louisiana State University Press, 2008), , p. 41. By the mid-eighteenth century there were several Italians resident in Scotland, acting as composers and performers. These included Nicol√≤ Pasquali, Giusto Tenducci and Fransesco Barsanti.M. Gelbart, The Invention of \\"Folk Music\\" and \\"Art Music\\" (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), , p. 36. Scottish composers known to be active in this period include Alexander Munro (fl. c. 1732), James Foulis (1710‚Äì73) and Charles McLean (fl. c. 1737). Thomas Erskine, 6th Earl of Kellie (1732‚Äì81) was one of the most important British composers of his era, and the first Scot known to have produced a symphony.N. Wilson, Edinburgh (Lonely Planet, 3rd edn., 2004), , p. 33. The Edinburgh Musical Society was so successful in this period that it was able to build its own oval concert hall, St Cecilia's, in 1762. According to James Baxter, by 1775 Edinburgh was a minor, but functioning European musical centre, with foreign and native resident composers and professional musicians. In the mid-eighteenth century a group of Scottish composers began to respond to Allan Ramsey's call to \\"own and refine\\" their own musical tradition, creating what James Johnson has characterised as the \\"Scots drawing room style\\", taking primarily Lowland Scottish tunes and adding simple figured basslines and other features from Italian music that made them acceptable to a middle class audience. It gained momentum when major Scottish composers like James Oswald and William McGibbon (1690‚Äì1756) became involved around 1740. Oswald's Curious Collection of Scottish Songs (1740) was one of the first to include Gaelic tunes alongside Lowland ones, setting a fashion common by the middle of the century and helping to create a unified Scottish musical identity. However, with changing fashions there was a decline in the publication of collections of specifically Scottish collections of tunes, in favour of their incorporation into British collections.M. Gelbart, The Invention of \\"Folk Music\\" and \\"Art Music\\" (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), , p. 30. A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs helped make Scottish songs part of the European cannon of classical music,D. A. Low, ed., The Songs of Robert Burns (London: Routledge, 1993), , pp. 16‚Äì18. while Thompson's work brought elements of Romanticism, such as harmonies based on those of Beethoven, into Scottish classical music.M. Gardiner, Modern Scottish Culture (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), , pp. 195‚Äì6. However, J. A. Baxter has suggested that Burns' championing of Scottish music may have prevented the establishment of a tradition of European concert music in Scotland, which faltered towards the end of the century. The Edinburgh Musical Society gave its last concert in 1798 and was wound up in 1801, with its concert hall sold off to become a Baptist church.

The attack On 14 August 2013, shortly after the Egyptian security forces launched a violent crackdown and massacre on two protest camps in Cairo where hundreds of supporters of ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi were killed, more than fifty militants stormed the police station of Kerdasa killing 12 officers and 2 civilians. According to the criminal investigation reports, about 50 militants and Bedouins militants besieged the station for more than 5 hours, before some masked men shot at the complex with RPGs. The victims' bodies showed signs of torture that might have led to their deaths and others were mutilated. The attackers later moved to the town's only church, chased out the people praying inside, torched it and later painted \\"we will show you rage and we will make you see terrorism\\" on one of the building's charred walls. Aftermath On 19 September 2013, as a response to the attack, the Egyptian National Police stormed the village where they clashed with militants. Giza's deputy security chief, Major General Nabil Farrag, was killed during gunfire exchange between the police and the militants. The operation was aired on national television. A daytime curfew was announced during the raid while security officers were searching for the wanted. The police arrested 156 people.

Criticism  Selfie- enhancing and other photo editing apps have been criticized for encouraging users to catfish or pretend to be someone else on the internet, especially on social networking platforms. This motivation to seek \\"perfection\\" is also seen as undermining self and body confidence, particularly in younger users. The counter view is that selfie-enhancing apps help users optimize mobile portraits, rather than strive for inauthentic \\"plastic perfection\\". Bloggers such as James Charles generally endorse this view, steering users away from over smoothing the face, for instance, to encourage a natural look. The increased use of body and facial reshaping applications such as Snapchat and Facetune has been identified as a potential cause of body dysmorphia. Recently, a phenomenon referred to as \\"Snapchat dysmorphia\\" has been used to describe people who request surgery to look like the edited version of themselves as they appear through Snapchat Filters.

It is said to be accompanied by physical pain and psychosis. Believers would assert that the physical and mental symptoms are not subject to medical treatment, but may only be cured through acceptance of and full communion with the spirit. The illness is characterized by a loss of appetite, insomnia, visual and auditory hallucinations. A ritual called a naerim-gut cures this illness, which also serves to induct the new shaman-priest. Symptoms The symptoms of a shinbyeong differ, depending on the mu cultural background as well as her surrounding environment. For example, in the most basic, frequent type of shinbyeong, the initiate is afflicted with the characteristic symptoms without apparent cause. The mudang cannot eat and becomes weak physically and psychologically. In another type of shinbyeong, these basic symptoms are preceded by physical illness. In yet another, the shinbyeong is caused by a psychotic episode. In a type of shinbyeong that is relatively rare, the mu mental state becomes weakened through external shock. Another rarely occurring type of shinbyeong, called the \\"dream appearance type\\", the shinbyeong is triggered by a dream in which the mu sees a god, spirit, or unusual occurrence, accompanied by a revelation. The symptoms of the shinbyeong can last a surprisingly long time: an average of 8 years and as many as 30. Most mu have little appetite during their shinbyeong, some suffer from indigestion and partake only on a limited diet. The body of the mudang becomes weak and is subject to pain and cramping accompanied by bloody stool in some cases. Physical symptoms progress to include mental illness. The initiate has a generally restless mind and is said to experience dreams in which she communicates with gods or spirits. Eventually dreams and reality become blurred and the mudang suffers hallucinations. In some cases, the mental illness becomes so extreme that the mu leaves home and wanders through mountains and rice fields. The symptoms are said not to be susceptible to normal medical treatment and such treatment is believed to only exacerbate them. Rather, the symptoms are alleviated through the ritual of gangshinje, a type of gut in which the mu receives her god or spirit. In the fourth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), published by the American Psychiatric Association, shinbyeong, or shin-byung, is listed as an example of a culture-bound syndrome. Religious aspects In the tradition of Muism, the shinbyeong is considered a structured religious experience demonstrating the vertical connection between god and humanity and showing that \\"god in some form exists in human consciousness.\\" It is a form of revelation that causes the shaman to become one with god and, consequently, change his or her patterns of thought. The shinbyeong is dissociated from reality and enters a higher form of consciousness. See also * Mu (shaman) * Muism References Bibliography * Translated by Chang Soo-kyung.

Produced by Spartina Productions and CBS Television Studios, it is the second iteration of CBS' Late Show franchise. The program is taped at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City and airs live to tape in most U.S. markets weeknights at 11:35 p.m. ET/PT, as with its competitors Jimmy Kimmel Live! and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Colbert was announced as the new host in April 2014, after existing host David Letterman announced his intent to retire earlier in the month; Colbert had previously hosted Comedy Central's news satire The Colbert Report, a program where Colbert portrayed himself as a parody of conservative pundits. As such, the series has carried a stronger focus on discussing and satirizing current events, especially within U.S. politics. Some of Colbert's staff moved to The Late Show, along with Jon Stewart ‚Äî who previously hosted The Colbert Reports parent series The Daily Show ‚Äî serving as an executive producer. As of the conclusion of the 2019‚Äì20 season, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert has been the top late-night program in the United States for the past four seasons.

Background Prior to Colbert's assumption of hosting duties, David Letterman had been host of Late Show for 22 years, dating to his arrival at CBS in 1993. CBS had not had a regular late-night talk show for most of its existence before that point, with only one attempt (the short-lived Pat Sajak Show in 1989-90) between 1972 and Letterman's arrival. Letterman, who joined CBS from NBC after ending his eleven-year run as host of Late Night and losing out on being Johnny Carson's successor on The Tonight Show to Jay Leno, was initially competitive with his show's bitter rival, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno; Letterman's Late Show, however, slowly experienced a decline in ratings over the course of the 1990s and 2000s, dating back to an affiliation agreement between New World Communications and Fox that resulted in all nine CBS-affiliated stations it owned or recently acquired switching to Fox between September and December 1994, relegating the network to lower-rated former Fox affiliates and independent stations in many major cities. Stephen Colbert hosted his satirical news show, The Colbert Report, which won seven Primetime Emmy Awards on Comedy Central, from October 2005 to December 2014. According to TV by the Numbers, in February 2013, the live-plus-seven-day ratings for Letterman's Late Show averaged about 3.1 million per show for the 2012‚Äì13 season to date. A year later, average viewership was down to 2.8 million. Late Show also had the oldest audience among the various late-night talk shows, which may have led to CBS' decision to pick a younger replacement for Letterman to compete with The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live!. In addition, Colbert's previous program did well among college students and young men 18‚Äì34, which are prime target audiences for late-night comedy programming. On April 3, 2014, Letterman announced his retirement, with his final episode as host of Late Show scheduled for May 20, 2015. On April 10, 2014, CBS announced Stephen Colbert as Letterman's successor, signing him to a five-year agreement. In contrast with Colbert's previous program The Colbert Report, in which he played a fictionalized version of himself, Colbert hosts the show (which retains the Late Show branding, albeit with the article \\"The\\" formally inserted into the title) as himself. On April 23, 2014, the character version of Stephen Colbert appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart to announce that he had clearly \\"won television\\" and would be closing down The Colbert Report because he had met his goal. This came after the announcement the character would not be used after the end of The Colbert Report. The final episode of Report aired on December 18, 2014. Several states and municipalities attempted to coax CBS with tax credits and other incentives to move Late Show from its long-time home at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City, including Connecticut, Los Angeles, and New Orleans. On July 23, 2014, CBS CEO Les Moonves announced that the program would remain in New York City; CBS would be eligible for $11 million in tax credits over five years to produce the program there, and would also receive grants to fund renovations to the theater. Jon Batiste was announced as the bandleader on June 4, 2015, with his Stay Human band succeeding the CBS Orchestra (which returned to its previous identity as the World's Most Dangerous Band shortly thereafter) as the house band. =Promotion= In anticipation of the program's premiere, a new online presence was launched for The Late Show in June 2015, including new social media accounts, a podcast, mobile app, and a monologue-styled video focusing on the beard Colbert had grown since leaving The Colbert Report. Throughout the remainder of the summer, videos would continue to be released through the show's official YouTube channel and mobile app. On July 1, 2015, Colbert hosted a special edition of a public access program in Monroe, Michigan, interviewing Eminem. Production The Ed Sullivan Theater's marquee Colbert has been given near-full control of the show, with little interference from CBS management in regard to format. Colbert brought most of his staff from The Colbert Report with him to The Late Show, as well as outsiders such as Brian Stack, who is best known for his work on Conan O'Brien's programs, and Jon Stewart, former host of Colbert's previous sister program The Daily Show, who is credited as executive producer. Colbert no longer uses the character he had portrayed on The Colbert Report, jokingly remarking to Jeb Bush that \\"I used to play a narcissistic conservative pundit ‚Äì now I'm just a narcissist.\\" The Ed Sullivan Theater underwent a full restoration to its original 1927 splendor in a process that began following Letterman's final episode, including the uncovering of the theater's ceiling, stained-glass windows and a restoration of a chandelier, due to advances in technology that allow less sound and video equipment to cover up the auditorium's architectural details. The 1993 restoration project for Letterman was only done on a few months' notice after the theater was repurchased in February 1993 by CBS. On April 13, 2016, former CBS This Morning executive producer Chris Licht was named showrunner for The Late Show; CBS had shown concerns that, despite improved ratings in comparison to Letterman's tenure, Colbert had a weak online presence in comparison to The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and Colbert's lead-out The Late Late Show with James Corden (whose \\"Carpool Karaoke\\" segments have been popular as viral videos). The Hollywood Reporter believed that Licht's experience in news programming would be leveraged to complement Colbert's strengths in topical and news-oriented material. On October 17, 2019, Colbert and CBS announced that they had agreed to renew Colbert's contract, which has been set to expire in August 2020, until August 2023. On March 12, 2020, the show suspended production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning March 30, the show was produced from Colbert's home, billed as A Late Show with Stephen Colbert (or A Late Show with Stephen at Home). ViacomCBS announced that the show would return to the Ed Sullivan Theater on August 6 with in-studio episodes starting on August 10. Colbert presented the program from a smaller set within the building's office tower, built as a replica of his own personal office seen on A Late Show with Stephen Colbert. On August 4, 2020, the show's music producer Giovanni Cianci was fired following sexual misconduct allegations. Format Colbert originally started the show with a cold open and brief monologue before the opening sequence, which uses tilt‚Äìshift photography of day and night New York City scenes that make the city appear like a miniature model.\\"The Opening of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Is Amazzzziiinnngggg ,\\" The Outtake, Medium, accessed September 15, 2015; \\"Stephen Colbert's Late Show debut: the good, the bad, and the weird ,\\" Vox, accessed 14 September 15, 2015. Starting with the April 18, 2016, broadcast, the first under new showrunner Chris Licht, the format was modified to replace the cold open monologue with short sketches starring Colbert, his staff, and often featuring that night's guests, followed by the opening sequence and Colbert entering the stage. Until July 2016, Colbert performed his own voiceovers for the intro. The open is followed by an extended news satire style desk sequence with a run-through of recent headlines, in a manner reminiscent of television newscasts and that of The Colbert Report. Also, the show follows the same basic format as other late- night talk shows including the use of sketch comedy, guest interviews and musical performances. Colbert's guest list includes more political and government figures than his contemporaries; his first two weeks' guests included visits from Jeb Bush, Joe Biden, Ban Ki-moon, Stephen Breyer, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Donald Trump, and Ted Cruz. Thus far, Colbert has not had any of his staff act as a sidekick or straight man on the show. While Colbert dances and physically interacts with Jon Batiste while the band plays, they only occasionally engage in on-air banter, unlike David Letterman's relationship with Paul Shaffer or the relationship of other late night hosts with their announcers or bandleaders. After the first few episodes in which Colbert introduced himself,https://tvline.com/2015/09/08/stephen-colbert-late- show-premiere-moments-george-clooney-jeb-bush/ he started to use an off-screen announcer - from 2016 to 2019 writer Jen Spyra. Occasionally, Colbert has brought out producers of his show, or enlisted the help of audience members, who assume a sidekick-like role for single segments, engaging in light dialogue about a topic. The show has occasionally been broadcast live to provide coverage of the immediate aftermath of major political events, such as candidate debates and party conventions during election years, the State of the Union address, and in 2018, the mid-term elections. Episodes Colbert interviewing Secretary of State John Kerry =Notable episodes= In the show's series premiere, Colbert welcomed actor George Clooney and politician Jeb Bush, thanked former host David Letterman, and joined singer Mavis Staples and numerous other musicians for a rendition of Sly and the Family Stone's \\"Everyday People.\\" The episode nearly missed its broadcast due to technical difficulties. An early interview with Vice President Joe Biden received particular acclaim. Following the terrorist attacks in Paris that November, Colbert devoted his program to that city. A special football-themed episode aired as the lead-out program for Super Bowl 50 in 2016, featuring guests President Barack Obama (in a taped segment), Tina Fey, Margot Robbie, Will Ferrell, and Megyn Kelly. On June 22, 2016, CBS announced that The Late Show would broadcast two weeks of live episodes during the 2016 Republican and Democratic conventions. The first of these episodes, on July 18, 2016, opened with a musical number by Colbert that compared the Republican convention to being \\"Christmas in July\\", and featured sketches where Jon Stewart (revealed to have been living off-grid in a cabin) is told that Donald Trump had clinched the Republican nomination for the presidential election, Colbert's persona from The Colbert Report is revived and delivers an edition of The Word on \\"Trumpiness\\", and a filmed sketch touring the convention's venue as his The Hunger Games-inspired character Julius Flickerman. Stewart appeared once more the following Thursday, delivering a segment criticizing the Fox News Channel in the wake of the firing of its CEO Roger Ailes. Colbert's performances during these episodes were critically praised for their return to an emphasis on news-oriented comedy similar to The Colbert Report and The Daily Show. On November 8, 2016, Colbert presented a live, election night special for CBS's sister premium channel Showtime, Stephen Colbert's Live Election Night: Democracy's Series Finale: Who's Going to Clean Up This Shit? The special featured appearances by Laura Benanti (reprising her impersonation of Melania Trump), Jeff Goldblum, Mark Halperin, Elle King, John Heilemann, and Nick Offerman. Due to it being broadcast on a premium channel, the show was billed as being uncensored (which Colbert demonstrated during his monologue by swearing, and announcing Marco Rubio's Senate re-election result using a nearly-nude male model). Critics felt that the special had anticipated a Hillary Clinton victory, noting the increasingly \\"surreal\\" and \\"uncomfortable\\" atmosphere that ensued when Trump emerged as the front-runner. When Halperin informed Colbert that Trump was nearing the required 270 electoral votes, he remarked that he \\"[couldn't] put a happy face on it, and that's my job\\". Katy Perry was expected to make a pre-recorded appearance, but her segment was dropped due to the impending victory. During his interview, Jeff Goldblum also acknowledged the situation, and sang a verse from \\"It Goes Like It Goes\\". In his closing monologue, Colbert noted that before she died, his mother Lorna (who was born only days after the first presidential election where women had the right to vote nationally) remarked that‚Äîdespite having historically been a Republican‚Äîshe had wanted to vote for Hillary Clinton. He argued that people may have \\"overdosed\\" on the \\"poison\\" of politics, but acknowledged that \\"you can't laugh and be afraid at the same time, and the devil cannot stand mockery.\\" On May 1, 2017, Stephen Colbert's monologue was devoted to President Trump following his conduct in an interview with CBS's John Dickerson on Face the Nation. Describing Dickerson as a fellow \\"member of the CBS family\\", Colbert \\"read a laundry list of insults on-air to rapturous cheers from the crowd ... reeling off a series of scripted jokes and ending on, 'In fact, the only thing your mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin's cock holster.'\\" Colbert's language was considered to be crude and homophobic by some, and led to a short-lived #FireColbert hashtag on Twitter. Colbert later addressed the controversy on-air, admitting he had used \\"a few words that were cruder than they needed to be\\" but that he \\"would do [the monologue] again\\". On May 5, the Federal Communications Commission announced that it would go through a comprehensive investigation of Colbert's remarks, and concluded no action was to be taken against Colbert or The Late Show, reasoning in a public statement released on May 23 that there was \\"nothing actionable under the FCC's rules\\" as the offending statement had been properly censored. Reception =Ratings and viewership= The Late Show debuted to 8.26 million viewers (with Live+7) according to Nielsen Media Research, beating out all late-night competition. The show's highest ratings to date‚Äîand highest for the Late Show franchise‚Äîwere achieved by a live episode that ran after Super Bowl 50 in 2016, which averaged 21.1 million viewers. Despite this, the show's initial ratings trailed competitor The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, while remaining ahead of Jimmy Kimmel Live. While Colbert still managed more young viewers than Letterman in his first few months, analyst Bill Carter wrote that his \\"opening splash seemed to dry faster than expected.\\" He suggested this was due to little social media presence (where his competitor, Fallon, surged). After Chris Licht was brought on as showrunner, the show began to increasingly focus more extensively on politics and the 2016 U.S. presidential election, including several live episodes following the 2016 Republican National Convention. While the live episodes saw gains, The Tonight Show remained the top late-night program. Following the inauguration of Donald Trump as president in January 2017, The Late Show began to see major ratings gains, aided by the program's satire of the Trump administration. In the first full week after the inauguration, Colbert narrowly beat Fallon for the first time in average viewership since its premiere. By the end of April, The Late Show had been the top U.S. late-night program in terms of total viewership for sixteen consecutive weeks and was rated the number one late night show by viewership for the first quarter of 2017. The Late Show became the highest- rated late-night talk show for the September 2016 to May 2017 season, averaging more than 3.2 million nightly viewers. The show has since seen larger ratings gains; in the first quarter of 2018, the show saw 4.02 million DVR-adjusted viewers, which was a 20 percent leap over the same time frame a year before. In the 2018-19 television season, The Late Show was the highest- rated U.S. late-night talk show for a third consecutive season. In addition, for the first time in Colbert's tenure, and the first time in franchise history since the 1994‚Äì95 season, The Late Show narrowly beat The Tonight Show as the top late-night show among viewers in the key demographic of adults 18‚Äì49. =Reviews= The Late Show with Stephen Colbert has garnered mostly positive reviews. The Guardian Brian Moylan praised the show's humor: \\"This opener was by no means a perfect show, but there were enough really inventive jokes to make Colbert already seem like an innovator.\\" Robert Lloyd of Los Angeles Times deemed it a \\"strong start,\\" while Variety Brian Lowry felt it a \\"mostly terrific\\" debut, commenting, \\"Colbert looks like he has the skill set to settle in and make this job his own, night in and night out.\\" Many critics considered the show's more political segments as reminiscent of The Colbert Report. An early interview with Vice President Joe Biden also received praise: Robert Rorke of the New York Post commented that the review gave Biden \\"that essential sense of humanity that makes people believe in a candidate.\\" The show's post-Super Bowl episode in 2016 proved polarizing. \\"Sunday‚Äôs live episode felt mostly like a wasted opportunity ‚Äì one that probably won‚Äôt win many converts among those football fans sober enough to stick around,\\" said Brian Lowry at Variety. Daniel D'Addario of Time dubbed his performance \\"stiff and uncomfortable,\\" writing, \\"Colbert might have been better advised not to bother trying with football at all and just put forward a program of pure entertainment.\\" The Late Show has received positive reviews following the inauguration of Donald Trump as president. \\"Colbert may not be the sarcastic, irony-laden character he once played for Comedy Central, but as Trump has dominated the news every day since taking office, The Late Show has become the home for reasoned, but incisive, discussion, on the perceived overreaches of the White House,\\" said David Sims of The Atlantic. James Poniewozik of The New York Times commented, \\"Mr. Colbert's comedy hasn't become radically different, but it has been more frank and caustic ... The network-TV Mr. Colbert is more cheery than his cable character. But it‚Äôs as if the Trump administration had solved the problem of reconciling his new comedy with his old by making truthiness America's official language.\\" Broadcast In Canada, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert airs on Global, airing in simulcast with CBS in most regions.

It lies in the Burren region of the northwest of the county. Location It is located in the Barony of Burren, north of Corofin. The parish is and covers . The land is typical of the broken, rocky and hilly country of the Burren. In 1841 the population was 330 in 50 houses. Antiquities Cliff with the \\"Cave of the Wild Horses\\" Kilcorney parish was in existence by 1302. It was the smallest parish in the diocese of Kilfenora, ranking 21st out of 23 in the taxation list of 1302-6. Given that, the size of the parish church was surprisingly large and it also sported a chancel, not a standard feature in local parish churches. It may have benefitted from financial support by the O'Loghlen family, owners of Caherconnell cashel as well as the tower houses (castles) at Glensleade and Lissylisheen, all within 2 km of the church. The parish contains caves, a cromlech, and the ruins of an old castle. There is a cave in Kilcorney townland (Cave of the Wild Horses) that is the subject of several legends. One is that an enchanted horse came from this cave and propagated its breed throughout the country. Poulnabrone Dolmen is a portal tomb, dating back to the Neolithic period, and situated north-west of the village of Kilnaboy. Kilcorney Church lies south of the present day road. No information is extant about its founding. There are references to a St Coirn√©, but no saint of this name is known. The old church of Kilcorney was extremely dilapidated in 1897. Nearby there was the site of an older church dedicated to the same saint some way from the present ruin. In addition, around 350 m to the west of the old church there are the barely discernible ruins of an ancient ecclesiastical building known as Kilcolmanbara, dedicated to Saint Colman Bair√©, presumably the same as Saint Colman Mac Duach. It may have been in use in 1675 when a deed mentioned a tract of land named Cille Cholm√°in Bh√°ire but was certainly abandoned by 1839. There are several holy wells nearby, possibly associated with pilgrimage to the site. The holy well of Tobar na nAingeal (well of angels, eye cures) is near the church. Another holy well,Tobar Colman Bair√© (also eye cures), is in Glensleade townland, about 1.5 km north of Kilcolmanbara. Another is Tobar Inghine Bhaoith (cure for warts). Since coirneach means tonsured or tonsured person, the site may have been an early monastic establishment, which also gave its name to the parish. Thus Cill Coirneach would have been the \\"church of the monks\\". There are various ruined stone or earth forts. These include Carher-na-mweela in the townland of Poulgorm, Caher-an-ard-dorais, Glensleade, Lisnanroum, Liscolmanbara, Lissaniska in Eanty beg south and Lissananima in Eanty beg north. Liscolman cashel near the Kilcolmanbara church may have been named for Colman, too. The castle of Glensleade belonged to a member of the O‚ÄôLoghlen family in 1580. By 1897, it had been levelled to the ground. Caherconnell cashel is an early medieval, well-preserved ringfort, located in the townland of Caherconnell, on the R480 road to Ballyvaughan. Townlands Townlands are Ballymihil, Baur North, Baur South, Caherconnell, Eantybeg North, Eantybeg South, Eantymore, Faherlaghroe, Glensleade, Kilcorney, Kilcorney Glebe, Lisnanroum, Magheraweeleen, Poulanine, Poulbaun, Poulgorm, Poulnabrone and Poulnaskagh.

It first aired in August 1993 with host David Letterman, who previously hosted Late Night with David Letterman on NBC from 1982 to 1993. Letterman's iteration of the program ran until his retirement on May 20, 2015. Comedian Stephen Colbert, best known for his roles on Comedy Central programs The Daily Show and The Colbert Report, assumed hosting duties that September. The show originates from the Ed Sullivan Theater in the Theater District of Manhattan, New York, and airs live to tape in most U.S. markets at 11:35 p.m. Eastern and Pacific, 10:35 in the Central and Mountain time zones. History =Prior to the Late Show= CBS had previously attempted late-night talk shows with The Merv Griffin Show (1969‚Äì1972) and The Pat Sajak Show (1989‚Äì1990) but neither were able to compete with NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and were cancelled; Griffin's for editorial disputes with the network (he would go on to continue the show in syndication for 14 more years), and Sajak's for low ratings. For most of the 20 years preceding Late Show, CBS's late night fare consisted of movies, re-runs, imported Canadian dramas and specialty programming packaged under the titles CBS Late Night and Crimetime After Primetime and broadcast to middling ratings, competing against The Tonight Show and, in its last years, the upstart success of a syndicated series, The Arsenio Hall Show, which began airing in 1988. The Late Show Ed Sullivan Theater featuring Letterman marquee, which was removed on May 28, 2015 =David Letterman (1993‚Äì2015)= When David Letterman became available after being passed over by NBC for The Tonight Show, CBS was eager to lure him and offered him a three-year, $14 million per year contract, doubling his Late Night salary. According to their agreement, the show would spend a month in Hollywood at least once a year. CBS purchased the Ed Sullivan Theater for four million dollars, spending \\"several million more\\" for renovation. The renovation was supervised by architect James Polshek. CBS' total cost for acquiring the show‚Äîincluding renovations, negotiation right paid to NBC, signing Letterman, announcer Bill Wendell, band leader Paul Shaffer, and the rest of the band‚Äîwas over $140 million. When Letterman moved to CBS and began the Late Show, several of Late Nights long-running comedy bits made the move with him. Letterman renamed a few of his regular bits to avoid legal problems over trademark infringement (NBC cited that what he did on Late Night was \\"intellectual property\\" of the network, a contention he disputed). \\"Viewer Mail\\" on NBC became the \\"CBS Mailbag\\", and Larry \\"Bud\\" Melman began to use his real name, Calvert DeForest. Shaffer's \\"World's Most Dangerous Band\\" became \\"The CBS Orchestra\\", a jab at NBC regarding the show's new home, and a play on the NBC Orchestra of the long running The Tonight Show. Letterman's signature bit, the Top Ten List, was perfunctorily renamed the \\"Late Show Top Ten List\\" (over time it was simply referred to again by its original name). In ratings, Letterman's Late Show topped Leno's Tonight Show for its first two years. Leno pulled ahead on July 10, 1995, starting with a Hugh Grant interview, after Grant's much-publicized arrest for picking up an LA prostitute. Leno also benefited from the lead-in provided by NBC's popular Must See TV prime time programs of the mid-to-late 1990s. Likewise the CBS network was hurt by affiliation switches in late 1994 relating to Fox picking up CBS's National Football League rights (although CBS would reacquire those rights in 1998), stunting the Late Show just as it was beginning to gain traction. Despite CBS rising back to first place in prime time in the 2000s, Letterman never fully recovered from the damage, and he remained behind Leno and successor Jimmy Fallon for the rest of his tenure, only briefly rising back to first place during Conan O'Brien's run as host of The Tonight Show. Announcer Bill Wendell left in 1995, with Alan Kalter taking his place for the remainder of Letterman's run as host. On April 3, 2014, Letterman announced his retirement. His last telecast aired on May 20, 2015. =CBS Summer Showcase ‚Äì transition (May 21‚ÄìSeptember 7, 2015)= Instead of airing a transitional version of Late Show with guest hosts (as happened with The Late Late Show from January to March 2015 between the end of Craig Ferguson's show and the premiere of James Corden's) or reruns from Letterman's time as host (as NBC did during its interregnums on The Tonight Show and Late Night), CBS placed the Late Show on hiatus and instead aired reruns of scripted dramas in the 11:35 pm time slot over the summer with the branding CBS Summer Showcase. The network dismissed concerns that this may hurt the ratings of The Late Late Show with James Corden. The plan was similar to CBS's pre-Letterman use of the slot for Crimetime After Primetime when police procedurals and mysteries aired in the slot in the early-1990s, and the late 1980s CBS Late Night which featured a mixture of scripted programming. CBS inaugurated the summer format with reruns of the final season of The Mentalist, a cancelled prime time police procedural, airing nightly from May 21 until June 5, 2015. Hawaii Five-0 (June 8‚Äì12, July 27‚Äì31), CSI: Cyber (June 15‚Äì19, August 17‚Äì21), Elementary (June 22‚Äì26), Blue Bloods (June 29-July 5), The Good Wife (July 6‚Äì10, August 24‚Äì28), NCIS: Los Angeles (July 13‚Äì17), NCIS (July 20‚Äì24; September 7) Scorpion (August 3‚Äì7), NCIS: New Orleans (August 10‚Äì14) and Madam Secretary (August 31-September 4) also aired during the summer in the 11:35 pm time slot between the Letterman and Colbert transition. The Late Late Show poked fun at the initial choice for its summer lead-in during several June episodes with a cold open sketch titled \\"Talking Mentalist\\", a parody of Talking Dead in which Corden, his bandleader Reggie Watts, and one of the show's scheduled guests discussed the episode that had just ended. Colbert would follow suit with a running gag on his first Late Show episode, showing CBS Corporation CEO Leslie Moonves with a giant switch which he could use to switch the network back to reruns of The Mentalist if he was dissatisfied with Colbert's performance (which he did, briefly, twice during the show). =Stephen Colbert (2015‚Äìpresent)= Stephen Colbert succeeded Letterman as host on September 8, 2015, having been signed to a five-year contract. In contrast with Colbert's previous program, The Colbert Report, in which he played a fictional character also named Stephen Colbert, Colbert hosts the show (which retains the Late Show branding) as himself.Pergament, Alan (April 10, 2014).

Vincent was an American teenager who was murdered in September 1979. Her body was not identified until 2007, twenty-eight years after her death. It was previously believed she may have been a victim of the notorious Green River killings. However, Vincent's case has not been officially solved. NCIS cast member Pauley Perrette collaborated with the popular television show America's Most Wanted in 2009 to work on solving the case. Circumstances Vincent grew up on a farm. She was seventeen years old when she ran away from home and likely engaged in prostitution as a way to survive. She was native to Seattle, Washington. Vincent reportedly contacted her sister in summer 1979, explaining her wish to return home. This was the last time she was heard from. It is believed that she was murdered due to the fact that she was going to testify against an organized crime leader in court. The night prior to Vincent's murder, a teen matching her description was seen accompanying a white man. The two were purchasing an ice pick as well as acetone, which were likely the same items used to murder her. Murder Crime scene where Vincent's body was located The body was found on September 26, 1979 in Tiburon, California. Vincent was beaten, shot in the head, and stabbed 43 times; her remains were severely damaged after being set ablaze after acetone was poured on the body. Witnesses reported seeing a van speeding away from the scene. Upon the discovery of the remains on a beach, examiners could not identify the body, and could only determine her eye color, height, weight, gender, and dental characteristics. At the time of death, she wore a black shirt, beige pants decorated with blue and red, and high heels. Identification In efforts to identify Vincent, the body was exhumed in 2002 and was transported to Richmond, Virginia for further examination. The Center for Missing and Exploited Children created a composite image from her skull, which has been done on countless other unidentified decedents. Various other reconstructions have been created prior to the work done by the Center for Missing and Exploited Children. In 2007, DNA samples from Vincent's mother and sister were matched to the DNA of the remains. Because Vincent's head was severely burned, detectives were unable to collect hair samples; instead, hair from the pubic region was used to carry out the DNA test. She was cremated on August 7, 2007 and was laid to rest by her family later that month. Her ashes were flown from California to her family in Washington by detective Steve Nash, who had worked on the case since 1988.

Cracht at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He was one of the founding members of the Bentvueghels, an association of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists working in Rome. It was customary for the Bentvueghels to adopt an appealing nickname, the so-called 'bent name'. Cracht was given the bent name ‚ÄòBotterkull‚Äô or ‚ÄòBotterkul‚Äô, which may be a reference to the Dutch sweet called ‚ÄòBoterbal‚Äô (butter or cream ball).Biographical details on HadrianusOud Holland, Volumes 84-85, Gebr. Binger, 1969 His portrait appears on one of the sheets with portraits of Bentvueghels, which are now in the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam. Cracht is depicted with the following members of the Bentveughels: Joost from The Hague, Cornelis van Poelenburch, Wouter Crabeth II and Peter from Leiden. Cracht himself is referred to in the sheets as 'Tyman (Cracht) van den Emster alias Botterkull'. The expression 'van den Emster' indicates a person from the Dutch province of Drenthe. This is difficult to square with Cracht having been born in Wormer, in the province of Noord-Holland. Cracht did have a brother-in-low who lived in Wormer. Cracht was a close friend of David de Haen, another member of the Bentvueghels. In 1626 Cracht joined the fraternity of the Collegio Teutonico. Along with the painter Cornelis Schut he worked from 13 January 1627 for Giorgio Pescatori (aka Pieter de Vischere), an Italian banker and patron of Flemish origin and painted frescoes in his villa in Frascati, the so-called 'Casino Pescatore‚Äô. Cracht was in Rome until 1631, the year in which he traveled to The Hague, where he became a member of the local Guild of Saint Luke. He was head ('Hoofdman') of the Guild from 1634 to 1636 and in 1640. In 1636, Abraham van Beijeren was Cracht's pupil in The Hague. Cracht worked in 1638 at Huis Honselaarsdijk for stadtholder Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. In 1642, he was enrolled as a member of the militia ('Schutterij') of the Hague. On May 9, 1646 his estate was auctioned off in The Hague. Work Cracht was known for his landscapes and history paintings but he also painted portraits. He was influenced by Caravaggio.

It is similar to other Car-Free Days held around the world. It has traditionally taken place once per year on the third Sunday in June (Father's Day). In recent years it has expanded to events on both the Saturday and Sunday, in addition to an event in North Vancouver in August. The neighbourhoods involved often host smaller block parties in conjunction with a large street festival to celebrate. This day eliminates cars from the event sites along major streets and encourages people in these communities to interact with each other in the spirit of reducing carbon emissions. The larger street festivals include many non-profit organizations, artisans, artists, businesses, and food vendors. Some festivals also include live performances ranging from musical guests, to spoken word, to dance and more. The goals of these events are to remind people of their ecological impact on the city, to decrease dependence on personal vehicles as transportation within the city, to encourage active and alternative forms of transportation, and to help people see streets as public spaces for all.  History  Vancouver Car Free Day began with the Commercial Drive Festival in 2005. The Festival was the start of a community wide event known as Car Free Day Vancouver. It was run and organized completely by volunteers, consisting of 30 main organizers along with 300 more volunteers. In its first year of operation, over 25,000 people were in attendance to celebrate this community event. The idea was in response to the BC provincial government's Gateway Program, which aimed to significantly reduce congestion into the City of Vancouver. The first annual Car Free Vancouver Day took place in 2005, on Sunday June 19, and included different festivals taking place in Kitsilano, Commercial Drive, Main Street, and the West End.  Local involvement  There are now four neighbourhoods that regularly participate in Car Free Day: Kitsilano, Main Street, Commercial Drive and West End. There is a fifth event organized by the Car Free Vancouver Society in North Vancouver. Commercial Drive is the origin of Vancouver's Car Free Day, which first took place in 2005. The 2015 festival marked the 11th anniversary of Car Free Day on Commercial Drive. The #20 Downtown/Victoria Bus, which provides service along Commercial Drive, is rerouted from Commercial Drive around the festivities. The Main Street Car Free Day event is the largest of Vancouver's Car Free Day events. The event hosts a variety of entertainment including local artisans, musical performers, spoken word, and food vendors. The Main Street Car Free Day spans 21 blocks, from Broadway Avenue to 30th Avenue, creating car-free zones suitable for smaller block parties. Attendance at Vancouver's Car Free Day events has been increasing year-over-year and in 2015, attendance at all four sites totalled 400,000. The West End holds similar events to both the Commercial Drive and Main Street Car Free Days on the Saturday preceding these two events. This event allows for the festival to overtake a main street with performances, vendors and artisans. The community in Kitsilano takes a slightly different approach to the popular Vancouver Car Free Day. Instead of closing major streets to host the festival, the neighbours organize and host their own block parties. This gives people the chance to come together as a community and spend time interacting, playing games, and relaxing in an otherwise busy city. The activities at these block parties differ greatly since each event is entirely independent of the next, but popular choices include road hockey, music and dancing, and relaxing in chairs or on couches. In 2012 Kitsilano hosted a total of 16 block parties, followed by 13 in 2013. Kitsilano Car Free Day is supported by the Car Free Day Vancouver Society, Vancouver Foundation, and the City of Vancouver. The organizers and hosts of these block parties receive small grants given out by the Vancouver Foundation through their Neighbourhood Small Grants program.

Activities The society aims to raise awareness of and fund sceptical projects. During the 2014 World Homeopathy Awareness Week, the Good Thinking Society set up a website at homeopathyawarenessweek.org with the purpose of giving a factual scientific view on homeopathy. They also ran Psychic Awareness Month in October 2014 which included handing out leaflets to audience members before a psychic's shows in the UK. In April 2015 the organisation threatened legal action against the Liverpudlian Clinical Commissioning Group over its spending of ¬£30,000 per year on homeopathy, with Singh saying \\"Homeopathic treatments when paid for by the NHS are a waste of crucial resources\\". Thereafter, Singh and project director Michael Marshall called on all remaining homeopathy- funding CCGs in the UK to follow the example of Liverpool to reconsider their funding policies. Michael Marshall lecturing on GTS' homeopathy campaign at QED 2015. In June 2015, the Daily Mirror reported that Marshall had investigated the curious case of Freeman's, a NHS-supplying pharmacy that, amongst other products, sold \\"homeopathic owl\\", apparently meant for people with sleeping problems or who \\"pick up the characteristics of [an owl]\\". Marshall commented that \\"Around ¬£3-5 million is spent each year [on homeopathic products by the NHS] and it's completely worthless. People are being told that it works when there's no evidence that it does.\\" In May 2015, GTS obtained video footage from the Spirit of Health Congress, where, according to Marshall, claims were made about health that 'appeared illegal and could cause serious harm': \\"The dangerous misinformation at the Spirit of Health event is shocking, particularly with regard to serious conditions such as cancer.\\" In September 2015, Marshall showed how American televangelist and self-proclaimed prophet and faith healer Peter Popoff ‚Äìpreviously exposed by James Randi‚Äì was trying to persuade people to send him money on promises of \\"fabulous extreme fortune\\" and \\"miracles\\". Moreover, at a recent London gathering, GTS filmed how Popoff supposedly 'healed' a woman 'who said her body was wracked with pain', but who Marshall and his colleague believed could have been planted in the audience as part of Popoff's team: they saw she was handing out pens and a questionnaire at the start of the event, and quietly left the room soon after the alleged miracle. In November 2015, following a threat of legal action by the Good Thinking Society, the British government stated that the Department of Health would hold a consultation in 2016 regarding whether homeopathic treatments should be added to the NHS treatments blacklist (officially, Schedule 1 of the National Health Service (General Medical Services Contracts) (Prescription of Drugs etc.) Regulations 2004), that specifies a blacklist of medicines not to be prescribed under the NHS. In November 2017, the British Homeopathic Association (BHA) filed suit to overturn NHS England's 2017 guidance which advises GP's not to prescribe homeopathic remedies. In June, 2018, BHA lost that case, in a decision characterized by Edzard Ernst as the result of \\"4 years of excellent work by the GOOD THINKING SOCIETY\\". In June 2019, the Good Thinking Society filed a Judicial Review claim to challenge an earlier decision by the Professional Standards Authority to re-accredit the Society of Homeopaths' register. At the time of filing several (GTS alleges it to be over 50) Society of Homeopaths members were still offering CEASE therapy for autism. In October 2019 the High Court gave permission for the judicial review to proceed.. The Good Thinking Society also promotes mathematics education, through projects like \\"Who wants to be a mathematician?\\", \\"Top, top set maths\\", and the \\"Parallel Project\\". In March 2020 the Good Thinking Society announced their collaboration with Richard Wiseman to set up The Good Magic Awards. These awards recognize and reward performers that use magic tricks to improve the lives of people like disatvantaged groups, charities, community groups, hospital patients and others struggling with physical and psychological challenges. These awards were announced on March 17, 2020 and were awarded the first time on May 5, 2020. Awards The society runs a number of awards including the Golden Duck award, given for a 'lifetime achievement of quackery', awarded to Andrew Wakefield in 2012. The society also awarded a joint Science Blog Prize to Suzi Gage and David Colquhoun in 2012; Ben Goldacre and science writer Mark Henderson were among the judges, choosing from over 100 entries.

Causality is one of the key concepts employed in the sciences. In our attempt to understand and influence the world around us, one of the main things we need to know is what causes what. Once we understand the causal connections, we are in a position to explain what has gone before, predict what will come in the future, and intervene to produce the outcomes we require. While scientists deal with the concrete details, it is philosophers who consider in the abstract what it is for one thing to cause another. The aim of this project is to bring together that abstract philosophical approach to causation with a more concrete understanding of the work actually undertaken by the practitioners of the sciences. CauSci is based on a dispositional theory of causation, in which a cause is understood as event that disposes towards an effect or outcome. A further key theme for causation comes from that this theory, namely Reductionism versus holism in the sciences. Many philosophers have been attracted to a reductive view of nature in which everything is to be explained ultimately in terms of subatomic particles. But is there any evidence for the success of reductionism in the sciences or is the view a mere philosophers‚Äô fancy? It appears, on the contrary, that many sciences are premised on holistic phenomena that cannot be reduced to the sum of their parts: at certain levels of nature, new causal powers emerge that cannot be explained at relatively lower levels. Nature is stratified. The project aims to test the existing dispositional theory of causation against four key sciences in which the issues of causation, emergentism and reduction are central: physics, biology, psychology and the social sciences. While the theory aims to offer new insights that explain practice within these sciences, the theory in return will gain a more empirically informed grounding. A team of Norwegian and international researchers in these four fields have been recruited as collaborators to the project.  Methodology  The methodological basis of the project is that philosophy should not dictate to science and nor should science dictate to philosophy. While these two disciplines have the same subject matter - understanding the world - they aim to answer very different questions. What can be achieved, however, is a reflective equilibrium: a unified view of causation that is both philosophically and empirically satisfactory. It is all well and good for philosophers to decide a priori what would make a good theory of causation, but what use is that if scientists are dealing with something else? By considering both the abstract and the concrete together in unison, an account can emerge that is both philosophically and empirically adequate and complete. Four central sciences have been selected against which to test and improve the causal dispositionalist hypothesis. The approach will be to apply the theory to some of the key problems within that science. It will be taken as a sign of success for the theory if it is able to solve those problems or at the very least offer some illumination of them. The sciences are selected on the basis of their centrality but also their diversity. Theories of causation are sometimes criticised on the basis that they explain only causation in physics, for instance, but with no indication of how they could apply to biological, social or mental causation. The four sciences selected therefore cover some of the most important divisions across human thinking: matter, life, mind and society.  Notes   References  * Born, M., 1949.

It was first published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in 1982, and later republished in the 1989 collection Crystal Express. \\"Swarm\\" was nominated for the Nebula, Hugo and Locus Awards. Plot summary The Shaper Captain-Doctor Simon Afriel, a passenger in an Investor ship, arrives at an asteroid in another solar system to study a colony of a non- intelligent species known as the Swarm. Their society has an insect-like hierarchy with a queen and different castes, and also hosts some degenerated alien species known with a common name as symbiotes which live as parasites or in commensal relationships with the others. Afriel plans to stay for two years and study it, together with another Shaper called Galina Mirny who was already there. Their intentions are partly to prevent the Mechanists from benefiting from it, and partly to find a way to use the hive pheromones to control and manipulate the species, so they can establish a colony in their own solar system and make them work for them. Once on-board the hive seems to take no notice of the visitors. But when they start to experimenting with artificial pheromones and create a chemical imbalance it triggers the colony's instinctive mechanisms, who recognize it as a sign of the presence of intelligence. The queen lays an egg that develops into a new form which is vigorously protected during development. Once fully developed it is revealed to be a new caste with superior intelligence and a well developed genetic memory derived from multiple species. It reveals that all other castes have only sufficient intelligence to perform their assigned roles, the new form, that refers to itself as Swarm for the lack of a better name, is another reflection of the nest, a specialized form that serves the nest in its assigned role. Swarm acts as part of the superorganism's immune system, and sees unbound intelligence as self-destructive and its presence as a threat to the survival of the colony in the long run. It reveals that humans are not the first race who have invaded the place. Fifteen other intelligent species have done so on precedent occasions and become symbiotes, new members of the colony. When it happens, the representatives of the species that are present are assimilated and become a part of the alien society's genetic collective. Using the same principles as the creation of antibodies through a vaccine, the added genetic material gives birth to numerous superior and loyal individuals of the assimilated race, who will attack and deal with the \\"infection\\" the next time their previous kinship arrives and tries to invade Swarm. The symbiotes will then gradually degenerate over the following generations, becoming less and less intelligent until their intellect disappear completely and they become nothing more than genetic memories of their ancestors with no other purpose in existence than survival itself, like DNA remnants from microbes once that invaded a specie's genome. And they will be the only surviving descendants of their race according to Swarm, because racial immortality is only possible without intelligence. Based on Swarm's experiences, a race \\"infected\\" with intelligence only lasts for a few thousand years, and is then never heard from again:The Good New Stuff: Adventure in SF in the Grand Tradition  References  Short stories by Bruce Sterling 1982 short stories ","title":"Swarm (novelette)"},{"id":"42457549","text":"Manx Ark Project is a project to provide sanctuary for rare animal breeds (sheep, cattle, pigs and goats) at a number of farm sites in the Isle of Man.Isle of Man in rare breeds 'Noah's Ark' plan 1 May 2013 by Ariane Barua BBC NewsBeasts on the Isle of Man, A modern-day ark for animals of yesteryear September 2013, Wired page 72 References External links *The Manx Ark Project website Nature conservation in the Isle of Man Agriculture in the Isle of Man ","title":"Manx Ark Project"},{"id":"42457560","text":"Citrus garrawayi, the Mount White lime, is a tree native to the Cape York region of northern Queensland in Australia.

Since salt was an essential and irreplaceable commodity used in everyday life, and therefore was viable as a stable source of government revenue, various historical rulers employed a salt monopoly which forbade the production and sales of salt by commoners. The practice of monopolizing salt began during the rule of Emperor Wu of Han, and during the Tang dynasty, income obtained from salt taxes by the salt commission accounted for greater than half the government revenue; during the Yuan dynasty, this figure reached 80%.Ë∑®Âå∫ÂüüÁî®ÁõêÁäØ‰∫Ü‰ªÄ‰πà\\"ÁΩ™\\"Ôºü, NetEase With the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the practice of state monopolization of salt persisted; the salt tax continued to form a significant proportion of government revenue, representing 5.49% of the total national tax in 1950, however with a shift in economic development, this has diminished to 0.04% in 2006. Founded in February 1950 and formerly known as the China National Salt Industry Company (), China Salt controls a nationwide government monopoly over the salt industry in China. In 2003, administration of the government-controlled enterprise was shifted and placed under the management of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council of the People's Republic of China. A law titled \\"Regulation on the Management of the Salt Industry\\" () dictates that salt cannot be sold across different regions, and that private citizens are forbidden from selling their own manufactured salt, meaning that the management of salt is controlled by the state.2014-04-01, ÁôæÊó†‰∏ÄÁî®ÁöÑÁõê‰∏ö‰∏ìËê•, NetEase In 2011, table salt production in China reached 81.98 million tons, making it the largest salt producing country in the world, and a significant increase over 18 million tons produced in 1987, and 40 million tons in 2000. This increase was in part due to development of salt manufacture from mineral and lake sources. However, despite high production figures, salt prices remain expensive in China as a result of the salt monopoly; whilst average salt consumption as a percentage of personal income in the United States, France and Australia are 0.06%, 0.04% and 0.04% respectively, this value is 0.12% in China. Management The pricing of salt is set uniformly at a national level by China Salt, which centrally makes all decisions regarding market pricing.2009-06-23, ‰∏≠ÂõΩÁõê‰∏öÊÄªÂÖ¨Âè∏Áß∞ËøëÊúüÈ£üÁõê‰∏çÊ∂®‰ª∑, Sina.com All legally manufactured table salt is branded as \\"China Salt\\" before shipments are transported and sold on the retail market. Salt producers have no decision making powers in regards to sales and production, and only follow the directive of China Salt. As a result, there is no market competition amongst salt producers and a significant lack in product diversity. China Salt serves as both the operating company and the entity responsible for formulating administrative policy, having complete control over salt production standards. Iodine deficiency is a recognized problem in the western, southern, and eastern regions of the country, which historically did not derive their salt from ocean water. China Salt is responsible for the iodization of edible table salt in China, where legal salt producers manufacture iodized salt in accordance with the requirements of China Salt. Since the monopoly is the sole provider of iodized salt, consumers have no choice over how much iodine they consume, which has led to health problems relating to iodine overdose; there have been noted increases in reported cases of thyroid cancer in China during 2013. As of 2014, table salt on the Chinese market contains approximately 20‚Äì50 mg of iodine per kilogram. Contemporary issues There have been numerous calls for the salt monopoly to be broken up and privatized. It is argued that a salt monopoly can no longer be justified, as the basis for its existence to protect national economic interests no longer exist, and that it harms consumers. On 8 March 2013, Taobao was forced to remove all listings of salt from its online marketplace, since it violated the law forbidding sale of salt across regions.2013-03-07, ÁΩëË¥≠Âπ≥Âè∞Âè´ÂÅúÈ£üÁî®ÁõêÈîÄÂîÆ ÊâìÂ£∞ÊãõÂëº‰ªçËÉΩ‰π∞Âà∞Ôºü, Xinhua News Agency Private businesses that violate salt regulations are fined and have their salt products seized.2013-10-21, Salt suppliers struggle as Chinese gov't monopoly profits , Want China Times One such case occurred in Chongqing in 2013, where 90 tons of illegally manufactured industrial salt intended for sale as edible salt in Hubei, Sichuan, Shanxi, Shandong and Henan was confiscated by authorities, with a total street market value of 4 million yuan.2013-03-28, Ëá™È£üÁõê‰∏ìËê•‰ª•Êù•ÁßÅÁõêÊ°àÂ±°Á¶Å‰∏çÊ≠¢ÔºöÈ£üÁõê‰π∞ÂçñÂà©Ê∂¶Â∑®Â§ß , People's Daily Because China Salt controls the country's salt mines and wet salt farms whilst selling at expensive prices, various companies manufacturing food products such as soy sauce and food seasonings have resorted to the illegal use of industrial salt created by artificial manufacture in efforts to reduce costs, at the risk of being caught and fined.

He went to Haiti in 1952 on a research trip as part of his medical studies, and during that visit decided to locate the clinic in the Artibonite Valley; he was granted land that was formerly a banana plantation by then president of Haiti, Paul Magloire. He and his wife Gwen Grant Mellon opened a hospital they named H√¥pital Albert Schweitzer in Deschapelles, Haiti in 1956. When it opened, the facility had two operating rooms, a laboratory, X-ray facilities, a pharmacy, and had its own water system, electric power, machine and vehicle shops, laundry and food services. Services By 1970, the facility had grown from 80 to 120 beds and provided annually about 60,000 outpatient visits, 3500 admissions and 2500 operations. By 2010, the facility in Haiti had expanded to include 12 health clinics that were staffed by Haitian volunteers; they offered and preventive and community education and focused on women's health and HIV treatment and prevention. At the time the hospital performed about 2,000 surgical procedures each year and served about 60,000 people as outpatients, and about 100,000 people were treated each year at the satellite clinics. In 2015 it spent about $6 million on hospital operations and about $400,000 on the clinics.

Age of Panic had theatrical showings in North America as part of the Rendez-vous with French Cinema series 2014 program (first screening on 7 March). Critical response Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 100%, based on 5 reviews, with an average score of 7.1/10. Jordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter said of it: \\"With several scenes filmed on location during the actual Election Day events, Age of Panic mixes documentary-style drama with scenes of Mumblecore-esque comedy in ways that are often compelling and occasionally quite funny. Triet definitely has a knack for creating uncomfortable situations that go from bad to awful, only to suddenly lighten up in the interim, and although she can't quite sustain things for feature length, the film's smart setup and ambitious shooting tactics make for a highly watchable affair.\\" Ronnie Scheib of Variety commented that \\"Triet brilliantly orchestrates the intersection of documentary and fiction. [...] [T]he spontaneous ebb and flow of the enormous French crowds seen here synchs visually and rhythmically with the film's domestic Sturm und Drang, acted throughout with improvisatory immediacy. Although Drosch's Laetitia acts out the precarious pressures of the harassed career mom with considerable brio, it is Macaigne's Vincent, almost psychotically internalizing the panic of his thirtysomething generation, that lingers in the mind; indeed, the downbeat, dirty-haired Macaigne seems to be emerging as French indie cinema's newest neurotic loser par excellence.\\" Kent Turner of Film-Forward said that \\"[n]o caffeine is necessary before watching Justine Triet's The Age of Panic, with its anxiety-producing first hour [...] There's not a chance that anyone will nod off. The film singly breaks the festival out of any art-house stupor. The IFC Center called it an \\"enormously promising first feature, a very funny comedy of discomfort infused with documentary- style energy [...] all within the frame of one manic day in Paris.\\" Accolades The Age of Panic won the audience prize at the Paris Cinema International Film Festival in July 2013. It was nominated for the Best First Feature Film at the 2014 C√©sar Awards.

Origins Simon Ortiz's 1981 essay \\"Towards a National Indian Literature: Cultural Authenticity in Nationalism\\" is generally held to be the most significant precursor of the movement. Definition American Indian literary nationalists hold that American Indian literature is best studied through the lens of American Indian cultural and philosophical traditions. When the earliest works now categorized as nationalist were first published, this \\"grounded\\" approach ran counter both to the ethnologically inflected literary criticism of the 1970s and early 1980s, and also to the postmodern critical methods that had largely succeeded these in the 1990s. The nationalists saw the first of these approaches as an attempt to keep Native cultures primarily as the object of Anglo-American study, while the second relied heavily on Eurowestern models and thus again served to deprive Native peoples of a legitimate voice. Nationalist criticism, by contrast, would keep crucial political issues such as tribal sovereignty at the forefront. Rather than being another ethnic literature within the American canon, American Indian literatures should be seen as the product of separate nations, and studied as such. Key works Robert Allen Warrior's book Tribal Secrets: Recovering American Indian Traditions was the first full-length work of nationalist criticism. In it, he discusses the Osage novelist John Joseph Mathews and the Standing Rock Sioux philosopher Vine Deloria, Jr., placing both in a specifically American Indian intellectual context. This book was followed by Jace Weaver's That the People May Live, which proposes an ethic of \\"communitism\\" as a key way to understand tribal literatures. Finally, Craig Womack's Red on Red: Native American Literary Separatism completed the emergence of the three key thinkers of the movement. Womack's book was the first full-length monograph to concentrate on the literary output of a single tribal nation, leading some to label it \\"tribalcentric\\".Elvira Pulitano, Toward a Native American Critical Theory (Lincoln: Nebraska UP, 2003) p. 13 After the publication of Elvira Pulitano's Toward a Native American Critical Theory in 2003, which made multiple statements about the work of Warrior and Womack that all three major nationalists held to be inaccurate, Weaver, Warrior and Womack collaborated (along with Abenaki scholar Lisa Brooks) on American Indian Literary Nationalism, probably the clearest positional statement of the nationalist cause.

The Lower School encompasses grades Pre-K through 2, the Middle School is grades 3 through 5, and the Upper School is made up of grades 6, 7 and 8. Students are taught in a manner that balances STEM education with studies in the Classics. It is a part of the Virginia Association of Independent Schools. History The school was established in 1962 by Jane Goll. Mrs. Goll grew up wanting to be a teacher after being instructed in a traditional, classical education in New York City. Her own educational background was combined with her experiences traveling throughout Europe with her husband to form an idea of how she would want to teach students. After being dissatisfied with her work in both public and private schools in the United States she decided to found her own school. In 1962, Mrs. Goll opened a private Kindergarten class in St. Albans Episcopal Church in Annandale, Virginia. Throughout the early years, her school grew and soon she decided to give her school a new name. Her school kept expanding and a new building and wings were created between 1970 and 2003. Mrs. Goll died on September 5, 1992 and her position of Headmaster was passed on to Ellis Glover. Campus Academic classrooms at Westminster School include innovative technology such as smart boards, and are furnished with \\"executive style\\" or \\"tablet-arm\\" student desks. The 3rd, 4th and 5th grade academic classrooms are grouped together along a single corridor, and joins with a 6th, 7th and 8th grade corridors. These corridors along with the central hallway, which also houses 7th and 8th classrooms, form a central courtyard with a garden at the heart of the old school building. This central courtyard was constructed in the style of a classical atrium. The central hallway of the school building features \\"Shakespeare Windows,\\" or mounted wooden cabinet windows that use the stained-glass overlay method. The creation of the windows was a joint effort between Tourne and Peter Shipman. For over five years, the graduating eighth grade class has raised money in order to have a window created and donated to the school. The subject of the artwork was determined by the Shakespeare play that class performed in the seventh grade. The new section of the school includes the music studio, art studio, gymnasium and library. The spacious and well-lit gym allows for daily physical education classes. While most of the school is located on one floor, a wheelchair lift provides access to the gymnasium. The art studio is decorated with class art projects cultivated over the nine-year program. The music studio also includes space for private lessons. The windows of the library overlook wooded view and provide natural sunlight for students to browse and check-out the more than 25,000 books and audio-visual materials that the school has acquired. Inside the library is an additional resource center. Highlights of the school include a theater, playground, and recreational field. The theater is used for school productions that instruct students in presentation and technical aspects of the theater, as well as foster creativity in costume and set design. The playground includes climbing structures, social stations, slides, swings, junior-sized basketball court, and plenty of running room. Academics Students are taught a number of core subjects including language arts, mathematics, science and social studies. At different times throughout their time at Westminster, students also take courses on technology and geography. It is mandatory for students to participate in physical education, visual art, music and theater classes. Throughout all grades, pre-K through 8th, students learn the French language and in their last two years at Westminster they are enrolled in a Latin course. The school also emphasizes personal presentation and etiquette. Extracurriculars Westminster School maintains a theater program with all students at all grade levels performing in a play or musical each year. In 1981, students from the Middle School entered into a Folger Shakespeare Theater competition, affiliated with the Folger Shakespeare Library. This has led to an annual production of a Shakespeare play by the seventh grade class. Students in the Middle and Upper Schools compete in athletic competitions with other independent schools in the Northern Virginia Region. Westminster is a part of the Capital Athletic Conference, with other institutions such as Congressional Schools of Virginia, Green Acres School, Immanuel Christian School, The Langley School, National Presbyterian School, Norwood School, St. Patrick's Episcopal School, and Woods Academy. Community service is also an important extra-curricular activity for the students at Westminster. They have formed a \\"Builder's Club\\" that has volunteered throughout the school's neighborhood, and at organizations such as The Center for Multicultural Human Services. Westminster's Builders Club is sponsored by the Kiwanis organization of Fairfax. Additionally, the school sponsors a variety of clubs including Chess Club, French Club, Odyssey of the Mind, Mathcounts, and Science Olympiad. The Griffin Academy Westminster School is affiliated with The Griffin Academy.

It is distinguished from related species by large genital papilla on the males, large raised postorbital ridges, a laterally compressed carapace, and elongated chelae. Etymology The specific name is derived from Latin lacus, referring to the coastal lakes that the species is found in. Before it was formally described it was known by the common name \\"lake yabby\\". Discovery Specimens of Gramastacus lacus were first discovered in the Ramsar wetlands of Myall Lakes National Park. More specimens were collected as part of the Australian Crayfish Project, starting in 2005. Description The species reaches a maximum weight of and a length of . The vast majority of specimens are smaller, with the average weight being around to . The rostum is long and narrow with a spine at the apex. The abdomen is smooth and unarmored, and thinly covered in stiff setae. The tailfan is U-shaped. The first cheliped is smooth and distinctly longer than the other legs. The species is sexually dimorphic, with males having significantly larger chelae than females while females have broader abdomens. Coloration varies among populations. The dorsal parts of the thorax and abdomen will often be light brown, green, tan, or steel blue and patterned with red or cream-colored spots. The cephalon is usually black or brown on the dorsal surface, with lighter toned blue highlights on the lateral edges. The body's ventral surface is cream-colored or transparent. The first chelae are black to dark blue, with bright blue coloration along the edges and red joints. Juveniles are uniformly light blue in color. Range and habitat Gramastacus lacus is found in a number of geographically isolated populations along the Central and Mid North Coast of New South Wales, Australia. It is native to coastal lowlands from Wamberal Lagoon to Wamberal Lagoon, usually to above sea level. Populations typically occur in ephemeral wetlands such as small creeks and swamps, in depths no greater than . Population density varies between 1 and 35 individuals per square meter depending on the environment. Behavior Unlike its relative the western swamp crayfish (Gramastacus insolitus), the eastern swamp crayfish excavates burrows to survive during the dry season, when the water bodies it inhabits dry up. Burrows are typically between and deep, although some have been observed as deep as . Sometimes burrows will have a round chamber at the end or be capped with mud. Occasionally a juvenile will be found sharing a burrow with an adult. Gramastacus lacus often hides in the thick reeds and grass along the shore to avoid predators such as speckled longfin eels, gudgeons, giant water bugs, eastern long-necked turtles, and Australian water dragons, as well numerous species of birds. The only individuals to seek out deeper water are recently moulted ones, likely in an attempt to avoid being cannibalized. The crayfish will use its enlarged claws for defense while in the water, but when on land will usually elect to scuttle backward rapidly instead. Reproduction The eastern swamp crayfish is an opportunistic breeder, breeding whenever the vernal pools they inhabit are flooded, usually beginning in early August. Females lay 30-150 eggs of a dark olive green or dark purple color. The eggs will hatch after 6‚Äì8 weeks, usually in late October. Conservation threats The eastern swamp crayfish is found in parts of Australia's fastest developing areas, leading to their habitat being potentially threatened as swamps and wetlands are drained to make way for agriculture, industry, housing developments, and golf courses. The species is also threatened by the invasive common yabby (Cherax destructor), which has been introduced into G. lacus's habitats in the Wamberal Lagoon.

K√∂nigsberg's first marzipan production was established by the Pomatti brothers in 1809, who became confectioners of the Royal Prussian Court.

K√∂nigsberg marzipan is known for its flamed surface, which results in a golden-brown finish. It contains rose water and is often filled with jam.

Career  She was the Pastoral Associate at St. Mark Catholic Church in Wheaton, Illinois. She went on to found Bethlehem Center, which is now called the Northern Illinois Food Bank. Through her experience with the St. Mark's Food Pantry, she witnessed the devastating effects of both spiritual and material poverty. Too many children were going to bed and suffered from malnourished, it is hard to imagine that hunger exists in the US but it does. So serious was the problem that the US Senate set up a select committee to look into the issue. In response to this need, Sister Rosemarie assembled a group of people to work with her on this project. They became the first board of directors: Bonnie Goodman, Cathy Truesdale, Jim Truesdale, Clevis Cabrera, Joyce Shannon, Nick Hindman, Paul Wood, Barb Williams and Willie Williams. Sister Rosemarie also met with many local leaders, Leah Krantz, from The Greater Chicago Food Depository and Bernie Kleina, the Executive Director of the Hope Fair Housing Center. It was also discovered that thousands of pounds of edible food was going into landfills. The board contacted manufacturers and grocery stores to try to recover some of it. They realized a food bank could be a way of recovering and distributing this much needed food. The name Bethlehem, meaning \\"House of Bread\\" was chosen.

Chu Teh- Chun enrolled in the National School of Fine Arts (now China Academy of Art), where he studied under Fang Ganmin and Wu Dayu. He was the first ethnic Chinese member of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts of France, and together with Wu Guanzhong and Zao Wou-Ki were dubbed the \\"Three Musketeers\\" of modernist Chinese artists trained in China and France. Early life and education Chu Teh-Chun was born in 1920 in the town of Baitu in Xiao County, which was then in Jiangsu province but now part of Anhui province. In 1935 he entered the National School of Fine Arts (now China Academy of Art) in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, graduating in 1941. At the school he studied Chinese painting under Pan Tianshou and Western art under Fang Ganmin and Wu Dayu., who were prominent Chinese artists trained in France. Among his schoolmates were Wu Guanzhong and Zao Wou-Ki. The three, dubbed the \\"Three Musketeers\\" of Chinese modernist art, were all elected as members of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts. It was owing to Chu's influence that Wu Guanzhong decided to abandon engineering and become an artist. Career In 1945 Chu became a faculty member of the architecture department of the National Central University in Nanjing, then China's capital. With the communist victory in mainland China, Chu moved to Taiwan in 1949, joining the National Taiwan Normal University where he taught Western- style painting. He moved to Paris in 1955, where he lived for the rest of his life. He became a French citizen in 1980, and a member of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts in 1997. In April 1956, Chu painted an oil on canvas portrait of his wife Tung Ching-Chao (Ëë£ÊôØÊò≠), which won the silver medal at the Paris Salon. Chu called the painting his \\"lucky star\\", after which his career became increasingly successful. Wu Guanzhong praised the painting as the \\"Mona Lisa of the East\\". Inspired by Nicolas de Sta√´l's abstract landscape paintings, Chu abandoned figurative painting and adopted a unique style using bold strokes of colour which evoked Chinese calligraphy. His new style was immediately successful. In 1964, an exhibition of his works at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh brought him international fame. On 17 December 1997, Chu was elected a member of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts of France, the first Frenchman of Chinese origin to be chosen. He was also made a Chevalier de l‚ÄôOrdre des Palmes Acad√©miques and Chevalier de la L√©gion d‚ÄôHonneur in 2001. His paintings are now in the permanent collections of more than 50 museums all over the world. Major exhibitions of his work were held at the Shanghai Art Museum in 2005 and Beijing's National Art Museum of China in 2010. In 2003, Chu donated an oil painting to the Shanghai Grand Theatre for its fifth anniversary. The painting now decorates the theatre's central lobby. At the unveiling ceremony, Chu called the painting his biggest and best work. Art market In November 2013, an untitled oil on canvas diptych painted by Chu in 1963 was sold for HK$70.7 million (US$9.1 million) at an auction in Hong Kong, setting his personal record. His previous record was another diptych entitled \\"La Foret Blanche II\\", which was sold at auction in 2012 for HK$60 million, or $7.7 million USD According to the Hurun Art List, the total value of Chu's artworks sold in 2013 at public auction was US$65 million, ranking third among all living Chinese artists, behind only Zeng Fanzhi and Fan Zeng. Death On 26 March 2014, Chu Teh-Chun died in Paris at age 93, closely following the deaths of his friends and fellow modern artists Wu Guanzhong in 2010 and Zao Wou-Ki in 2013.

St. John. He was the grandson of Thomas St. John, Esquire (1564‚Äì1625) and Jane Mathew and great-nephew to Sir William St. John, Knight of Highlight and his wife Eleanor (de Port-St. John) St. John of Lydiard Tregoze. He was the great-grandson of Christopher St. John, Esquire (1547‚Äì1616), Lord of Uchel-olau until his death, and his wife Elizabeth Bawdrip. This St. John family came from a small, now abandoned, feudal village called Uchel-olau (High-light in English), Glamorganshire, Wales. Thomas St. John, Esquire removed to London after he was admitted to Gray's Inn, one of the four Inns of Court in 1577. Mathias' father, Christopher St. John was raised in London no later than 1584 and married about 1600. Matthias appears to be his first born child. Sir William St. John, Knight his great uncle was a member of the Virginia Company of London and recorded in the early census records of Virginia. Sir William was back and forth between London and Colonial America until Matthias and his uncle Matthew came to America permanently. Sir William was a Vice Admiral in the English Royal Navy and had his own ships. Matthias' occupation as a chandler likely refers to ship chandler a service he probably provided for his great uncle, lord of Uchel-olau. Matthias and his uncle Matthew have been merged into 1 person in the 1907 St. John Genealogy book.  Settlement in Massachusetts Bay Colony  He came to Dorchester, in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1632. He was named a freeman on September 3, 1634. He received a grant of twenty acres of land there on January 14, 1635. In 1638, he sold his house to a Mr. Withington, and in 1639, he sold his land to Withington too.  Settlement in Connecticut Colony  \\"Matthias Senchion's\\" property can be seen on this map of the settlement of Windsor He moved to Windsor, Connecticut Colony in 1640. He was granted land ten rods wide and 18 rods deep adjacent to the palisades (the protective fence of the settlement). In 1643 and 1644, he served as a member of a Grand jury. Matthias is listed as a settler in Wethersfield as early as 1648. Jonas Weede sold Matthias his land in Wethersfield in 1640. On several occasions he served on a jury, and was also himself challenged in court in Hartford. In some cases, the issue was either a debt owed of or to him. On one occasion, he was brought before the court accused of selling \\"syder to Indians by which they was Drunke\\". On another occasion he won a judgment against Stephen Beckwith for defamation. In February 1658, Thomas Wickham bought Matthias' land in Wethersfield. He moved to Norwalk in 1654. In 1657, he is recorded as working with Isacke More, and Edward Nash to \\"make and provide a good and sufficient wolfe-pit.\\" The record states that Matthias was chosen in 1660, as a townsman \\"to act and agitate all such affairs and occasions as the orders of the court authoriseth and that for the Yere ensuinge.\\" He is listed on the Founders Stone bearing the names of the founding settlers of Norwalk in the East Norwalk Historical Cemetery.

It was the follow up single to You've Got a Friend and became a Top 40 hit in the U.S. and a Top 20 hit in Canada, and made the Top 10 on the Adult Contemporary chart in the U.S. It has also been covered by New York Voices and Johnny Mathis. Lyrics and music Taylor wrote \\"Long Ago and Far Away\\" in 1970, about a year before it was recorded for Mud Slide Slim. Joni Mitchell sings background vocals and Carole King plays piano. It is a sad song that Taylor biographer Timothy White calls \\"among the most wistful of Taylor's vast catalogue of secular hymns.\\" The theme of the song is how things don't turn out as planned, how dreams don't usually match the ultimate reality and how expectations don't last. The lyrics describe a young man whose dreams have not come true. The lyrics evoke a motif common in Taylor's songs, that of the sea and sailing away for one reason or another. Other images in the lyrics include \\"tender dreams\\" and \\"broken glass.\\" Towards the end of the song the singer asks why his song is so sad. The phrase \\"long ago and far away\\" never appears in the lyrics. Rather, Taylor sings that \\"Long ago a young man sits and plays his waiting game.\\" In 1998 Taylor noted that the lyrics in the second verse \\"Love is just a word I've heard when things are being said\\" was the \\"most coherent\\" part of the song for him at that time, stating that \\"it is a musing on the nature of expectations, and how they don't last. Critic Al Rudis notes a resemblance between some of the melody of \\"Long Ago and Far Away\\" and that of \\"Sunny Skies,\\" a song from Taylor's prior album Sweet Baby James. Journalist Peggy Mulloy Glad regards it as an example of how Taylor can use his vocal and guitar playing to \\"communicate the pain, melancholy and desires that most people experience but few can express.\\" Musicologist James Perone explains that one of Taylor's means of achieving this is that \\"some of the melodic notes touch and linger on the upper extensions of the chords. He explains that this may be heard as mild dissonances, which may imply sadness. The dissonances also give the song a jazz feel, which is enhanced by Danny Kortchmar's conga-playing. Perone also points out that the song uses many chords that include notes beyond the standard three-note triad. Reception Author Dave Thompson described the song as \\"slight.\\" But Rudis considers it a \\"nice dreamy number.\\" Author Ian Halperin regards it as the most daring song on Mud Slide Slim. Thirteen years after its initial release, critic Doug Robinson called it a \\"lesser known gem.\\" Rolling Stone Album Guide critic Mark Coleman considered it the one song on Mud Slide Slim that wasn't sappy or flaccid. Taylor himself considers it \\"a sentimental song, but good.\\" \\"Long Ago and Far Away\\" reached number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached number 4 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.

She was Chair of the Commission for 2015, and Vice Chair in 2014. Ravel resigned from the commission on February 19, 2017, effective March 1, 2017.

After graduating from Willow Glen High School in San Jose, Ravel received a B.A. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1970 and her J.D. from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in 1974.https://www.mcmanislaw.com/people/lawyers/ann-ravel She lives in Los Gatos, California with her husband, Stephen, an independent adoption attorney. She has three children, two granddaughters and one grandson. Political career Ravel has served as Chair of the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) and led the California Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC). Prior to joining the FEC, Ravel was appointed by California Governor Jerry Brown in February 2011 to serve as the Chair of the California Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC). At the FPPC, Ravel oversaw the regulation of campaign finance, lobbyist registration and reporting, and ethics and conflicts of interest related to officeholders and public employees. In Ravel‚Äôs most significant case as Chair, the FPPC pursued a year-long investigation into the methods used by donors who seek to influence political campaigns by anonymous methods. In October 2013, the FPPC fined the Center to Protect Patient Rights and Americans for Responsible Leadership $1 million for forwarding $15 million in \\"dark money\\" contributions to a California committee without disclosing the source of those contributions. Ravel testified about the case before the Senate Rules and Administration Committee considering the issue of nondisclosure by political groups on April 30, 2014. While at the FPPC, Ravel sought to leverage technology to \\"enhance efficiency, improve governance and repair the relationship between the public and their government.\\" To that end, the FPPC adopted regulations to allow political contributions to be made by text message and created an online, searchable database of California public officials‚Äô Statements of Economic Interests. During Ravel‚Äôs tenure, the FPPC also released a mobile phone application to track gifts received by public officials and held a hackathon to explore creative options to better disclose the Agency‚Äôs public data. As Chair of the FPPC, Ravel created the Regulation Clarification Project, an effort to clarify and streamline California regulations. This project was designed to make the law more understandable to the public, promote easier and less onerous compliance for state and local officials, and ensure that the regulations complied with the governing statutes and courts decisions. Among other changes, the FPPC created guides to analyze gift laws and reorganized the regulations by topic. During her tenure at the FPPC, she established the States Unified Network (SUN) Center, a nonpartisan group of state and local jurisdictions promoting transparency in campaign finance. The group shares enforcement, litigation, and campaign finance data through a public website, which provides nationwide disclosure and aids in enforcement. Before joining the FPPC, Ravel was Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Torts and Consumer Litigation in the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice.

Ravel was appointed member of the Federal Electoral Commission (FEC) by President Obama on June 21, 2013, and took office on October 25, 2013 after being confirmation by the Senate. On October 24, 2014, Ravel called for \\"a reexamination of the commission's approach to the internet and other emerging technologies...\\" \\"The suggestion on its face should have been non-controversial: 'As a Commission, we need to consider the changing role of technology in our elections and recognize how technology is changing our politics. For that reason, next year, I will bring together technologists, social entrepreneurs, policy wonks, politicos, and activists‚Äîfrom across the spectrum‚Äîto discuss new and emerging technologies and how the Commission‚Äôs current approach may or may not fit with future innovations.'\\" http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1346032/final- checks-and-balances-statement-ravel.pdf Then-FEC chairman Lee Goodman \\"characterized the suggestion as an attempt to regulate speech.\\" In May 2015, Ravel told the New York Times that it is unlikely that the FEC will be able to regulate the coming 2016 presidential election. \\"The likelihood of the laws being enforced is slim,\\" she told The New York Times. \\"I never want to give up, but I‚Äôm not under any illusions. People think the FEC is dysfunctional. It‚Äôs worse than dysfunctional.\\" Ravel resigned from the FEC on February 19, 2017, effective March 1, 2017. In 2019, Ravel began her campaign for California state senator.

Over three postwar decades, he assembled a \\"deeply personal\\" and much revered collection centered on thirty-three works by Paul C√©zanne and more than forty by Vincent van Gogh, Amedeo Modigliani, Cha√Øm Soutine, Paul Gauguin, √âdouard Manet, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and a dozen other European modernists. Early life and business career Pearlman started his career in the cork insulation business, forming his own company, Eastern Cold Storage Insulation Corporation, at the age of twenty-four and becoming a major player in marine refrigeration. He married Rose Fried in 1925. They raised two daughters in Croton-on-Hudson, eventually living both there and in Manhattan and traveling frequently in pursuit of art. Art collector Cha√Øm Soutine, View of C√©ret, ca. 1921-22 While Pearlman initially decorated his Croton home with Old Master and American Realist paintings, including those found at local flea markets, he later turned to expressionist paintings. In 1945, he purchased an expressionist painting by Cha√Øm Soutine ‚Äì View of C√©ret (formerly Village Square, C√©ret). Pearlman quickly made connections in the New York art world and traded his decorative collection for carefully selected examples of modern works by impressionist, post-impressionist and expressionist European artists. In the years after World War II, Pearlman began traveling to Europe. During an early trip to London he met Austrian expressionist Oskar Kokoschka. This would result in a lifelong friendship for Pearlman with one of the few living artists whose work he collected. On this same trip he also visited the places where Soutine had painted. Ultimately, Pearlman's collection would include seven paintings by Soutine, and four works by Modigliani, including a rare limestone head and two oil portraits (L√©on Indenbaum and Jean Cocteau). Vincent Van Gogh, Tarascon Stagecoach, 1888. Collection of the Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation. Although successful in business, Pearlman was never able to match the resources of his contemporaries. Instead, \\"he was both lucky and clever: lucky in that, when he first started, the art he was interested in‚Ä¶could be secured for thousands rather than millions of dollars‚Ä¶and clever in that he continuously honed his eye and then applied his skills‚Ä¶ to obtain the objects of his passion.\\" In 1950, Pearlman learned from a dealer that Van Gogh‚Äôs Tarascon Diligence was available from the heirs of the artist Milo Beretta. He offered a combination of paintings and cash to acquire the long lost painting, the last time. Also in 1950, with the advice of noted C√©zanne specialist John Rewald, Pearlman made his first purchase of a C√©zanne watercolor, Cistern in the Park of Ch√¢teau Noir. Over the following two decades, he acquired more than thirty works by C√©zanne and assemble a distinguished collection of watercolors by the artist. In addition to Modigliani, he added works by Toulouse-Lautrec, Manet, Degas, Renoir and Gauguin as well as several significant oil paintings by C√©zanne, including the only known vertical-format of the artist‚Äôs favorite subject, Mont Sainte- Victoire. Pearlman continued to build his collection for the three remaining decades of his life. His last two purchases were C√©zanne watercolors: a late masterpiece (Still Life with Carafe, Bottle, and Fruit) and Rocks at Bib√©mus. Exhibitions and legacy Paul C√©zanne, Cistern in the Park of Ch√¢teau Noir, 1895-1900 Beginning in the 1950s, Henry and Rose Pearlman began lending individual works to major museums, initially for retrospectives of Soutine and Modigliani. Pearlman also lent financial and other support to artists, including Kokoschka and Jacques Lipchitz, whose studio was destroyed by fire in 1952. Later he allowed his collection to be exhibited as a fundraiser for an organization helping immigrant populations settle in New York. The Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation was established in 1955 as a not-for-profit organization and is the current owner of the collection. The first exhibition of the collection took place in 1958, when twenty-seven selected works were lent anonymously to the Baltimore Museum of Art. Numerous exhibitions of the collection (in whole and in part) have taken place over the past six decades, including the following: forty-six works were shown at Knoedler & Company in New York in 1959; the Fogg Museum in 1959; the collection was featured in different exhibitions at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1960, 1964, 1974 and 1986; the Detroit Institute of Art in 1967; the Wadsworth Atheneum in 1970; the National Gallery of Art in 1972, and at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco in 1982. In 1961 Pearlman began making summer loans to museums, starting with the Metropolitan Museum of Art‚Äôs \\"Paintings from Private Collections: Summer Loan Exhibition\\" series, in part so that the works would be safe and seen while he and Rose were in Croton. Paul C√©zanne, Mont Sainte- Victoire, ca. 1904-6 Henry Pearlman spent much of the last year of his life organizing an exhibition of the collection at the Brooklyn Museum, which toured after his death to Princeton, Utica (NY), Williamstown (MA) and the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh. The collection returned to the Princeton University Art Museum in 1976, when Rose Pearlman, as head of the foundation, initiated a series of longer-term loans that continue to this day. A world- class university-based museum, Princeton offers the collection security, conservation, curatorial expertise and management of loan requests from museums around the world. In 2014, the Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation and the Princeton University Art Museum initiated a tour of the collection, including its first exhibitions outside the United States. With the aim of expanding the audience for these works and artists, the tour (C√©zanne and the Modern: Masterpieces from the Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection) opened at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, England, in March 2014, to critical acclaim. In July 2014, it traveled to the Mus√©e Granet in Aix-en-Provence, France, where many of the C√©zanne works were originally created. The collection then returned to North America with three exhibitions: The High Museum in Atlanta, the Vancouver Art Gallery and at Princeton for the fall semester of 2015.

Plot Paper Clips takes place in the rural, blue-collar Tennessee community of Whitwell, where a middle-school class attempts to gauge the magnitude of World War II's Holocaust by collecting paper clips, each of which represents a human life lost in the Nazis' slaughter of Jews. The idea came in 1998 from three of the teachers at the school and was completed in their eighth grade classrooms. The students ultimately succeeded in collecting over 25 million paperclips. Production The documentary film about the project was officially released in 2004. This film's genesis lies with Rachel Pinchot who initially saw an article about the Whitwell Middle School in the Washington Post. She took the idea of a film to her husband, Ari Pinchot, of The Johnson Group. The Johnson Group sent a team to Whitwell to film key moments, such as the arrival of several Holocaust survivors from New York who shared their experiences with the community. Out of that footage, Elliot Berlin created a seven-minute presentation. With help from Ergo Entertainment and its partners Donny Epstein, Yeeshai Gross, and Elie Landau (who joined the project as executive producers), this \\"demo\\" helped to convince the Miramax film company that this project was worth a full-length movie. It was described as being not yet another movie showing the tragedy, but a project of hope and inspiration. The movie features interviews with students, teachers, Holocaust survivors, and people who sent paper clips. It also shows how the railcar traveled from Germany to Baltimore, and then Whitwell. The creators had accumulated about 150 hours of footage. The movie was shown for the first time in November 2003 in Whitwell.

She converted to Judaism and moved to Israel after the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Avraham was the 2012 Israeli women's champion in Thai boxing, in the weight class. She is also the 2014 World Muaythai Federation pro-am women's world champion in the 57‚Äì63.5 kg (125‚Äì140 lbs) class. Early life Avraham was born in Bombay, India, to a Hindu father who is a physician, Dr. Aaron Avraham (formerly Hagirdas Pradesh) and a Christian mother who was a nurse. Her family was close friends with Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife Rivka, who were killed in the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, by terrorists who attacked the Mumbai Chabad House where the couple served as emissaries. Avraham was 14 years old at the time. Immigration to Israel A year after the attack, she and her family converted and moved to Israel. They settled in the West Bank Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba, south of Jerusalem, on the outskirts of Hebron, where she now lives. She is now a religious Orthodox Jew, and studies in the ulpana, a religious school for Orthodox girls, in Kiryat Arba. Avraham also volunteers as a firefighter, and has taken part in scores of firefighting operations. Avraham is considering studying medicine, or she may eventually become a full-time firewoman. Thai boxing career While attending a Kiryat Arba school for religious girls, Avraham made the decision to participate in sports. Michael Pollack, a fitness trainer from nearby Hebron's Jewish neighborhood, melded kickboxing into her sports training. Pollack put Thai boxing coach Eddie Yusopov and Avraham in contact with each other, and Yusopov became her trainer. Avraham trains in Muay Thai boxing five times a week, at the boxing center at Jerusalem's Teddy Stadium. As is the case with most Israeli athletes, she does not receive any funding. To pay for her training (NIS 230 a month) and trips abroad for competitions, since she does not like to ask for money, she cleans houses and also works as a dog walker and waitress. In addition, Avraham hitchhikes to her practices in Jerusalem, as she does not have money to take the bus. Because she is religious, she brings kosher food with her when she travels to fights. =2012 Israeli Champion= In September 2012, Avraham won the Israeli national women‚Äôs Thai boxing championship in her weight class of 57‚Äì63 kilos (125‚Äì140 pounds), at the age of 18. =2014 World Champion= In early 2014, while still in high school Avraham won the Women's World Thai-Boxing Championship in Bangkok, Thailand, in her 57‚Äì63 kilos (125‚Äì140 pounds) weight class.

History Permanent barracks were first established in Canterbury when William Baldock initiated construction of \\"St Gregory‚Äôs Barracks\\", an infantry barracks on Sturry Road, as part of the British response to the threat of the French Revolution, in 1793. Sir Edward Hales completed construction of the cavalry barracks slightly further up Sturry Road in 1795 and artillery barracks were built on land between these sites around the same time. In 1873 a system of recruiting areas based on counties was instituted under the Cardwell Reforms and the barracks became the depot for the two battalions of the 3rd (East Kent) Regiment of Foot. Following the Childers Reforms, the regiment evolved to become the Buffs (East Kent Regiment) with its depot in the barracks in 1881. These 18th century barracks fell into a state of disrepair in the early part of the 20th century, were withdrawn from use in the 1930s and were ultimately demolished in 1967. New barracks were established on a new site, half a mile to the south-east of the old barracks, during the 1930s: these barracks became the new home of the Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment). They were named after Lieutenant Colonel Gerard Howe, a former commanding officer of the Buffs, and went on to become the regional centre for infantry training as the Home Counties Brigade Depot in 1960. They also became the depot and Regimental Headquarters for the Queen's Regiment in 1966, for the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment in 1992 and for the 5th Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Scotland (the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) in 2003.

He spent several years in Japan after his graduation from the Naval Academy, granting him a large amount of knowledge about East Asia and the Southwest Pacific that proved key in his interactions with Naval Intelligence. McCollum served as an American Naval Officer and retired in 1951 as Rear Admiral and consultant after World War II to the Central Intelligence Group and Central Intelligence Agency. McCollum graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1923 and was then sent by the Navy for 3 years of study in Japan. He also attended the submarine school at the Naval Submarine Base. Despite the fact that he served on a wide variety of ships with the US Navy, he is most noted for his work in intelligence. He was fleet intelligence officer on the staff of Commander in Chief U. S. Fleet (1936-1938). In October 1940 as a Lt. Commander he authored what is called the McCollum memo outlining his assessment of German and Japanese threats to U.S. security. From Nov. 1942 to May 1945, he held 3 titles simultaneously. He held Director of Allied Naval Intelligence, Southwest Pacific, Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Seventh Fleet, and Commanding Officer of the Seventh Fleet Intelligence Center.

Career Little is known of Masrur's background; his nisba suggests that he was from Balkh and he may have been either of Iranian or Turkic origin, but this is not known for certain. He is first mentioned by the historian al-Tabari in 870, during the events that resulted in the deposition of the caliph al-Muhtadi. When the revolt of Musa ibn Bugha al-Kabir began, Masrur was one of several officers who remained loyal to the caliph, and he was placed in charge of the administration of the caliph's palace. During the battle against the rebels he was in command of al- Muhtadi's right flank, but the caliph's forces were defeated and the troops fled. During the reign of al-Mu'tamid (r. 870‚Äì892), the caliph's brother and effective regent al-Muwaffaq made Masrur one of the leading officers of the Abbasid army. In 872 he led an expedition against the Jacobite Kurds and succeeded in routing them, and in 872, 874 and 875 he commanded several campaigns against the Kharijite rebel Musawir in al-Jazira. In 875 he replaced Musa ibn Bugha as the commander in charge of suppressing the Zanj Rebellion, and was named as the governor of al-Ahwaz, Basra, the Tigris districts, al- Yamama, and al-Bahrayn. Later that year, as part of al-Mu'tamid's succession arrangements, he was nominally appointed as al-Muwaffaq's governor of all of the eastern provinces of the caliphate. In 876, Masrur participated in the campaign to halt the Saffarid amir Ya'qub ibn al-Layth's advance into Iraq. In an attempt to slow down Ya'qub's progress, he flooded the region around Wasit by breaching a dike on the Tigris; he then made his way toward main government army at Sib Bani Kuma. When the two sides met at the decisive Battle of Dayr al-Aqul, Masrur commanded al-Muwaffaq's left flank. After the Abbasid forces were victorious, Masrur's role in the battle was acknowledged in a public statement, and he was awarded the estates of Abu al-Saj Dewdad, who had fought on the Saffarid side. Following the battle, Masrur resumed overseeing the operations against the Zanj; he also advanced to the region of al-Ahwaz and periodically fought the rebels there. In 881, after al-Muwaffaq decided to personally campaign against the Zanj, Masrur joined his camp, and served as one of his commanders for the duration of the rebellion. He participated in the attack against the Zanj capital of al-Mukhtara, though no mention is made of him during the final assault in 884. Family Masrur had at least two sons. Muhammad ibn Masrur was appointed as governor of the Mecca Road by al- Muwaffaq in 879; he deputed his brother 'Ali to assume the post, but the latter was killed by tribesmen of the Banu Asad while en route to al- Mughithah.

Their name is synonymous with a music project they originated, the 45-RPM 7\\" single, The Nuclear Beauty Parlor. Two members of the Nuclear Beauty Parlor wrote the lyrics to the song which debuted in the women‚Äôs jail following the 1983 blockade of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, one of the largest anti-nuclear protests in the United States. The group staged numerous performances to attract media attention for the cause of nuclear disarmament. The record, conceived as an art prank, is archived in the Peace Library at Swarthmore College. The group is noted for adding humor and post-punk style to a dedicated protest movement.  History  On May 24, 1983, ten women formed an affinity group to prepare for the mass arrests planned for the International Day of Nuclear Disarmament protest of June 20, 1983. They were trained in civil disobedience by Livermore Action Group. The female membership grew over the next 3 years, as they evolved into a performance art and activist art group. Founding member Vicki Krohn Amorose originally coined the name Nuclear Beauty Parlor and she, along with founding member Denise Slattery, wrote the lyrics to the Nuclear Beauty Parlor song. The group was not a band; they enacted political satire in the tradition of guerrilla theatre and performance activism.  Activities  On June 20, 1983, the group participated in the blockade of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. More than 1000 demonstrators were arrested, including three members of the Nuclear Beauty Parlor, and jailed for 11 days in tents on the grounds of the Alameda County Jail. The group gained their first media attention with a San Francisco Examiner headline: Nuclear Beauty Parlor a Hit in Jail. American activist group Nuclear Beauty Parlor's record cover During November and December,1983, the Nuclear Beauty Parlor acquired non-profit status, under the title Bay Area Energy Action. Bill Graham (promoter), San Francisco music impresario, funded production of the Nuclear Beauty Parlor 45-RPM 7\\" single. The lyrics were set to music and the record was produced by the group's friend and ally, Stacy Baird. Side A, The Nuclear Beauty Parlor, was performed by Re Styles and other members of The Tubes. Side B, Awake, was recorded at OTR Studios under the direction of Cookie Marenco. The Nuclear Beauty Parlor 45-RPM single was released and a press conference held on Dec 15,1983. Between January and April, 1984, the group solidified its identity as a performance art group with the goal of gaining media attention for the nuclear freeze movement. The record gained airplay and press. On April 16, 1984, the group performs the first in a series of \\"Tax Day actions\\" at Rincon Annex Post Office in Rincon Center. Playing to the audience of taxpayers lined up in cars to meet the midnight tax-filing deadline, the Nuclear Beauty Parlor interacted as costumed waitresses, served weapon-themed food, and encourage people to: \\"Have one, you paid for it!\\" They attracted attention from TV and newspaper reporters. The Democratic National Convention was held in San Francisco on July 14 and 15, 1984. In conjunction with \\"A Vision of America at Peace\\", the Nuclear Beauty Parlor performed an original play with songs, titled \\"The First Lady Debate\\". The group recorded \\"The First Lady Debate\\" and distributed tapes to radio stations nationwide. On the eve of the Nov 6, 1984, presidential election, the group pasted thousands of anti-Reagan posters in downtown San Francisco, designed by artist Paul Mavrides, who also designed the record jacket. Although the posters were quickly removed after Ronald Reagan‚Äôs victory, photographer C. Baldwin captured the morning-after image and created a postcard. A December 1984 Ms. Magazine article on the group helped to boost record sales. In their second Tax Day performance at Rincon Annex Post Office on April 15, 1985, The Nuclear Beauty Parlor dressed as couture nuclear weapons with price tags, and interacted with last-minute taxpayers, resulting in local TV and press coverage. In July and September, 1985, the group adapted their nuclear weapon costumes for The Fashion Show presented by New Langton Arts. An original script read by the MC accompanied the runway show, titled \\"The Nuclear Fashion Arsenal\\", which was also performed a second time at Fort Mason for the International Day of Peace. In the group's third Tax Day performance, April 15, 1986, at Rincon Annex Post Office, The Nuclear Beauty Parlor enacted taxpayer robberies with pink machine guns. In the 1990s, The Nuclear Beauty Parlor record was housed in the Audio Visual Collection of the Swarthmore College Peace Collection.  Members and Names  The founding group members are Marissa Hutter LaMagna, Diana Wendling, Denise Slattery, Laura Graham, Lisa Andreini, Cecilia London, Kathy Staats Hornbeak, Marjorie Newman, Vicki Krohn Amorose and Fawn Yacker. Membership grew to include Connie Hendrix, Suzanne Stefanac, Kelly Cash, Lexine Alpert, Brenda Burson, Nancy Leszczynski, Siri Aarons, Christine Stiles and Suzy Poole.

He is credited with starting to manufacture plastic goods in the country. Early life Stewart was born in Christchurch in 1913. His father, Robertson McGregor Stewart, was an accountant. His mother was Ivy Emily Stewart (n√©e Wooles). His parents separated when he was six, and Stewart and his younger brother Max remained with their mother. They lived in Sydenham and then Linwood. He attended Linwood North Primary School, Christchurch West High School, and one term at Christchurch Boys' High School until age 13, when scarlet fever caused him to leave school. He went to Bottle Lake Hospital in Burwood for treatment and recovered, but did not go back to school. Professional career He trained to become an electrical engineer through attending night school for five years. His first employer in 1929 was Harry Urlwin, who instilled in him the sense of never to be frightened of anything or anyone. In 1935, Urlwin sent him to England for the purpose of learning about plastics. He imported a moulding machine to New Zealand and was the first to manufacture the material in the country. He started to work for Plastic & Die Casting Ltd in 1947, a company founded ten years earlier. By 1957, he had raised enough money to buy the company, which he renamed PDL. The company was listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange in 1971 and at its height, employed 2,200 staff with an annual turnover of NZ$350 million. It exported to 50 countries across three continents. He established factories in many countries, including one in Malaysia in 1974. His favourite saying was: Stewart retired in the mid-1990s, handing over PDL to his son, Mark Robertson. The 60% family shareholding in PDL was sold in 2001 to the French company Schneider Electric for NZ$97 million. Stewart was appointed a Companion of the Order of the British Empire in the 1970 New Year Honours and a Knight Bachelor in the 1979 New Year Honours, for services to manufacturing and the community. He was a Christchurch City Councillor from 1969 to 1972. In 1995, he was inducted into the New Zealand Business Hall of Fame. Due to his lack of formal education, the recognition that he was most proud of was his honorary doctorate of engineering from the University of Canterbury. His business relationship with Malaysia saw him become an Honorary Malaysian Consul, a role that he filled for 28 years. The King of Malaysia appointed him a Companion of the Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia (JSM) for his business and cultural links. Stewart Fountain The second Stewart Fountain just before its demolition In the 1960s, Stewart offered funding for the erection of a fountain on a small public reserve on the corner of Colombo, High, and Hereford Streets. Initially, he put up ¬£5,000, but this was later increased to NZ$14,000. The fountain, with four stainless steel walls that had water flowing down it, was built in the early 1970s and was his first philanthropic contribution to Christchurch. In 1987, it was decided that the fountain needed to be redesigned, which was done in 1988. Ongoing maintenance issues resulted in the 1993 decision for the fountain needing to be replaced. By then, its location had become part of the City Mall. The replacement, which was known as the Stewart Fountain, was built in 1998 at a cost of NZ$700,000, with a NZ$200,000 contribution by Stewart and decorated with hundreds of tiles painted by Christchurch schoolchildren. The fountain developed into a favourite place for young people. Demolition of the fountain began on 13 August 2007 and 13 young people were arrested in a protest over the demolition; Sir Robertson Stewart had died that morning. The removal of the fountain was supported by local business owners, who had long complained about the young people being bad for their businesses. Christchurch City Council formally named the reserve Stewart Plaza in 2008. Stewart's bequest part-funded the replacement sculpture, \\"Flour Power\\", on the condition that the installation be permanent, and that the land be known as Stewart Plaza. Family and death In 1937, Stewart married and later divorced Gladys Gunter. They had three children: *Sir Robert John Stewart (born 1940), knighted in the 2014 Queen's Birthday Honours. *Elizabeth \\"Lee\\" Stewart (born 1943) *Peter Maxwell Stewart (born 1945) married since 1968 to New Zealand Fashion Week founder Dame Pieter Stewart (who was made a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2012 Birthday Honours).

This structure is now part of a larger complex of buildings, many of which are Colonial Revival buildings built in the 1930s, when the house was also restored. The farmstead was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The property has had several interesting owners. James Gowing, Jr.'s son, Almerin, was a local militia leader and town selectman. The property was bought in 1853 by Samuel Hale, who served as Governor of New Hampshire 1882-83. In 1895 it was acquired by Louis Cabot (whose family manufactured Cabot Stain), who made it part of his large gentleman's farm. After deteriorating in the 1920s and 30s, the property was acquired by Mrs. Selina Riker, heir to the Riker Drug fortune in 1937. Mrs. Riker retained the firm of Belknap & Weir to design a Colonial Revival farm complex, of which the restored Gowing farmhouse became a part. Their design was developed as an extension of the Gowing house. The property was bought in 1954 by F. Nelson Blount, the president of the Ocean Spray cooperative.

He also wrote novels and screenplays.  Life  Driest was born in Stettin, Germany (now Poland), on 28 April 1939, the son of a graduate economist and a piano teacher. At the end of World War II, the family fled to Peine, Lower Saxony. His parents were divorced in 1950. The children stayed with the mother, who moved to G√∂ttingen, but he returned to his father in 1957. In an anthology from 1995, Driest described his memories of childhood and adolescence under the title Halbstark in Peine. He was dismissed from school four times but achieved the Abitur as the third-best of that year. Driest studied law for ten semesters in Kiel, Berlin and G√∂ttingen. On 11 May 1965, three weeks before his oral law examination, he robbed the savings bank () in Burgdorf. He was sentenced to five years in prison and released after three years and four months. He then worked in the port of Hamburg, and as a waiter and taxi driver in London.

Though the public initially confronted the city's African-American community with the crime, the dying third victim, Maggie Hunter, stated that her estranged husband had attacked her. J.C. Hunter was sentenced to death for the murders in 1910. His sentence was commuted to life in prison one day before his execution date in 1911. He was eventually pardoned by the governor in 1923.  Murder  On December 10, 1909, two women, Eliza Gribble and her daughter Carrie Ohlander, were discovered beaten to death inside the house. A third woman, Maggie Hunter, was found barely alive and later died from her injuries in the hospital. When police arrived on the scene, they found Carrie Ohlander's body in the hallway, and concluded that she had been criminally assaulted before her throat was slit. Carrie's mother, Eliza Gribble, was found in the back bedroom with her skull beaten in. Eliza Gribble, 70, was the owner of the house. She was originally from Cornwell, England, but had settled in Savannah before the Civil War with her late husband R. Gribble. She had rented the house with her daughter a short time before the murders occurred. Eliza was found sitting in her easy chair in the back bedroom. A newspaper and her reading glasses lay at her feet. She had received one to two blows to the back of the head and her grey head showed the imprint of an axe. Carrie Ohlander, 36, was Eliza Gribble's daughter. She was separated from her husband, Andrew J. Ohlander, who was living in Memphis, and had come to Savannah to live with her mother. Ohlander was partially deaf and believed to be the first to have been attacked, likely trying to protect her mother. Physicians determined she was criminally assaulted before having her throat cut and being beaten to death. Maggie Hunter, 34, had just rented a room and moved into the Gribble House the day before the attacks occurred. She was estranged from her husband, JC Hunter, who was 30 years her senior, at the time, and was planning on making a living on her own by being a seamstress. JC Hunter had just brought a sewing machine over to the house the day before the murders. Maggie was found barely alive at the front door of the house with her throat slit and her head beaten in. She died three days later in the hospital.  Public reaction and trial  The crime happened early enough in the day to make the evening paper that night. The Savannah Evening Press reported the murders and caused frenzy in the town. A riot broke out with fences torn down and doors burst in as townspeople went on a witch-hunt for the murderer. Quickly, the story became national news. The Los Angeles Herald reported on December 11, 1909, ‚Äúone hundred and fifty negroes are prisoners in the police station, awaiting examination.‚Äù Mobs of men stormed the jail in outrage, making the prisoners fear for their lives. However, a delirious Maggie Hunter, dying in the hospital, would reveal to a Baptist minister, Reverend John S. Wilder, who was sitting at her bedside, the name of the killer. Maggie claimed that her husband, JC Hunter, was the one who struck her down. Police were notified, and Hunter was taken into custody after a search of his house revealed a bloody rag and bloody clothes. On February 23, 1910, the Chatham County grand jury indicted three men, JC Hunter, Willie Walls, and John Coker, for the murder of the three women. All men denied any knowledge of the crimes. On August 17, 1910, the jury convicted Hunter of murder, and the court sentenced him to death by hanging. He tried to appeal his conviction and sentence, but was denied, and his execution date was set for December 22, 1911. The day before his execution, Hunter was to be baptized in his jail cell by Reverend John S. Wilder. Hunter still proclaimed his innocence of the crimes and was told that the governor had commuted his sentence to life in prison. On October 27, 1923, Hunter was granted a pardon by Governor Clifford Walker and returned to Savannah.  The accused  JC Hunter (David L. Taylor) was Maggie Hunter's husband. At the time of the murders, they were separated, with her living at the Gribble House residence and he living nearby at Montgomery and Congress Streets. He had served in the American Civil War as a soldier in the 63rd Regiment Georgia Volunteer Infantry until he was wounded in the Battle of Atlanta. Afterwards, he served jail time twice, once for stealing a horse and the other for bigamy. Upon his release, he adopted the name of Hunter. Hunter was a paperhanger and painter from Guyton, Georgia, and was 30 years older than Maggie Hunter, often referring to her as his daughter. In her delirium while dying in the hospital, Maggie Hunter announced to Reverend John S. Wilder, JC Hunter's name as the man who had attacked her and murdered the other two women. Police quickly descended upon Hunter's residence and found a bloody rag stuffed in his fireplace, as well as a packet of bloodstained clothes in the house. Robert J. Travis, a Savannah lawyer who investigated the scene on his own, had also discovered one of his walking canes in the house. Hunter was the only man to be fully trialled for the murders, and on August 17, 1910, the jury convicted him of the murders and the court sentenced him to death by hanging. On December 22, 1911, Hunter's sentence was reduced from hanging to a life in prison, and on October 27, 1923, he was granted a pardon by Governor Clifford Walker and returned to Savannah. Willie Walls came under suspicion after admitting to the police that he had tried to see Maggie Hunter on the day the attacks and murders had occurred. Walls had also paid for Maggie's stay in the Gribble House for a month in full as she was estranged from her husband, JC Hunter. Walls was brought in for questioning and was held, but released on his own bond, as the case against him was extremely weak, and he never went to trial. Bingham Bryan was put into custody under the alleged motive of robbery on January 25, 1910, by the Chatham County Sheriff's Department. It was believed Gribble had an old trunk filled with wills, stocks, and other valuable things. At the time of the murders, Bryan was the yardman for the property, and it was believed he knew the contents of the trunk. He was held, but never put on trial for the murders, as there was no evidence against him. John Coker was also put on trial for the murders, but was never accused due to lack of evidence and unreliable witnesses.  Tourist attraction  In 1944, the Gribble House and surrounding buildings were torn down to build the 15,000-square-foot warehouse that stands there now, located at 234 Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd in Savannah, Georgia. The warehouse is the former site of ghost tours, and was featured on the 17 May 2014 of season 9 E10 of the show Ghost Adventures.

His most notable work River Elegy paved the way to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, and his participation in the protest also forced him into the exile in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square Massacre. Su currently resides in Delaware.  Early life  Su came from an intellectual family: His father Su Pei was the vice-president of the Central Party School and his mother was a reporter of Guangming Daily. Su attended a technical college for higher education. Due to his intellectual background, he was sent to a rural area as a laborer during the Cultural Revolution. After the Cultural Revolution, Su became a reporter for Henan Daily and later People's Daily, and served as a lecturer at the Beijing Broadcasting Institute and later Beijing Normal University.  River Elegy  Su Xiaokang was highly praised by scholars and intellectuals in the 1980s, seen as one of the most iconic and popular liberal writers. Su wrote the script for the controversial and thought-provoking documentary River Elegy, a six-part documentary that narrated the decline of Chinese civilization and culture, highlighted the differences between the \\"transparency\\" of democracy and the \\"opacity\\" of an autocracy, and subtly critiqued the political system under Communist Party rule. The documentary was inspirational to numerous university students and became instrumental to the beginning of the Tiananmen Square protests.  1989 Tiananmen Square Protests  Su, along with 50 writers and novelists, participated the protests in May before the arrival of Soviet General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Su voiced his support to the students and said, \\"The students should not be allowed to stand alone\\". On May 19, Su and other intellectuals signed a petition demanding democracy in China: > We, as intellectuals, in the name of our personal integrity and all our > moral rectitude, with our body and mind, with all our dignity as > individuals, solemnly swear never to retreat in the quest for democracy > pioneered by the students with their blood and lives, never under any > pretext to disengage ourselves because of cowardice, never to allow again > the humiliations of the past, never to sell out our moral integrity, never > to submit ourselves to dictatorship, never to pledge allegiance to the last > emperors of the China of the 80's. Despite Su's vocal support of the student movement, on May 13, he went to the square and attempted to persuade the students to withdraw from the hunger strike, as he suspected the hunger strike might escalate into a \\"bloodbath\\". His books were banned from sale and publication immediately after the crackdown, River Elegy was denounced officially by the Communist Party, proclaiming it was counter-revolutionary.  Exile  After the crackdown on June 4, the Chinese Communist Party accused Su Xiaokang as one of the \\"blackhands\\" behind the protest, subsequently charging him with the crime of \\"inciting counter-revolutionary propaganda\\"; his exile began in an effort to escape the arrest warrant. During the exile, Su had to hide in the mountains and remote villages for three months before Operation Yellowbird successfully smuggled him to Hong Kong. Su proceeded to France and later reunited with his wife and son in United States. Since begins exile, Su has actively participated in speeches and seminars to advocate for a democracy movement in China. He founded a web-based magazine called Democratic China to continue the pro-democracy movement. Su wrote his memoir, titled A Memoir of Misfortune, published in 1997 in Chinese and in 2001 in English. The memoir documents the hardship he and his family endured after his exile and a tragic automobile accident in the Buffalo City that paralyzed his wife. After A Memoir of Misfortune, Su wrote another book, The Loneliness of Delaware Bay, telling of the struggles and the challenges he faced since moving to the United States. In 2013, Su published The Era of Slaying the Dragon, tackling subjects from Mao's Great Leap Forward and other atrocities occurring under the Chinese Communist Party's rule. In 2003, Su returned to China for his father's funeral under three conditions imposed by the Chinese government: *No interviews with the press. *No making speeches. *No meeting with political activists. Su's story was also featured in the Home coming campaign, funded and founded by Chu Yiu Ming, with a goal to restore the exiled democracy activists' right to return to China.

It took place after the end of Nicaraguan civil war of 1926‚Äì1927 and prior to the Sandino Rebellion of 1927‚Äì1933. The Battle The incident began when American Marines heard gunshots coming from the town of La Paz Centro (located halfway between Managua and Chinandega) at nearly 1:00 in the morning and decided to investigate. The Marine platoon that entered the town was led by Captain Richard B. Buchanan. Three blocks into La Paz Centro, the Marines' left flank, led by Sergeant Glendell L. Fitzgerald came under fire from a crowd of about seventy-five armed Nicaraguans, forcing the former to take cover \\"under a protruding wooden sidewalk and behind a pile of railroad ties along the town‚Äôs main street.\\" They were soon joined by Captain Buchanan's main force. Buchanan was fatally wounded by fire coming from a local saloon while crossing Main Street. Sergeant Fitzgerald and two privates cleared out the enemy-occupied saloon, \\"killing seven of the enemy.\\" The Americans' four casualties were brought into the recently cleared building, with Buchanan dying at 2:30. Private Marvin A. Jackson was also mortally wounded. \\"That was one boy that didn‚Äôt want to die. His brains were sticking out of that bullet hole, and he didn‚Äôt want to die\\" said Corporal Donald L. Truesdale. The hostile Nicaraguans began withdrawing at 3:00.

It is unknown for sure who commanded the Liberals that attacked the Marines at La Paz Centro, but Francisco Sequeira (\\"General Cabulla\\") seemed to be a likely suspect. After the firefight, two squads of Marines, led by Captain William P. Richards decided to visit Cabulla. On May 26, 1927, Captain Richards killed the Liberal general as the latter jumped out of his bed to go for a pistol.

It is around 170 km to the northwest of the modern city of Turkmenabat, Lebap Wilayah, near the border between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. It is a fortified square enclosure with sides of 53 metres long. It was originally a fortress built by Tahir ibn Husayn in the 9th century. In the 11th century, it was transformed into a caravanserai with fascinating brick-structures, providing shelter for not only caravans but also elites during their long journeys. The integrity of Dayahatyn acts as a typical example showing the mastering skill of Seljuk architects on brickworks during the 11th and 12th centuries. Because of its artistic excellence, Dayahatyn is regarded as one of the most valuable and the finest example of caravanserai structure extant in the Central Asia.  The construction of Dayahatyn  There are several legends related to the construction of Dayahatyn. One of them is that the Rabat of Dayahatyn was built by a local ruler, who wished to hide from a beauty named Daya. Another version is about a rich man named Bai, who suspected his wife in infidelity and left home in the cloth of poor dervish. His wife Bai-Hatyn waited him to return for many years. In order to ease his suspicion, she built this beautiful Dayahatyn to show her love and fidelity to her husband. After years of wandering, Bai finally came back to the homeland as a worker in the caravanserai construction. Bai-Hatyn recognized him and they lived happily ever after. Based on the archaeological finds and historic records, it is believed that Dayahatyn was originally the Tahiriya fort. The construction of the Tahiriya fort (which is also spelled as Takhiria) is attributed to Tahir ibn Husayn, founder of the Tahirid dynasty, in the 9th century This kind of fortresses of army detachments, or simply called as ‚ÄúRabat‚Äù, were used for military training of the Ghazi Warriors. They studied the Koran and carried out military exercises and prayer offerings all within the fort. Because of the frequent international trading activities, large groups of people were travelling along the Silk Road. Caravanserais were built in every 25-35 kilometres in cities and deserts along the ancient Silk Road to provide a shelter for travellers. As some areas are in the desolate steppes, walls and towers are needed to protect the coaching inn. Therefore, fortresses were sometimes transformed into caravanserais. In the 11th century, the Tahiriya fort was turned into a brick-caravanserai, which is the present Dayahatyn.  Architecture  Interior arcade and chambers of the Dayahatyn caravansaray. Dayahatyn caravanserai, with an adobe brick foundation and high-quality burnt brick structure on top, has a typical caravanserai- style square plan. It is enclosed by fortress walls of 53 metres long at each side with a round tower at each corner. Two mutually perpendicular axes are marked by projections and arches in the inner yard and medium towers on the outer wall. Towers at the corners and at intervals along the curtain walls conveyed a powerful and forbidding impression. The entrance on the eastern wall is also located on the perpendicular axis and is stressed by a high arch portal. The rooms along its perimeter are separated by an arch gallery from the four-avian yard. There was also a mosque, an oblong hall to the right of the lobby. This kind of plan structure and its spatial perception have been specified and developed in the architecture of the later Timurid epoch, At the stretches between the towers, there are symmetrically situated small rectangular towers excluding the pre- portal part. By archaeological investigations, these fortress walls are found be the residues of Tahiriya fort of the 9th century, As the fortress changed its function into a caravanserai in the 11th century, the former fortress was being modernized during the 11th and 12th centuries to meet the aesthetic of that time, The walls, masonry of arches, roofs and domes were all built during that period. The way of decorating walls with plain bricks reflects a typical Seljuk style of the 11th and 12th centuries. Decorative stucco moulding is applied in some places in the interiors. Dayahatyn is certainly a masterpiece of the architect skill of the Northern Khorasan School of the ‚ÄúGolden Age‚Äù. On both sides of the entrance, the names of first successors to Prophet Mohammed (Ali, Omar, Osman and Abu Bakr) were found in kufic made by brickwork. By mentioning the names of four important caliphs, Dayahatyn, certainly, was not simply a caravanserai for caravans. It was indeed also served as a royal stopover for elites during the long trips across the expanses of their powers Rooms with unusual layout and exceptionally inventive design are believed to be for the elites. Between the names of the four caliphs, there were some empty frames with traces of a missing outer layer. The missing parts are believed to be with some inscriptions on the history of the building and be removed in the later time for unknown reasons. Another reconstruction of Dayahatyn was held in the 15th and 16th centuries. The high arched portal at the entrance was the product of that time. Its style is completely different from filigree brickwork of Seljuk period. The portal, without any decoration, is also made of bricks but in a larger size and yet not as high quality as the one in the 11th and 12th centuries.  Rediscovery  Along with the fall of the Silk Road, The Dayahatyn caravanserai lost its importance and was being abandoned. Since then, the former coaching inn became the shelter of no longer caravans, but sometimes military units and rare wanderers passed by. The gorgeous structure was forgotten by the history. Not until the year of 1840, an officer of the East India Company rediscovered the buildings during his trip from Herat to Khiva. He was the first European making a note on the caravanserai. In 1887, Leo Evgrafovich Dmitriev drew a picture of the caravanserai from the river side. Dayahatyn has its first photograph taken by Mikhail Chernyshevsky in 1899 and was first examined in 1920s by Alexander Marushchenko who laid the foundations of Turkmenistan archaeology. The first detailed study of Dayahatyn was carried out in 1950 by Anna Maksimovna Pribytkova, an architectural historian. Later, her colleague Galina A. Pugachenkova wrote the most fundamental work on the architectural history of Turkmenistan. She devotes many pages on the Dayahatyn and regards it as ‚Äúa sample of the mature style, which requires a functional rationale, constructive feasibility and artistic excellence as an integral whole‚Äù  Nowadays  Partially restored main gate of the Dayahatyn Caravansaray as of June 2015. = Importance = At its highest, there were thousands of different caravanserais scattered along the Silk Road. However, most of them have been completely demolished and only the masterpieces, like Dayahatyn, are left along the Silk Road. Its artistic excellence makes Dayahatyn the most fascinating caravanserai in Turkmenistan. It represents the gorgeous brickwork of the 11th century. It is also one of the most remarkable example of caravanserai architecture in Central Asia, along with Rabat-i Malik and Rabat-i Sharaf. These three caravanserais, with extraordinary artistic fineness, are believed to be the luxurious hotels along the Silk Road at that time. Among them, Dayahatyn retained its general contours to this day and has the highest integrity. As the structural layout is simply symmetrical, the missing parts of the buildings and decorations could be restored easily without any speculation based on the existing remains. The complete structure of caravanserai could always be easily recreated. Because of its architectural excellence and importance, Dayahatyn caravanserai is included in ‚ÄúThe Analytic and Systematic Regional Inventory of Caravanserais in Central Asia‚Äù, organised by National Commission for UNESCO. Since 2002, Dayahatyn has been the subject of photographic surveys and drawing up of architectural documents. Dayahatyn is also recommended for inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage List because of its significance on the Silk Road = Conservation = Since its rediscovery in the late 19th century, not much proper heritage management and protection had been done on Dayahatyn. Visitors' behaviours were not governed that carvings done by visitors could be seen on the walls. Only in the recent years, conservation and management projects on Dayahatyn began to carry out. In 2012, Dayahatyn is awarded with a conservation grant from ‚ÄúAmbassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation‚Äù from the U.S. Government. The conservation project would be administrated by the National administration for Protection, Research and Restoration of Historical and Cultural Monuments of Turkmenistan. The administration is also responsible for monitoring the regime for management and use of Dayahatyn caravanserai and coordinating relevant practical works, like archaeological surveys and rehabilitation. = Tourism = Tower and wall of the Dayahatyn caravansaray. As the Dayahatyn is located far from the common tourist routes and the movements of foreign visitors are still monitored by an extremely authoritarian government, the tourism development condition of Dayahatyn is not very favourable. Very few tourists would be able to make a visit there. In order to develop the tourism, Dayahatyn caravanserai is included in ‚ÄúThe Programme for tourism industry development in Turkmenistan in 2012-2016‚Äù. Within the programme, improvement works on tourism development in Dayahatyn would be carried out in the near future.

These paired belts develop along convergent plate boundaries where subduction is active. Each pair consists of one belt with a low-temperature, high-pressure metamorphic mineral assemblage, and another characterized by high-temperature, low-pressure metamorphic minerals. Historical background The concept of paired metamorphic belts was originally theorized by the Japanese geologist, Akiho Miyashiro in 1961. The parallel arrangement between the metamorphic belts and the similar ages of each belt, led Miyashiro to the idea that metamorphic belts formed together as pairs. The introduction of the paradigm of plate tectonics in the late 1960s, led to a better understanding of regional metamorphism and permitted the association between paired metamorphic belts and subduction zones. Conditions of formation The asymmetric deformation of earth's lithosphere along subduction zones produces two distinct thermal environments. These two distinct thermal conditions are parallel to the trend of the subduction zone. Low temperature, high pressure conditions are generated in the areas along the oceanic trench, whereas high temperature, low pressure conditions are generated beneath the arc region. A positive thermal gradient is visualized, extending from the colder oceanic trench to the warmer arc region. The thermal and barometric conditions within these 2 regions are recorded and preserved through distinct types of metamorphism and mineral assemblages. Mineral assemblages Detailed research on constraints of metamorphic mineral stability fields allows accurate inference of previous regional thermal and barometric conditions. *Low temperature, high pressure conditions are characterized by blueschist facies and eclogite facies. Common minerals include: lawsonite, garnet, glaucophane, coesite, pumpellyite, hematite. Such mineral assemblages indicate temperatures of 500-800 degree Celsius at pressure of 2.5-3.5 GPa. *High temperature, low pressure conditions are characterized by granulite facies and amphibolite facies. Common mineral include: sillimanite, quartz, cordierite, orthopyroxenes. Such a mineral assemblage is indicative of temperatures reaching 1000 degrees Celsius at pressure of 0.5-1.3 GPa. Geothermal gradient Metamorphic belts are a consequence of thermal perturbations, due to low temperature with respect to pressure ratios (dT/dP) in oceanic trenches and high temperature with respect to pressure ratios (dT/dP) in arcs. Paired metamorphic belts are the product of subducted colder crustal rocks, which are taken to depth, metamorphosed and then exhumed. However, if the rock unit is not exhumed relatively quickly after subduction ceases, the rock unit will re-equilibrate to the standard geothermal gradient and the geological record will be lost. Application Paired metamorphic belts permit the inference of subduction directions and relative plate motions at various points in the past. For example, the Ryoke/Sanbagawa paired metamorphic belt in eastern Japan displays a metamorphic sequence indicating a north-west subduction direction. Whereas the Hidaka/Kamuikotu paired metamorphic belt on the western coast of Japan exhibits opposite orientation, indicating a different subduction direction. Furthermore, by dating paired metamorphic belts, the origin of present-day tectonic subduction mechanisms (asymmetric subduction) can be inferred. Recent discoveries In recent years, greater knowledge of processes along convergent plate boundaries has caused skepticism about this simplistic model. Observations indicate convergent boundaries typically display oblique motion. The implications of such observations demonstrate the possibility that metamorphic belts could have formed in different sectors of the same subduction margin and became juxtaposed afterwards. Furthermore, accreting allochthonous terrains along subduction zones as a mechanism, encourages the skepticism. The contrasting metamorphic assemblages may have been produced from remote environments. Moreover, the realization that most metamorphic belts are not the product of a single geothermal gradient indicates a more complex mechanism.

Clemens/Twain lived in Nevada from 1861 to 1864, and visited the area twice after leaving. Historians such as Peter Messent see Clemens's time in Nevada as \\"the third major formative period of Mark Twain's career\\" (after his time in Hannibal and upon the Mississippi) due to his encounters with \\"writers and humorists who would both shape and put the finishing touches on his literary art.\\" The Routledge Encyclopedia of Mark Twain states that despite the few \\"disagreeable experiences\\" he had there, Twain \\"thrived in Nevada.\\" Among those things he learned was \\"how far he could push a joke\\", a lesson learned from some \\"disagreeable experiences\\" he brought upon himself. Arrival Having deserted the Marion Rangers (a small band of Confederate irregulars) due to a dislike of military life, Samuel Clemens was ready for a clean break with his past. He had lived in St. Louis for two weeks when he decided to accept his brother's offer that would provide this fresh start. Orion Clemens Samuel's brother Orion Clemens (who \\"had moved toward the position that slavery was morally wrong\\") had stumped for the presidential ticket of Abraham Lincoln in northern Missouri during the election of 1860 alongside St. Louis lawyer Edward Bates (whose law offices Orion had worked in during the 1840s). Lincoln made Bates his attorney general, and Bates recommended Orion to Secretary of State William H. Seward for a political appointment. This suggestion was accepted, and Orion was nominated by Lincoln to be secretary of the Nevada Territory on March 23, 1861 and was confirmed by the Senate on March 27, 1861. Despite a generous salary, no funds to relocate to Nevada were provided, and without the means to move, Orion struck a deal with Samuel that if he paid for their journey he would serve as Orion's private secretary. It was under this agreement that Samuel and Orion Clemens left for Carson City, Nevada on July 18, 1861 on an overland stagecoach leaving from St. Joseph, Missouri that would take 19 days to arrive. Each ticket was $150 (a month's wages from Orion's new job), Samuel paid the sum with money saved from when he was a riverboat pilot. The population of Carson City at the time was 2,000. Despite the fact that the Nevada Directory for 1861-62 listed Samuel Clemens with the prestigious title of assistant secretary of state, the job could not maintain his interest. He felt that there was not enough writing in the job to keep both his brother and him busy. He also bristled at being underneath Orion's authority referring to him in his letters as \\"his majesty the Secretary\\". Lingering Southern sympathies Samuel Clemens before the Civil War had considered joining the Know Nothings but joined the Constitutional Unionists made up of ex-Whigs who supported the Dred Scott decision (and won the majority of Southern border states in the election of 1860). Historian Arthur G. Pettit points out that \\"Clemens rejected even the moderate Democratic candidate Stephen Douglas, who carried Clemens's own state. Clemens's Southernism, in other words, was a matter of conscious choice as well as regional background.\\" Before the war Clemens held the Whig ideal of having both Union and slavery, but as things progressed he didn't have any problem with the idea that states could secede if they felt aggrieved. Pettit relates that, after Clemens's unhappy time in the irregular militia, he was glad to set out for Nevada rather \\"than to be at once a disloyal Northerner and a treasonous Southerner.\\" Historian Louis J. Budd states that Clemens was hardly alone in escaping the war in this manner \\"In fleeing west with his brother, Sam had plenty of company as, throughout the war years, many thousands of able-bodied men crossed the plains in the same direction.\\" Arriving in Nevada did not force Clemens to alter his convictions. While the territory was \\"aggressively dominated by Union men\\", there was a loud and well-organized Southern minority whose stronghold was in Virginia City (which had been named by Southerners). These supporters for Nevada secession even claimed victory in defeating a statehood proposal because it would allow entry to free blacks ‚Äì calling the bills defeat the \\"slaughter of that free nigger Constitution\\". As time went on, and the war began to shift for the benefit of Union forces, the weight of popular opinion did as well, and Samuel Clemens soon had to take stock of where he stood on the matter. Mining This Bonanza ore (from the Consolidated California and Virginia Mine, Comstock Lode) is an example of what Clemens mined. After seeing silver ore emerge from one of the mills of the Comstock Lode, Samuel Clemens (tired of working under his brother) began to spend much of his time in the mining districts of Humboldt and Esmeralda. Some of the towns he had an extended include Aurora and Unionville, Nevada (which had originally been named Dixie but had its name changed in 1861 after a close vote). In these areas, Clemens engaged in prospecting and working as a pocket miner with dreams of striking it rich. Clemens took up several partners, most notably was a partnership with Calvin Higbie (to whom the book Roughing It would be dedicated) and Robert Howland, working with an investment made by his brother Orion. Despite great dreams of success, none of Clemens efforts were overly successful. The rush of immigration to strip the area of silver had been ongoing since the spring of 1859, and Clemens attempt to strike it rich was very late. By the time he began mining, amateur efforts to strike it rich were hardly viable, value of shares in mining outfits was beginning to collapse from over speculation, and lawyers mitigating disputes were viewed as the only ones sure to make a fortune. In Roughing It, his stories about his time in Nevada and the West, Clemens and Higbe find a vein of silver that will make them millionaires and fill out the paperwork to make a legal claim, but they both get distracted and fail to do the upkeep necessary to keep the claim valid, and others are able to take it over and make fortunes. Historian R. Kent Rasmussen notes that there was a promising claim that the partners lost in 1862, and \\"Though their lost claim later proved valuable, it would not necessarily have made the men millionaires.\\" Rasmussen holds that \\"He magnified the episode enormously\\" for comic effect. Having found quartz-mining in search of silver difficult. Not finding enough to support himself, Clemens began working in a quartz mill shoveling tailings for small wages; he was unhappy with the work. Correspondent Antique printing press powered by flat-belt, overhead line shaft, preserved at the Mark Twain Museum at the Territorial Enterprise in Virginia City, NV In February 1862, Samuel Clemens began to send occasional letters to the major paper in the Nevada Territory, the Virginia City Daily Territorial Enterprise. By July, he was asking Orion if he could assist him in finding a job as a correspondent. In the fall, he was offered $25 per week to become the city editor of the Enterprise. The offer to be an editor was more than he had anticipated, and he worried about his \\"inexperience and consequent unfitness for the position.\\" Having been self-sufficient since he was 13 and worrying about falling into debt, Clemens accepted the job despite his worries. The Territorial Enterprise was run by its founding editor Joseph T. Goodman who mentored Clemens in his new role as editor. Goodman and his staff had enjoyed Clemens's letters that he had signed as \\"Josh\\", especially one that satirized the oratory of the territory's chief justice. It also may have seemed advantageous to employ someone with connections to the government. Clemens began covering \\"vice, the mines, ghost stories, social functions, and other intrigues (sometimes imaginary) in his local columns\\" for the Enterprise. By December 1862, he was reporting on the territorial legislature and courts in Carson City. Mark Twain's editor's desk preserved at the Mark Twain Territorial Enterprise Museum, Virginia City, NV One of his more popular pieces in 1862 was the unsigned \\"Petrified Man\\" in which Clemens claimed that a petrified man who had lived \\"close about a century ago\\" had been found \\"south of Gravelly Ford.\\" Historian Bruce Michelson concludes Twain used this hoax to both ridicule the local politician Sewall and mock a public who through gullibility were too quick to accept a mass of petrification reports. The humorous story quickly was picked up by other newspapers and spread east. In a letter dated February 3, 1863 to the Territorial Enterprise from Carson City, complaining about a lavish party that kept him \\"awake for forty-eight hours\\" Clemens signed his work \\"yours dreamily, MARK TWAIN\\", the first use of the name under which he would become famous. In May‚ÄìJune 1863, Twain made his first visit to San Francisco, travelling with Clement Rice ‚Äì eating and drinking throughout the city and making important literary connections. He visited again, alone, in September. During this time, Twain often got his letters re-published in papers throughout the region, and near the end of 1863, began contributing to The Golden Era, a San Francisco literary journal. =Shifting sympathies= When Clemens came to Virginia City, he began boasting that he had been a first lieutenant in the regular Confederate Army. It was soon found out that he had been merely a second lieutenant in a self- organized militia of Missouri farm boys. Because of this boast, Clemens offended people on both side of the issue, including his brother's boss, Territorial Governor James W. Nye, who called him a \\"damned secessionist.\\" Humboldt County judge G.T. Sewall swore he would whip Clemens for his sympathies if he ran across him. In a letter to his friend William H. Clagett, Clemens complained of the news that \\"they\\" (Union troops) had \\"thrashed\\" and defeated \\"our Missourians\\". William H. Clagett received letters from Twain that indicate his shifting sympathies about the Civil War. Clemens's behavior became an increasing embarrassment to his steadfastly loyal Republican brother Orion, as Samuel was seen as a disloyal troublemaker who spent too much time in the saloons. Samuel Clemens's attitude began to change in 1862 as the general opinion became more heavily Union when the Northern armies began winning more battles. Clemens began to hedge his Confederate sympathies, and then abandoned them outright. By September 1862, in his letters to Clagett, he began to refer to the Union soldiers as \\"we\\". The scrapbook Clemens kept while in Nevada initially was filled with newspaper articles that hailed secessionist opinions in the West, but by the end of 1862 he began pasting in editorials of leading citizens demanding that Orion purge the government of anyone with Southern sympathies. (Orion did fire a probate judge and notary public for this reason.) Samuel Clemens continued to collect articles about the results of people who expressed Southern sympathies that had just months before been tolerated. In July 1863, after a flag earlier planted on Mt. Davidson by Union supporters (to overlook Virginia City and mock its Southern sympathizers) survived an intense electrical storm, Clemens, now writing under his penname Mark Twain, presented its survival through the lightning strikes as a mystical omen of Union victory. With this, Twain publicly had shown his newly undivided devotion to the Union. He also portrayed an incident in San Francisco as an omen for the fall of the Confederate cause when all the lights suddenly went out at a meeting of Copperheads (Northern Democrats calling for immediate peace). Twain would go on to protest a clause in a proposed Nevada constitution to disfranchise any that voluntarily bore arms for the Confederacy, claiming that, even in his Missouri days, he always had an underlying affection for the Union. Historian Arthur G. Pettit points out that Twain mentally would separate his Southern values from his Confederate values, for \\"When loyalty to the Confederacy proved a handicap in the face of shifting Western opinion‚Äîespecially when it began to interfere with Clemens's main business in the West, which was to make money‚Äîit did not take him long to decide that dropping the Confederate South was a small price to pay‚Ä¶.Clemens was hardly the neophyte he made himself out to be in Roughing It.\\" =The Third House= Territorial Governor James W. Nye was often on the receiving end of Twain's roasts when he led the satirical \\"Third House\\". Twain's growing literary reputation and humor were celebrated by \\"the Third House\\" who were \\"an eccentric group of journalists, lawyers, bohemians and businessmen who mocked the legislative process.\\" The group \\"was bawdy, raucous, and satirical\\". The Third House met after the adjournment of the actual territorial legislature, so elected legislators could join as well. Sessions were held anywhere from saloons to the First Presbyterian Church. The name mocked the two houses of the legislature of the territorial government while invoking the common term for journalism \\"the Fourth Estate\\" (a check on governments to keep them honest). The gatherings of the Third House were in the name of humor; it acted as \\"a burlesque legislature...with both politicos and their characteristic lingo the butt of the jokes.\\" Because many members of government were present and prepared to be lampooned at the Third House, and as \\"drink flowed freely, the humor was rough and pointed.\\" With Twain comedically roasting even politicians he respected, all to be repeated shortly in the pages of the Enterprise. In December 1863, the members of the Third House elected Twain their \\"President of the Convention\\" as a jibe on the 1863 Nevada Constitutional Convention (working to make a state constitution, a necessary step to be granted statehood). Among those mocked by Twain was lawyer William Morris Stewart, a future U.S. senator and employer of Twain. This also served as a jibe on Territorial Governor James W. Nye, who was often outside the territory trying to gain supporters for Nevada statehood and his own political future. Nye's absences were covered by Orion Clemens acting in his stead, so electing Twain as the head of the Third House highlighted that his brother was forced to act as the head of the real government due to Nye's actions. =The Empire City Massacre Hoax= Twain's humor was not always appreciated, such as his hoax on October 28, 1863 called \\"A Bloody Massacre near Carson\\" (alternatively, the \\"Empire City Massacre Hoax\\"), purporting to detail the story of a man who loses \\"an immense amount in the Spring Valley Water Company of San Francisco\\" who in a deranged fit kills and scalps his wife and nine children. While the regular indicators were present that the piece was a joke, it was so bloody that it shocked the Enterprise readership and later caused the paper's trustworthiness to be brought into question. Other newspapers in the region, including the Gold Hill News and the San Francisco Bulletin, had picked up the story and presented it as factual. Despite Twain's retraction of the piece the next day, his critics held it against him for over a year. Many subscribers to the Enterprise canceled their subscriptions and turned to the Union, a rival newspaper The newspapers that had reprinted it were outraged, with the Bulletin demanding that Twain be fired. His offer to resign from the paper was refused by Joe Goodman, and his reputation continued to grow, some giving him the nickname the \\"Washoe Giant.\\" Artemus Ward Artemus Ward's prolonged visit to Virginia City had a deep impact on Twain. Twain attended many of the plays and entertainments that came to Virginia City and was invited to meet the famous actress Adah Isaacs Menken after a good review he wrote for her, but as the Routledge Encyclopedia of Mark Twain states: \\"Most importantly, he met Artemus Ward on his week-long visit to Virginia City in December 1863.\\" This visit had a lasting impact on Twain. Ward had come to deliver a lecture but stayed for three weeks into January 1864, drinking, eating oysters, and engaging in roof walking on the buildings of hilly Virginia City with Twain, and his friends Joe Goodman, and Dan De Quille (\\"jumping from one roof down to another\\"). Twain formed a fast friendship with Ward who offered him advice on his career. Ward encouraged Twain to aim higher than being a western journalist, and promised to speak to the editors of the New York Sunday Mercury about his work. Ward told Twain \\"to work into the Eastern publications immediately\\" and sent a letter of introduction for him to the editor of the Mercury. Ward told Twain he should relocate to New York, where he was going himself. Twain declined the offer to travel east with Ward. (Thanks to Ward's assistance Twain was able to publish two stories in the Mercury in 1864, and due to his encouragement Twain would later send his story The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County to New York in 1865 where it would become a national success.) Despite Ward's early death in March 1867, The Mark Twain Encyclopedia states: \\"His style, manner, and mantle‚Ä¶[were] adopted by others, including especially Mark Twain. ...the attitudes and persona of Ward were influential on Twain's literary comedy in both general and specific ways.\\" Political sway In January 1864, Twain began covering another legislative session in Carson City. Thanks in part to his familial political connections, Twain's political reporting, though still in a humorous vein, raised his reputation in the eyes of his reading audience as an important figure in public affairs. His satire and social criticism was directed at matters of importance for the community. With his growing audience and influence, politicians wished to stay on his good side rather than be ridiculed in the Enterprise. Historian Louis J. Budd points out that, while in later life, Twain \\"distorted the sober nature of this assignment [of covering the Legislature] by stressing the margin of irreverence with which he had carried it out\\" this was a comic recasting of reality. For while \\"His weekly letter for the Sunday trade was often playful and sometimes irresponsible. Day by day however he ground out factual accounts\\" with none of the comic color. Twain therefore \\"was deep in day to day realities\\" of how things got done in the Legislature and \\"he took side whenever possible\\". Twain tried to use his influence to aid in the cause to move the capital of Nevada out of Carson City to Virginia City, a move favored by his employer as well. The boasters of Carson City argued against such a move, and both sides \\"used every fair or foul maneuver\\" they could to support their cause. Twain's printed work in the Enterprise not only made charges of graft, with identities of the accused thinly veiled, but his positions on other matters also were calculated to support the cause. As historian Louis J. Budd points out, \\"A neat example of how he shifted tactics as strategy demanded lies in his comments on a bill to grant twenty thousand dollars to the Sierra Seminary, a private school in Carson City with about forty students. On January 14, 1864, he held that the 'money could not be more judiciously expended'; on February 16 he called the school 'a private affair,' hinted at boodling [political graft and fraud], and suggested support for a public mining college instead; on April 25 he had the gall to refer to the Sierra Seminary bill as a 'really worthy measure.'\\" The capital remained in Carson City, but Twain's treatment of the Sierra Seminary would come back later to haunt him. Death of niece On January 29, 1864, Twain's niece Jennie (born in 1855) fell ill to spotted fever. Twain, who was very close to the girl, had recently visited her class and written an article about it entitled \\"Miss Clapp's School\\"; he would later use the memories of this visit in his book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Twain, still in Carson City to cover the legislature, joined with his sister-in-law Mollie and his brother Orion at Jennie's bedside, continuously praying with the feverish girl. On February 1, 1864 at 6 p.m., she died when the disease progressed into meningitis. Twain and her parents had remained at her bedside. On February 3, the territorial legislature adjourned to attend the funeral. Orion and Mollie never had another child, and a general depression helped cause his political decline. Twain was grief-stricken over the loss, and remained bitter over it for the rest of his life. At the time, he directed his anger at the profession of undertakers, using his writing to claim they were corrupt. He continued to slam the profession for years to come. While Twain wanted to help Orion with his grief, he could not endure his brother's attempts to father him. The Sanitary Affair As Nevada was still a territory at this time, Twain's newspaper writing covered a political scene that was especially charged, as the regional government \\"had the delicate task of overseeing the transition to statehood at a time when other states were attempting to secede\\" during the Civil War. In this atmosphere, Twain's often satirical writing was seen as disloyal to the Union by people of influence, as \\"allying himself with the 'Peace Democrats' and the George B. McClellan ticket in 1864\\". Twain printed an especially poorly received piece of satire at the same time that he involved himself in an increasingly serious war of words, insults, and challenges with the editor of a competing paper. These coinciding incidents occurred in mid-1864 with both involving community fundraising for sanitary commissions (groups raising money for the care of wounded Union soldiers). The efforts were intended to send the money to the St. Louis Sanitary Fair that was occurring later that spring which was backed by the soon-to-be general of the Union Army Ulysses S. Grant and Frederick Law Olmsted. Twain received circulars about the fair from Pamela Moffett, and he wrote pieces for the Enterprise and the San Francisco Morning Call encouraging fundraising efforts for the event. =The Great Austin Flour Sack= Reuel Colt Gridley and his famous sack of flour One campaign to raise funds for the sanitary commission was run by Twain's friend Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War veteran and grocer Reuel Colt Gridley, whom he had known from his school days in Hannibal. The campaigning centered on a flour sack that Gridley carried around from town to town throughout the region. Individuals, groups, and towns would \\"bid\\"/donate to the \\"purchase\\" of the flour sack trying to out-contribute/\\"bid\\" each other, solely for the purpose of civic pride and \\"the pleasure of outbidding one's rivals, and in the briskly competitive West, this proved a clever incentive to pry open people's pocketbooks.\\" Gridley always maintained possession of the sack and would bring it with him to his next stop in the region. The flour sack had originally been part of a bet between Gridley and H.S. Herrick of the town of Austin, Nevada. While Gridley supported the Democratic party, his opponent supported the Republican party. The bet was over whose party's candidate would win the mayoral election. Gridley was running as the Democratic candidate and said that, if he lost, he would carry the sack on his back through town with a brass band playing John Brown's Body behind him, but if Herrick's candidate lost, Herrick would carry the sack with the band playing Dixie. After Gridley lost and held up his part of the bet, Herrick told him he didn't want the flour, and it was decided that it should be auctioned with the funds going to the sanitary commission. The winner of the first series of bids refused to take possession of the sack and instructed that he auction it again, to which he complied with the situation repeating itself into the night. Other communities learning of the event invited Gridley to \\"auction\\" the sack at their town, which Gridley did, making his own traveling fundraising campaign for the sanitary commission. On May 15, Gridley proceeded to Virginia City. Despite the size of the city (due to its populace being unprepared for his arrival and the lateness in the day when the \\"auction\\" started) less was raised than in the village of Austin. Gridley was convinced to stay overnight and the boasters of the sanitary commission made arrangements for greater publicity. The next day, Gridley was driven through Virginia City in an open carriage being led in a parade of city notables in their own carriages and accompanied by musical bands. Despite gathering a crowd, the procession left them in the dust and moved onto nearby villages. The citizens of Virginia City were directed to a public bulletin board being used to record the updates of what their neighbors contributed in an effort to goad civic rivalry. Twain went out with other reporters to catch up to Gridley and record the events meeting the procession at its first village stop of Gold Hill. He spent the day with Gridley's writing two long pieces for the Enterprise about the events. The sack then traveled to Silver City, Dayton and then was turned around to head back to Virginia City. The citizens of Virginia City were now clamoring to beat the amount raised by the smaller towns (having failed to previously). The growing enthusiasm was not limited to the people of Virginia City because, on his way back, Gridley was forced to stop again at Silver City and Gold Hill and let the towns bid again before proceeding to return to Virginia City. =Miscegenation hoax= With the local focus on fundraising for the Sanitary Commission, Twain decided to write a piece of satire that combined the story of the progress of the Great Austin Flour Sack with the events surrounding a May 5, 1864 Carson City fancy-dress ball held by prominent society ladies (including Mollie Clemens) to raise funds for the same purpose. The committee for the Sanitary Ball had held a debate about whether to send the funds raised to the Western Sanitary Commission of St. Louis or the U.S. Sanitary Commission of New York. Some members of the Ball committee did not like the idea of sending money to the St. Louis organization as a portion of the funds would be given to support the Freedmen's Aid Society. Twain learned of the debate either from his sister-in-law Mollie or his brother Orion. On May 16, 1864 with editor Joe Goodman out of town Twain's unsigned piece (entitled the \\"Grand Ball at Los Angeles Plata\\") made its way into the hands of the printer for the Enterprise and appeared in the paper on May 17. The piece asked why the Great Austin Flour Sack had not been taken to Carson City to raise funds there; it claimed \\"that the reason the Flour Sack was not taken from Dayton to Carson was because it was stated that the money raised at the Sanitary Fancy Dress Ball, recently held in Carson for the St. Louis Fair, had been diverted from its legitimate course, and was to be sent to aid a Miscegenation Society somewhere in the East; and it was feared the proceeds of the sack might be similarly disposed of.\\" The piece added cryptically that the claim was \\"a hoax, but not all a hoax, for an effort is being made to divert those funds from their proper course.\\" There was already a worry around collections for the Sanitary Fund; that they might be fraudulently collected and not being used for their stated purpose. Such suspicions even fell upon Reuel Gridley the organizer of Flour Sack fund drive, this despite the fact that his efforts were leaving him destitute. Even with such worries, it was Twain's use of the term \\"miscegenation\\" that made his statement so controversial. Despite the strong support of the idea that the Union must be preserved to preserve democracy itself, the idea of racial equality and sexual relations with members of a different race was seen as outrageous in Nevada as it was throughout most of the Union. At the time Nevada had a law fining \\"Cohabitation with Indians, Chinese, or Negroes\\" proscribing fines between 100 and 500 dollars or imprisonment from one to six months. Historian Ron Powers writes \\"The Emancipation Proclamation was less than two years old in the spring of 1864‚Ä¶Sentiment toward Negros, even on the \\"emancipating\\" side, was saturated with animosity, superstition, sexual fears and resentment: the liberators would soon have to compete with former slaves for work. Union-\\"secesh\\" tensions rippled through Washoe; fights erupted, shootings occurred over the question. Even though Union sympathy prevailed, few people accepted the notion that Negroes were equal to whites. Many pro- Union whites still resented black slaves for having made the war inevitable.\\" The term \\"miscegenation\\" had only recently been coined by Copperheads. The term first appeared in a pamphlet fraudulently claiming to be written by Lincoln supporters and crafted to try and discredit him during his bid for re- election. By the time of Twain's own miscegenation comment the fact that the pamphlet was a hoax was publicly known, \\"and Clemens used the term knowing its connections to Copperheadism.\\" Historian Joe B. Fulton points out that Twain's miscegenation comment was printed during the tense run up to the November 1864 elections. Fulton quotes Major G.W. Ingalls who recorded that at this time Lincoln's supports called the other side \\"traitors, 'secesh' [secessionists], and 'copperheads'\\" and the McClellan's supporters calling their opponents \\"'black Republicans,' 'abolitionists,' and 'nigger worshippers'\\". Twain would later claim that he had been intoxicated when he wrote the piece, but historian Fulton states \\"his article is best understood in the context of election year Copperhead hoaxes and of his own early efforts such as \\"A Bloody Massacre Near Carson,\\" \\"Petrified Man,\\" and his reporting for the Third House.\\" Historian James Melville Cox points out that by being willing to bring the Sanitary Fund's reputation into question and linking it to miscegenation this was a \\"somewhat \\"confederate\\" accusation‚Ä¶revealing that Mark Twain's humor still showed a native if not a partisan Southern cast.\\" Historian Arthur G. Pettit states that in Twain's shift to support the Union \\"He was probably relived to learn that coming down on the winning side did not require revision of his views about black people. Nevada Territory, like most of the West and the North, was anti-black as well as antislavery and enjoyed the usual nigger jokes. With his Southern background, vernacular skill, and tendency to search out off-color subject matter, Mark Twain was quickly attracted to this kind of humor. ‚Ä¶The most notorious example was the so-called Sanitary Fund episode, probably the most damaging incident of Mark Twain's Western career.\\" Historian Louis J. Budd also holds Twain's \\"latent Southern racism made possible his fatally clumsy wisecrack that local money for the Sanitary Fund would go to a \\"miscegenation society.\\" Historian Ben Tarnoff writes \\"Twain had located a sore spot in the collective psyche\\" the idea of sexual relations between the races \\"wasn't simply taboo; it also tapped an anxiety about the ultimate aim of the Civil War. ‚Ä¶When Twain joked that the money meant for the Sanitary Commission would instead be used for miscegenation, he articulated an awful fear festering in white minds throughout the Union: that the war would result in full equality for blacks, who would soon be taking white jobs, white land, white women.\\" The Routledge Encyclopedia of Mark Twain points out that as miscegenation was seen as a sexual vice and \\"provided tempting material for smutty humor, and in the earlier stages of his career Twain, not yet the vocal champion of racial justice he would become, tended to approach the subject of interracial liaisons with a measure of virile bawdry‚Ä¶It was a crude suggestion that the proceeds of the ladies' charity ball were to be used to fund a 'miscegenation Society'\\". Historian Ron Powers points out \\"Like his mother, the youthful Sam could be racially callous in the abstract--as in his miscegenation slur--but he could never stand the sight of racial cruelty.\\" While Twain wrote the piece as a harmless joke, he would soon find out that the ladies of the Ball and their supporters took the matter with deadly seriousness. Historian Stephanie LeMenager notes that by linking \\"the local women's fear of fiscal contamination by the Freeman's Society\\" to fear of a contamination by miscegenation \\"the hoax makes Carson City, Nevada, the first staging ground for Mark Twain's disruption of American racial manners.\\" =Contribution rivalry = On May 17, 1864, the same day that Twain's unsigned miscegenation hoax was appearing in the Enterprise, he wrote about the progress of the Great Austin Flour Sack when it was brought to be \\"auctioned\\" once again at Virginia City. With the sack again in Virginia City, Twain accompanied Gridley to observe the proceedings. Twain recorded that the second \\"auction\\" lasted two and a half hours, and \\"a population of fifteen thousand souls had paid in coin for a fifty-pound sack of flour a sum equal to forty thousand dollars in greenbacks! ‚Ä¶The grand total would have been twice as large, but the streets were very narrow, and hundreds who wanted to bid could not get within a block of the stand, and could not make themselves heard. ‚Ä¶This was the greatest day Virginia [City] ever saw, perhaps.\\" That night Twain wrote a letter to his mother and sister from the offices of the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise. He told them that there was a competition between his paper and the Virginia City Daily Union to \\"outbid\\" each other for the sack. He said he had strict orders from \\"the proprietors always to 'go them a hundred better'\\", and his paper was in the lead when he left to file his report. He had gotten word that a representative of the Union had returned and increased their bid by a hundred dollars. He wrote, \\"It was provoking. ‚Ä¶But I guess we'll make them hunt their holes yet, before we are done with them.\\" The piece Twain filed that night appeared on May 18, under the title \\"Travels and Fortunes of the Great Austin Sack of Flour.\\" At the time, the paper's editor Joe Goodman was away and had put Twain in charge. With no oversight Twain felt free to goad his paper's rivals, publishing his unsigned letter asking, \\"How Is It?‚ÄîWhile we had no representative at the mass meeting on Monday evening, the UNION overbid us for the flour‚Ä¶we are told that the Union (or its employees, whichever it is,) has repudiated the bid. We would like to know about his matter, if we may make so free\\". If the piece was supposed to be a joke, the staff of the Union were not amused and would soon be letting Twain know of their displeasure. Historian Louis J. Budd points out that previously Twain was \\"usually following the line marked out by the Enterprise editorials‚Ä¶[while] he crisply judged the factional moves within the Union party\\", but by the time of Twain's remarks about the Daily Union, \\"Nevadans [had] started drifting away from Union party harmony and toward Democratic and Republican poles\\" with the Daily Union and Enterprise in opposition to each other. =Editorial troubles= While Twain was calling the honor of the staff of the Union into question in the May 18, 1864 issue of the Enterprise, the president, vice president, treasurer, and secretary of the Sanitary Ball committee sent a letter to his paper denouncing his article as \\"a tissue of falsehoods‚Ä¶made for malicious purposes.\\" When it arrived at the Enterprise, Joe Goodman having returned decided to ignore the letter in hopes that the uproar would defuse of its own accord. Just as he did during the fallout from Twain's \\"A Bloody Massacre near Carson\\" hoax, Goodman continued to stand by Twain. The Union responded to Twain's piece wondering if they had rescinded their donation by publishing their own angry letter (presumably written by its co-owner and editor James L. Laird) on May 19 entitled \\"How Is It? ‚Äì How It Is\\" signed \\"Printer.\\" It was full of harsh words for Twain's piece, saying, \\"Such an item could only emanate from a person whose employer can find in his services a machine very suitable to his own manliness.\\" The piece also accused Twain of dealing in \\"Unmanly public journalism.\\" Historian Jerome Loving points out that Twain's problems in Virginia City occurred when he was acting editor-in-chief for an absentee, mirroring the difficulties he got himself into when working in Hannibal for Orion's newspaper and publishing a controversial piece mocking the editor of a rival paper (resulting in a situation that would've ended in a duel except for Twain's youth). On May 20, 1864, the same day as his final piece about the travels of the Flour Sack appeared in a piece that was picked up by San Francisco Bulletin (as the campaign had indeed moved to Carson City before widening its sights to include California), the angry letter from the ladies of the Sanitary Ball of Carson City arrived at the Enterprise. Now aware of the mounting opposition to him in Carson City, Twain wrote his sister-in-law Mollie Clemens. Letter to Mollie Mollie, still grieving over the death of her only child, had found herself ostracized from Carson City society, as the ladies had figured out that Twain was the author of the miscegenation hoax. Historian Ron Powers points out that Twain wrote an anguished letter to Mollie \\"not to apologize for the mortification he'd caused, nor to promise that he would assume public responsibility. He was preoccupied with the damage that the committee women's letter could do to him.\\" Twain told Mollie that he \\"had nothing but trouble & vexation since the Sanitary trip, & now this letter comes to aggravate me a thousand times worse. It if were from a man, I would answer it with a [dueling] challenge, as the easiest way of getting out of a bad scrape, although I know I am in the wrong & would not be justified in doing such a thing.\\" Dan DeQuille questioned the wisdom of Twain publishing the hoax. The composing table of the Territorial Enterprise preserved at the Mark Twain Territorial Enterprise Museum in Virginia City, NV In the letter, Twain admitted he wrote \\"the squib\\" but claimed he had heard the \\"rumor\\" at the auction when it was \\"said in drunken jest\\" by people he refused to name. He told Mollie he \\"was not sober\\" when he wrote the piece and presented it at the Enterprise to Dan De Quille (the pen name of William Wright). De Quille looked it over and asked \\"Is this a joke?\\" When told it was, De Quille said \\"he would not like such a joke as that to be perpetrated upon him, & that it would wound the feelings of the ladies of Carson. He asked me if I wanted to do that, & I said, 'No, of course not.'\\" Twain had placed the piece on the editing table and he and De Quille forgot about it as they made plans and then proceeded to the theater. Twain theorized that it was found by the foreman of the printing press while looking to see if there was a further copy to print. The foreman seeing that the piece was not only about \\"the Sanitary spree\\" surrounding the Flour Sack, but was written in the hand of the acting editor in chief, so he published it without Twain's knowledge. As he did not bother to read the Enterprise every day, Twain told Mollie he had no knowledge that the piece had made the paper until the paper received the angry reply from the ladies of Carson City. Twain told Mollie he was stuck and unable to do anything to resolve the situation, for he couldn't admit \\"that I & all concerned were drunk. No‚ÄîI'll die first.\\" He asked Mollie to \\"Either satisfy those ladies that I dealt honorably by them when I consented to let Dan suppress that article‚Ä¶or else make them appoint a man to avenge the wrong done them, with weapons in fair & open field. They will understand at a glance that I cannot submit to the humiliation of publishing myself a liar\\". Protocol for a duel The next day, May 21, 1864, Virginia City's Union editor Laird let loose again, saying Twain \\"had no gentlemanly sense of professional propriety\\" conveying with \\"every word, and in every purpose of all his words, such a groveling disregard for truth, decency and courtesy, as to seem to court the distinction only of being understood as a vulgar liar.\\" Laird said Twain was one of those men who \\"prefers falsehood; whose instincts are all toward falsehood; whose thought is falsification; whose aim is vilification through insincere professions of honesty\\". That afternoon Twain formally challenged Laird to a duel. Twain who had begun carrying a pistol again sent Laird a note, verifying that he was the author of the piece the Union railed against, and demanded he publicly retract his paper's \\"insulting\\" response. Historian Roy Jr. Morris states that \\"although he could scarcely hold a pistol in his hand without threatening to shoot himself in the foot, he felt honor-bound to reply in kind to Laird's inflammatory words.\\" Thomas Fitch, previous editor for the Virginia Daily Union, had been recently crippled in a duel with the editor of the Enterprise. Laird was incensed to receive such a demand from Twain, from (as historian Ron Powers puts it) \\"the reigning loudmouth of Washoe, still infamous from the Carson massacre hoax\\". This was especially irritating as eight months earlier the regular Enterprise editor-in-chief Joe Goodman had gotten into a heated war of printed words with one of Laird's Union editors (Thomas Fitch) and crippled his knee in a pistol duel at Stampede Valley. Throughout that day and into the night private correspondence traveled between the Union and the Enterprise addressing the issue of insulted dignity and proceeded further along in the protocol towards a formal duel. J.W. Wilmington a printer for the Union and a war veteran who had seen action at the Battle of Shiloh wrote Twain claiming it was he not Laird who had written the piece that threw Twain's manhood into question. Twain ignored this and wrote back to Laird \\"...any further attempt to make a catspaw of any other individual and thus shirk a responsibility that you had previously assumed will show that you are a cowardly sneak. I now peremptorily demand of you the satisfaction due to a gentleman--without alternative.\\" Laird responded saying \\"Mr. Wilmington has a prior claim upon your attention. When he is through with you, I shall be at your service.\\" He also accused Twain of a \\"groveling disrespect for truth, decency, and courtesy.\\" Twain responded, writing \\"...[I]f you do not wish yourself posted as a coward, you will at once accept my peremptory challenge, which I now reiterate.\\" Historian Fred Nixon points out the escalation Twain invoked by his choice of words, \\"Whereas the first challenge was an 'alternative' challenge, which could be satisfied by an apology, this one [a peremptory challenge] could be satisfied only on the field of honor.\\" Twain passed Wilmington's letter to his friend and Enterprise printer Mississippi-born Steve Gillis. Despite being under five feet tall and weighing only 95 pounds, Gillis had a scary reputation as a saloon brawler. Gillis acting as Twain's dueling second, wrote Wilmington saying \\"A contemptible ass and coward like yourself should only meddle in the affairs of gentlemen when called upon to do so.\\" Wilmington begged off saying that he \\"had written the communication only in defense of the craft, and did not desire a quarrel with a member of that craft\\". Letter to Ellen Cutler While still awaiting satisfaction from Laird, Twain tried to repair the damage done to the feelings of the ladies of the Carson City Sanitary Fair. On May 23, 1864 Twain wrote to Ellen G. (Mrs. William K.) Cutler, a signer of the letter blasting the author of the miscegenation hoax. He apologized for not responding sooner to the letter as it \\"came at a moment when I was in the midst of what ought to have been a deadly quarrel with the publishers of the Union\\". Mrs. Cutler was the only one among the Carson City society ladies that had not ostracized Mollie Clemens, for which Twain thanked her. Twain promised that he would \\"say a word or two to show the ladies that I did not wilfully and maliciously do them a wrong.\\" A public \\"retraction\\" and escalation Trying to put an end to the problems caused by the Miscegenation hoax, on May 24, 1864 Twain published a round-about unsigned apology in the Enterprise. Historian Ron Powers quotes portions of the letter in a summary of the piece indicating Twain's attempt to defuse responsibility for the piece: \\"yes, 'we' published a rumor, and yes, it was a hoax, but 'we' stated as much, 'And it was‚Äîwe were perfectly right.' 'We' were sorry for the 'misfortune,' and 'we venture to apologize for it,' and so on.\\" That same day having received no response from Laird that satisfied his wounded dignity, Twain also published all of their private correspondence over the matter in the Enterprise. In the now publicly printed correspondence and in an afterword following it Twain called Laird \\"putrid,..grovleing, vulgar liar\\", an \\"ass\\", inflicted by such a condition through \\"general principles\\" and from \\"natural instinct\\". Laird's correspondence called Twain \\"a liar, a poltroon, and a puppy\\" and called into question his war conduct. Twain demanded Laird's \\"craven carcass\\" apologize at once for being an \\"unmitigated liar\\" or give him \\"the satisfaction due to a gentleman.\\" In the following days papers from around the territory reprinted the letters, some mocking the originator of the bloody Carson Massacre hoax for getting himself into a situation that would end with his own blood. Historian James Melville Cox puts forward that the newspaper audience aware that there was a law against dueling in the Territory (one that wasn't strictly enforced), likely saw the \\"journalistic invective‚Ä¶[as] one legal way of retaining the satisfaction of a forbidden ritual‚Ä¶[with] the bombastic exchange of published threats and challenges promising a duel‚Ä¶[as] a burlesque of the duel itself. Thus the 'publication' provided amusement for Enterprise readers\\", similar to Twain's political burlesques as head of the Third House. Historian Ron Powers sees Twain's behavior concerning Laird not as burlesque but as \\"dark, deadly stuff\\", \\"reckless\\", and \\"downright suicidal\\". Powers holds that Twain had not blundered along into increasing trouble but that \\"This was apparently what Sam was looking for: an excuse to unleash the defining ritual of southern manhood, the code duello. ‚Ä¶Sam seems to have viewed dueling as a kind of hovering fate, onerous but inevitable, an obligation that must sooner or later be met to confirm his manhood. He was twenty-eight in 1864, a man now, but a man with a 'soft' calling in a violent, obsessively masculine society. ‚Ä¶the more apparent his lack of resolve became to him, the more he tried to mask it with belligerent posturing.\\"  Sanitary Ball grievances letter published The next day May 25, 1864 apparently not satisfied by the half-hearted, unsigned, and tardy apology, the damaging letter from the ladies of the Carson City Sanitary Ball that Twain and Goodman had refused to print in the Enterprise, began a three-day run in the Union as a paid public notice with the title \\"The Enterprise Libel of the ladies of Carson.\\" Besides questioning Twain's integrity and honesty, the letter stressed \\"one thing was decided [about the funds raised], that they should go to the aid of the sick and wounded soldiers, who are fighting the battles of our country, and for no other purpose.\\" It also accused Twain and his fellows of being \\"desirous of acquiring some glory by appropriating the efforts of the ladies to themselves.\\" Historian Jerome Loving points out that in the ladies' response \\"the subjects of race or slavery never entered the discussion.\\" Letters to Orion & plans to leave In a letter that day to Mollie and Orion (who was the head of the Ormsby County Sanitary Committee), Twain apologized if his actions had caused any decrease in their popularity. He also advised them against \\"making speeches for the Fund. I am mighty sick of that fund‚Äîit has caused me all my d[amne]d troubles--& I shall leave the Territory when your first speech is announced, & leave it for good.\\" He related that he was \\"open to a challenge from three persons, & already awaiting the issue of such a message to another\\". He considered the matter of the ladies of the Sanitary Ball closed with the previous day's apology \\"they got out of me what no man would ever have got‚Ä¶as [far as the letter from the ladies of] Carson is concerned. I shall take no notice of it all, except to mash Mr. Laird over the head with my revolver for publishing it if I meet him today‚Ä¶[as for the Sanitary Ball ladies] I am quits with them. \\" On May 26, 1864 Twain wrote his brother asking if he could \\"Send me two hundred dollars if you can spare it comfortably. However, never mind‚Äîyou can send it to San Francisco if you prefer. Steve & I are going to the States. We leave Sunday morning per Henness Pass. Say nothing about it, of course. We are not afraid of the grand jury, but Washoe has long since grown irksome to us, & we want to leave it anyhow.\\" The route through the pass was the longer less direct one, but it was the one that bypassed Carson City altogether. Twain's mention of the Grand Jury indicates that all the regional reprints of his dueling challenges to Laird had come to the attention of the governmental authorities. The Nevada Territory had passed a law against dueling in November 1861 (An Act concerning Crimes and Punishments, section 35) making dueling punishable by a sentence of two to ten years imprisonment for the issuer and the receiver of the challenge. Grand Jury foreman Jerry Driscoll, who previously had been a business manager of the Enterprise told Twain that his opponents were going to lodge a criminal complaint about his challenge. In his letter, Twain told his brother that \\"thoroughly canvassed the Carson business, & concluded we dare not do anything, either to Laird or Carson men without spoiling our chances of getting away.\\" Despite his haste Twain stated that he would put his plans on hold if challenged to the field of honor by an angry spouse \\"if there is any chance of the husbands of those [Carson City] women challenging me, I don't want a straw put in the way of it. I'll wait for them a month, if necessary, & fight them with any weapon they choose.\\" Challenged to a second duel Twain would soon have his chance to duel an angry husband from Carson City, when on May 28, 1864 William K. Cutler arrived at Virginia City and sent him a note issuing a formal duel challenge. Historian Louis J. Budd points out that Mrs. Cutler was one of the founders of the Sierra Seminary that \\"had suffered from his opinions only weeks before\\", which may explain Cutler's challenge despite Twain's letter to his wife and the public retraction in the Enterprise. After receiving Twain's personal letter, Mrs. Cutler had also reversed her previous behavior and joined the other high-society ladies in ostracizing Mollie Clemens. Twain wound up pasting four different duel challenges from angry Carson City husbands in his scrap book next to a clipping of the reluctant apology/retraction he made in the Enterprise. In response to the challenge, he sent Steve Gillis to speak to Cutler who was awaiting Twain's response at the hotel. Gillis delivered a letter from Twain saying \\"Having apologized once for that offensive conduct, I shall not do it again.\\" He said he had received Cutler's challenge, and \\"I am ready to accept it. Having made my arrangements‚Äîbefore I received your note‚Äîto leave for California, & having no time to fool away on a common bummer like you, I want an immediate reply to this.\\" Whether Cutler was mollified by the idea that Twain was leaving or was intimidated by Gillis (as Twain later claimed in his Autobiography) he dropped the matter and returned to Carson City. Exiting Nevada Territory On Sunday May 29, 1864, Mark Twain, having quit the Enterprise, boarded the stagecoach with his friend Steve Gillis and began his journey out of the Nevada Territory to San Francisco; no duel was fought. The Territorial Enterprise wished him well, writing \\"Mark Twain leaves this morning for San Francisco. Sorry to see you go, Mark, old boy‚Äîbut we cannot expect to have you always with us. Go then, where duty calls you, and when the highest pinnacle of fame affords you a arresting place remember that in the land of silver and sagebrush there are a host of old friends that rejoice in your success.\\" Historian James Edward Caron notes that outside of his friends and the staff of the Enterprise many were upset at \\"Clemen's unforgivable habit of conflating news narratives with fictional narratives, presented with the supremely blithe attitude of his alter ego Mark Twain. Some simply could not forgive Clemens for being a newspaper reporter who seemed completely indifferent to telling the truth\\". Among those expressing such sentiments at the time was the Gold Hill Evening News which was among the papers glad to see him leave. In an editorial appearing on May 30, 1864 they wrote \\"Among the few immortal names of the departed‚Äîthat is, those who departed yesterday morning per California stage‚Äîwe notice that of Mark Twain. We don't wonder. Mark Twain's beard is full of dirt, and his face is black before the people of Washoe. Giving way to the idiosyncratic eccentricities of an erratic mind, Mark has indulged in the game infernal‚Äîin short, 'played hell.' ‚Ä¶The indignation aroused by his enormities has been too crushing to be borne by any living man, though sheathed with the brass and triple cheek of Mark Twain.\\" Later visit to Nevada Twain would only be able to repair the situation in 1866 when after rising to fame due to his lectures on his travels in Hawaii (also called the Sandwich Islands). After giving his lectures in many California cities and towns, he proceeded back into the young state of Nevada. On October 31, 1866 he performed his humorous lecture before a packed house in Virginia City. He was hesitant to go to the lecture arranged for Carson City that was scheduled for November 3, due to worries of lingering anger over his miscegenation hoax. His fears were ended by a public invitation printed in the Enterprise signed by the governor Henry G. Blasdel and more than 100 leading citizens of Carson City, including two husbands of the Sanitary Commission ladies, saying that they had \\"none other than the most kindly remembrances of you\\" and encouraging him to perform in their town. In response, he published a letter in the Enterprise thanking them for their tolerance \\"of one who has shamefully deserted the high office of Governor of the Third House of Nevada and gone into the Missionary business\\" and pledging to \\"disgorge a few lies and as much truth as I can pump out without damaging my constitution.\\" Twain arrived in Carson City and played to a roaring crowd. =Armed robbery prank= Twain's triumphant return to Nevada was slightly marred in his estimation due to a surprising incident. On a trip back from Gold Hill (where he had given his lecture on November 10) to Virginia City. Twain and his literary agent Denis McCarthy (a one-time co-proprietor at the Enterprise) were making the five mile journey at night in an area where only two days before a pair of stagecoaches had been robbed at gunpoint. Suddenly six masked men flourishing revolvers emerged from the dark stopping Twain and his companion. They shouted things like \\"\\"Throttle him! Gag him! Kill him!\\" The leader of the men held a pistol to Twain's head ordering his accomplices \\"Beauregard,\\" \\"Stonewall Jackson,\\" and \\"Phil Sheridan\\" to empty their victim's pockets. They took $125 in cash from Twain, his $300 gold watch (the present from the Third House), two jackknives and three lead pencils ‚Äì leaving his pockets empty. Later it was revealed that the \\"robbers\\" were Steve Gillis and some friends, who had let Twain's companion McCarthy in on the joke beforehand. Twain had a restless angry night, before he was told the truth in the morning. Gillis and friends stated that they had merely wanted to give Twain more material, and perhaps get him to give another lecture in Virginia City. Twain who had been shaken and remained seriously upset that they used real revolvers, tried to put on a brave face on the incident in his writing saying \\"they did not really frighten me bad enough to make their enjoyment worth the trouble they had taken.\\" One of the pranksters differed with his take, saying Twain \\"was the scaredest man west of the Mississippi\\". Twain did have his possessions returned, but he fired McCarthy as his agent anyway. Final visit The last time Twain traveled to Nevada was in 1868 on another lecture tour, this time about his voyage aboard the Quaker City and arrival in Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine which he called the Holy Land and which would be the basis for his book The Innocents Abroad. His performances were held in Carson City on April 29 and 30. Recollections Twain wrote out stories of his time in Nevada and the West in his book Roughing It. Twain used his memories of his time in Nevada as one of the sources for his book about living in the American West called Roughing It, which was published in 1872. Historian Ron Powers points out that in particular, \\"The [Sanitary Commission] affair continued to vex him long afterward, and he treated it with careful levity in his writings. He can barely bring himself to touch on it in Roughing It\\", claiming he omitted it out of boredom. Twain wrote a humorous sketch about the affair titled \\"How I Escaped Being Killed in a Duel\\" that appeared in Every Saturday on December 21, 1872, and was retold in lectures for Roughing It, in Tom Hood's Comic Annual for 1873 and in his autobiographical dictation in 1906. In his autobiography, as Powers points out, \\"he treats the whole matter facetiously, as a kind of boys-will be boys romp in the Wild West. Dueling was a 'fashion'\\" where, despite his indifference to dueling, he got caught up in it \\"more or less out of boredom\\". The Mark Twain Encyclopedia points out that, in his later characterizations of the American South, Twain pointed to dueling \\"as an example of a culture's entrapment in outworn traditions.\\" In Twain's tales about the duel Rollin M. Daggett wrote up the challenges to Laird for him, and Laird backed out when Steve Gillis shot the head off a sparrow and told Laird's second that Twain had done the same feat from thirty yards. A similar version of events was told by Steve Gillis himself late in his life (though with contradictions in detail such as saying Laird was with the Chronicle rather than the Union at the time, the bird being a mud-hen, and him giving Twain the pistol after the shooting to fool Laird's seconds and telling him Twain made the shot himself rather than had bettered the shot earlier). Gillis also stated that Twain \\"was averse to violence\\" but \\"we thought it about time that his baptism took place‚Ä¶we finally prevailed upon him to send Laird a challenge, and when Laird did not send a reply at once we insisted on Mark sending him another challenge, by which time he had made himself believe that he really wanted to fight, as much as we wanted him to do.\\" In Gillis' version Laird \\"took back all he had said\\" not in the paper but verbally and this was accepted by Twain. Gillis also claimed Twain sent the challenge to Cutler after he \\"had written Sam an insulting letter\\" but nothing came of it because \\"Cutler was out of town at the time\\" the day they left Nevada. Another Virginia City local, Tom Fitch (crippled by Goodman in a previous duel), claimed Laird was \\"an arrant coward\\" who had failed in his effort to sell him the Union after receiving Twain's challenge, on the condition that when he took over the paper he assumed responsibility for engaging in the duel. Some historians such as the authors of The Routledge Encyclopedia of Mark Twain point out that \\"There is no evidence to corroborate Twain's story of the pistol-practice session that induced Laird to decline the combat\\", concluding that this version of events was \\"A work, apparently, of Twain's comic imagination\\". Historians Forrest Glen Robinson and Leland Krauth also view these accounts as highly fictionalized reconstructions, \\"portraying Clemens as much less the fool and the coward than he was in fact. For example, not once is there mention of his editorial reference to the 'miscegenation society'\\". Krauth sees it as an example that \\"illuminate[s] the process whereby Mark Twain characteristically purged through his art that which was painful and humiliating in Sam Clemen's past,\\" by \\"purging drunkenness, sex, and violence\\" while he \\"imposes on the whole of Roughing It a posture of propriety\\". Krauth notes that despite Twain's effort, he is never quite capable of purging \\"sexist, racist, and elitist\\" views of the Victorian culture of his times, (including in Puddn'head Wilson were Twain returned to the subject of miscegenation, where he underlined the absurdity of equating equality with racial purity but in the end re-establishes the acceptability of doing so). When dictating his autobiography for the North American Review (published in 1906-1907) Twain presented the events around his stay in Virginia City and the episode of the duel again in a humorous way. But he did make a remark in his dictation that reflects something else saying \\"I was ashamed of myself, the rest of the staff were ashamed of me‚Äîbut I got along well enough. I had always been accustomed to feeling ashamed of myself, for one thing or another, so there was no novelty for me in the situation.\\" Historian Forrest Glen Robinson says this is an example of \\"what we know about poor Clemens's tyrannical conscience, and his virtual incapacity to forgive himself for any of the real and imagined wrongs that lurked, undying, in his memory.\\" Twain is both humiliated by his participating in the irrational code duello and for not participating in it enough ‚Äì leaving town; leaving him with nothing but \\"profound self-contempt‚Ä¶an anguish that needed telling but that was too shameful for direct expression\\". Impact of Nevada Twain's stay in Nevada was a formative period in his personal growth in examining his culture and himself, and in his growth as a writer and a professional. Historian Ivan Benson points this out at length, stating that \\"Even without the editorial Troubles of May 1864 Mark Twain would not have remained on the Comstock Lode indefinitely. ‚Ä¶However, the two years on the Comstock Lode as a reporter on the Territorial Enterprise had definitely contributed to Mark Twain's development as a writer.\\" The Enterprise \\"had given him virtually a free rein\\" and let him make use of their influence and reputation to gather an audience. Not only did Samuel Clemens invent Mark Twain in his work for Nevada's Enterprise, but it was with their assistance that \\"he first attracted a reading public beyond his own locality, his work gaining the notice even of Eastern publications.\\" Before coming to Nevada Samuel Clemens had tried three apprenticeships, with none of them panning out as a profession; \\"When Mark Twain left the Comstock Lode, he had served his final apprenticeship; he had made writing his career.\\" Thanks to his time in Nevada, Twain was able to enter easily into the Bohemian literary society of San Francisco in May, 1864 and \\"required no apology‚Ä¶His work as a writer on the Territorial Enterprise had given him wide notoriety, and in previous visits to San Francisco he had been treated as a celebrity.\\" Historian Ron Powers states that when Twain left Nevada he \\"drew the curtain of charity over the wildest, most irresponsible and dangerous period of his life. ‚Ä¶But this dangerous interval was also the most important gestative period of his writing life. Sam discovered the true essence of his craft‚Ä¶\\" References Nevada Twain Twain Twain Twain, Mark ","title":"Mark Twain in Nevada"},{"id":"42460840","text":"Warlmanpa Sign Language is a highly developed Australian Aboriginal sign language used by the Warlmanpa people of northern Australia  Documentation  The first recorded documentation of Warlmanpa Sign Language was carried out by British linguist Adam Kendon.

In addition, the majority of signs are performed with only one hand and the range of handshapes and body locations used are significantly different.Kendon 1988, pp. 100-101. = Parameters = In documentation of Warlmanpa signs, Kendon and researchers followed the approach originally developed by William Stokoe for the description of signs in ASL. In this sense, signs are regarded as actions which can be viewed in terms of three aspects: what is performing the action, the action taken and where the action is done. These aspects are named Sign Actor, Sign Action, and Sign Location, respectively. = Sign Actor, Action, and Location=  Sign Actor  The body parts manipulated in the production of the sign and how they are organized during production.  Sign Action  The pattern of action that is employed to produce the sign.  Sign Location  Where the utilized body parts are placed as they carry out the action performed. = Formula = The Stokoe notation, a phonemic script used for writing down sign languages, was adapted by Kendon for use in recording Australian Aboriginal signs.Kendon 1988, p. 104. The formula is arranged in a special order where L is Sign Location; ap, HS, and OR are the three components of the Sign Actor, arm position, hand shape, and orientation, respectively; AC is the Sign Action.Kendon 1988, p. 104.  Grammar  Many verbs in spoken Warlmanpa are compounds of a root verb and a preverb. This compound morphology is reflected in Warlmanpa Sign Language.Kendon 1988, p. 116.  Use  The use of sign language across Australia is less common amongst men and is typically associated with women.Kendon 1988, p. 57. Its use within the Warlmanpa is limited to traditional ceremonies and situations where speech is considered taboo. = Speech taboo = Traditional practices in Warlmanpa society, such as initiation ceremonies or mourning, often place limitations on (or even restrict) the use of speech. Initiation ceremonies For young males in Aboriginal society, an initiation ceremony signifies their transition into manhood. Restrictions are placed on communication and behavior as a male undergoes this process and a state of \\"semi-death\\" is observed (since the dead cannot speak). In some societies, such as the Lardiil, these restrictions may last up to 6 months.Kendon 1988, p. 64. Mourning The death of a family member is strongly observed in Aboriginal society. Relatives of the deceased are often subject to speech bans. These bans are especially strict on female relatives, who may not use any form of speech to communicate. In some cases, such as in the Warumungu, these restrictions may extend for as long as two years. Avoidance relationships Avoidance relationships are highly observed within Aboriginal society. For example, the avoidance between a son/daughter-in-law with their mother-in-law serves as a common case. Avoidance speech is the most likely way to communicate with one's mother-in- law. It has been observed that sign language can be used as form of communication in these situations, though only rarely.Kendon 1988, p. 66.

Built in 1908 as part of a gentleman's farm, it is a reconstruction of a late-18th century farmhouse, and a good example of Georgian Revival architecture. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Joseph Gowing Farm is located in a rural setting of southeastern Dublin, on the west side of Page Road about southwest of its junction with Windmill Hill Road. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade faces east, and has a slightly asymmetrical arrangement of windows around the center entrance. The entry is framed by pilasters and a corniced entablature. The building is connected by a single-story ell to a large 19th-century barn with cupola. The house was built in 1908, reconstructing a c. 1793 farmhouse that was destroyed by fire. It was built by Louis Cabot, an industrialist who owned a large gentleman's farm, whose manager occupied this house. The structure is technically Georgian Revival, as it is a reconstruction, but it is supposedly faithful to the original, which had added Federal style details, including corner pilasters and a bracketed cornice. The original house, in addition to its association with the locally prominent Gowing family, was also owned by Governor Samuel Hale before becoming part of the Cabot farm.

Early life Flying Above Kirkuk, Kurdistan (1919) (Art.IWM ART 4637) Sydney Carline was born in London, the son of the artist George Francis Carline and Annie Smith (1862-1945). His brother, Richard Carline and his sister Hilda were also artists, as was his sister-in-law, Nancy (n√©e Higgins), and his brother-in-law, Stanley Spencer. Sydney Carline was educated at Repton School before he studied at the Slade School of Art, between 1907 and 1910, and then in Paris. In 1914 he spent time painting in Westmoreland. World War One When the First World War began Carline joined the British army and trained as a dispatch rider until, in 1916, he became a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps. He was shot down, and wounded, over the Somme but survived and went on to pilot a Sopwith Camel fighter on the Italian Front in late 1917. During the first years of the war, during intervals in his war duties, Carline worked on the design of a medal commemorating the Battle of Jutland and also a design for a 'Next of Kin' medal. During his time in Italy he established a studio in a museum building in Vicenza and had, on an unofficial basis, been sketching combat scenes since February 1918. His brother, Richard, put him forward to be an official war artist and, in that capacity, he painted aerial battles on the Italian front from July to November 1918, usually sketching from a Sopwith Camel.. The Destruction of the Turkish Transport in the Gorge of the Wadi Fara, Palestine Flying Over the Desert at Sunset, Mesopotamia (1919) (Art.IWM ART 4623) In January 1919 both brothers were sent to the Middle East by the Imperial War Museum, as official war artists for the Royal Air Force with a brief to depict aerial combat. The brothers arrived in Port Said in January 1919 and then travelled to Ramleh where they were based with No. 1 Squadron of the Australian Flying Corps. From there they moved to Jerusalem and began to travel around the region, often visiting historical and archaeological sites, alongside their military duties. Near Aleppo they sketched the results of the RAF bombing raids on the Turkish airbase at Rayak. At Wadi Fara Sydney made a set of studies which eventually became the painting The Destruction of the Turkish Transport in the Gorge of the Wadi Fara, Palestine, which depicted an RAF attack on a Turkish column in a steep gorge. After some time in Beruit the brothers returned to flying duties, with Sydney making several flights over Wadi Fara and the Sea of Galilee. The brothers stayed in Cairo before moving to Baghdad where they remained until the middle of July when they went to Mosul from where the RAF were planning bombing raids against the Kurdish uprising. Before that action they were recalled to England for demobilisation and arrived home in November 1919. Although between them the brothers had enough sketches for twenty-five major paintings, the RAF Section of the IWM had no funds left to acquire new paintings. Eventually the Museum paid Sydney for four finished paintings and bought three from Richard. The brothers were allowed to keep the 300 plus sketches they had made in the Middle East and these formed the basis of their successful Groupil Gallery exhibition in March 1920. Later life Before the war Carline had exhibited at the Royal Academy and after the war he resumed doing so until 1927. In 1922 he was appointed Ruskin Master of Drawing at Oxford University and in 1924 he was elected a member of the London Group. In 1926 he created illustrations for T E Lawrence's book Revolt in the Desert. In April 1928, Carline married Gwendolen Harter. The following year he died of pneumonia, which developed after a visit to John Nash on a particularly cold evening. A number of memorial exhibitions were held in his memory and Richard Carline donated over a hundred of his works to the Imperial War Museum. During the first quarter of 2017 an exhibition of Carline's paintings from Italy in 1917-18 was held at the Estorick Collection in London.

While Serbia holds the opinion that the thalweg of the Danube valley and the centerline of the river represents the international border between the two countries, Croatia disagrees and claims that the international border lies along the boundaries of the cadastral municipalities located along the river‚Äîdeparting from the course at several points along a section. The cadastre-based boundary reflects the course of the Danube which existed in the 19th century, before meandering and hydrotechnical engineering works altered its course. The area size of the territory in dispute is reported variously, up to . The dispute first arose in 1947, but was left unresolved during the existence of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It became a contentious issue after the breakup of Yugoslavia. Particular prominence was given to the dispute at the time of Croatia's accession to the European Union. the dispute remains unresolved, and the line of control mostly corresponds to Serbia's claim. Territorial claims The Croatia‚ÄìSerbia border dispute in the Baƒçka and Baranja area. The Croatian claim corresponds to the red line, while the Serbian claim corresponds to the course of the Danube. The Croatia‚ÄìSerbia border dispute entails competing claims regarding the border at several points along the Danube River valley shared by the two countries. The disputed areas are located along a portion of the course, out of of the river course in the area. In that area, the border is defined differently by the neighbouring countries‚Äîeither as following the course of the Danube, as claimed by Serbia, or following a line tracing the borders of cadastral municipalities having seat in either of the two countries, as claimed by Croatia. The cadastre-based boundary also traces the former riverbed of the Danube, which was changed by meandering and hydraulic engineering works in the 19th century, after the cadastre was established. The border dispute involves up to of territory. Other sources specify somewhat different figures, indicating a Croatian claim over on the eastern bank of the river, in Baƒçka, while saying that the cadastre-based boundary leaves of territory on the western bank of the Danube, in Baranja to Serbia. Yet another estimate cites a total area of in dispute, 90% of which is located on the eastern bank of the Danube, controlled by Serbia. The bulk of the territory in dispute is in the vicinity of the town of Apatin, while the Island of ≈†arengrad and the Island of Vukovar are cited as particularly contentious parts of the dispute. Further disputed areas are located near the town of Baƒçka Palanka, and in the municipality of Sombor, at the tripoint of Croatia, Hungary and Serbia. Croatia claims that the cadastre-based boundary was adopted by the ƒêilas Commission, set up in 1945 to determine the borders between federal constituents of Yugoslavia, while Serbia claims that the same commission identified the boundary as the course of the Danube in 1945. In 1991, the Arbitration Commission of the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia ruled that the border between federal units of Yugoslavia became inviolable international borders, without referring to locations of any specific claim or line. The opinion was rendered at the request of Serbia. Prior to the ruling, Serbia asserted that the borders were subject to change following the breakup of Yugoslavia and the independence of Croatia. Since the Croatian War of Independence, the line of control coincides with the Serbian claim. On 28 July 2002, warning shots were fired by a patrol boat of the Yugoslav Army at four boats carrying the prefect of Vukovar-Srijem County and the mayors of Vukovar and Baƒçka Palanka, as well as several other civilians to Baƒçka Palanka. The incident took place approximately away from ≈†arengrad Island. Shots were also fired at a Croatian patrol boat after it attempted to approach the vessel carrying the prefect and the mayor. There were no casualties, but the passengers and crew of the civilian boat were arrested. Four elderly individuals and four children were released immediately, while the rest were interviewed at a Yugoslav military barracks for two hours before being set free. Yugoslav foreign minister Goran Svilanoviƒá expressed regret over the incident, but Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Raƒçan stated that Croatia was not satisfied with the gesture. The Serbian Army withdrew from the border in October 2006, turning control over to the Serbian police. =Recent developments= In early 2000, Croatia and Serbia set up a commission tasked with determining the border, but in its first ten years it convened only once or twice. Since 2010, the issue has gained increasing prominence in the disputing countries. Plans for construction of a port in Apatin, on a piece of territory claimed by Croatia, added fuel to the dispute. After years of inactivity the inter-governmental commission established to identify and determine the border between Croatia and Serbia met in Zagreb in April 2010, only to conclude that there was a difference of opinions on the matter. Later that month, the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) deputies in the National Assembly proposed a resolution which would require that Serbian officials resolve the dispute in compliance with the Serbian claim. Months later, Radoslav Stojanoviƒá, a former legal representative of Serbia and Montenegro in the Bosnian Genocide Case and former ambassador to the Netherlands, likened the dispute to the Croatia‚ÄìSlovenia border dispute in the Gulf of Piran. Stojanoviƒá said that the position held by Croatia in its dispute with Slovenia was favourable for Serbia and warned that Serbia might be in a disadvantageous position if Croatia joined the European Union (EU) before Serbia‚Äîwhich would allow it to impose its conditions to the process of accession of Serbia to the EU. By 2011, Serbian diplomats made several requests to the EU, asking it to pressure Croatia to resolve the dispute before Croatia's accession to the union out of fear that it might follow the Slovene example and stall Serbian accession similar to the impasse between Croatia and Slovenia over their border disputes and the subsequent blockade of the Croatian EU accession negotiation process. The request was denied by the EU. Croatian President Ivo Josipoviƒá said that the dispute was the most contentious issue of Croatia‚ÄìSerbia relations but added that it should not be difficult to resolve. In 2012, Josipoviƒá stated that Croatia should not block Serbia's EU accession over the issue and suggested that the dispute should be resolved through arbitration, which is considered to be an acceptable solution by both countries. In 2014, the Croatian ambassador to Serbia reiterated Josipoviƒá's stance from 2012. On the other hand, Zoran Milanoviƒá, the Prime Minister of Croatia, said that the resolution of the border dispute would be Croatia's condition placed before Serbia in its EU accession negotiations. Vukovar Island Agreement In 2006, representatives of the city of Vukovar and the municipality of Baƒç, located on the bank opposite Vukovar, reached an agreement on use of Vukovar Island as a recreational facility and beach. The island is accessible to organised transport by boats sailing from Vukovar. No border controls are involved in the process. By 2012, visits to the island reached 150,000 persons per year. Liberland On 13 April 2015, V√≠t Jedliƒçka from the Czech Party of Free Citizens proclaimed the micronation Liberland on what he said is land left unclaimed by both Croatia and Serbia. The Croatian Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs has rejected these claims, stating that the differing border claims between Serbia and Croatia do not involve terra nullius, and are not subject to occupation by a third party. However, the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on 24 April 2015 that while Serbia does not consider \\"Liberland\\" to be an important matter, the \\"new state\\" does not impinge upon the Serbian border, which is delineated by the Danube River. Evolution of the border =Until 1922= The evolution of the Croatia‚ÄìSerbia border began in 1699 with the Treaty of Karlowitz, transferring Slavonia and a portion of Syrmia from the Ottoman Empire to the Habsburg Monarchy at the conclusion of the Great Turkish War. The rest of Syrmia was transferred to the Habsburg Monarchy through the Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718. The transferred territories were organised within the monarchy into the Kingdom of Slavonia, with its eastern border established at the Danube, and the defensive belt of Military Frontier stretching along the Sava River, governed directly from Vienna. Subsequent territorial changes in the region included the proclamation of the short-lived Serbian Vojvodina during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, which included Syrmia as its territory. A year later Serbian Vojvodina was abolished and replaced by the crown land of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat, which ceded Syrmia back to the Kingdom of Slavonia. In 1868, following the Croatian‚ÄìHungarian Settlement, the Kingdom of Slavonia was incorporated into the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, before the Slavonian Military Frontier was fully annexed to Croatia-Slavonia in 1881. At the end of World War I in 1918, Croatia-Slavonia became a part of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, while Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja proclaimed direct unification to Kingdom of Serbia on November 25, 1918. They were formed after the division of Hungarian Baranya and B√°cs-Bodrog Counties along the \\"Clemenceau line\\" established through the Treaty of Trianon of 1920. The territory of southern Baranja was ceded to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes on the premise, claimed by the Yugoslav delegation at the conference, that it formed a natural hinterland of the city of Osijek. The territory south of the \\"Clemenceau line\\" was distributed to administrative divisions in existence before First World War, with the territory being reorganised administratively later in 1922. All this territories united under Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was renamed Yugoslavia in 1929. =Interwar period= Banovina Croatia from 1939, by which the regime wanted to solve the Croatian question in Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia was established in 1918 as a centralised monarchy under Serbian Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty. In 1922, the territory was reorganised by oblasts. Baranja along Baƒçka was incorporated into Novi Sad oblast, Syrmium with its seat in Vukovar became a separate oblast, while Osijek became incorporated into Slavonija oblast. By Royal Proclamation of 6 January 1929, the Constitution of 1921 was abolished, the parliament dissolved, and an absolutist monarchy proclaimed. The country was renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the territory was reorganised into banovinas. The greatest change in regard to the region in dispute here, occurred in Syrmia, with the districts of Vukovar, Vinkovci, ≈†id, ≈Ωupanja and Sremska Mitrovica becoming part of the Drinska Banovina with its seat in Tuzla. While the northern half of the disputed territory being incorporated along all of Baranja and Baƒçka into Danube Banovina. Two years later, in 1931, the districts of Vukovar, Vinkovci and ≈Ωupanja were transferred to Savska Banovina. A further territorial reorganisation was carried in 1939 as part of an agreement reached after intensive talks between authorities in Belgrade and opposition forces in Zagreb. The agreement known as Cvetkoviƒá-Maƒçek Agreement created the Banovina of Croatia. The creation of the Banovina of Croatia was the first step towards the federalization of Yugoslavia, in which a Slovenian autonomous unit was also envisaged, while the rest of the country was to be a Serbian unit. In relation to the Croat-Serbs boundary, the 1939 delimitation of Banovina of Croatia included ≈†id and Ilok districts while no version of the agreement included Baranja in Croatia, meaning the northern half of the disputed area was to stay excluded from Croatia in all versions. =After 1945= Croatia‚ÄìSerbia border developments and dispute in the Baƒçka and Syrmia area. At the Baƒçka section of the border, the Croatian claim corresponds to the red line, while the Serbian claim corresponds to the course of Danube. The first general outline of the post-1945 borders of Croatia was made by the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia on 24 February 1945. Some issues regarding the border, such as Baranja, were left unresolved. The newly established Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, a part of the Socialist Republic of Serbia since April 1945, sought to establish its border with the Socialist Republic of Croatia along the Drava River, thus including Baranja, the Danube and along the Vukovar‚Äì≈Ωupanja line. To counter the claims made by Vojvodina, Croatian authorities staked counterclaims in the areas of Vukovar, Vinkovci, Baranja and in the area of Sombor. In order to settle the matter, the federal authorities set up a five-member commission presided over by Milovan ƒêilas in June 1945. The commission identified three sets of disputed territories. Those were the districts of Subotica, Sombor, Apatin and Od≈æaci in Baƒçka, districts of Batina and Darda in Baranja, and districts of Vukovar, ≈†id and Ilok in Syrmia. The districts in Baƒçka were awarded to Vojvodina, while those in Baranja were awarded to Croatia, both primarily along ethnic lines. The commission also noted that if Yugoslavia managed to acquire the region of Baja from Hungary, the decision regarding Baƒçka would be reviewed. The district of Vukovar was also awarded to Croatia, while Ilok and ≈†id were assigned to Vojvodina. In the case of Ilok, the decision was specified to be provisional until authorities are consolidated on either side of the boundary, when the issue would be reexamined. Subsequently, the Serbian Parliament enacted a law establishing Vojvodina's borders. It referred to the boundary proposed by the ƒêilas commission explicitly noting that it was temporary. The law noted that the border follows the Danube from the Hungarian border to Ilok, crosses the Danube leaving Ilok, ≈†arengrad and Mohovo in Croatia then moves south and leaves the cadastral municipalities of Opatovac, Lovas, Tovarnik, Podgraƒëe, Ap≈°evci, Lipovac, Stro≈°inci and Jamena in Croatia, and everything east of the line in Vojvodina. The awarding of Ilok to Croatia was a departure from the findings of ƒêilas commission and it was based on a referendum held in the town on the matter in 1945 or 1946, when its population voted to be added to Croatia. =Start of the dispute= In 1947, Vojvodina's Ministry of Agriculture complained to Serbia's Ministry of Forestry that the authorities in Vukovar refused to hand over four river islands, and then to Croatia's Ministry of Forestry regarding the same matter, asking for assistance. After Croatia refused the request, the Serbian authorities turned to the federal government. The federal authorities advised resolving the matter through mutual agreement and said that Vojvodina's interpretation of the law on its borders‚Äîthat the border runs along the thalweg of the Danube valley, i.e. along the river's midpoint‚Äîis erroneous because the law does not apply such wording. In a letter dated 18 April 1947, Yugoslav authorities said that the disputed river islands were the territory of Vukovar district and that the territory could not be transferred to Vojvodina before the border was defined otherwise. By May 1947, authorities in Vojvodina noted that there was a dispute between them and the authorities in Croatia regarding the interpretation of the position of the border along the Danube, and that the federal authorities, who were asked to mediate in the dispute, supported the position of Croatia. At the same time, Vojvodina requested that Croatia return the territories on the right bank of the Danube that had previously been ceded to it (Varo≈°-Viza and Mala Siga). While in the Yugoslav framework, the issue received little further attention as its resolution was discouraged by the federal authorities, and because the area involved had limited economic value, was uninhabited and frequently flooded. By 1948, Croatia and Serbia agreed on two modifications of the border‚Äîthe village of Bapska was transferred to Croatia, while Jamena was turned over to Vojvodina. No further changes to the border were agreed upon. A map of the area issued by the Yugoslav People's Army Military-Geographic Institute in 1967 depicts the border along the cadastre-based boundary, corresponding to the Croatian claim in the dispute.

The two primary traditional dances of Tuvalu are the fakanau (for men) and oga (for women) and the fakaseasea.

Performance of the fakaseasea The fakaseasea was mainly performed by women, who were on their feet, dancing and moving their arms, hand and upper body; while men and women would sing and beat the time. It is a slower song with very loose rules on how to dance to it, with variations on different islands with different names. The fakaseasea tradition continues in the present day although performed mainly by elders.

It was developed by the New Corporation and released only in Japan. It is a 2D action platform game. The game's story focuses on Ralph, a man who has been turned into a child who now must save a damsel in distress. Reviewers praised the game for its high quality graphics, music, and difficulty.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot of the platforming segment. The Adventure of Little Ralph is a two-dimensional side scrolling action game. There are several difficulty modes. Selecting easy mode results in the last few levels being skipped, and being unable to view the real ending. There are a total of eight stages in the game, and they include locations such as a desert, an iceberg, and a flying battleship. The player can collect fruit to increase points, which will appear as the player moves through stages. Alternate and secret paths net more fruit to collect. Some stages scroll vertically, and some stages scroll horizontally. The player will use ropes and ledges to climb the vertical stages. The player can perform a downward strike using their sword. It is a feature common in fantasy games featuring swords. During boss fights, Ralph grows to adult size, and it turns into a fighting game. Moves are similar to Street Fighter II, and there's a blocking button. The game contains eight stages in total. The game has an emphasis on earning points, which had become less popular in gaming at the time.  Plot  In the game, a demon named Valgo has come to town, transformed an adult swordsman named Ralph into a small child, and kidnapped his girlfriend. Development New Corp was formed by out of the arcade game center community in Kashiwazaki, Niigata Japan. They released Boxer‚Äôs Road, a boxing game for the PlayStation in 1995. Development on the game began in 1991. The original platform it was development for was the Sharp X68000 home computer before eventually moving to the PlayStation. Designer Aoyagi Ryuta cites Wonder Boy, Rastan, and Quartet as influences. The motivation of the dev team at the time, was that platformers were already starting to wane, and they took it as a challenge to make a great platforming game. The music was composed by Hiroki Kuroonuma, Naoki Tsuchiya, and Hideki Sato. The score was made collaboratively, and aimed to evoke sounds from the 80's. Tsuchiya did all of the sound effects himself. When The Adventure of Little Ralph was released, it was one of the few two-dimensional games released during that time period, and there was far more interest in three-dimensional games. Other two-dimensional games such as Skullmonkeys had sold poorly, and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night had relatively low sales. Releases The game was released on June 3, 1999 in Japan only for the Sony PlayStation. It retailed for 4800 yen. To promote the game, a high score contest was held at release. First place won an IMac, second won a Sony MiniDisc radio and cassette player, and third won a MiniDisc walkman. Since its release, physical copies of the game has been known to fetch as high as US$200 on online auction sites such as eBay. In 2014, Eurogamer noted the price could be ¬£80 - ¬£100. The game was later released on PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable in Japan on July 26, 2007 and retailed for 600 yen. The soundtrack to the game was released in 2009 by EGG Music. Reception Four reviewers for Weekly Famitsu gave the game 26 points out of 40. Reviewers noted the game's difficulty, saying it was suitable for those who wished for an older style video game. One reviewer compared it to Famicom titles. Gamers Republic magazine game the game a B-. They noted the minecraft section was very similar to the one in Hermie Hopperhead. The reviewer praised the 2D graphics, and challenging gameplay which was a contrast to many modern 3D games. The reviewer noted the only flaw in the game was its short length, but still recommended it to import for fans of 2D side scrolling games. Gamers Republic later listed the game in their 1999 Video Game Buyers Guide and Y2K Preview as one of the best games to import from Japan that year along with such games as, Bangai-O, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Pepsiman, Robot Dandy, and Internal Section. Planet PlayStation gave it a score of 75 out of 100.

T.\\" Webb (March 22, 1864 - December 20, 1938) was an American politician who served twice as member of the Arizona Territorial Legislature. Biography Webb was born in Salt Lake City to Chauncey Gilbert and Almira Sophia (Taft) Webb on March 22, 1864. He was educated in public schools before attending the University of Deseret (now the University of Utah). Webb moved to Tombstone, Arizona Territory in January 1881. He worked there as a miner for a short time before accepting a job helping to construct the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad in New Mexico Territory. In 1883, Webb moved to Pima, Arizona Territory. He partnered with his father to operate a family store for a time. The family business was dissolved in 1887, at which time Webb become involved in raising livestock. In October of that year he married Sarah Burns at a ceremony in Salt Lake City. The couple remained married until her death on March 6, 1912. Several Buffalo Soldiers who had fought against bandits during the Wham Paymaster Robbery identified Webb as being involved in the attack. As a result, he was arrested in June 1889. Unable to post bail, Webb was held until the trial. His father Gilbert, who was also arrested on the same charges, was able to make bail and spent several months locating people willing to testify and provide alibis to the accused. At trial, Webb and his fellow defendants were acquitted of all charges by a jury that is generally considered to have been biased against the black witnesses of the accusation and in favor of the accused. As a result of the trial, Webb became a lifetime friend to Marcus Aurelius Smith, who had served as defense counsel during the trial. His legal troubles did not end immediately however. For several years, territorial law officers investigated Webb for a variety of crimes including cattle rustling and banditry. Nothing ever became of the investigations. In later years, Webb was often asked if he was involved in the Wham robbery. His standard response was, \\"Twelve good men said I wasn't.\\" Beginning in 1891, Webb slowly expanded and diversified his business interests. This led to him eventually becoming owner of the 76 Ranch, director of the Bank of Safford, and President of the Webb-Merrill Commercial Company of Pima. At the same time, Webb became active in Democratic party politics. He was twice elected mayor of Pima and served in both the 22nd and 23rd Arizona Territorial Legislature. During his second term in the legislature, Webb was Speaker of the House of Representatives. As Arizona statehood approached, Webb was elected as a member of the new state's constitutional convention. He was also active in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, serving as an elder in his local stake. During the US Presidential Election of 1912, Webb became a presidential elector. He was also chosen as the messenger tasked with taking Arizona's official certificate of votes to Washington D.C.. While en route, he disappeared near St. Louis, Missouri. United States law at the time required the messenger to present the official vote certificates to the President of the United States Senate by the fourth Monday of January or face a $1000 fine and loss of mileage allowance. Webb had been informed by a lawyer friend that the certificates did not need to arrive in Washington until February 1, 1913 and was surprised to learn on January 28 that Arizona's congressional delegation were searching for him. He took a train from New York City, where he learned of the search, to Washington. The official certificate was delivered a day late but Webb's explanation was determined sufficient to excuse him for the tardiness and allow him to collect a $642.75 mileage reimbursement. The reason for Webb's delay did not become publicly known for almost a year-and-a-half. On June 13, 1914, Webb married Claire Noelke of St. Louis, Missouri. The delay had come because Webb had stayed in St. Louis for several days to court his future wife instead of proceeding directly to Washington. Prior to their marriage, she had been a light opera singer. Webb died in Los Angeles, California on December 20, 1938. He had gone to the city seeking medical treatment. He was buried at the Pima Cemetery in Pima, Arizona.

Released on 14 April 2014, Homo Erraticus is a concept album, loosely connected to Jethro Tull's Thick as a Brick (1972) and Anderson's Thick as a Brick 2 (2012), since it again credits the lyrics to the fictional character Gerald Bostock. The album was released in four formats: as a double vinyl, a single CD, a CD + DVD collection, and an Amazon.com exclusive box set edition, containing the album on CD as well as three bonus discs. Anderson and his band embarked on a promotional tour of the album, in which they performed the entire album for the first half of each show, and the best of Jethro Tull for the second half. Musical style Homo Erraticus is a progressive rock album which, according to Anderson, blends folk and medieval as well as heavy metal music styles. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the album \\"as close to 1970s progressive rock as is possible in 2014\\". Concept The phrase Homo Erraticus is Latin for \\"wandering man\\", and the concept for the album builds tangentially upon the fictional narrative of Ian Anderson's recurring character Gerald Bostock, a literary child prodigy. Details of the album's fictional story are provided, but also slightly contradicted, by two official sources: the Jethro Tull website and the album's own promotional website. The general backstory underlying the album is that, in the year 2014, poet Gerald Bostock, now in his early fifties, has recently discovered in his town's bookstore a \\"dusty, unpublished manuscript, written by local amateur historian Ernest T. Parritt, (1873 -1928)\\" which is entitled either \\"Homo Britanicus Erraticus\\" or \\"Homo erraticus (The St Cleve Chronicles)\\". Anderson claims that the album's lyrics are Bostock's resulting interpretation of Parritt's \\"illustrated document [which] summarises key historical elements of early civilisation in Britain and seems to prophesy future scenarios too\\". Apparently, two years before his death, Parritt began suddenly recalling visions of past-life experiences, attributed either to the fact that \\"Parritt had a traumatic fall from his horse\\" or \\"Parritt suffered from a recurrence of malaria, contracted during his Army days in India\\". In either case: > [Parritt] awoke with the overwhelming conviction of having enjoyed past > lives as historical characters: a pre-history nomadic neolithic settler, an > Iron Age blacksmith, a Saxon invader, a Christian monk, a Seventeenth > Century grammar school boy, turnpike innkeeper, one of Brunel‚Äôs railroad > engineers, and even Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria. This > befuddled, delusional obsession extends to his prophecy of future events and > his fantasy imaginings of lives yet to come.... Bostock has returned once > again to lyric writing, basing his new effort on the Parritt papers and I > [Anderson] have had the fun and frolics of setting all to music of Folk- > Rock-Metal stylings.

It was not an organized political party in the contemporary sense, but a heterogeneous camp uniting around certain key themes. Only until 1849 did Lucas Alaman establish a formal party to campaign for conservative causes in elections. At various times and under different circumstances they were known as escoseses, centralists, royalists, imperialists, or conservatives, but they tended to be united by the theme of preserving colonial Spanish values, while not being opposed to the economic development and modernization of the nation. Their base of support was the army, the hacendados, and the Catholic Church. While containing a noted monarchist element which ended up resulting in multiple efforts to establish a monarchy in Mexico, the conservatives were not always averse to the republican form of government, but they supported the movement to have a centralized republic as opposed to a federal republic. The Conservative Party went defunct after the fall of the Second Mexican Empire. Figueroa Esquer Ra√∫l; ‚ÄúEl tiempo eje de M√©xico, 1855-1867.‚Äù En Estudios.

Both which were first signed on December 14, 1859 by Melchor Ocampo and Robert McLane, ambassador of the United States in Mexico. Simultaneously, conservatives sought help from Europe. On September 26, 1859, Juan Nepomuceno Almonte, the Mexican Conservative minister in Paris signed a treaty with Alejandro Mon, Spain's ambassador in France. The Almonte- Mon treaty re-established relations with its former metropoli (Spain). Miramar Castle in Trieste, Italy. During the Reform War in Mexico (1858‚Äì61), Zuloaga was repeatedly named provisional president by conservatives and abolished the Constitution and the liberal laws affecting the privileges of the church and the lerdo law. In 1860, he began the decline of the Conservative government. On May 10, General Miguel Miramon replaced Zuloaga and sought to defeat the Liberals, but they outnumbered him because unlike conservatives, who only had a presence in the city, also had the support of the Mexican peasantry. Finally they were defeated in the Battle of Capulalpan in December 22, 1860. This battle ended the War of Reform, as a result, Miguel Miramon moved to Cuba and left Benito Ju√°rez as the only president. In 1861 the governments of Spain, France and Great Britain, after the Treaty of London, faced the Juarez government, which filed for bankruptcy. Liberals managed to convince Spain and England to leave the country peacefully, on the other hand the French sent troops by orders of Napoleon III, and had the aim of establishing a Catholic empire in Mexico to stop the advance of American Protestantism and its growing expansionism. Conservatives supported this policy and strategy that aligned with their interests to establish a monarchy. On 10 June 1863 the French army took the city of Mexico. The same year the Conservatives convinced Maximilian of Habsburg to accept the crown of the Mexican empire. After being in power, conservatives noticed that regalist practices of Maximilian resembled closer to liberal than conservative policies, thus he lost a substantial part of its support. This, coupled with the withdrawal of French troops at the approach of the Franco-Prussian war in 1867, as well as the American combatant support for the liberal government of Juarez, who perceived a monarchy in the Mexican territory as a menace for their interests in the region, resulted in a victory for the liberals who ordered to shoot Maximiliano and many conservatives such as Miguel Miramon and Tomas Mejia. Liberals took power and restored the federal republic, with Benito Ju√°rez to the front.

The episode is Part 1 of a two-part season finale; Part 2 (\\"Basic Sandwich\\") aired on April 17, 2014 on NBC. The episode received generally positive reviews.

Plot The Save Greendale committee shares a moment of quiet after completing a large portion of their tasks. Abed (Danny Pudi) is uneasy because he thinks this is a misleading lull in excitement. Dean Pelton (Jim Rash) then enters to explain that an insurance appraiser will be arriving the next day to determine the value of the school. Abed interprets this news as a crisis, but Jeff (Joel McHale) takes him aside to placate him by explaining there is no crisis and thus no story. Abed seemingly agrees, saying, ‚ÄúSo be it. Let the lack of story--.‚Äù He abruptly walks away mid- sentence, leaving the camera to pan to a student who is noisily sipping soup at his desk, implying to the audience that there is no story. Abed realizes he is in a story when he catches himself explaining that there is no story. He attempts to fool the camera he thinks is following him by running away but to no avail. He falls to his knees, helplessly admitting that everything is a story. A white-bearded version of Abed suddenly appears and tells him to keep fighting the story until it falls apart. Abed goes into an existential breakdown as Leonard (Richard Erdman) passes by to say, ‚ÄúUnsubscribe.‚Äù The city‚Äôs insurance appraiser, Ronald Mohammad (Michael McDonald), then arrives to assess the campus‚Äôs liability. Mohammad enters the school to perform his inspection. In his last safety test, he attempts to rock a vending machine back and forth to see if it will fall down and crush him. Satisfied that the vending machine will not fall, he declares the school has passed his evaluation. He explains to the committee and the school board guys (Carl and Richie) that the school has value. Carl and Richie then plan to sell the school to a private bidder. The Group reacts with stunned silence as Abed returns, ironically saying that the school is now story-free and that they can be content now forever. Dean Pelton then tries to tip the vending machine over on himself, but Jeff pulls him off saying that he can‚Äôt do so because they fixed it when they saved Greendale. Jeff comes to the realization that their efforts this year inadvertently led to Greendale being sold. The Greendale campus is bought by Subway and is transformed into Subway University in preparation of its sale. Annie (Alison Brie) fails to convince the committee to launch a social media campaign by tweeting ‚Äú#SaveGreendale.‚Äù Right before Jeff bangs the gavel for the last Save Greendale committee meeting, Chang (Ken Jeong) reveals himself as a spy for Subway and dances away while singing ‚ÄúFive Dollar Footlong.‚Äù Annie and Abed then arrive at Dean Pelton‚Äôs office to help him pack. Abed notices an engraved plate on the picture of the first dean, Russell Borchert (Chris Elliott), which says ‚ÄúThe Truth Is Behind This Picture.‚Äù They remove the picture frame to reveal a dusty scroll. The Subway Executive (James Michael Connor) offers a job to Jeff at the new Subway University, where he will teach ‚ÄúSandwich Law.‚Äù Jeff then walks to Study Room F where he finds Britta (Gillian Jacobs) sitting morosely and listening to her iPod Nano. They talk about what they might do after Subway takes over. Britta says she is worried about Abed and Annie. Nevertheless, Jeff and Britta are both relieved and yearn for a moment of sanity. They reminisce that their experience with the Study Group started because Jeff tried to have sex with Britta. They both grow quiet as they realize that neither of them is leaving with anything. Jeff unexpectedly proposes to marry her, saying that this is what people do to keep it all from being pointless. Britta agrees and Jeff kisses her. Jeff says they must first consummate their future on the new table. As Jeff goes to lock the door, Dean Pelton barges in with Annie and Abed, exclaiming, ‚ÄúBuried treasure!‚Äù They excitedly announce that they can save Greendale by finding buried treasure on campus. They say they must plan an emergency meeting to plan this search. An eavesdropping Chang hears ‚Äúemergency meeting‚Äù but writes down ‚Äútomato‚Äù on his notebook while laughing maniacally. In the end-tag, Professor Duncan (John Oliver) and Professor Hickey (Jonathan Banks) are seen having a drink in Duncan‚Äôs office. Duncan says he will move in with family in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, England, where Hickey says he was stationed. Hickey mentions a pub where he lost his virginity to a prostitute and Duncan reveals his mother was a prostitute in the same pub. The crisis of paternity is subverted when Hickey reveals his whore had one thumb, whereas Duncan‚Äôs mother has two and says Hickey might have slept with his aunt. Duncan says that he will be staying with his cousin, Clive, and that he and Hickey would get along. Duncan then stares inquisitively at Hickey, implying that Hickey might be his cousin‚Äôs estranged father.

There wasn't really much to it, hence its title (and Abed's search for a story line), but there were surely some funny bits. The irony of the Save Greendale Committee doing such a good job that they've made Greendale just valuable enough to sell to Subway is pretty bleak, when you think about it, but also a pretty useful setup for whatever National Treasure‚Äìbased high jinks are sure to follow in next week‚Äôs 'Basic Sandwich.'\\" References External links * \\"Basic Story\\" at NBC.com  2014 American television episodes Community (season 5) episodes ","title":"Basic Story"},{"id":"42461606","title":"A State of Trance 2014"},{"id":"42461627","text":"Now That's What I Call Music! 50 is the 50th edition of the Now! series in the United States, released on May 6, 2014.

Edmund Spenser's Epithalamion is an ode written to his bride, Elizabeth Boyle, on their wedding day in 1594. It was first published in 1595 in London by William Ponsonby as part of a volume entitled Amoretti and Epithalamion. Written not long since by Edmunde Spenser. The volume included the sequence of 89 sonnets (Amoretti), along with a series of short poems called Anacreontics and the Epithalamion, a public poetic celebration of marriage. Only six complete copies of this first edition remain today, including one at the Folger Shakespeare Library and one at the Bodleian Library. The ode begins with an invocation to the Muses to help the groom, and moves through the couple's wedding day, from Spenser's impatient hours before dawn while waiting for his bride to wake up, to the late hours of night after Spenser and Boyle have consummated their marriage (wherein Spenser's thoughts drift towards the wish for his bride to have a fertile womb so that they may have many children). Spenser meticulously records the hours of the day from before dawn to late into the wedding night: its 24 stanzas represent the hours of Midsummer Day. The ode's content progresses from the enthusiasm of youth to the concerns of middle age by beginning with high hopes for a joyful day and ending with an eye toward the speaker's legacy to future generations.  Edmund Spenser  Edmund Spenser was a London-born English poet who moved to Ireland and is known for works such as The Faerie Queene, The Shepheardes Calender, Epithalamion and Amoretti. Epithalamion is similar to Amoretti. The two works explore the development of the romantic relationship between Spenser and his bride Elizabeth Boyle. Spenser wrote during the Elizabethan Era and was a devotee of the Protestant church. Spenser married Boyle, who was much younger than he was, the same year his previous wife died. He is considered one of the greatest poets of the English language. Era Spenser lived from 1552 to 1599. Works in this time period are considered Early Modern literature, which spanned from the Baroque period to the Age of Enlightenment. It saw writers such as Miguel de Cervantes, Daniel Defoe and Jonathan Swift in Europe. He was also considered to be a part of the Elizabethan era. It coincided with the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and is considered to be the literary height of the English Renaissance. Poetic forms such as love sonnets, the pastoral, and the allegorical epic where popular in this era.  Summary  Epithalamion is a poem celebrating a marriage. An epithalamium is a song or poem written specifically for a bride on her way to the marital chamber. In Spenser's work, he is spending the day anxiously awaiting to marry Elizabeth Boyle. The poem describes the day in detail. The couple wakes up and Spenser begs the muses to help him on his artistic endeavor for the day. Spenser spends a majority of the poem praising his bride to be, which is depicted as both innocent and lustful. When she finally wakes, the two head to the church. Hymen Hymenaeus is sung by the minstrels at the festivities. As the ceremony begins, Spenser shifts from praising Greek Gods and beings to Christian language to praise Elizabeth. After the ceremony, Spenser becomes even more anxious at the thought of consummating the marriage. Spenser then rebukes any idea of evil that could ruin their new found happiness. Spenser asks for blessings for childbearing, fidelity, and all things good at the end.  Structure  Epithalamion follows a rhyme a scheme of ABABCC, DEDEFF, and so on (except the 15th stanza.). The structure is 24 stanzas, each with either 18 lines or 19 (15th stanza has 17 lines). The last stanza is an envoy(a short formal stanza which is appended to a poem by way of conclusion) with 7 lines. There are 433 lines in total.  Numerology  There are 24 stanzas and 433 lines in the poem. There are 365 longer lines and 68 shorter lines. The 365 longer lines represent the year leading up to Spenser's wedding day. The poem starts at midnight of the day of the wedding, as Spenser grows anxious of the future he is embracing. Every stanza is an hour of that day, eventually leading to the event and then to the consummation. Every hour is described in detail; from what is being worn to where the wedding is taking place to Spenser's own thoughts. The 24 stanzas represent the 24 hours in a day and the 365 longer lines represent every day in a year. Spenser's wedding is one day; the first 16 stanzas are the day time and the last 8 are the night time, and the relationship with Boyle has been occurring for a year.  Mysteries  In the 15th stanza, Spenser changes the structure. Throughout the poem, the stanzas are structured with 18 or 19 lines. In the 15th, there is a line missing. The rhyming structure typically goes ABABCC, then DEDEFF and so on. But stanza 15 is FEGGHH. This might have been done to keep the onomatopoeia of the poem or to keep the structure of the 365 lines as a metaphor for a year.  Greek Mythology  Most of the poem contains references to Greek Mythology. The following is a summary of some examples that appear in the poem. = Muses = Spenser calls on the Muses to help him in his artistic endeavors on this special day. Greek muses are the goddesses that inspire great artistic works such as the works of Homer or Hesiod. \\"Ye learned sisters which have oftentimes Beene to me ayding, others to adorne:\\" = Orpheus = Spenser compares his love to that of Orpheus. Orpheus was a legendary musician and poet who could charm all living things. The most well known myth regarding Orpheus concerns his descent into the underworld to retrieve the soul of his late wife Eurydice. Hades was charmed by Orpheus's music and allowed Eurydice to travel back up to Earth with the condition that Orpheus could not look back to Eurydice to confirm that she was behind him. Orpheus ultimately looked behind him after he grew concerned that Hades had misled him only to find that Eurydice was behind him, but having broken the condition, Eurydice was lost to him a second time. \\"Ne let the same of any be envide: So Orpheus did for his owne bride, So I unto my selfe alone will sing,\\" = Echo = Spenser states his love will echo for all to hear, it will be repeated everywhere. Echo was a nymph who was cursed by Hera to repeat the last word that she heard as punishment for distracting her from catching her husband Zeus entangled in one of his many affairs. She fell in love with Narcissus, however, she was unable to win his affection or save him from his fate of falling in love with his own reflection. Spenser could be referencing Echo from the mythology or the term echo. His love is all he hears echoed back because it is all he can speak. \\"So I unto my selfe alone will sing, The woods shall to me answer and my Eccho ring.\\" = Hymen = Hymen was the god of marriage ceremonies. Spenser calls him to his side on this day so that his own marriage ceremony will be perfect and to ensure their marriage lasts. Spenser wants his bride to wake and calls on Hymen to do the duties of this day. \\"Bid her awake; for Hymen is awake, And long since ready forth his maske to move,\\" = Nymphs = Nymphs were the spirits of natural objects such as trees, rivers, and clouds that animate nature and the land. \\"Bring with you all the Nymphes that you can heare Both of the rivers and the forrests greene: And of the sea that neighbours to her neare, Al with gay girlands goodly wel beseene.\\" = Tithones = Tithonus was a mortal Trojan prince. Eos, the Goddess of the Dawn, fell in love with him and requested Zeus to make him immortal. Because she did not request eternal youth explicitly, Tithonus withered in old age. In some versions of the myth, Eos transforms Tithonos into a cicada. In the context of the poem, Spenser is excited at the thought of growing old with Elizabeth. He is thinking of their future together and every hour Spenser waits for the ceremony to begin actually leads to the rest of the couple's life. \\"Wake, now my love, awake; for it is time, The Rosy Morne long since left Tithones bed,\\" = Phoebus = Phoebus is another name for the god Apollo. Apollo was the god of music, poetry, truth, and, relevant to the poem, the sun, as the day has begun with the sun rising. \\"All ready to her silver coche to clyme, And Phoebus gins to shew his glorious hed.\\" = Medusa = Medusa was a monstrous gorgon who had the unique ability to paralyze anyone who looked directly at her. Within the poem, Spencer alludes to Medusa to communicate that he is paralyzed with wonder as opposed to fear at the sight of Elizabeth. \\"Garnisht with heavenly guifts of high degree, Much more then would ye wonder at that sight, And stand astonisht lyke to those which red Medusaes mazeful hed.\\" = Hesperus = Hesperus is the evening star in Greek mythology. The day is ending and Hesperus is making an appearance. \\"With darksome cloud, now shew theyr goodly beames More bright then Hesperus his head doth rere.\\" = Cyprian Queene and Venus= The \\"Cyprian Queen\\" is term for Aphrodite, the goddess of love, sex, and beauty, who is also referred to as Venus in Roman Mythology. \\"And ye three handmayds of the Cyprian Queene, The which doe still adorne her beauties pride, Helpe to addorne my beautifullest bride: And as ye her array, still throw betweene Some graces to be seene, And as ye use to Venus, to her sing,\\" = Phoebe = Phoebe was associated with the Moon in mythology. The moon is rising signaling the end of the day. Elizabeth is compared to Phoebe as she walks down the aisle. \\"Loe where she comes along with portly pace Lyke Phoebe from her chamber of the East, Arysing forth to run her mighty race,\\" = Bacchus and the Graces = In Roman Mythology, Bacchus was a god of wine, festivals, and is associated with fertility, his Greek equivalent was Dionysus. The Graces, goddesses of charm, beauty, and grace are mentioned in association with Bacchus and Venus, connecting them to both the festive nature of the wedding and the preparation of the bride. \\"Crowne ye God Bacchus with a coronall, And Hymen also crowne with wreathes of vine, And let the Graces daunce unto the rest; For they can doo it best:\\" = Crab = This is the constellation between Cancer and Gemini. The constellation are shifting. In this case, the time is now towards the end of July since the constellation is moving. \\"When once the Crab behind his back he sees.\\" = Maia = Maia was one of the Pleiades and was the mother of Hermes by Zeus, who seemed to be connected to maternal and nurturing motherhood. \\"Like unto Maia, when as Jove her tooke, In Tempe, lying on the flowry gras, Twixt sleepe and wake, after she weary was, With bathing in the Acidalian brooke.\\" = Alcmena = Alcmena was the mother of Hercules by Jupiter, who took on the appearance of her husband Amphitryon, which led to the pair to make love for three days and nights. \\"But let the night be calme and quietsome, Without tempestuous storms or sad afray: Lyke as when Jove with fayre Alcmena lay, When he begot the great Tirynthian groome:\\" = Cinthia = Cynthia is a female name given to Mount Cynthus, but it was also a name for Selene, the personification of the moon who is spying on the couple. \\"Who is the same, which at my window peepes? Or whose is that faire face, that shines so bright, Is it not Cinthia, she that never sleepes, But walkes about high heaven al the night?\\" = Latmian Shepherd = The \\"Latmian Shepherd\\" refers to Endymion, a shepherd on Mount Latmas, whom the personification of the moon, Selene fell in love with as he slept. She was only able to grant immortality to him by placing him into an eternal slumber. Either before or during his eternal sleep the couple produced fifty daughters. \\"For thou likewise didst love, though now unthought, And for a fleece of woll, which privily, The Latmian shephard once unto thee brought, His pleasures with thee wrought.\\" = Genius = Genius was a concept in Roman Mythology where an individual may be inhabited by a \\"genius\\" to accomplish a great work or achievement. \\"And thou glad Genius, in whose gentle hand, The bridale bowre and geniall bed remaine,\\" = Hebe = Hebe is the Goddess of youth and the patron of the brides, logically connecting her to the events of a wedding and the fertility that ideally follows. \\"And thou farye Hebe, and thou Hymen free, Grant that is may so be. Til which we cease your further prayse to sing, Ne any woods shall answer, nor your Eccho ring.\\"  Why use the mythology  The ultimate goal of using the Greek mythology is for emphasis of love. Each character from the mythology is being used to bless the area of the wedding, the ceremony itself, the marriage, Spenser and Elizabeth's life together, and for the hope of offspring. Comparing his love to that of great myths is all to make his love seem grand. The mythology also emphasizes how important time is in the poem. Spenser is counting down the hours in the day that will lead to the rest of his life. He asks for the gods' help in all the single hours but also for the future.  Christian symbolism  While Greek mythology is used to express Spenser's undying love, symbols of Christianity are used to express his intimate feelings. \\"How the red roses flush up in her cheekes, And the pure snow with goodly vermill stayne, Like crimsin dyde in grayne, That even th'Angels which continually, About the sacred Altare doe remaine, Forget their service and about her fly, Ofte peeping in her face that seemes more fayre,\\" Spenser comments how Elizabeth is so beautiful to him that even the Angels would come down to Earth to look at her. She is the virgin to be sacrificed, for all to learn from. \\"She commeth in, before th'almighties vew: Of her ye virgins learne obedience, When so ye come into those holy places, To humble your proud faces; Bring her up to th'high altar that she may, The sacred ceremonies there partake, The which do endlesse matrimony make,\\" The virginity being taken is sacrificial, but not in the form of Elizabeth dying for a cause. Her virginity is being sacrificed for the sake of making a marriage. Elizabeth is walking up the aisle and the almighties are watching on. She stands as a symbol at the altar for all to admire and want to be. The second to last stanza of the poem is Spenser envisioning heaven, as it is the end of time for him and Elizabeth. \\"And ye high heavens, the temple of the gods, In which a thousand torches flaming bright... Poure out your blessing on us plentiously, With lasting happinesse... So let us rest, sweet love, in hope of this,\\" The description of this idea of Heaven is filled with their desires and will bring lasting happiness. Spenser's Heaven is one where he and Elizabeth can live in peace and be rewarded for their lives.  Animal symbols  There are multiple animals referenced throughout the poem with different meanings. = Turtledove = The Turtledove is a symbol for love and being faithful. Elizabeth will go to the closed off place of Spenser's love because she is his faithful love. \\"Go to the bowre of my beloved love, My truest turtle dove,\\" = Oule, Storke and Raven= Oule is an old spelling of owl. In Epithalamion, it is a bad omen. Spenser asks that these birds be quiet. If an owl is screeching, it means danger is nearby. Ravens are often construed as omens of bad luck, and Spenser is wishing they do not make a sound. Storks, in Chaucer's Parliament of Fowls, are avengers of adultery. So it can be inferred these birds will stop any such crime from happening. Spenser does not want any of these birds to be heard on his wedding night since he is only asking for love and peace for the rest of his life. \\"Let not the shriech Oule, nor the Storke be heard: Nor the night Raven that still deadly yels,\\" = Qurye of Frogs = Frogs croak at night, which can keep people awake at night. Spenser wants a peaceful night and a peaceful life with his new bride. \\"Ne let th'unpleasant Quyre of Frogs still croking Make us to wish theyr choking. Let none of these theyr drery accents sing; Ne let the woods them answer, nor theyr eccho ring.\\" = Song Thrush/Mavis = Mavis is dialect for a song thrush. There are many birds singing to mates in this stanza, and it comes out to the tune of the couples wedding song. \\"The merry Larke hir mattins sings aloft, The thrush replyes, the Mavis descant playes,\\"  Reception  =Critical responses= Many modern scholars argue the effectiveness of Spenser's work. James Lambert wrote about how the poem connected to the Protestant Reform of the time \\"Spenser‚Äôs Epithalamion reflects this communal joy as it narrates a public celebration of marriage, and does so in song and psalmic refrains. Spenser‚Äôs poetic interest in the earthly nature of joy takes Epithalamion beyond an expression of celebratory, communal Thjoy and into a more private, secret joy that remains ineffable. Finally, the poem moves toward affective joy, bestowing a kind of blessedness, or even grace, upon the listener, much like the practice of reciting the Psalms itself was supposed to do. Countering the relative absence of joy as a lived emotion, Spenser‚Äôs Epithalamion sets out to combine the discourses of joy‚Äîpsalmic praises, hymnody, spiritual comfort, heavenly foretaste, festivity, matrimony, and finally, sex‚Äîinto an all-inclusive articulation.\\" Melissa Sanchez's essay praised the hidden messages in the poem, while James Larsen spoke of the poem in his critical edition: \\"Epithalamion is a poem which gives ritualized and public affect to the personal on a number of levels, cosmographical, publicly prayerful and euchological.\\"  Analysis  Spenser uses the structure of his writing to portray the length of time his love will last: forever. The 24 stanzas are the hours of his wedding day, the 365 lines are the small amount of time he has been courting Elizabeth. The structure maps out one day to a specific time, to an even bigger time frame. The poem goes from microcosm to macrocosm as Spenser describes every hour and then to envisioning the future. It emphasizes the feeling of anxiety Spenser is feeling as he waits for the day to be over to start the rest of his life. The use of the Greek mythology is to emphasize how strong Spencer's love is. Spenser begs the gods to bless his wedding day, marriage, and fertility. He asks nymphs to make the scenery beautiful for his perfect day. He asks Hymen to bless his ceremony, so it will last forever. He begs for fertility from Bacchus so he can make a life with Elizabeth. He speaks of specific characters, like Orpheus to compare how he will do anything for Elizabeth. Spenser wants the best marriage and life with his bride because she is the most important thing to him. The use of Greek mythology is unexpected for the piece, as Spenser was Protestant. To ask for other God's blessings is completely out of place and the solae of Protestantism go against how Spenser displays her. To glorify her or put on the altar as a mediator between God and humanity is against Spencer's beliefs.. The use of animals as symbols can be inferred as Spenser wishing the night of the ceremony and the future to being pleasant and uninterrupted. He does not want the raven to bring danger and he does not want the frogs to croak and disturb the night. Spenser is wishing for a peaceful time with his bride. The poem uses many symbols to display the intense love Spenser has for Elizabeth and his deepest wishes. Epithalamion is the ultimate ode to a bride Elizabeth and is Spenser's great love story.

Kilfearagh is also a civil parish that covers the same area. Both lie on the Loop Head peninsula between the Atlantic ocean and the Shannon Estuary. The main settlement is the resort town of Kilkee. The parish contains many ruins, some dating to the early days of Christianity in Ireland. Location Kilfearagh is named after a saint called Fiachrach, or Fiachra. There are several saints by that name in the Irish calendars. It is not known which is the patron of the parish. The parish is in the barony of Moyarta, west of Kilrush. It is and covers . The main town of Kilkee is about from the end of the Loop Head peninsula, which separates the Shannon Estuary from the Atlantic Ocean. Kilfearagh lies between the Atlantic Ocean to the west and Poulnasharry bay of the Shannon Estuary on the east. In the 1830s, apart from farming there was a large trade in turf sent by boat from Poulanishery harbour up the River Shannon to Limerick. About 75 small boats were engaged in Atlantic fishery. In 1841 the population was 7,137 in 1,162 houses. The land between Kilrush and Kilkee was described in 1840 as \\"bleak, flat, boggy, poorly cultivated, and miserably occupied.\\" The same author described the Atlantic coast as presenting Town At first Kilkee was a small fishing village in the horseshoe-shaped Moore Bay on the Atlantic ocean. When sea bathing became popular in the late 18th century, Kilkee offered a safe beach protected by the Duggema reef. In the early 19th century a regular steamboat service along the Shannon from Limerick to nearby Kilrush made Kilkee more accessible. It ran daily in the bathing season. The town grew to meet tourist demand, first with seaside villas and later with hotels. By 1840 Kilkee was described as \\"a watering place of considerable importance, having been of late years greatly resorted to by the citizens of Limerick, as also by the gentry of the adjoining country.\\" Many small houses had been built in a haphazard fashion, there was an inn and many lodging houses. Horse-drawn cars ran daily between Kilkee and Kilrush to connect to the Limerick steamers. Stella Maris Hotel, Kilkee, late 19th century A Catholic church was opened in Kilkee in 1831, a Protestant church in 1843 and a Methodist church in 1900. The sea wall and embankment were built between 1846 and the 1860s, giving employment during the Great Famine. The South Clare Railway reached the town in 1892, and Kilkee boomed until the start of World War I (1914-1918). The town has changed since then, but it is still a popular day trip or vacation spot. Catholic parish The old parishes of Kilfearagh and Killard of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe were united by the late seventeenth century. In 1704 Daniel Gorman is recorded as parish priest of Kilfearagh and Killard. Kilfearagh was served by the mass house at Corbally Cross until 1831. That year a parish church was opened in the growing resort of Kilkee. In 1854 the combined parish was redivided into the parishes of Kilkee and Doonbeg, with roughly the same boundaries as the medieval Kilfearagh and Killard. The first church in Kilkee had a cruciform barn structure, with two octagonal towers framing the entrance. Furnishing and decorating the church was a slow process, and seating in the main aisle was not installed until 1885. After many delays, a new church in Kilkee with a modern design was completed in 1963, and the first church was torn down. Today the Catholic parish is served by the Church of the Immaculate Conception and St. Senan in Kilkee and by St. Flannan‚Äôs Church in Lisdeen. The Parish Schools are Moyasta National School, built in 1961 and expanded in 2002; Scoil R√©alt na Mara National School, a mixed school opened in 1999; and Kilkee Community College, a mixed secondary school. Antiquities thumb The old church of Kilfearagh has been leveled to the ground, but the large cemetery that surrounds it remains. There is another graveyard in the townland of Kildimo, dedicated to a Saint Dioma, no longer used. A third, named Cill-na-mban-√≥rtha or \\"church of the pious women\\", is in the townland of Bawnmore. Near this church there is a holy well with the same name. There was a Church of the Nuns in the townland of Killnagalliagh, founded by Saint Sen√°n, but no traces remain. There is a small cemetery at Kilkee, which gives the town its name. The town contains a well dedicated to Saint Sen√°n. About from Kilkee, on the edge of the cliff opposite Bishops Island, there is a holy well dedicated to Saint Caoidhe. Bishops Island has two small buildings, an oratory and cell, dating to the early days of Christianity in Ireland. There is a large fort or rath near Kilkee, said to have been built by the Danes. The civil parish today has graveyards at Baunmore, Emlagh, Farrihy, Kilfearagh and Kilnagalliagh. Townlands Townlands are Ballyonan or Doonaghboy, Baunmore, Corbally, Dough, Emlagh, Farrihy, Foohagh, Garraun, Kildeema, Kilfearagh, Kilkee Lower, Kilkee Upper, Kilnagalliagh, Knockroe, Leaheen, Lisdeen, Lisluinaghan, Moyasta, Termon East and Termon West. Proprietors of these townlands in 1641 on the eve of the English Civil War were Teige, Murtagh and Charles Cahane, Sir Daniel O'Brien, Barnabas O'Brien, 6th Earl of Thomond, Hugh Clancy and Hugh MacSweeney.

As a tribute to him, a huge plateau in Antarctica bears the name Mackin Table and a large lunar crater named Mackin (originally named Mackin- Apollo) marks the location of the Apollo 17 landing site. Biography Mackin was born November 16, 1905, in Oswego, New York, the youngest of seven children of William David Mackin and Catherine Hoover Mackin. Hoover spent two years immobilized in a cast after being stricken with poliomyelitis at the age of four, but outgrew the effects of his childhood illness and eventually played football both at Oswego High School and Oswego Normal School. After graduation in 1924, Mackin entered New York University. Initially intending to become a journalist, he switched his major to geology after hearing lectures by Professor George I. Finley. He received the B.S. degree in geology from NYU in 1930 and then entered the graduate school of Columbia University, where he was granted an M.A. degree in 1932. Mackin accepted an appointment as an instructor at the University of Washington and eventually received a Ph.D. from Columbia in 1936. His teaching career would span thirty-four years‚Äîtwenty-eight years at Washington and six years as Farish Professor of Geology at the University of Texas at Austin. Research While Mackin considered himself a geomorphologist, his bibliography reveals far greater scope to his actual research activities. In his doctoral thesis on the origin of surface features of the Big Horn Basin in Wyoming, he introduced the concept of lateral plantation by a stream essentially at grade, producing gravel-mantled terraces as the stream gradually deepens its valley, as opposed to formation of terraces by stream dissection of earlier alluvial plains. Mackin's further analysis led to publication in 1948 of the classic paper, Concept of the Graded River, which has been cited over 700 times. In this paper Mackin refers to the rapidity with which a graded stream responds to artificial changes - a warning of profound importance to stream engineers against altering natural equilibrium by diversion or damming or channel- improvements. One of Mackin's earliest papers, written with the famous British geologist E. B. Bailey, dealt with the complex folding in the Pennsylvania Piedmont area of the Pennsylvania Regions and the use of b-lineation in structural analysis. This paper was perhaps the first attempt to apply the concepts of recumbent folding and nappe structure to geologic interpretation of the piedmont. Since then, these concepts have been shown to be widely applicable. A by-product of the initial study was Mackin's 1950 paper on the \\"down structure\\" method of viewing and interpreting geologic maps. In World War II, Mackin became affiliated with the U.S. Geologic Survey studying sources of strategic materials. His major effort, which continued after the end of World War II, was on the iron deposits of the Iron Springs District of Utah and also included, quicksilver deposits near Morton, Washington, and placer deposits containing radioactive minerals in Idaho. From these studies, Mackin demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt precisely where the iron that forms the major economic deposits of the district came from, how it was separated from the parent body of intrusive quartz monzonite, why it was deposited in adjacent limestone in the particular places now found, and when this process took place in the igneous and structural history of the area. In the course of the study, Mackin demonstrated that in certain types of magmatic flow, phenocrysts and inclusions become oriented normal, rather than parallel, to the direction of magma movement. Mackin's work is considered to have contributed significantly to the understanding of ore deposits and of granite tectonics. In addition to teaching and research, Mackin was chairman of the Earth Sciences Division of the National Research Council from 1963 to 1965; delegate of the National Academy of Sciences to the 1967 meetings of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences in Istanbul and of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics in Zurich in the same year; and the keynote speaker at the Symposium on Pediments, held in Budapest early in 1968. Mackin was selected as one of several experts to examine samples returned from the Moon. He participated actively in the early planning and design of the lunar geology experiments as a member of the U.S. Geological Survey team sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and he initiated the idea of a sampling tube to be driven into the lunar soil, which became nicknamed the ‚ÄúHoov Tube.‚Äù Honors Throughout his career Mackin was a guest lecturer at many universities, and was the Distinguished Lecturer for the American Association of Petroleum Geologists in 1953 and National Lecturer for Sigma Xi in 1963. Mackin was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Geological Society of America (Council, 1950-1953; chairman of Cordilleran Section, 1950), the Society of Economic Geologists, the American Geophysical Union, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and Sigma Xi. Mackin died on August 12, 1968, while preparing to serve as delegate of the U.S. National Committee on Geology to the International Geological Congress to be held in Prague later in 1968. The University of Texas, where he taught, has an endowment benefiting geosciences, the J. Hoover Mackin Memorial Scholarship Fund. The Geological Society of America also offers a memorial scholarship for students in quaternary geology and geomorphology from the J. Hoover Mackin Award Fund.

The player controls a bird and must explore the environment of R√¶tikon to find its secrets. Game elements include animals with specific behaviors and ancient puzzles. Development began in 2011 and the game was formally announced in July 2013 and followed by alpha and Steam Early Access releases. Secrets of R√¶tikon was released on April 17, 2014 for Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms. It received mixed reviews from reviewers, who praised its artwork and movement physics, but criticized its inconsistency, lack of cohesion, and technical issues.  Gameplay  Secrets of R√¶tikon is a single-player, story-driven, open world sandbox action- adventure video game. The player-character takes form of a bird. The player controls the bird with three buttons: one that flaps its wings, another that takes items into the bird's beak, and another that makes bird sounds. While the game can be played through keyboard and mouse, the developers instead recommend a controller. The objective is to fly through the R√¶tikon environment to find its titular secrets, namely by collecting relics to power an ancient device. The environment is split into themed levels such as swamp, lagoon, mountaintops, and forests. Glowing shards are dispersed throughout each level, which can be collected and redeemed at an altar within each themed level for a glowing relic. These relics can be returned to where the player started the game to power a mysterious, ancient device. The player-character carries the relics past aggressive enemies and treacherous environment, and completes puzzles of reconstructing animal statues from its pieces to access new levels. Each level features different animals and contain environmental objects that player can interact with.  Development  R√¶tikon was first announced in July 2013, though its development began in 2011. The game's Viennese developer and publisher, Broken Rules Games, had previously worked on the 2012 Wii U game Chasing Aurora, which itself was based on a multiplayer prototype for R√¶tikon. The game is partly based on an Alps region culture conquered by the Roman Empire. Its visuals were inspired by dream-like flying sensations. In an effort to increase the game's replay value, the developers emphasized its artificial intelligence, physics, and interactive qualities, including animal-specific behaviors and strippable plant foliage. Broken Rules released an alpha version of the game in October 2013. Around the same time, they announced an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign in lieu of searching for a publisher. The game later entered Steam Early Access. R√¶tikon was released on April 17, 2014 for Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms via Steam, the Mac App Store, and the Humble Store. The Steam edition of the game supports Steam Workshop with a level editor for users to build and share original content.  Reception  The game received \\"mixed or average reviews\\", according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers praised the game's artwork and movement physics, but criticized its lack of cohesion. Some appreciated the moments where the game's elements coalesced. They estimated the game to run between two and three hours in length. Joystiq Sam Prell said that the adventure felt restrictive and linear, \\"like a guided tour\\". He wrote that R√¶tikon map design encourages players to think methodically about their path rather than to explore the game as a non-linear open world. In this way, he felt that its gameplay philosophies contradicted. Hardcore Gamer Geoff Thew wrote that the game \\"commits a number of fundamental design sins\\" as one of \\"few games so ceaselessly tiring to play\\". He felt that the animals who steal the game objectives created \\"busywork\\", and complained of copious backtracking and the \\"straight up discourteous\\" exclusion of an in-game map. Eurogamer Jon Denton added that numerous \\"extremely irritating conflicts\\" with off-screen animals hurt the game's pacing. He noted its gameplay influence from Fez and compared its blue shards game mechanics to that of Dark Souls. Denton did not feel that the game deserved the amount of effort it required of its players to understand its story. Reviewers noted technical issues and glitches within the game. Prell noted issues in the game's physics and game save features. As R√¶tikon does not support manual saves, he frequently found his progress automatically saved while his player-character was stuck in the environment. Thew of Hardcore Gamer found similar physics glitches that trapped him in the environment, which led him to use his keyboard alongside the Xbox 360 controller to circumvent controller compatibility issues. When mentioning the game's art style, most reviewers gave positive response. Denton described the style as a \\"beautifully drawn, angular 2D world\\". Prell wrote that R√¶tikon triangle-based art style made its characters feel like papercraft and gave the game \\"a sense of reverence and spirituality\\" when complemented by the story, and gave comparison to Shadow of the Colossus. Thew gave similar response noting that it is reminiscent of Origami. However, Thew continued to state that while the visuals were \\"distinctive\\", the game's \\"alpine\\" area was \\"clich√©d and predictable\\" and its \\"good looks and smooth movement mechanics\\" did not compensate for the rest of the game's design. He found the game \\"shallow\\", uninteresting, and \\"a disappointment ... on almost every level\\". Denton of Eurogamer praised the moments where he figured out how to find a shard or alphabet piece, but ultimately found R√¶tikon \\"awkward\\", with \\"substance did not live up to its style\\", and causing unjustified and unreasonable frustration.

Sejarah & Perkembangan BPK PENABUR 1950-2010. Jakarta: BPK PENABUR. BPK PENABUR has schools in 15 cities which are in four provinces: West Java, DKI Jakarta, Banten and Lampung. Those 15 cities are Jakarta, Bandung, Cimahi, Cirebon, Bogor, Serang, Bandar Lampung, Metro, Cicurug, Sukabumi, Rengasdengklok, Indramayu, Jatibarang, Cianjur and Tasikmalaya. BPK PENABUR's vision is \\"To become a Christian educational institution superior in Faith, Knowledge, and Service.\\" Its mission is \\"To optimally develop the students' potential through quality education and teaching based on Christian values.\\" BPK PENABUR covers education levels including preschool, primary school, middle school, high school and a Sekolah Menengah Kejuruan in Pharmaceutics.

Buku Acara Kebaktian Syukur dan Pagelaran Seni 60 Tahun BPK PENABUR: Bukan Ekor tapi Kepala. Jakarta: BPK PENABUR.mars bpk penabur History =Pre-1950= The History of BPK PENABUR is strongly linked to the Gereja Kristen Indonesia of the West Java Synod (then named Tiong Hoa Kie Tok Kauw Hwee Khu Hwee Djabar - THKTKHKH Djabar) which has already existed since the Dutch colonial era.https://bpkpenaburjakarta.or.id/history/ The THKTKHKH Synod of West Java is one of the parties that were trusted by the missionary institutions of the Dutch to take over part of the educational institutions that they left behind after the end of Dutch rule over Indonesia. This trust is then responded to quickly by the Synod in a session held on 28 May 1948 in Bandung by forming a committee responsible for taking crucial steps to open Christian schools. Said committee then acquired the support of Rev. Pouw Peng Hong, a pioneer of an independent movement of churches in West Java. With the Reverend's support, the committee became more vigorous in their efforts, especially in acquiring funds and support from teachers to realize their hopes of building a Christian school under the THKTKHKH Synod of West Java. The efforts from the Committee finally had some results. In the years 1948‚Äì1950, the Committee (renamed into the School Committee) successfully built 4 evening schools using the old missionary institution's school buildings. The 4 schools are Christian Primary Schools (SDK) which are located at 29 Pintu Besi St, Tanah Njonja St (now Gunung Sahari St), Oranjeplein St (now Slamet Riyadi St), and 11 Sluisbrugstraat St (now Pintu Air St). In contrast to the Christian schools in Jakarta which focus more on educating and involve more teachers, the Christian schools in Bandung concentrate more on building faith and involve reverends. =1950s: The founding of BP THKTKHKH West Java= After the Round Table Conference, the important figures of the Synod started intensely thinking about the condition of the schools under their custody in Indonesia. Finally, after a series of meetings, the School Committee and the important figures of the Synod agreed to found Badan Pendidikan THKTKHKH (BP THKTKHKH) Djabar. According to a Notarial Deed composed by H. J. J. Lamers in Bandung, represented by Notary Tan Eng Kiam, BP THKTKHKH of West Java is thereby founded and separated from the church. The institution then starts organizing and appointing management. The first president of BP THKTKHKH Djabar was Ong Teng Houw, the secretary was Liem Boen Liong, and the treasurer was Lie Bo Tay. During the founding, BP THKTKHKH Djabar's assets were spread in six cities; Jakarta (5 compounds), Bandung (3 compounds, 2 shared with Gereja Kristen Pasundan), Cirebon, Sukabumi, Jatibarang, and Indramayu. The central office of BP THKTKHKH Djabar was also moved to Jakarta from Bandung following the restoration of Jakarta as the capital city. =1950-1968: The development of BP THKTKHKH Djabar and its renaming to BPK Djabar= During this period, BP THKTKHKH Djabar started expanding to fulfill its goal of building Christian schools. The construction of schools had started spreading to other cities, even those where BP THKTKHKH Djabar hadn't been established yet. In 1953, BP THKTKHKH Djabar pioneered a school in Tasikmalaya which would later become BPK PENABUR Tasikmalaya, followed by BP THKTKHKH Cianjur in 1955, Bogor in 1958, Cimahi in 1961, and then Metro in 1967. Alongside its expansion efforts, BP THKTKHKH Djabar started improving the schools in the original 6 cities. In 1951, Dutch missionaries donated a sum of money to the Christian Kindergarten- Primary school (TKK-SDK) in Kebonjati. 4 years later, in 1955, a new Christian Primary school was built in Guntur St located in Bandung, followed by a Christian Junior High School in Jenderal Sudirman St also in Bandung. To complement the Kindergartens, Primary Schools, and Junior High Schools previously built, the institution built an Assistant Pharmacist School, which is now a Pharmacy Vocational High School. On July 1965, BP THKTKHKH Djabar also opened its first Senior High School(SMA) in Kosambi St in Bandung whose first principal was Drs. Kwee Hok Gwan. This Senior High School will eventually be named SMAK 1 BPK PENABUR Bandung (BPK PENABUR Bandung Christian Senior High School 1). In 1956, the Komite Sekolah (School Committee) was transformed and renamed to Komite Pembantu Setempat (KPS) (Local Assistance Committee). The board members of this committee were members of the THKTKHKH church. An independent KPS in Bandung was established later on in 1959. In 1967, BP THKTKHKH Djabar officially renamed itself to Jajasan Badan Pendidikan Kristen Djawa Barat (BPK Djabar) as stated under Notarist Act No. 33 dated 27 January 1967, issued by Notarist E. Pondaag. As a result of the renaming, BPK Djabar is now open to all ethnic groups in Indonesia and is based on Christian values. =1968-1989: The development of BPK Djabar and its renaming to BPK PENABUR= After renaming itself to BPK Djabar, the institution kept expanding to more cities. In 1975, BPK Djabar Bandar Lampung was officially established, followed by BPK Djabar Rengasdengklok in the same year. The year after, BPK Djabar Cicurug was also established. In 1989, BPK Djabar Serang was established. In other cities, the schools in each city grow faster and faster, with the KPS of each city building more and more school complexes of different education levels. The spread of BPK Djabar to other cities as well as its goal to sow the seeds of Christian education to other cities influenced the management of BPK Djabar to rename itself to BPK PENABUR (literally meaning 'sower') in 1989 as stated in Act no. 121, issued by Notarist Wiryomartani S.H. This event reached Berita Negara Republik Indonesia (National News of the Republic of Indonesia) edition 36, with the name being officially adopted on 1 July 1989, during the GKI Jawa Barat 46th Synod General Assembly. =1989-present: BPK PENABUR= Since 1989, BPK PENABUR has experienced a rapid growth. As of 2010, BPK PENABUR manages 135 schools across Indonesia, including a few PENABUR International Schools and a Vocational High School.

It is long. Tributaries of the stream include Huling Branch and Middle Branch Twomile Run. The stream flows through Leidy Township and Noyes Township. The stream's watershed has an area of approximately 9 square miles. Coal is mined in the watershed. Most of the acid mine drainage in Kettle Creek comes from Twomile Run. The discharge of Twomile Run at its mouth ranges from 200 to 10,000 gallons per minute. There are 2.1 to 11.7 milligrams per liter of manganese in the waters at this location. In 2007, the average pH at the mouth of the stream was 3.52, with a range of 3.4 to 3.9. By 2011, the stream's pH had increased slightly upstream of Huling Branch. Rock formations in the watershed include the Huntley Mountain Formation, the Burgoon Sandstone, the Allegheny Group, and the Pottsville Group. Course Twomile Run begins in Sproul State Forest in Leidy Township, Clinton County. The stream flows south and slightly east, leaving Sproul State Forest and Leidy Township and then entering Noyes Township. Soon after entering Noyes Township, it receives the tributary Middle Branch Twomle Run and continues south. The Twomile Run valley begins to get deeper at this point. The stream turns southwest, then southeast, and then southwest again. Shortly after the final bend, it receives the tributary Huling Branch and not long afterwards enters Kettle Creek. =Tributaries= Named tributaries of Twomile Run include Middle Branch Twomile Run and Huling Branch. Robbins Hollow joins Twomile Run downstream of Middle Branch Twomile Run. Huling Branch has an unnamed tributary of its own and is significantly longer than Middle Branch Twomile Run, about the same length as Twomile Run. Other tributaries of Twomile Run include Pecking Patch Hollow and MackIntosh Hollow. Hydrology The watershed of Twomile Run experiences significant acid mine drainage, with of the stream being affected by it. The acid mine drainage flows in the watershed have a pH of 2.5 to 3.5, an iron concentration of 20 to 50 milligrams per liter, and an aluminum concentration of 20 to 70 milligrams per liter. The acidity concentration in these flows ranges from 200 to 600 milligrams per liter. The stream is the only significant source of acid mine drainage to enter Kettle Creek on its eastern side. Thirty to fifty percent of the acid mine drainage in the Twomile Run watershed comes from baseflow. Above the swamp on Twomile Run, the discharge of the stream is 511 gallons per minute.

Geography, geology, and climate There are a number of surface mines and deep mine complexes in the Twomile Run watershed. Some of the deep mine complexes extend into adjacent watersheds. There are several rock formations in the Twomile Run watershed which are visible on the surface. These include the Huntley Mountain Formation, the Burgoon Sandstone, the Pottsville Group and the Allegheny Group. The Huntley Mountain Formation is from Devonian and Mississippian times and the Burgoon Sandstone is from Mississippian times. The other two formations are both from the Pennsylvanian times. The Upper Kittanning and Lower Kittanning coal seams are found in hills with the Allegheny Group. The Pottsville Group also contains coal seams. The elevation of the Upper Kittanning coal seam in the watershed ranges from to in the ridge between Middle Branch Twomile Run and Huling Branch. The watershed of Twomile Run runs in approximately the same direction as the nearby Clearfield-McIntyre Syncline. To the north of the Clearfield-McIntyre Syncline is the Wellsboro Anticline and to the south is the Hyner Dome. The Huling Branch valley is relatively straight and narrow. The elevation of Twomile Run at its source is , while the elevation at its mouth is . The first acid mine drainage discharge is at . The maximum elevation in the watershed is . The average basin slope is 8.32 degrees. At to white and orange metal precipitate forms on the banks of Twomile Run at its confluence with Kettle Creek because the waters of the former stream are acidic, while those of the latter are alkaline. The velocity-depth of Twomile Run is low, but there is an adequate frequency of riffles in the stream. The right bank of the stream is somewhat unstable. Between 1992 and 2005, the annual precipitation ranged from to at the nearby Alvin R. Bush Dam. The average rate of precipitation was per year. Watershed The watershed of Twomile Run has an area of 9.15 square miles. There are of streams in the watershed, of which are affected by acid mine drainage. Most of the watershed is forested land. However, there are some areas of grassland, parking areas, and roads. The watershed runs in a northeast-southwest direction. Most of the land in the watershed is owned by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the Bureau of Forestry, and Sproul State Forest. There are some agricultural lands in the watershed, most of which are in the vicinity of Huling Branch. Roads in the Twomile Run watershed include Two Mile Run Road. There are between 15 and 20 stream crossings in the stream's watershed. Twomile Run, Huling Branch, and Middle Branch Twomile Run all have floodplains in their upper reaches. History and industries The first coal mines in the Twomile Run watershed were deep mines, but there are no surviving maps of them. Surface mining of the Lower Kittanning and Upper Kittanning coals began after World War Two, with the Lower Kittanning coal being mined to a depth of . By the 1970s, the surface mining had ended. Much of the coal mined in the entire Kettle Creek watershed was in the Twomile Run watershed. In the 1930s and early 1940s, there was a Civilian Conservation Corps located in the Twomile Run watershed. A draft for an Operation Scarlift report was written in 1973 for Kettle Creek (which Twomile Run is a tributary of), but was never approved. A number of passive treatment systems were installed in the tributary Robbins Hollow in 2004 and nine have been installed in the main stem. Timber is produced in the watershed of Twomile Run. Some coal reserves remain in the watershed. Biology Brook trout are found in the upper reaches of the tributary Middle Branch Twomile Run, upstream of the acid mine drainage discharges in its watershed. There are brook trout above the acid mine drainage discharges on Twomile Run, but none below the discharges. The brook trout population is considered to be a \\"Class A population\\" and is increasing. The concentration of brook trout at one location on the tributary Huling Branch is per hectare and at another location the concentration is per hectare. The confluence of Twomile Run with Kettle Creek was completely devoid of fish in 1967, but by 1997, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission observed two species of fish, white sucker and smallmouth bass in this location. Twomile Run has the highest potential fish biodiversity of all streams in the Kettle Creek watershed, with a Potential Species Richness of 232 to 241 in places. Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Odonata, and Coleoptera have all been observed on Huling Branch. The stonefly and caddisfly populations on Middle Branch Twomile Run are increasing. The confluences of Middle Branch Twomile Run and Huling Branch with Twomile Run were considered to be \\"poor\\" or \\"marginal\\" habitats by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection in 2001. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission assessed the mouth of the stream as 2 out of 10 on their habitability scale in the same year. Recreation Most of the land in the Twomile Run watershed is used for recreation. Deer hunting and bear hunting are often done in the area. There is also a series all-terrain vehicle trails known collectively as the Whiskey Springs ATV trail complex. These are located in the sub-watersheds of Huling Branch and Middle Branch Twomile Run.

It was made at Pinewood StudiosWood p.98 with sets designed by Walter Murton. The film was released in the U.S. as Man With 100 Faces. Plot Three men rob a millionaire of diamonds aboard an airliner in flight. When Police Superintendent Benting tries to intervene, Jack Drake, another passenger, knocks him out to save him from being shot. The thieves force the pilot to land so they can dump the passengers. However, the men find the diamonds have already been stolen by someone else (Drake). Drake is a sort of modern-day Robin Hood. He donates the proceeds of his latest robbery to fund the stalled construction of the \\"New Social Institute\\". He even writes a book, \\"Crackerjack\\": The true story of my exploits., which becomes a bestseller. Everybody is reading it, including the people at Scotland Yard and Baroness Von Haltz, and wondering if it is fact or fiction. The baroness tells her maid Annie that certain passages somehow remind her of Drake, who broke her heart. By coincidence, she is residing in the same hotel as Drake. He goes to see her, but she does not forgive him for leaving her without a word in Berlin. He explains that he was forced to leave suddenly, but she is not mollified. Meanwhile, Drake instructs Burdge, his secretary, to send a cheque for ¬£10,000 to the Buckingham Hospital for a new wing, even though Burdge informs him he is overdrawn at the bank. Drake tells him that the wealthy Mrs. Humbold's pearls will provide ample funds. The Humbolds are hosting a masquerade ball that night, and the baroness will be there. At the ball, part of the entertainment is a group called the \\"Four Gangsters\\", who have been tied up and replaced by a gang of real gangsters, the same thieves from the aeroplane caper. Sculpie, their leader, kills an unarmed man who foolishly tries to resist. Afterward, however, Sculpie is furious to learn that the pearls he took from Mrs. Humbold are fakes. Once again, Drake has the real ones. An advertisement in the newspaper asking for Crackerjack's help intrigues Drake. He arranges to meet the person in trouble, who turns out to be the baroness, although he speaks with her indirectly, not face to face. She asks him to retrieve letters being used as blackmail by Hambro Golding. Drake is especially interested when she informs him that the letters prevent her from marrying. He promises to attend to the matter the next night. Unaware that Golding is actually a member of Sculpie's gang, she innocently informs him that Crackerjack will try to burgle his safe for the non-existent letters (Golding told her that Crackerjack had stolen his ring, a family heirloom). Sculpie is delighted. However, when the baroness returns for her forgotten handbag, she overhears the gang discussing Crackerjack's fate. Suspecting that Drake is Crackerjack, she tries to stop him by making a dinner engagement with him, but when he does not show up at the appointed time, she makes Burdge take her to Golding's place. Drake is caught, but manages to turn the tables on the gang. He has also arranged for the police to raid the house as well. Drake gets away and flies off with the baroness to get married.

Background  After their fourth studio album, Human Frailty, was released in Australia in April 1986 Hunters & Collectors toured North America twice later that year. The band's line-up was John Archer on bass guitar, Doug Falconer on drums, John 'Jack' Howard on trumpet, Robert Miles providing live sound and art design, Mark Seymour on lead vocals, lead guitar, Jeremy Smith on French horn and Michael Waters on trombone, keyboards. They returned to the studio in February 1987 and recorded three songs, co-produced by the band with Greg Edward. These tracks were then released as their third extended play, Living Daylight on 13 April 1987. Rock historian, Ian McFarlane, felt it was \\"something of a stop- gap measure\\". The three-track EP appeared on the Australian Top 50 Singles Chart peaking at No. 41 on the Australia Singles Chart and No. 25 in New Zealand. Following its release Hunters & Collectors toured the US and Canada for three months. Upon their return to Australia they went back to the recording studios in September 1987 and recorded their fifth studio album, What's a Few Men?, also co-produced with Edward, which was then released in November.

Editura Meronia, Bucharest, 2008, he adhered to the Bolshevik movement while still an adolescent. Because he participated in the typographers' demonstration of December 13, 1918, he was expelled from every educational institution in his native country by the authorities of the Kingdom of Romania. He continued his high school education in Paris and began but did not complete studies at the polytechnic division of the University of Grenoble. He returned to Romania in 1922 and was hired as an expert at the War Ministry. He was recruited as a Soviet spy in Vienna in 1928; arrested in Romania in December 1930, he agreed to become an informant for the Siguran»õa secret police. At his trial for espionage on the Soviets' behalf, he was initially sentenced to five years at hard labor, but was retried and acquitted in 1932.Dennis Deletant, Banalitatea rƒÉului: o istorie a SecuritƒÉ»õii √Æn documente, 1949-1989, p.333.

During the rest of the decade, Zilber, characterized as \\"cultured, voluble and ubiquitous\\", and known in the cultural circles of Bucharest, led an underground life as a member of the banned Romanian Communist Party working to destroy \\"bourgeois democracy\\", an informer and a spy, but also lived the seemingly normal life of a bourgeois desirous of prosperity. Following the King Michael Coup of August 1944, when the Communist Party was made legal, he became the closest collaborator of his friend Lucre»õiu PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, who became Justice Minister.TƒÉnase, p.151 Zilber was arrested in 1948, together with PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, and imprisoned following a show trial.

On August 18 the strike escalated on a violent clash called \\"Kemi Bloody Thursday\\" between strikers and local police, two workers were killed and several injured. Kemi strike is so far the last fatal political protest in Finland. The Kemi strike is seen as a struggle between Communist Party of Finland and the Prime Minister K-A Fagerholm's cabinet. The cabinet controlled a large part of the trade unions through the Social Democratic Party and the communists wanted to regain the power their parliamentary organization Finnish People's Democratic League had lost in the 1948 legislative election.Hanhim√§ki, Jussi M.: \\"Containing Coexistence: America, Russia, and the \\"Finnish Solution\\" 1945‚Äì1956\\", p. 74‚Äì77. Kent State University Press, 1997.  The clash  The strike began on July 1, as the government wanted to cut the wages of Kemi Oy's lumber workers with more than 30 percent. It was soon joined by local lumberjacks, employers of the Kemi Oy sawmill and the dockers of Port of Kemi. Prime Minister Karl-August Fagerholm declared the strike illegal as it went on for several weeks. The strike caused a jam of 20,5 million cubic foot of logs to the mouth of Kemijoki river.Kemin \\"veritorstai\\" 1949 (in Finnish). Finnish Broadcasting Company. Retrieved 11 April 1949. The employers recruited strikebreakers, bringing them to work under police protection. On August 18 a peaceful march of more the 3,000 strikers was on its way to the estuary, where the strikebreakers were driving logs and releasing the jam. As the march was stopped by armed policemen, a violent riot burst out. Protesters were equipped with sticks and rocks, while the police were using their batons and guns. One striker was shot and a female worker was fatally hit by a truck. It is still unclear who fired the deadly shot. According to official forensic examination the bullet was not shot from any of the police guns, although declassified secret police documents reveal that the police were shooting at strikers. One police officer stated he was prevented from shooting at a violent striker only by his gun jamming.Pohjolan Sanomat 16.8.2009  Aftermath  As a result, president Juho Kusti Paasikivi called a general alert of the armed forces and the government sent army troops to Kemi. This ended up with an arrest of 22 leading activists. A total number of 127 strikers were later accused of uprising, 63 of them were sent to prison. The police violence caused a series of sympathy strikes around Finland by communist dominated trade unions like the seamen's union led by Niilo W√§ll√§ri and a large number of metal workers. Finnish government was even afraid of communist uprising and Soviet intervention. Communists in turn, were accusing the government for violating the Paris Peace Treaty since they had sent military against the striking workers. The American press characterized the incident as a \\"test for Finnish democracy\\". Soviet newspaper Pravda was talking about \\"police terror\\" and \\"Prime Minister Fagerholm's collaboration with American imperialists\\". The sympathy strikes were finally put down on 22 August, as the Social Democrat controlled Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions expelled the striking unions. Several other unions decided to cancel their planned strikes. Some trade union leaders were later put on trial and given short sentences.

Sources  The Constitution of North Carolina is the foremost source of state law. Legislation is enacted by the General Assembly, published in the North Carolina Session Laws, and codified in the North Carolina General Statutes. State agency regulations (sometimes called administrative law) are published in the North Carolina Register and codified in the North Carolina Administrative Code. North Carolina's legal system is based on common law, which is interpreted by case law through the decisions of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals, which are published in the North Carolina Reports and North Carolina Court of Appeals Reports, respectively. Counties, cities, towns, and villages may also promulgate local ordinances. = Constitution = North Carolina has had three constitutions, adopted in 1776, 1868, and 1971, respectively. Like the federal constitution does for the federal government, the North Carolina Constitution both provides for the structure of the North Carolina government and enumerates rights which the North Carolina government may not infringe. Because \\"[t]the North Carolina Constitution expresses the will of the people of [the] State,\\" it is \\"the supreme law of the land.\\" \\"If there is a conflict between\\" a state statute and the North Carolina Constitution, the constitution controls because it \\"is the superior rule of law in that situation.\\" The Supreme Court of North Carolina has the ‚Äúpower and . . . duty to determine whether challenged acts of the General Assembly violate the constitution,‚Äù by ‚Äúconstru[ing] and appl[ying] the provisions of‚Äù that document ‚Äúwith finality.‚Äù To determine whether a statute violates the North Carolina Constitution, a court looks to the text and ‚Äúhistorical context‚Äù of the ‚Äúapplicable constitutional provision‚Äù and subsequent court decisions interpreting that text and history. Laws passed by the General Assembly are presumptively constitutional and will be held unconstitutional only when ‚Äúthe constitutional violation is plain and clear.‚Äù = Regulations = Pursuant to certain statutes, state agencies have promulgated regulations, also known as administrative law. The North Carolina Register includes information about state agency rules, administrative rules, executive orders and other notices, and is published bimonthly. The State of North Carolina Administrative Code (NCAC) contains all the rules adopted by the state agencies and occupational licensing boards in North Carolina. Both are compiled and published by the Rules Division of the North Carolina Office of Administrative Hearings. = Case law = The legal system of North Carolina is based on the common law. Like all U.S. states except Louisiana, North Carolina has a reception statute providing for the \\"reception\\" of English law. All statutes, regulations, and ordinances are subject to judicial review. Pursuant to common law tradition, the courts of North Carolina have developed a large body of case law through the decisions of the North Carolina Supreme Court and North Carolina Court of Appeals. The decisions of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals are published in the North Carolina Reports and North Carolina Court of Appeals Reports, respectively. Opinions are first published online on filing day as slip opinions, and may be withdrawn or corrected until the mandate issues 20 days later. Slip opinions are then printed with headnotes and other finding aids in soft-bound books called Advance Sheets and online, and are given citations to the official reports. Advance sheets are then compiled and printed in the hard-bound volumes of the North Carolina Reports and North Carolina Court of Appeals Reports, respectively. Trial court opinions are often neither written nor published. = Local ordinances = Local governments are created by acts of the General Assembly, which define their boundaries and approve their charters. These charters can be changed by legislative action or, in certain cases, by home rule amendments adopted by the local governments. Local government charters and legislative amendments can be found in the North Carolina Session Laws, and all home rule changes must be filed with the Secretary of State and the Legislative Library.

The feature works by having the same namespace for a set of resources and processes, but those namespaces refer to distinct resources. Resources may exist in multiple spaces. Examples of such resources are process IDs, hostnames, user IDs, file names, and some names associated with network access, and interprocess communication. Namespaces are a fundamental aspect of containers on Linux. The term \\"namespace\\" is often used for a type of namespace (e.g. process ID) as well as for a particular space of names. A Linux system starts out with a single namespace of each type, used by all processes. Processes can create additional namespaces and join different namespaces.  History  Linux namespaces were inspired by the wider namespace functionality used heavily throughout Plan 9 from Bell Labs. The Linux Namespaces originated in 2002 in the 2.4.19 kernel with work on the mount namespace kind. Additional namespaces were added beginning in 2006 and continuing into the future. Adequate containers support functionality was finished in kernel version 3.8 with the introduction of User namespaceshttps://lwn.net/Articles/532593/.  Namespace kinds  Since kernel version 5.6, there are 8 kinds of namespaces. Namespace functionality is the same across all kinds: each process is associated with a namespace and can only see or use the resources associated with that namespace, and descendant namespaces where applicable. This way each process (or process group thereof) can have a unique view on the resources. Which resource is isolated depends on the kind of namespace that has been created for a given process group. = Mount (mnt) = Mount namespaces control mount points. Upon creation the mounts from the current mount namespace are copied to the new namespace, but mount points created afterwards do not propagate between namespaces (using shared subtrees, it is possible to propagate mount points between namespaces). The clone flag used to create a new namespace of this type is CLONE_NEWNS - short for \\"NEW NameSpace\\". This term is not descriptive (as it doesn't tell which kind of namespace is to be created) because mount namespaces were the first kind of namespace and designers did not anticipate there being any others. = Process ID (pid) = The PID namespace provides processes with an independent set of process IDs (PIDs) from other namespaces. PID namespaces are nested, meaning when a new process is created it will have a PID for each namespace from its current namespace up to the initial PID namespace. Hence the initial PID namespace is able to see all processes, albeit with different PIDs than other namespaces will see processes with. The first process created in a PID namespace is assigned the process id number 1 and receives most of the same special treatment as the normal init process, most notably that orphaned processes within the namespace are attached to it. This also means that the termination of this PID 1 process will immediately terminate all processes in its PID namespace and any descendants. = Network (net) = Network namespaces virtualize the network stack. On creation a network namespace contains only a loopback interface. Each network interface (physical or virtual) is present in exactly 1 namespace and can be moved between namespaces. Each namespace will have a private set of IP addresses, its own routing table, socket listing, connection tracking table, firewall, and other network-related resources. Destroying a network namespace destroys any virtual interfaces within it and moves any physical interfaces within it back to the initial network namespace. = Interprocess Communication (ipc) = IPC namespaces isolate processes from SysV style inter-process communication. This prevents processes in different IPC namespaces from using, for example, the SHM family of functions to establish a range of shared memory between the two processes. Instead each process will be able to use the same identifiers for a shared memory region and produce two such distinct regions. = UTS = UTS (UNIX Time-Sharing) namespaces allow a single system to appear to have different host and domain names to different processes. = User ID (user) = User namespaces are a feature to provide both privilege isolation and user identification segregation across multiple sets of processes available since kernel 3.8https://lwn.net/Articles/532593/. With administrative assistance it is possible to build a container with seeming administrative rights without actually giving elevated privileges to user processes. Like the PID namespace, user namespaces are nested and each new user namespace is considered to be a child of the user namespace that created it. A user namespace contains a mapping table converting user IDs from the container's point of view to the system's point of view. This allows, for example, the root user to have user id 0 in the container but is actually treated as user id 1,400,000 by the system for ownership checks. A similar table is used for group id mappings and ownership checks. To facilitate privilege isolation of administrative actions, each namespace type is considered owned by a user namespace based on the active user namespace at the moment of creation. A user with administrative privileges in the appropriate user namespace will be allowed to perform administrative actions within that other namespace type. For example, if a process has administrative permission to change the IP address of a network interface, it may do so as long as its own user namespace is the same as (or ancestor of) the user namespace that owns the network namespace. Hence the initial user namespace has administrative control over all namespace types in the system. = Control group (cgroup) Namespace = The cgroup namespace type hides the identity of the control group of which process is a member. A process in such a namespace, checking which control group any process is part of, would see a path that is actually relative to the control group set at creation time, hiding its true control group position and identity. This namespace type has existed since March 2016 in Linux 4.6. = Time Namespace = The time namespace allows processes to see different system times in a way similar to the UTS namespace. It was proposed in 2018 and landed on Linux 5.6, which was released in March 2020. = Proposed namespaces =  syslog namespace   Implementation details  The kernel assigns each process a symbolic link per namespace kind in \`/proc//ns/\`. The inode number pointed to by this symlink is the same for each process in this namespace. This uniquely identifies each namespace by the inode number pointed to by one of its symlinks. Reading the symlink via readlink returns a string containing the namespace kind name and the inode number of the namespace. = Syscalls = Three syscalls can directly manipulate namespaces: * clone, flags to specify which new namespace the new process should be migrated to. * unshare, allows a process (or thread) to disassociate parts of its execution context that are currently being shared with other processes (or threads) * setns, enters the namespace specified by a file descriptor. = Destruction = If a namespace is no longer referenced, it will be deleted, the handling of the contained resource depends on the namespace kind. Namespaces can be referenced in three ways: # by a process belonging to the namespace # by an open filedescriptor to the namespace's file (\`/proc//ns/\`) # a bind mount of the namespace's file (\`/proc//ns/\`)  Adoption  Various container software use Linux namespaces in combination with cgroups to isolate their processes, including Docker and LXC. Other applications, such as Google Chrome make use of namespaces to isolate its own processes which are at risk from attack on the internet . There is also an unshare wrapper in util-linux. An example to its use is SHELL=/bin/sh unshare --fork --pid chroot \\"\${chrootdir}\\" \\"$@\\"  References   External links  * namespaces manpage * Namespaces ‚Äî The Linux Kernel documentation * Linux kernel Namespaces and cgroups by Rami Rosen * Namespaces and cgroups, the basis of Linux containers (including cgroups v2) - slides of a talk by Rami Rosen, Netdev 1.1, Seville, Spain (2016) * Containers and Namespaces in the Linux Kernel by Kir Kolyshkin *https://medium.com/@teddyking/linux-namespaces-850489d3ccf *https://medium.com/@teddyking/namespaces-in-go-basics-e3f0fc1ff69a *https://medium.com/@teddyking/namespaces-in-go-user-a54ef9476f2a *https://medium.com/@teddyking/namespaces-in-go-reexec-3d1295b91af8 *https://medium.com/@teddyking/namespaces-in-go-mount-e4c04fe9fb29 *https://medium.com/@teddyking/namespaces-in-go-network-fdcf63e76100 *https://medium.com/@teddyking/namespaces-in-go-uts-d47aebcdf00e Interfaces of the Linux kernel Linux kernel features Operating system security Virtualization-related software for Linux ","title":"Linux namespaces"},{"id":"42463202","text":"Lumachan () is a railway station on the Alishan Forest Railway line located in Zhuqi Township, Chiayi County, Taiwan.

History and description  The Transit-Mix Corporation operated a concrete plant on the site from the late 1940s through its abandonment in 1987, according to NYC Parks, although the city's land records indicate the property was foreclosed for non-payment of taxes in 1981. In 2000, the property was transferred to NYC Parks, which formed a partnership with community organizations, including the Bronx River Alliance, to design and construct the park. The city stabilized the old structures from the abandoned plant, cleared tons of debris, and constructed other park facilities. The park was opened to the public in 2009. Besides the restored concrete plant structures, which have fences around them, the park includes a walk along the Bronx River, grassy lawns, seating (some of it under a small metal canopy), a \\"reading circle\\" of concrete chair-like structures, and a paved bicycle and pedestrian trail that is part of the developing Bronx River Greenway.

March 13, 948Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287.Academia Sinica Chinese-Western Calendar Converter.), known as Du Wei () during the reign of Shi Chonggui, was a major general of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period state Later Jin, as a brother-in-law to its founding emperor Shi Jingtang and uncle to Shi Jingtang's successor (adoptive son and biological nephew) Shi Chonggui. He, however, would betray Shi Chonggui and surrender to Later Jin's rival, the Khitan state Liao's Emperor Taizong, hoping that Emperor Taizong would make him the emperor of China, and would later rebel against the succeeding Later Han state's founding emperor Liu Zhiyuan. He eventually surrendered again to Later Han, but was executed at Liu Zhiyuan's directions following Liu Zhiyuan's death. He was one of the reviled figures of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period, due to his treachery and mistreatment of the people.  Background  It is not known when Du Chongwei was born. His family was originally from Shuo Prefecture (ÊúîÂ∑û, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi), and his grandfather Du Xing () served as an officer of Zhenwu Circuit (ÊåØÊ≠¶, headquartered at Shuo Prefecture). His father Du Duijin () served as a forward commander for the major late-Tang warlord Li Keyong the military governor (Jiedushi) of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), however, and it was apparently during that time the family moved to Hedong's capital Taiyuan. In Du Chongwei's youth, he served under Li Keyong's adoptive son Li Siyuan.Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 109.  During Later Tang  During Li Siyuan's reign as the emperor of Later Tang, Du Chongwei served as an officer in the imperial guards, and received the title of prefect of Fang Prefecture (Èò≤Â∑û ‚Äî unclear where it was, most likely in modern Liaoning, but in any case an honorary title only as that prefecture was under the control of Khitan Empire). By this point, he was married to a younger sister of the general Shi Jingtang, who was a son-in-law of Li Siyuan's.  During Later Jin  = During Shi Jingtang's reign = In 936, Shi Jingtang, then the military governor of Hedong, rose against then-Later Tang emperor Li Congke (Li Siyuan's adoptive son) and, with aid from Khitan Empire's Emperor Taizong, was able to defeat Later Tang troops, causing Li Congke to commit suicide and ending Later Tang. Shi became emperor of a new state of Later Jin, formally subordinate to the Khitan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. Du Chongwei's activities during the war between Li Congke and Shi were unclear, but after Shi's victory, he made Du an imperial guard general and had Du also carry the honorary title of prefect of Shu Prefecture (ËàíÂ∑û, in modern Anqing, Anhui, then the territory of Later Jin's southeastern neighbor Wu). Du's wife (Shi's younger sister) was created the Grand Princess Leping.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. In 937, Fan Yanguang the military governor of Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei) rose against Shi's rule. He was soon joined in rebellion by Zhang Congbin (), who rose at Luoyang. Shi sent Du and Hou Yi () against Zhang, and they defeated Zhang; Zhang drowned when he tried to retreat. (During this campaign, Shi made Du the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), but kept him as a general of the imperial guards.) Du subsequently served under Yang Guangyuan in the campaign against Fan, eventually resulting in Fan's surrender. He was then made the military governor of Zhongwu Circuit (Âø†Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan), but continued to serve as a general of the imperial guards. In 939, Shi bestowed honorary chancellor designations of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi () on both Du and another imperial guard general, Liu Zhiyuan the military governor of Guide Circuit (Ê≠∏Âæ∑, headquartered in modern Shangqiu, Henan). Liu, whose battlefield accomplishments greatly helped Shi in the establishment of Later Jin, felt insulted ‚Äî as he believed that Du was only reaching his position due to the marital relationship, and therefore did not want to be mentioned in the same edict as Du ‚Äì and therefore initially declined repeatedly. This led to Shi's being angered and considering removing Liu altogether, but the chancellor Zhao Ying defused the situation, and subsequently, Shi sent the imperial scholar He Ning to persuade Liu to accept.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. Du's military governorship was subsequently changed to that of Tianping Circuit (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong). In 941, at the recommendation of the chancellors Li Song and Feng Dao, Shi sent Liu, who was then the commander of all imperial guards, out of the capital Kaifeng to serve as the military governor of Hedong, while replacing him with Du. It was said that because of this, Liu resented Li and Feng. It was said at the time that Du was exacting of the people's wealth, and that wherever he served, the people often fled his jurisdiction. This led to a comment he made when visiting a market, \\"Some say that I chase away the people. How come there are still so many people here at the market?\\" In late 941, An Chongrong the military governor of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) rebelled against Shi. Shi sent Du and Ma Quanjie () against him. Du's and An's army met and battled near Zongcheng (ÂÆóÂüé, in modern Xingtai, Hebei). During the encounter, An initially successfully repelled two attacks by Du, and Du considered withdrawing. The officer Wang Chongyin (), however, convinced him that retreating may lead to a general panic, and he therefore did not do so. Instead, as Wang suggested, he attacked An's army on three fronts. At this point, An's key officer Zhao Yanzhi () surrendered to him (although his soldiers killed Zhao anyway), leading to a panic in An's army and allowing Du to crush his army. An fled back to Chengde's capital Zhen Prefecture (), and Du then put it under siege. Shortly after, an officer of An's allowed Du's army to enter Zhen and execute An. Du, however, killed that officer so that he could claim credit for capturing the city. Shi then renamed Zhen to Heng, and Chengde to Shunguo (), and then made Du Shunguo's military governor. Du seized both An's personal wealth and the circuit treasury to be his own personal wealth, and while Shi knew this, he did nothing about it. Du's deputy military governor Wang Yu () was also harsh and corrupt, such that the people of Heng were oppressed.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. = During Shi Chonggui's reign = Shi Jingtang died later in 942, and was succeeded by his adoptive son and biological nephew (biological son of his older brother Shi Jingru () Shi Chonggui ‚Äî who was therefore a nephew by marriage of Du Chongwei's. (During Shi Chonggui's reign, Du Chongwei became known as Du Wei, to observe naming taboo for Shi Chonggui.) Instead of the submissive stance that Shi Jingtang took toward Khitan (which had renamed its state Liao by this point), Shi Chonggui, at the advice of his chancellor Jing Yanguang, took a confrontational stance against Liao, only willing to refer to himself as \\"grandson\\" (as Shi Jingtang had claimed himself to be \\"son\\") and not \\"subject\\" as to Emperor Taizong. He further executed many Liao merchants in Later Jin territory and seized their possessions. Confrontations against Liao thus loomed. Further, it happened at the time that there were droughts, floods, and locust-driven famines throughout various parts of the Later Jin realm. Shi Chonggui ordered that all the excess food that the people had held onto were to be requisitioned for state use. While his edict exempted Shunguo and Yiwu (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei) Circuits, Du nevertheless reported that his own army needed the food supplies, and therefore was nevertheless allowed to seize food supplies from the people. Altogether, he seized one million Hu () of grain, but only reported to Shi that he seized 300,000 Hu ‚Äî with the remainder taken into his own personal wealth. By that point, the Later Jin imperial government was in a tense standoff with Yang Guangyuan, who was then the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong), with Yang displeased that his powers were being curbed by Jing, and therefore was secretly negotiating with Emperor Taizong, hoping for Liao support for him to displace Later Jin. In late 943, Yang, in preparation for his rebellion, secretly ordered his son Yang Chengzuo (), who was then the prefect of Dan Prefecture (ÂñÆÂ∑û, in modern Heze, Shandong), to flee back to Pinglu's capital Qing Prefecture (). In spring 944, Du tried to defuse the situation by sending his staff member Cao Guangyi () as an emissary to Yang, trying to persuade Yang not to rebel. Yang initially promised that he was not intending to rebel, such that Shi believed his promise and tried to negotiate with him further. However, Emperor Taizong, around the same time, already launched Liao troops to aid Yang, and so Yang rebelled anyway. During the subsequent campaign, during which Shi ordered a number of generals to the north to resist the Liao invasion while sending Li Shouzhen to attack Yang, Du was titularly the second in command of this anti-Liao army, under Liu Zhiyuan. The Liao army was soon repelled, and Li Shouzhen's siege on Qing caused Yang Guangyuan's son Yang Chengxun () to put Yang Guangyuan under house arrest and then surrender.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. In late 944, Emperor Taizong launched another major incursion into Later Jin territory, inflicting much damage on the Later Jin populace north of the Yellow River. As the Liao army withdrew in spring 945, Shi sent Du and Li Shouzhen in command of an army to give chase. They crossed into Liao territory and captured Qi () and Tai () (both in modern Baoding), but soon received news that the Liao army had turned around and was heading for them. They tried to withdraw, but became surrounded near Yangcheng (ÈôΩÂüé, in modern Baoding). Du panicked and was reluctant to engage the Liao army, but at Fu Yanqing's advocacy, Fu, Zhang Yanze, Yao Yuanfu (), and Huangfu Yu (), attacked the Liao army fiercely, causing the Liao army to panic and flee. However, despite this victory, it was said that Du continued to misgovern Shunguo, as he continued to extract wealth from the people. Further, whenever the Liao army pillaged the towns of the circuit (as Shunguo was on the Later Jin/Liao border), he, fearing them, would not launch any forces to aid the towns, such that many of the Shunguo towns were slaughtered. Continuing to fear the possibility of a Liao invasion and the resentment from the people, he, in summer 945, simply abandoned his post without prior imperial approval and returned to Kaifeng. Shi's chief of staff (Shumishi) Sang Weihan greatly advocated punishing Du, but Shi, as he saw Du as an uncle, refused. Sang thereafter resigned in exasperation. When Du arrived at Kaifeng, he \\"offered\\" his wealth (which he had left at Heng Prefecture) to the emperor, and then requested, through his wife (who was then carrying the title of Grand Princess of Song), to be the military governor of Tianxiong. Shi agreed. Despite this episode, when the imperial official Wang Qinzuo () was subsequently sent to Shunguo to serve as its acting military governor, and Wang took Du's stored grains for the circuit's use, Du objected angrily, arguing that it was his own personal wealth, such that Shi compensated Du and recalled Wang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. In 946, there were rumors that the major Liao general Zhao Yanshou ‚Äî who had previously been a major Later Tang general before being captured by the Khitan in the campaign that led to Later Tang's destruction ‚Äî was planning on defecting to Later Jin. This rumor was believed by Shi's chiefs of staff Li Song and Feng Yu (the brother of Shi's wife Empress Feng). They had Du write a letter to Zhao, encouraging him to do so, with the officer Zhao Xingshi (), who had previously served under Zhao Yanshou, delivering the letter. Zhao Yanshou wrote back (to try to lead Later Jin forces into a trap), stating, \\"I have long been in a foreign land, and I want to return to China. Please launch a major army to support me, so that I can pull myself out and return with it.\\" Subsequently, under Emperor Taizong's orders, Liao's prefect of Ying Prefecture (ÁÄõÂ∑û, in modern Cangzhou), Liu Yanzuo (), also offered to defect to Later Jin. Shi thus put Du and Li Shouzhen in command of an army to attack north, with the stated objectives being to first recapture the prefectures Shi Jingtang previously ceded to Liao (the Sixteen Prefectures), and then to destroy Liao. (Zhao Ying, however, had reservations, pointing out that Du, despite his honored position, was still often dissatisfied with his station, and therefore suggested to Li Song and Feng that Li Shouzhen be put in command by himself; Zhao Ying's suggestions were not listened to, however.) When Du and Li Shouzhen advanced, though, they were met by a large army that Emperor Taizong personally commanded. The Liao army eventually surrounded the Later Jin army at Zhongdu Bridge (‰∏≠Â∫¶Ê©ã, in modern Baoding). After Emperor Taizong made the promise to Du to make him emperor if he surrendered, Du and Li Shouzhen surrendered their army. (As part of accepting Du's surrender, Emperor Taizong had Zhao mockingly put an imperial robe on Du.) Emperor Taizong then prepared to advance south. He commissioned Du acting Taifu () and the defender of Tianxiong's capital Yedu (), and had Du accompany him south. With virtually the entire Later Jin army having been given to Du and Li Shouzhen for this northern campaign, Kaifeng was left essentially defenseless, and Shi Chonggui felt compelled to surrender, ending Later Jin. Emperor Taizong subsequently entered Daliang.  During the Liao occupation  Emperor Taizong soon claimed to also be the emperor of China. He distrusted the Later Jin imperial troops that surrendered with Du Chongwei, believing that he made a mistake in having given those troops to Shi Jingtang and allowing those troops to be subsequently used by Shi Chonggui in resisting him. He considered, but initially hesitated, in slaughtering them, so he stationed them at Chenqiao (Èô≥Ê©ã, in modern Xinxiang, Henan) while deciding what to do with them, with Du still in command. However, despite the fact that it was snow season, he gave them insufficient supplies, such that the soldiers were going cold and hungry; they were resentful of Du, and they often gathered to curse him, as did the local populace whenever Du came out of his headquarters. Emperor Taizong's thoughts of slaughtering the soldiers only came to rest when Zhao Yanshou pointed out that doing so would leave the former Later Jin territory defenseless against invasions by Later Shu and Southern Tang (Wu's successor state).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. Emperor Taizong required the former Later Jin officials and generals to offer substantial parts of their wealth to continue the upkeep of the military, but Du complained, pointing out that he surrendered the entire army to Liao already. Emperor Taizong laughed and exempted him. Emperor Taizong also distrusted the former Later Jin military governors, and after they came to Kaifeng to pay homage to him and show submission, he kept them at Kaifeng for quite some time, not sending them back to their circuits. This left a power vacuum in the circuits, and many rebellions rose against Liao rule in response to his harsh rule ‚Äî including allowing the Liao soldiers to freely pillage the countryside. It was not until this began to occur that Emperor Taizong began sending some of the military governors back to their circuits, including Du and Li Shouzhen. Emperor Taizong soon tired of dealing with these rebellions, and he left his brother- in-law Xiao Han in charge of Kaifeng as the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (), while heading back to Liao proper himself. On the way, when he went through Yedu, Du and his wife (the former princess) went to the Liao camp to pay homage to him.  During Later Han  Meanwhile, Liu Zhiyuan declared himself the emperor of a new state of Later Han at Taiyuan, and the rebel forces against Liao gradually submitted to him, allowing him to take over most of the former Later Jin territory after the gradual Liao withdrawal (coupled with Emperor Taizong's death and succession by his nephew Emperor Shizong). Du Chongwei initially offered to submit to Liu as well, and further offered to be transferred to another circuit. In summer 947, Liu issued orders swapping his position with that of Gao Xingzhou the military governor of Guide. However, Du's offer was merely a test to see what Liu's intentions were toward him, and upon Liu's orders, he resisted and requested aid from the Liao general Yel√º Mada (), whom Emperor Shizong left in charge of Heng, then still under Liao control. Yel√º Mada sent a mixed Khitan and Han Chinese army (with the Han component coming from their having been personal guards for Zhao Yanshou and were from Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing), which was part of the land that Shi Jingtang cedd to Liao) to help Du defend Yedu. Liu commissioned Gao as the commander of an army against Du, with Liu's half- brother Murong Yanchao serving as Gao's deputy. Murong, however, doubted Gao's faithfulness as Gao's daughter was Du's daughter-in-law, and so there was discord among them. Liu decided to command the siege himself, and he shortly after arrived at Yedu. Du initially claimed that once Liu arrived, he would submit, but when Liu arrived, continued to defend the city. As the food supplies dwindled, many of Du's soldiers surrendered to the Later Han army, but for quite some time the defense held, particularly because the Lulong soldiers, under the command of the officer Zhang Lian (), were highly motivated after hearing that Liu had slaughtered a group of Lulong soldiers at Kaifeng. By winter 947, however, the city was in desperate situation, and Du sent, successively, his officer Wang Min (), his son Du Honglian (), and his wife, to meet with Liu, offering to surrender. Liu accepted his surrender. By that point, some 70-80% of the populace had died of starvation. While Liu spared Du, he, at the suggestion of his general Guo Wei, killed some 100 of Du's officers. Further, while Liu had offered Zhang free passage, he instead arrested and killed Zhang, although he allowed Zhang's soldiers to return to Lulong. He also seized Du's wealth to use it to supply the army. Liu created Du the Duke of Chu and gave him the titles of Taifu and Zhongshu Ling (), and kept him at Kaifeng. By this point, Du had become so despised by the populace that whenever he was out in public, the people would throw stones and bricks at him. In spring 948, Liu was deathly ill. He entrusted his son Liu Chengyou, who was to succeed him, to a group of high level officials and generals ‚Äî Su Fengji, Yang Bin, Shi Hongzhao, and Guo. As part of his instructions, he stated, \\"Be careful of Du Chongwei!\\" After he died shortly after, this group of regents did not immediately announce his death. Rather, they issued an edict in his name, ordering that Du and his sons Du Hongzhang (), Du Honglian, and Du Hongcan () be put to death. The former princess and other relatives were spared. Du Chongwei's corpse was displayed in the open and cut into pieces. The people rushed to cannibalize him to show their disgust at him, and soon, the flesh was all gone.

Kolovrat's forces suddenly attacked the rear-guard of Batu Khan's army and annihilated it in a fierce battle. Perplexed, Batu Khan sent out a much larger force, led by his relative Khostovrul. Khostovrul promised to capture Kolovrat alive, and accordingly challenged Kolovrat to a duel. A man of extraordinary strength, Kolovrat split his opponent in half with his sword and proceeded to kill the surrounding Mongols, splitting many of them down to the saddle. Khostovrul's remaining soldiers retreated and killed Kolovrat from a distance using stone launchers. In a sign of respect for Kolovrat's bravery, Batu Khan returned his body to his soldiers and let them return home. Legacy The bravery and strength of Kolovrat were praised in the Russian literature, art and media by *Nikolay Yazykov in \\"Evpaty\\" (1824) *Lev Mei in the \\"Song about boyar Evpaty Kolovrat\\" (1859) *Sergei Yesenin in The Tale of Evpaty Kolovrat (1912) *Vasily Yan in Chapter 3 \\"Evpaty the Fierce\\" of the book Batu (1942) *Furious (Kolovrat) film of Ivan Shuvkhovetsky (2017) *Yevpatiy Kolovrat, an icebreaker for the Russian Navy The tale of Kolovrat is depicted in the 1985 Soviet short animated film The Tale of Evpaty Kolovrat and is being produced as a full-length movie.

It is much larger in scope than standard libraries for most other languages, including C++, and is comparable in scope and coverage to the standard libraries of Java. The list of standard libraries is Base Class Library (BCL), Runtime Infrastructure Library (both part of the kernel profile) Network Library, Reflexion Library, XML Library (which with the two first listed library are part of the compact profile and the Extended Array Library, Parallel Library, Floating Point Library. The Framework Class Library (FCL) is the origin of the Standard Libraries as the .NET Framework, which includes the FCL, is the first implementation of the CLI. Profiles The main standard libraries are organized into two Standard Profiles, the Kernel Profile and the Compact Profile. The following standard libraries do not belong to any profile: the Extended Array Library, the Extended Numerics Library, the Parallel Library and the Vararg Library. =Kernel Profile= The Kernel Profile is a subset of the Compact Profile. The Kernel Profile contains the Base Class Library (BCL) and Runtime Infrastructure Library. =Compact Profile= The Compact Profile contains those libraries in the Kernel Profile as well as the Network Library, the Reflection Library and the XML Library. Libraries =Base Class Library= The Base Class Library is a simple runtime library for modern programming languages. It serves as the Standard for the runtime library for the language C# as well as one of the CLI Standard Libraries. It provides types to represent the built-in data types of the CLI, simple file access, custom attributes, security attributes, string manipulation, formatting, streams, collections, among other things. It defines types in the following namespaces: ;System: Defines the Object class which all reference type objects derive from (including value-type objects) and the ValueType class which all value type objects derive from. It also defines the base data types like integers, floating point numbers, character, strings, Boolean, enumeration and more. Support for the environment and platform and a command-line interface is provided along with base classes for exceptions and attributes. It defines arrays and delegates, mathematical functions and many other types. ;SystemCollections: Defines many common container types used in programming, such as dictionaries, hashtables, lists, queues and stacks. ;SystemCollectionsGeneric: Defines generic types of the container types in the SystemCollections namespace. ;SystemDiagnostics: Defines types that provide the ability to diagnose applications. It includes event logging, performance counters, tracing and interaction with system processes. ;SystemGlobalization: Defines types that define culture-related information, including language, country/region, calendars in use, format patterns for dates, currency and numbers and sort order for strings. ;SystemIO: Defines type that enable reading from and writing to different streams, such as files or other data streams. Also provides a connection to the file system. ;SystemSecurity: Defines types that represent the security system and permissions. ;SystemSecurityPermissions: Defines types that control access to operations and resources based on policy. ;SystemText: Defines types that support various character encodings, regular expressions and a more efficient mechanism for manipulating strings. ;SystemThreading: Defines types that enable multithreaded programming. =Runtime Infrastructure Library= The Runtime Infrastructure Library provides the services needed by a compiler to target the CLI and the facilities needed to dynamically load types from a stream in a specified file format. It defines types in the following namespaces: ;System: Defines types for the application domain, pointers, handles and more. ;SystemReflection: Defines types that provide a managed view of loaded types, methods and fields, and that can dynamically create and invoke types. These types are relevant to the program runtime. ;SystemRuntimeCompilerServices: Defines types that provide functionality for compiler writers who use managed code to specify attributes in metadata that affect the run-time behavior of the Virtual Execution System. ;SystemRuntimeInteropServices: Defines types that support Platform Invocation Services (P/Invoke). =Network Library= The Network Library provides simple networking services including direct access to network ports as well as HTTP support. It defines types in the following namespaces: ;System: Defines types that provide an object representation of a uniform resource identifier (URI) and easy access to the parts of the URI. ;System.CollectionsSpecialized: Defines specialized and strongly-typed collections; for example, a linked list dictionary, a bit vector, and collections that contain only strings. ;SystemNet: Defines types that provide a simple programming interface for a number of network protocols. ;System.NetSockets: Defines type that provide a managed implementation of the Windows Sockets (Winsock) interface for developers who need to tightly control access to the network. =Reflection Library= The Reflection Library provides the ability to examine the structure of types, create instances of types and invoke methods on types, all based on a description of the type. It defines types in the following namespaces: ;System: Defines the void type, a return value type for a method that does not return a value. ;SystemGlobalization: Defines type that provide information about a specific culture (called a locale for unmanaged code development). The information includes the names for the culture, the writing system, the calendar used and formatting for dates and sort strings. ;SystemReflection: Defines types that provide a managed view of loaded types, methods and fields, and that can dynamically create and invoke types. ;System.SecurityPermissions: Defines types that control access to operations and resources based on policy. These types are relevant to the reflection. =XML Library= The XML Library provides a simple \\"pull-style\\" parser for XML. It is designed for resource- constrained devices, yet provides a simple user model. It defines types in the following namespace. ;SystemXml: Defines types for processing XML. =Extended Array Library= The Extended Array Library provides support for non-vector arrays. That is, arrays that have more than one dimension or arrays that have non-zero lower bounds. The Extended Array Library doesn't add any extra types, but it does extend the array-handling mechanism. =Extended Numerics Library= The Extended Numerics Library provides support for floating-point (SystemSingle, SystemDouble) and extended-precision (SystemDecimal) data types. Like the Base Class Library, this library is directly referenced by the C# standard. =Parallel Library= The Parallel Library provides easy parallelism for non-expert programmers, so that multithreaded CPUs can be exploited. =Vararg Library= The Vararg Library provides support for dealing with variable-length argument lists.

The Oregon and California trails ran up and over these bluffs. They were characterized by American pioneers heading west to Oregon and California as sparse in vegetation with a number of violent incidents involving Native Americans. In the early 1860s, a Pony Express station was located about west of where the wagon trails went up the bluff. During construction of Interstate 80, the steep part of the bluffs were cut away but wagon ruts remained, which are marked by iron hoops signifying wagon wheels. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. History There is relatively little recorded on O'Fallons Bluff other than diary entries by American pioneers heading west to Oregon and California. The bluffs were close to the Platte River and, due to the terrain, the Oregon and California trails ran up and over the bluffs. Most sources indicate that the bluffs were named after Indian agent Benjamin O'Fallon, but the origin of the name may be unclear. The area around the bluffs were described as an \\"alkali belt\\" and alkali was found in both the water near O'Fallons Bluff as well as the soil rendering much of the area near the bluffs devoid of vegetation. On June 13, 1881, Emily Towell wrote in her diary that \\"There were few flowers to be seen, only withered poppies, prickly pears and sunflowers. Now and then we glimpsed a few spears of green grass.\\" Although there are few detailed accounts, O'Fallons Bluff was known for incidents between Native Americans and non-Native Americans who traveled there. For example, Thomas Twiss (an agent for the Upper Platte Indian Agency) reported that Almon W. Babbitt and two companions were killed by 13 Cheyenne Native Americans at O'Fallons Bluff in 1856. Eugene Ware, a junior officer in the 7th Iowa Cavalry in 1863, wrote about several incidents involving Native American attacks in the area. On June 18, 1846 the Donner Party passed by O'Fallons Bluff on their journey along the Oregon Trail to California. In 1859, the Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Company used O'Fallons Bluff station as a Pony Express station. The station was located around south and west of Sutherland, Nebraska and west of where the Oregon and California Trails climbed up the bluffs. View from O'Fallons Bluff facing northeast. The iron hoops mark the location of ruts left by wagons crossing the bluffs. When Interstate 80 was built, it cut through the bluffs and ran close to the wagon trails as seen by the trail ruts running downhill toward a semi-trailer truck that is parked along Interstate 80. After construction of Interstate 80 Much of O'Fallons Bluff was removed when Interstate 80 was constructed, though remnants of wagon-wheel ruts from the Oregon and California trails still remain. These trail ruts parallel to Interstate 80 ranging from only a few feet (or meters) to about a mile (a little over a kilometer) from it. The remaining ruts that run up and over O'Fallon's Bluff are marked by iron hoops representing wagon wheels and can be seen close to Interstate 80. In 1864, Eugene Ware reported that General Robert Byington Mitchell stopped on O'Fallons Bluff, had it fortified, and ordered a company of cavalry to guard it. In 1966, archaeologists excavated a rectangular portion of a ditch at the base of O'Fallons Bluff that was thought to be the remnants of the fortifications erected in 1864. However, after excavating over of trenches, only scattered animal bones were found.

The play, published by West End Press,Pareles, p. 43. was first written in 1995. It includes aspects of Coatlicue, an Aztec goddess; the play Medea by Euripides; and La Llorona.Eschen, p. 103 Plot A revolution in what was the United States had created separate territories for different racial groups. One territory is now African-American, one territory is now Native American, and another is now Latino and Hispanic. Patriarchies were established and homosexuals were forced to leave many of the areas because of politically conservative counter-revolutions. The setting is a post-apocalyptic future on the border of the current United States and Aztl√°n, the separate nation carved out for Latinos and Hispanics as well as Native Americans. Aztl√°n combined elements of both cultures. Medea was exiled because of the patriarchical, anti-homosexual revolution in Aztl√°n. Medea, her son Chac-Mool, and her girlfriend live in the border area, around Phoenix, Arizona. Medea's husband Jas√≥n wants to divorce Medea and take her Chac-Mool with him back to Aztl√°n, where Jas√≥n holds an important place in society. Characters * Medea - The main character, a former revolutionary who was forced into exile. She is bisexual and feminine. She is Luna's lover, Jas√≥n's wife, and mother to teenage son, Chac-Mool. Her character is based on Euripides' Medea. * Jas√≥n - Medea's husband, a biracial man who now lives in Aztl√°n, where he holds an important position. He wants to marry an Apache virgin girl and thus is divorcing Medea. * Chac-Mool - Medea's son, a teenager. Chac-Mool is named after a Toltec messenger, Chacmool.Eschen, p. 106 Melissa Pareles of the Lambda Book Report describes him as \\"rebellious but trusting\\". At one point Medea kills Chac-Mool to prevent him from going into Aztl√°n. Nicole Eschen of the Theatre Journal wrote that at the end, \\"Chac-Mool reappears, possibly as a ghost or hallucination, to absolve and cradle Medea as she kills herself.\\"Eschen, p. 104 * Luna - Medea's girlfriend, a sculptor. She had taught Chac-Mool about history and heritage, including how to plant corn. Eschen states that Luna is not apologetic about her sexuality, and while Media is in despair, Luna gives \\"the voice of reason\\". She is not willing to leave Medea. Eschen and Pareles both describe her as \\"butch\\". Pareles states that in the play Luna is \\"perhaps the most sympathetic character\\". * Mama Sal - A grandmother who is a lesbian. Pareles describes Mama Sal as \\"the kind cynic who, despite her love for Chac-Mool and Medea, helps Luna leave Medea and Medea carry out her insane plan\\". * Chihuateo - Four women who had died in childbirth. They provide a chorus. Production By 2006 the play had received several full productions. The Hungry Woman: A Mexican Medea has had few productions between the first 1995 production directed by Tony Kelly and the 2006 production at the Leeds Theater at Brown University. The Brown University Production of The Hungry Woman took place at the Leeds Theater in April 2006. According to the Brown Daily Herald Review, \\"Though a recreation of a Greek tragedy, the play includes both humorous scenes such as a girls‚Äô night on the town in a lesbian dance club where the ladies line-dance to a disco remix of ‚ÄúThe Hustle‚Äù and intense scenes like Medea mourning her son in the confines of a psychiatric hospital, only to be mocked by her doctors\\" (Barnes). Angelica del Valle plays Medea, highlighting the emotions behind the battle to keep her son. Luna, Medea's lover, played by Erin Adams gives a sense of romance and evokes the feeling of emotional strain that family conflict can have on a relationship. Stanford University's production of The Hungry Woman: A Mexican Medea took place in May 2005 at the Pigott Theater. Adelina Anthony directed this production. The production included equity actors VIVIS as Medea, Tessa Koning-Mart√≠nez as Mama Sal, as well as actors Ronak Kapadia as Jas√≥n, Misha Chowhury as Chac-Mool, and Adelina Anthony as Luna. According to Eschen's performance review, \\"The play, from Medea herself to the set design, carried several simultaneous meanings, resonating with various culture\\" (Eschen). According to a production review by Nicole Eschen in a Theatre Journal, \\"The Hungry Woman furthers Moraga‚Äôs explorations of the intersection between aspects of identity, particularly as a Chicana lesbian, but also in relationship to indigenous cultures and motherhood\\" (Eschen). Adelina Anthony tackles Cherr√≠e Moraga's work and attempts to display the intersection of cultures. Cultures were intertwined in this production. This was heavily seen in the set design. The set had Greek elements, with white marble and traditional architecture. Its shape \\"suggested a cave or natural rock setting\\" according to Eschen. She further mentions that \\"Lighting and repositioning of a small rectangular platform transformed this abstract background into various locations such as a lesbian bar and a mental hospital\\"(Eschen). This production takes inspiration from Euripides' Medea, but does not mimic it, balancing \\"elements of the Greek story with the Mexican La Llorona and the Aztec goddess Coatlicue\\" (Eschen). VIVIS highlighted Medea's characterization of agony and despair. Eschen writes that VIVIS, \\"spent a great deal of the play wandering around the stage in a black slip with a bottle of tequila or confines in a mental institution\\" (Eschen). During the scene where Medea ultimately makes the decision to kill her son, there is a choreographed dance by Alleluia Panis which \\"combined images of birth and death culminating in a Piet√† image in which Medea cradled her dead son\\" (Eschen). Anthony, playing Luna, Medea's lover, both acted and co-directed the production. Anthony represented the butch lesbian lover, teaching Medea's son Chac-Mool about his heritage and history. Both Anthony and VIVIS utilized \\"fairly realistic, traditional Western acting styles\\"(Eschen). The chorus was costumed in brown body suits, \\"which were painted outlines of their breasts\\" (Eschen)., mimicking the image of tattoos. The women both danced and took on minimal roles such as a nurse, switching their costumes by adding specific identifying pieces. Jas√≥n, \\"a cruel South American dictator\\" (Eschen), was seen as having dark skin, unshaven face, and vaguely military costume. Chac- Mool, Medea and Jas√≥n's son, played by Misha Chowdhury represented a tall and lanky adolescent.

The Art of Brian Friel, the Nobel poet Seamus Heaney wrote \\"The particularity of quotation joined with the meditative, associative habit of your mind is the book's strength. It provokes a thoughtful response in return and, as such, will be a welcome addition to the critical reaction to Friel. It should deepen the sense of his complexity and modernity, while rendering a sense of those 'truths, immemorially posited'.\\"Letter to Richard Pine from Seamus Heaney, dated 5 April 1989Letter to Richard Pine from Seamus Heaney, dated 5 April 1989 (page 1)Letter to Richard Pine from Seamus Heaney, 5 April 1989 (page 2).

His son Rayadappa Rayudu succeeded him and later his adopted son Gopalakrishna Rayudu took over. During Gopalakrishna Rayudu rule in 1753, the Northern Circars were assigned to French by the Nizam of Hyderabad. The French East India Governor Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau, agreed to lease Srikakulam and Rajahmundry Circars to Pusapati Vijayarama Gajapati Raju I, the Raja of Vizianagaram. A rupture between Bussy and the Nizam led to the weakening of the former's authority. Vijarama Raju placed his troops at the disposal of Bussy and helped him in re-establishing his suzerainty. Viziarama Raju persuaded Bussy to help him in defeating his arch rival, the Raja of Bobbili. On 24 January 1757, Bussy with his army and the army of Pusapati Vijayarama Gajapati Raju I in tow marched towards the Bobbili fort. The army of Gopalakrishna Ranga Rao was no match for the combined armies of Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau and Pusapati Vijayarama Gajapati Raju I. Gopalakrishna Rayudu was led by his Army General Tandra Paparayudu and his army, who put up a brave fight till the end. The French General knew that it would be impossible to reach Bobbili via Rajam as Paparayudu was camping there and took a different route to reach the fort. Rani Mallamma Devi, wife of Ranga Rao and sister of Paparayudu, sent a message to him on coming to know of the enemy's advance towards the fort. However, the enemy intercepted the courier and the message did not reach Paparayudu. Meanwhile, Ranga Rao and his men after defending the fort for several hours realised that the enemy could not be contained for long. Ranga Rao did not want the women and children in the fort to be at the mercy of the enemy. He ordered them to be sacrificed. Rani Mallamma Devi committed suicide. When the news reached him, Tandra Paparayudu rushed to the demolished fort and saw his sister and the entire family lying on the ground in a pool of blood. Seething with vengeance he took an oath to kill Pusapati Vijayarama Gajapati Raju I. The battle Pusapati Vijayarama Gajapati Raju I was camping in a Tent, basking in the glory of the war, which annihilated his enemy. Tandra Paparayudu along with Devulapalli Peddanna and Buddaraju Venkaiah managed to reach the tent in which Pusapati Vijayarama Gajapati Raju I was sleeping. Paparayudu gained entry through the rear of the tent, while the other two stood guard at the entrance. He woke up Pusapati Vijayarama Gajapati Raju I shouting \\"Puli, Puli... Bobbili Puli\\" (Tiger, Tiger... The Tiger of Bobbili). Pusapati Vijayarama Gajapati Raju I tried to divert his attention saying that Velama heroes should not be little their clan as cowards gaining entry through the backdoor. \\"You have wiped out our entire clan through dubious means and have no right to get ethical treatment,\\" replied Paparayudu and stabbed him repeatedly in the chest. Hearing the commotion, the bodyguard of Pusapati Vijayarama Gajapati Raju I tried to enter the tent but was killed by Peddanna, who was guarding the entrance. The entire army was alerted and the Bobbili tiger Paparayudu and the other two killed themselves.

The earliest recording of this parasite was in 1822 in Salem, North Carolina,Schweinitz, Schriften der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft zu Leipzig. 1822. Sphaeria hyalina 1: 30. but microscopic descriptions of H. hyalinus do not appear in the literature until 1886. Host H. hyalinus is a host-specific pathogen which exclusively attacks species of the genus Amanita, which is famous for containing some of the most toxic mushrooms in the world. H. hyalinus specifically attaches to the basidiocarp on the sporocarp (fruiting body) of the fungus.P√µldmaa, K., Farr, D.F., & McCray, E.B. Hypomyces Online, Systematic Mycology and Microbiology Laboratory, ARS, USDA. Effects The parasitic effects of H. hyalinus thoroughly disfigures its host and in the absence of a nearby healthy specimen it can be impossible to determine the identity of the host in the field. Infection often covers the host mushroom preventing the expansion of the pileus (cap) and causing the pileus to deform and fuse to the stipe (stalk). As a consequence of this, the gills of the mushroom are also destroyed and the fruiting body dies without dispersing spores. Reproduction and life cycle The life cycle for H. hyalinus is not currently completely understood. The life cycle of fungi in the division Ascomycota generally alternates between an asexual stage and a sexual stage respectively termed the anamorph stage and the teleomorph stage. Each of these stages contains intermediary steps that vary depending on the species. =Anamorph= Although anamorphs have been observed in some samples of H. hyalinus, there in no consistently identifiable connection H. hyalinus and an anamorph. =Teleomorph= The teleomorph of H. hyalinus is observable and can be identified. A teleomorphic structure called the subiculum covers the fruiting body of the host, resulting in destruction of the host's gills and inability of the host to expand its pileus. Another teleomorphic structure, the perithecia, forms throughout the subiculum with pores facing outward to facilitate the release of ascospores into the environment. Despite this, researchers have not been able to associate any specific ascospore with H. hyalinus. Studies H. hyalinus has been studied in several different manners. Field observation has been used to observe the effects of the pathogen on the host. In addition to direct field study, the pathogen has been cultured on oat meal agar and potato dextrose agar to facilitate testing of the pathogen at the biochemical and microscopic level. KOH string testing, which can be used to determine the gram status of an organism,Sutton, S. 2006. The Gram Stain. The Microbiology Network. PMF Newsletter. is used to determine the gram classification, gram positive, of H. hyalinus. In addition to this, various forms of microscopy including bright-field microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, interference contrast microscopy, and phase contrast microscopy have been used to observe the pathogen. Geographical distribution H. hyalinus has a large geographic distribution and has been recorded in Eastern Canada, Northwestern U.S.A., North-Central U.S.A., Northeastern U.S.A., Southeastern U.S.A., China, and Eastern Asia. Further research This parasite has very minimal citations in scientific literature. Further research would be useful to form a more complete picture of life cycle of H. hyalinus which would allow researchers to better understand the mode of transmission of this disease. Furthermore, due to the specificity of H. hyalinus to parasitize the poisonous species ofAmanita, further research could prove useful in manipulating Amanita fungi. Although H. hyalinus does not currently have a large impact economically or socially, further research could make this parasite more important to society due to its relation to species of Amanita, which comprises both toxic and edible mushrooms.Wieland, T. 1968. Poisonous Principles of the Genus Amanita. Science 159: 946-952 H. hyalinus is considered inedible and may be poisonous. Further research could also reveal the ecological roles of H. hyalinus in population, environmental, and evolutionary biology.

Duris (March 2, 1928 ‚Äì March 23, 2014) was an American politician in the state of Oregon. A native Oregonian, he served as mayor of Hillsboro, Oregon, and as chairman of the Washington County Board of Commissioners in the 1970s and 1980s. He served in the United States Navy and worked for nearly 30 years at Tektronix. Early life Miller Michael Duris was born on March 2, 1928, in Rainier, Oregon, along the Columbia River to John and Mary (n√©e Duhon) Duris, who emigrated from what is now Slovakia. After growing up in Rainier, he joined the United States Navy at the age of 17 in 1945. While in the Navy he took classes on electronics that eventually led to a job at Tektronix and served on the USS Achernar before leaving the Navy in 1949. During his naval service he began sending letters to Celestine Sally Weverka of Hillsboro, and the two married on October 11, 1948. The couple had six daughters, Cheryl, Carin, Cynthia, Carol, Colleen, and Cathy. Duris began working for Hillsboro's Meltebeke's Furniture after leaving the Navy, and then starting working for Tektronix in 1951 where he would work as a technical writer. Duris began managing Tektronix‚Äôs Washington, D.C., office and the family moved to Virginia in 1959, but returned to Hillsboro in 1967. He started the Pigtail-Ponytail softball group for girls in 1969, which is now the Hillsboro Girls Softball Association. Duris remained involved in the group until 1988, and himself played in softball leagues until 2009. Political career In 1969, he entered politics and was appointed to the Hillsboro City Council. He won re-election to the council in November 1970, running unopposed for the position. Duris then ran for mayor in 1972, defeating Kenneth Stuart in the November election and taking office on January 2, 1973. During this time he owned Miller's Sweet Shop from 1971 to 1974, and left Tektronix in 1977. In November 1974, he won re-election over A. T. Antonelli to a second two-year term as mayor. He along with the other members of the council, and PayLess Drug, were sued over a land use decision, with the case reaching the Oregon Court of Appeals in 1975, where he and the other defendants prevailed. Also while he was mayor, he officiated at the dedication of Bicentennial Park on October 19, 1976. A Democrat, he decided to run for the at-large commissioner position on the Washington County Commission in 1976. He won the Democratic nomination over Deneice Won in the May primary, and then defeated Republican Allan Paterson in the general election in November. While serving on the commission he became a member of the Columbia Region Association of Governments as the county‚Äôs representative to the multi-state organization. On January 4, 1978, Duris was elected as chairman of the county commission. That year voters approved changes to the county charter, with the commission converting to a three-member, full-time commission in 1979. In November 1978, Duris announced he would run for the new county commission, and then won election to the reconstituted commission in January, which had a special two- year term. Duris then ran for the new at-large commissioner position in 1980 in order to be chair. By November 1980 he was no longer the chairperson of the commission, and in 1981 the commission was to change back to five positions, though only the chairperson would be a full-time position. Duris lost the race to be chair to Virginia Dagg, and left office in January 1981. He declined to run again for the commission in 1982. Duris tried to re-enter politics when he ran for a spot on the school board of the Hillsboro Union High School District (now part of the Hillsboro School District) in March 1986. He did not win, and in March 1988 he lost a second attempt to join the same school board. Later life and death After leaving politics he began working as facilities manager for Tuality Community Hospital in Hillsboro, before retiring in 1991. Duris died on March 23, 2014, at the age of 86 after battling Parkinson's disease. His wife Sally survived him, as did five of his six daughters. He was a member of the local Elks Lodge, an Optimist, First Catholic Slovak Union, and a member of the Hillsboro Veterans of Foreign Wars post.

Physically Finn is an average middle school boy. He has brown hair, green eyes, is slim, and is about 5ft-4in tall. He loves Amanda, and is very protective of her. He is very brave and confident. He has a little sister, a mother, and a father. He seems to be a bit intimidated by his father, Donald Whitman. Also, in the 3rd book, his mom decides to help them with their Keepers stuff. Whenever the Keepers need a plan, they always seem to turn to Finn. When they cross over at night into Disney World they become part hologram, and part human. Finn is the only Keeper who can become full hologram for a long amount of time. He's the only one who can do it when he's awake, and ironically thinks it makes him part Fairlie himself. Finn has a balance of courage, smarts, athleticism, and control over his DHI powers. All the Keepers like him since he will protect everyone. : Finn's morals changed from book six onward, probably due to an electrical shock he received in DHI form. His anger overrides his better judgement, leaving him willing to kill the Overtakers, who have no qualms about doing so themselves. He fatally ripped a hole in Maleficent, tried killing Tia Dalma and strangling Cruella De Vil. *Charlene Turner: Blonde hair, blue eyes, and described as overall \\"beautiful\\". Also appears scared of anything under the sun, especially Maleficent. Was chosen to be a DHI because \\"She has the look of the typical American Girl Teenager\\". Her abilities are athletic ability and gymnastics; this proves useful for stealth. She is a cheerleader, dancer, track runner and champion gymnast. This makes her an important contribution to the team, often being used as a decoy. She can solve tough situations and has referred to herself as a \\"Scrabble wiz\\". In the first book she is very soft-spoken and quiet. She is given the nickname \\"Charlie\\" by Finn in the second book. In the fourth book, she is put under a spell by the Evil Queen, to gather information on the Keepers. Also, her feelings for Finn are much more obvious, but one-sided. In the fifth book, she kisses Finn in order to get over her feelings. :In Shell Game and Dark Passage, she begins to develop feelings for Maybeck; this proves to be a good thing as Maybeck was put in Sleeping Beauty Syndrome by the Queen, and needed true love's kiss. During the timeskip between Dark Passage and The Insider, Charlene had become quite a popular actress thanks to her good looks (having appeared on Good Luck Charlie often); however, she doesn't let the fame go to her head. In \\"The Syndrome\\", it is revealed that she now shares an apartment with a famous actress, who she told all about her adventures. *Terrance Maybeck (Donnie or Terry): Maybeck is an African-American boy who fiercely proud of his heritage, often believing others think poorly of it; he's also a Baptist. He lives with his Aunt \\"Jelly\\", tends to swear (usually \\"a word he shouldn't have said\\" explains this), and looks older than his age as he is about a head taller than everyone else. He believes many girls are attracted to him. He is skeptical about almost everything in Jez's diary, and is the first Kingdom Keeper to disagree with Finn (though he does follow through with Finn's orders). Donnie is his stage name. Maybeck loves his Aunt Jelly and hates anyone who hurts his friends and family. He is strong, as seen when he held Scar's puppet head for a long time and when he crushed an OTK with a chair. His strength makes him a great asset to the Keepers. In book 6, Maybeck falls into a coma due to a lightning strike caused by Maleficent; he was able to will himself awake after his DHI form was informed about this by Finn. :When the Evil Queen puts him in the Syndrome, Charlene awakens him with true love's kiss. They remained a couple throughout the timeskip between Dark Passage and The Insider, despite Charlene's acting career mostly keeping them separated; the narration says Maybeck is in agony for not being able to be with her. Charlene is the only person who makes Maybeck break his emotional mask. *Isabella Angelo (Willa): Willa is sweet, geeky, smart, and brave. She is described as either Native American or Asian since in Disney after Dark she was seen running on the cover and her skin tan was dark. She does archery, climbing, and swimming, which, along with her skills of understanding language and understanding clues, is useful to the team. Her mother is very protective of her, to the point of threatening Finn (who she told her mother to go to before anyone else) to get her out of the Syndrome. She likes Philby (a reciprocated feeling both aren't able to express in the first 5 books) and both are the most technically smart of the Keepers. She does not trust Storey Ming; in The Insider this is good intuition, since Storey is possessed by Ursula. Willa trusts Finn with secrets, and they are paired in book five. :To wake Philby from Sleeping Beauty Syndrome, Willa kissed him; since then, they have officially become a couple. Their relationship is an odd one; Philby \\"says what she wants to hear at the wrong time(s)\\". In The Insider, Willa doubts herself since she is not like most girls her age, though still becomes a strong girl. *Dell Philby: Known as \\"Philby\\", he is intelligent and knowledgeable about technology. Finn thinks of him as a know-it-all who doesn't get into your face about it. He is mildly seen as second-in-command and he is the guy to go to for information about every inch of the Parks. He is great at climbing and is well liked by the girls at his school although he couldn't care less about them. His first name is mentioned by his mother in Power Play, and also appears in the \\"Keeper Profiles\\" on KKO. Philby has red hair and, having spent some of his childhood in England, a British accent. His mother, Gladis, is paranoid about his safety. He also has a crush on Willa and is jealous that she and Maybeck are together in most of the Kingdom Keeper missions. He seems to set himself apart from the other Keepers in Shell Game, thinking he is smarter than everyone and acting rude. His ego shrinks after he is told off by Finn. :At the end of Dark Passage, he and Willa officially become a couple, following true love's kiss to awaken him from the Syndrome. In \\"The Insider\\", Philby is the most disappointed of the Keepers with missing graduation because he was one of the three top students and would be giving a speech. He is also paranoid about the Imagineers keeping tabs on them. At the end of The Insider, Philby convinces Finn to join the rest of the Keepers in looking into the meaning of Jess's latest drawing, and what connection it may have to Wayne's final message. =Fairlies= A pun on \\"fairly human\\", each Fairly has one supernatural talent. The government rounds up the Fairlies and imprisons them in a facility in Baltimore, Maryland to study their powers and replicate them for military purposes. Amanda and Jess, on the run from the facility for years, are now protected by Disney. Some of the novels explain that they have changed their appearance or are using nicknames. In The Syndrome, their powers are shown to have evolved. *Amanda Lockhart: A girl of the same age who helps Finn locate the other four DHIs in their real life aspects; seems to have a few secrets of her own. She is very good with people and is interested in Finn. Amanda is a very strong girl with a good head on her shoulders. She is occasionally sarcastic, but in a funny and charming way. Amanda is described as having \\"exotic eyes, a deep, natural, tan, and freckles on her cheeks.\\" She is about an inch taller than Finn. She is considered an honorary Keeper, and in the third book even becomes a DHI. Amanda's power is to push things; this is retained in her DHI state. She can levitate small objects and push things away from her even if they're not touching her. She also tells Finn that this leaks into her relationships and that she naturally \\"pushes\\" people away. Finn tells her he's like a yo-yo, and that he'll keep coming back. : Amanda is in love with Finn, but wonders about what their relationship is through the last four books of the series. In Power Play, Finn kisses her (partly due to a spell by the Evil Queen), but she doesn't fight him off. In Shell Game, she and Finn get into an argument before Finn goes on the Cruise Ship, so she is confused whether they are together or not. When Finn runs to jump off the ship with Willa, he sees Amanda's DHI and thinks about how he loves her. In The Insider, they attend Senior prom together; however, unlike the other couples, they try to keep a sliver of distance between them while dancing. In book 7, Jess notes that Amanda hates being called \\"Mandy\\", unless it's by Finn. Amanda and Jess have also gotten scholarships courtesy of the Keepers' hard work for Disney. In \\"The Syndrome\\", Amanda's strong love and desire to protect Finn allowed her powers to evolve, granting her telekinesis both properties of magnetism - repel AND attract; she also no longer needs both her hands to direct the blast. *Jessica Lockhart (Jez, Jezebel or Jess): A mysterious, gifted girl who first appears in Disney After Dark. Not much is initially known about her until it is revealed she is somewhat of an apprentice to Maleficent, possessing \\"magic\\" of her own. Towards the end of Disney after Dark she is revealed to be Amanda's pseudo-sister, by the real name of Jess, cursed by Maleficent to prevent her from using her powers. Though Jess and Amanda aren't biologically related, they consider each other sisters. Although her name is revealed to be Jess, she is always referred to as Jez, when the author is referring to her in the second book. However, in book 3, she is Jess. Her name changes as often as her hair; as an unintended side-effect of Finn breaking Maleficent's curse, Jess' hair turned white, forcing her to dye it repeatedly, primarily blonde. She is considered an honorary Keeper, also becoming a DHI in the third book. In book 2, she has a boyfriend named Rob; however, he's not mentioned again until book 7 (Jess recalls their not talking much), suggesting they broke up. : Her power is seeing the future in dreams, and sometimes daydreams; in The Insider, Jess has become increasingly horrified by her dreams (due to the mayhem that the Overtakers would be causing), becoming insomniac to keep from dreaming. Jess sees a vision of lightning, which is what slays Chernabog. Wayne gifts her with Walt's first pen, which is magical in her hands; anything she draws becomes real, but she cannot erase what isn't a part of the characters' world; she uses this to revive Mickey Mouse from the original Mortimer Mouse drawing. In \\"The Syndrome\\", Jess starts having vision the moment a key item is mentioned or shown to her, showing a growth of her powers. =Mentors= The Keepers are guided by Wayne Kresky and his daughter, Wanda. Wayne and Wanda's methods of assistance differ; Wayne prefers difficult riddles and clues, and Wanda directly assists them in any way she can. *Wayne Kresky: an elderly Imagineer who acts as the group's mentor and guide. He speaks in mystical clich√©s, often annoying the Keepers. He firmly states \\"Disney doesn't kill anything\\", not even the Overtakers; this is something that backfires repeatedly because he just incarcerates the villains, who end up escaping. He helped come up with the idea of DHIs to save the Magic Kingdom. Finn thinks he knows more than he lets on, but learns to trust him. Wayne was personally hired by Walt himself, which makes him a great addition to the Kingdom Keepers team. He is in fact a real cast member at Walt Disney World, and was put into the novel after he showed the author Ridley Pearson around the Magic Kingdom ride Splash Mountain. Wayne seems harsh to Finn in \\"Shell Game\\", appearing at the end of Dark Passage much to the Keepers' surprise. In The Insider, Wayne is framed by the Overtakers for stealing important files; he later gives his life to protect Willa from Judge Doom. He left a final message for the Keepers recorded in a music box. This leads the Keepers to use the DHI tech to time travel to the opening day of Disneyland; there's Wayne's younger self meets with them. *Wanda Alcott: Wayne's daughter helps the Kingdom Keepers reach places and areas inaccessible without employee keys. She is introduced in the 3rd installment, acting on her father's behalf since he was still in hiding at the time. In the 4th book, Wanda hacks into the DHI server to check activity, falling into a trap laid by the Overtakers to have her arrested. Finn's mother bails her out. She continues to help the Kingdom Keepers into the parks. At first, the Keepers didn't trust Wanda, but her name - \\"Wanda\\" (which Wayne derived from Mickey's magic wand)- and the genetic similarities convinced the Keepers she was really Wayne's daughter. In \\"the Insider\\", she is referred to as \\"Wanda Kresky\\" by the Imagineers, implying Alcott is an alias she uses. During The Syndrome, she lets Amanda and Jess stay at her home, and later helps hide them at her father's cabin, along with the Keepers; both the OTKs and Barracks 14 were posing a threat. =Overtakers= The Overtakers are the series' principal antagonists. Walt Disney foresaw the emergence of the Overtakers, knowing that the more one believes in something, the more real it becomes‚Äîthe more belief in the characters, the closer they get to the real world. The Overtakers intend to rule the parks and the world outside. Most are antagonists of Disney films and attractions, and are capable of thought. Minor characters, incapable of thought, are their soldiers (often mere animated statues). Chernabog rules the main faction of the Overtakers, with Jafar, Shan Yu and Ursula having their own storylines. The Overtakers are sometimes invisible to humans or security cameras; in the first novel, this allowed them to steal supplies to upgrade the cells below Pirates of the Caribbean. \\"The Return\\" series reveals the Overtakers were created by a witch doctor called The Traveler as part of a pact with Amery Hollingsworth. *Maleficent: The dark fairy from Sleeping Beauty who acts as the antagonist in the story. She is by far the most recurring villain and the main enforcer of Chernabog. Her very presence gives off a chill; however, this is to ensure the full strength of her magic as a warm environment weakens her. While the park is open, Maleficent often replaces the Cast Member playing her in the Fantasmic! show. Despite her power and reputation, Maleficent is not the leader of the Overtakers. Most that don't know her by name call her \\"The Green One\\". She is captured at the end of the first book, rescued at the beginning of the second, captured again at the end of the third, and released again at the end of the fourth. She has a DHI form, used to engineer her escape. After her second escape, Maleficent usually pairs with another of the OT's sorceresses, like Tia Dalma or the Evil Queen; repeated defeats likely taught her to have backup. She is killed in \\"Dark Passage\\" when Finn used his DHI powers to rip a hole in her. In \\"The Insider\\", Finn remembers that Maleficent once said she served a more powerful witch; he considers this to be Ursula. Tia Dalma brings Maleficent back in the epilogue of book 7; however, in the second book of \\"The Return\\", Maleficent is revealed to be deformed with stronger magic. She is mentioned repeatedly in The Syndrome, but never appears. **Diablo: Maleficent's right-hand raven. He served his mistress well during the maiden voyage of the Dream. Dibalo attacked and wounded Philby before being captured; his life was spared, thanks to Willa talking Philby down. Finn used him as a shield against Maleficent in \\"Dark Passage\\". Three years later in \\"The Insider\\", Diablo leads an attack on Phibly and Willa with several other ravens, most likely to avenge his mistress's death. *Blackbeard: A minor Overtaker, he and his crew of pirates serve Maleficent in their goal to rule the world. They were first seen by Finn, salvaging carts from the Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin ride to help with their cause. They came from the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction. He appears only in Disney after Dark. To clear confusion, he is not based on the Blackbeard from Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. **Pirates: Generic lesser characters from the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction. Often employed by the Overtakers as guards. *Chernabog: True leader of the Overtakers, and \\"The baddest of the bad. The most powerful demon Walt Disney ever created.\\" He is also the demon from the Disney film Fantasia. At the beginning of the second book, he was supposed to be on the Disney Villains float at the DHI-Day Celebration, but he disappears; the Overtakers mistook the statue for the genuine him. He is caught at the end of the third, but escapes at the end of the fourth. Chernabog also has a DHI form. Nobody knows his full powers, but his powers are in a journal stolen by Maleficent in KK 5 but taken back by Finn. He is snuck aboard the Disney Dream in \\"Shell Game\\", and brought to full power in \\"Dark Passage\\" by licking Dillard's blood. Finn later traps him in a small chamber with flooding with water. However, three years later, Tia Dalma frees him and facilitates his transport to Disneyland. According to the Evil Queen, Chernabog is childish despite being Disney's ultimate evil, with death being his answer to everything; even the Keepers say that Chernabog \\"isn't exactly a candidate for the debate team.\\" He is destroyed by a lightning strike; however, one of his wings was used by Tia Dalma in a brew to resurrect Maleficent. *Captain Hook: Mentioned briefly by a cast member dressed as Ariel in Disney at Dawn; he was snooping around Ariel's Grotto, having been sent by the Overtakers in investigate the meaning in Jess playing songs over the park speakers. *Cruella De Vil: An Overtaker in \\"Power Play\\". She first appears in Disney Quest, and follows the Evil Queen around, acting like a sidekick. She has a rather big mouth, often blurting things out until silenced. Cruella is important to the Overtakers as she knows how the modern world works; most of the Overtakers don't come from a modern era (such as the mid-1900s) like she does. She has a bad temper and is more of a nuisance than a threat, since she has no combat ability. Cruella also has a DHI. Revealed in \\"The Insider\\", Cruella has the magical ability to control animals; this was hinted to even work on Chernabog in \\"Shell Game\\". She also lives in a luxurious decommissioned train compartment. Cruella is nearly strangled to death by when Finn's overcome by bloodlust and revenge, but she escapes; however, Finn tosses a wrench at her, leaving Cruella out-of- commission for the rest of the story. **Hyenas: The vicious carnivores from The Lion King. They fear Scar, even if cowering at a mere mask of him. One of the hyenas is killed by Luowski to retrieve a swallowed flashdrive. They mostly follow Cruella's orders. Maleficent has said they are indeed useful and it was a shame to kill one. Cruella names two Happy and Howly. *The Evil Queen: An Overtaker in Power Play. She also first appears in DisneyQuest during Power Play. A selfish woman, and a trickster, she puts spells on several of the characters. Her only weakness is her reflection, due to her vanity. She becomes a temporary leader of the OTs in the fourth book, making her third-in-command. She had the idea of creating OT DHIs. She can transform herself and tricked Willa by turning herself into Finn to capture her. She ends up trapped with Chernabog at the end of \\"Dark Passage\\" until \\"The Insider\\", where Tia Dalma helps them escape; during her captivity, the Queen learned how to understand Chernabog and found him aggravating because of his childish fits. However, she has some vague knowledge of modern technology, as she warned Chernabog against showing himself during their transport to Disneyland as the \\"metal bricks have magic memory.\\" **Card Soldiers: The minions of the Queen of Hearts from Alice in Wonderland. They, along with the Small World dolls are the army the Evil Queen has guarding Tia Dalma in the abandoned Skyway Station. **magic mirror: mentioned by maybeck in 'The Insider'. **Spiders: Conjured by the Evil Queen to torture Willa with her arachnephobia in Power Play. That are later turned into rattlesnakes, to serve as Gigabyte's soldiers in chasing the Keepers. **Jays: They dive-bomb Charlene and Maybeck in the Disney Power house in Power Play; Maybeck and Charlene guess they used to be the security guards until the Evil Queen enchanted them. The Evil Queen changes them into gorillas to attack the Keepers, but they're scared off by pain of stepping on broken glass. It remains unknown if the Queen's magic wore off or the victims were sent to a zoo. *Frollo: An Overtaker who only appears in Power Play, who commands the Toy Story Green Army Men. Frollo is a wicked man, obsessed with his own version of law and order; however, he is loyal to the Overtakers' plot. He despises children, even trying to drown Willa when she refuses to reveal what news of the future Jess drew on a napkin. On his own, he presents a very small threat given he has no supernatural powers. The Queen has said Frollo is more patient than her. He was briefly seen in Shell game as one of the many villains entering the Disney dream. **Toy Story Green Army Men: Despite being good characters in Toy Story, they serve the Overtakers. They attack Willa in \\"Power Play\\" under Frollo's orders from the Evil Queen. Maybeck captures them in \\"Shell Game\\", by using a glue trap. **Frollo's soldiers: Soldiers of Judge Frollo. They chase Willa to spaceship Earth. Willa got rid of most of them by telling children they had candy and to get it they had to squeeze tightly and don't let go. two patrolled spaceship earth looking for willa. *Shan-Yu: Appears in Power Play. He controls the Chinese warriors and to speaks little English, wanting the DHI's magic to himself. Residing in Epoct, he considers the \\"invisible ones\\" (the Keepers) to be spies for an emperor. Finn tries convincing Shan Yu that he isn't, but decides to take advantage of his beliefs to convince him \\"the great lord Disney\\" was looking for allies against the Green One - Maleficent. He tried to kill Finn in KK 4 but wasn't strong enough to. Finn manages to outwit him and buy time to think of an escape plan by playing on Shan Yu's belief in following the will of Gods. **Chinese Warriors: These Overtakers from Mulan take orders from Shan-Yu. At least, there are eight of them. *Jafar: Appears in Power Play. He can use his magical powers he has in his movie, including the ability to use his staff to hypnotize others and transform into various objects, like a snake and a coil of rope. Maybeck considers Jafar the most evil Disney villain because he ruthlessly kills and manipulates others for power. Jafar dislikes giving autographs, considering an insult to his dignity. He does not follow the other Overtakers' agenda, and want the DHI's magic for himself. He was defeated by Willa's ability to charm him like a snake. Maleficent coaxed him into joining Chernabog's side by promising the lamp in return during Shell Game; however, he is back to his own agenda in \\"The Insider\\", confronting Finn and Maybeck. Jafar seems to hold a high opinion of Maleficent, given his surprise at Finn's announcement of killing her. As a giant snake, he almost swallows Maybeck whole, but ends up being badly wounded by Rajah. **Iago: Jafar's parrot lackey. Unlike his film counterpart, Iago doesn't give wisecracks. He divebombs the Keepers when their DHIs get shrunken. **Scepter: Jafar's scepter can morph into a real snake, and still retains its hypnosis powers. it's also rarely seen without Jafar. *Horned King: An Overtaker briefly seen in Power Play. Main antagonist of The Black Cauldron. *Gaston: An Overtaker briefly seen in Power Play on Tom Sawyer Island. The egotistical and dense villain of Beauty and the Beast. *Prince John: An Overtaker briefly seen in Power Play. The greedy ruler of Nottingham. *Ursula: In \\"Shell Game\\" She attacks Finn and King Triton at Typhoon Lagoon when Finn says her name, accidentally summoning her. In \\"The Insider\\", it's revealed that Ursula had been possessing Storey Ming, hoping to use the Keepers to eliminate Chernabog's Overtakers; however, being in contact with water will cause her binding to Storey to start coming undone. Finn and Violet worked together to fight her; due to continually growing, she accidentally gets herself stuck inside a sinking ship in the park. She is the \\"enemy within\\" that the Keepers were warned about. **Flotsam and Jetsam: Ursula's beloved pet eels. Unlike their film counterparts, they are much uglier and have several scars. Unless Ursula is giving them commands, they are relatively harmless as they are only seeking out food, primarily what's left behind in the park dumpsters. Ursula beat them up while posing as Storey Ming to reinforce the Keeper's trust in her. *Tia Dalma: In \\"Shell Game\\" she is spied on by the Keepers on Castaway Cay, she is seen talking to six cast members of Disney Dream and Jafar. She is also taken on to the Disney Dream when the boat leaves Castaway Cay. She is captured in \\"Dark Passage\\". Finn sees her as more powerful than Maleficent or the Evil Queen because black magic is more closely tied to the real world that the sorcery the other Disney villains have. She escapes captivity in \\"The Insider\\", freeing Chernabog and taking him to Disneyland for the final battle. Tia Dalma remained confident in her side's victory, despite Finn correctly pointing out that history shows evil self- destructs. After the Sky Station fire, Tia Dalma remains hidden; after Chernabog is fried by a lightning strike, she collects one of his wings. Tia Dalma uses the wing as one of the ingredients in a magical brew, which she uses to resurrect Maleficent. Like Jafar, she respects Maleficent to some degree; when she discovered the witch's remains at the start of \\"The Insider\\", she lamented the death of one of the greatest practitioners of dark magic. *Madame Leota: Coming from the Haunted Mansion attraction, she resides in the basement and is most likely its ruler. She only appears in \\"The Insider\\", where her full story is told to Maybeck by Charlene, and appears in two different forms. Showing Leota her reflection will get rid of her, since she hates being reminded of what she did and what she's become. She scared patrons during park hours, but was tasered and left badly burnt. ** Wraiths: Ghoulish minions that can suck out the very life from others, even the energy in the Keepers' DHIs, by simply touching them; nearly falling victim, Maybeck realizes no-one call pull away because the process is hypnotic. They'll even suck life out of their wounded comrades. Smashing their skulls temporarily reduces them to ash. They are stupid enough to try following their targets through shut doors, only to smash into them futily. Maybeck compared them to Dementors. Philby originally also guessed that they could also be Dr. Facilier's \\"friends on the other side\\". ** Demons: Creatures possessing the dead. Able to possess new hosts (even the Keepers in DHI form, Philby guesses) by looking them in the eyes; however, stabbing the demons in their eyes causes them to pop like balloons. They have trouble thinking for themselves, so a really hard riddle can stun them; in other words, they're stupid. Despite the corpse-like movements, they are capable of levitation at high speeds and can tear through metal. ** Ghosts: Coming from the cemetery of the Haunted Mansion, they are the embodiments of those who had unfinished business in the land of the living and could not pass on; they are transparent. Some dressed up as repairmen to infiltrate Ariel's Undersea Adventure, where they chase Storey Ming/Ursula, who nearly reveals her true self before King Triton reduces them to ashes. *Judge Doom: In The Insider, he attacks the Keepers in Toontown. He is a toon disguised as a human, having the ability to transform parts of himself into whatever he needs, though he favors a simple knife in the book. He is the closest thing the Overtakers have to an assassin, and Doom will do anything for money. Doom is referred to as an \\"out-of-work villain\\", since the original attraction Doom came from stopped showing him in later years. After being blasted by Amanda's telekinesis, Doom was left with a dislocated jaw and mangled left leg. After the earthquake, Doom is charged with putting the Partners statue on top the Matterhorn to attract lightning; however, Maybeck and Charlene's interference leaves him trapped in the crane operating cabin when lighting reduces it to sludge. A pun was written about his fate - \\"Inside is the Judge, Doomed.\\" **Toon Patrol: A group of gangster weasels that work for Judge Doom. They help attack the Keepers in Toontown. The only way to kill them is to make them laugh themselves to death, just like in the film. Psycho, a weasel in a straitjacket, fights Willa. *Hades: Mentioned in \\"The Insider\\" by some ghouls under his command, though he doesn't make an actual appearance within the series. Hades' Number 1 Rule is \\"no complaining.\\" It's said he's always watching his minions and hears everything they say, never being too far away and making them watch their backs for him. The Evil Queen says that he and Chernabog are brothers. Tia Dalma also believed she may have accidentally opened a path to his realm (the Underworld) in \\"The Insider\\", when she frees Chernabog and the Evil Queen from the labyrinth in Mexico.he is mentioned again in \\"The Return\\". ** Souls: The deceased that serve Hades. They dislike that Hades melts any metals they had, but know to shut up when they think he'll hear them and retaliate for breaking his Number 1 rule. Finn's team passes them on the way to Big Thunder Mountain. ** Pain, Panic: They first appear in 'The return Disney lands' they attack a security guard in broad daylight while searching for Willa. unlike their film's counterparts they are more ruthless and murderous, but do talk like idiots. *Headless Horseman: Introduced in The Insider, he tries to kill Finn and Willa on the banks of Frontierland. He comes from the \\"Tale of Ichabod and Mr. Toad\\". He is attacked by the transfigured Medicine Woman and a pack of wolves. Philby and Willa later pass the real Sleepy Hollow, making her cringe at the memory of the Headless Horseman getting attacked. *Hopper: Introduced in \\"The Insider,\\" he and his grasshoppers try to kill Finn and Amanda in Paradise Pier during a World of Color performance. Unlike the film, he's the size of a dog and has mandibles the size of hedge trimmers. Knocked away by the fountains. He comes from \\"A Bug's Life\\". *Shere Khan: The second villain from \\"The Jungle Book\\", he works with Si to attack Violet, Finn, and Willa. *Si and Am: The Siamese cats from Lady and the Tramp that caused mischief for Lady to get blamed for. They work with Shere Khan and Scar to stop Violet, Finn, and Willa. *Scar: Villain of The Lion King, he is Mufasa's brother and Simba's uncle and is mentioned by Violet as working with Am. **Shenzi, Banzai and Ed: The most recognised of the Lion King hyenas. The trio patrols Disneyland in \\"The Insider\\", after Tia Dalma damages the park with an earthquake. **Zira: Villainess of The Lion King 2. Zira is near-religiously loyal to Scar. She and other OT minions were after the Keepers, who used they DHI statis to launch earthquake debris at her. **‚Ä≤toy soldiers‚Ä≤: Coming from 'the santa claus 2', these overtakers follow zira and attacked the keepers, two of them were frozen by elsa. *Sabor: The vicious leopard from \\"Tarzan\\". Seeing Sabor as a statue, Finn immediately had The Dillard keep an eye on the leopard while he investigated Tarzan's Tree house for clues. As he predicted, Sabor came to life and attacked; however, Finn tricked the oversized cat into falling out of the tree house, where it reverted to being a statue. *Queen of Hearts: The queen from Alice and Wonderland, who attacks Finn and Maybeck in The Return: Disney Lands after returning to the present with her card soldiers. *Emperor Zurg: an overtaker briefly seen in Shell game, as one of the many villains entering the Disney dream. *King candy: appears in *Mother Gothel: appears in *Queen narissa: appears in *The Firebird: is mentioned in The insider. *Dr. Facilier: is mentioned in The insider. *OTK's (Overtaker Kids, or Green Eyes): Kids who are put under a spell by the Overtakers to spy on and attack the Keepers outside the parks. In Shell Game Finn's mom is transformed into an OTA (Overtaker Adult) by Maleficent outside of Typhoon Lagoon. Tia Dalma and the Queen can do the same, or the reverse by releasing them. Originally, the OTKs wore contact lenses to identify each other, but magic one day changed their eye colors to green. Some of OTKs were promised a better Disney World by the Overtakers in exchange for their services instead of tricked; as a benefit, their natural strength and endurance are enhanced. In \\"The Syndrome\\", Luowski has taken up leadership of the group; they all retain their green eyes.

He tried to kill Finn and the other DHI's several times; once by drugging Finn. He also tried to taser Maybeck, but got Aunt Jelly instead. In \\"Dark Passage\\" he begins resisting the spell and warns Keepers; also, to his disgust, he had to gut a hyena for a flashdrive. Maleficent zones him out as punishment until her death; when he barely regains consciousness, Greg warns of the war that takes place in \\"The Insider\\". In \\"The Syndrome\\", he appears to have either suffered a mental break down and thinks his memories of Maleficent are giving him orders, or the revived witch is too weak to make her voice strong enough in his mind to drown out his own conscience. He attempts killing the Keepers while they're in the Syndrome; however, he ends up being captured by Barracks 14, who wish to examine his enhanced abilities. **Hugo Montcliff: Dell Philby's (pre-Willa) best friend.

He was later projected as a DHI to help the Queen and Cruella shut off the main power to Animal Kingdom to release their leaders from imprisonment. **Sally Ringwald: A girl that goes to same high school as Finn and Amanda. Amanda and Charlene attacked her to get answers about the Overtakers. Later caught by Mrs. Whitman when trying to drug Finn in his sleep with Greg's help, Sally was forced to act as a double act for the Keepers in exchange for not having her mother told of what she's done. She kept that promise throughout the cruise between \\"Shell Game\\" and \\"Dark Passage\\". She reappears in The Syndrome, assisting Luowski with attempting to kill the Keepers while their DHIs are 60 years in the past. However, she is pinned by Amanda's telekenesis. **Bishop Graham: Another of Philby's former friends. However, it's unknown if this is actually Hugo under a nerd alias. The kid lives in his parents' basement and lives like a feudal lord. Due to his Green Eye powers, his mother is afraid of him.

She is supportive of the Kingdom Keepers and helps Finn and the rest many times, bailing Wanda out of jail, solving a cryptogram, providing transportation, and untying a barge in Disney in Shadow.

The OTKs (Overtaker Kids) are also suffering from the same problems. * Donald Whitman: Father of Finn Whitman, very strict, telling his son about getting good grades all the time. Like the rest of the Keepers' parents, he found out about the DHI crossing over in Disney in Shadow, and is the most angry out of the parents when their child crosses-over; he believes the Keepers' mission to be nonsense taking Finn's attention away from his school work. He has a harsh, hard-headed personality, and his interference could have led to the Overtakers' victory. Donald is also quite dense; Finn noted it would at least be a month until he noticed his wife's eyes had changed color. He actually bonded more with Finn over the timeskip, trying to help him cope with Dillard's death. * Finn's Sister: In Disney after Dark it isn't confirmed he has a sister but in Disney at Dawn Amanda borrows his sister's DS in Kingdom Keepers III:Disney In Shadow Finn asked where the rat (his nickname for her) is and said she was at Student Council.

Physically he is somewhat overweight. He always questions Finn's adventures, offering the logical explanation of a dream. He isn't referred to whatsoever in Disney At Dawn. He is mentioned once in Disney in Shadow although it mentions Finn does not see Dillard much anymore and for a while it seems that they might no longer be friends. In the 4th book Dillard helps Finn and the rest of the Kingdom Keepers on a mission at EPCOT. In Shell Game, he appears on the Dream mysteriously helping Finn; he calls himself Finn's guardian angel. He is kidnapped by the Overtakers in \\"Dark Passage\\" when he was posing as Finn, where Tia Dalma tricks Finn into killing him as part of rebooting Chernabog. As an unintended side-effect of the Keeper's time traveling adventure in The Return, Dillard is revived in a Pinocchio-esque fashion via the Dillard. Dillard has all the memories of his hologram's time with the Keepers, but is annoyed he is three years younger than his best friend now. ** The Dillard: After Dillard's death, his parents wanted to help Finn overcome his grief; as a result they contacted the Cryptos, who used Dillard's image and the Coles' home movies to create a hologram; it had vague self-awareness and some of the original Dillard's personality and phrasing, but its speech was mostly clinical. It remains unable to understand sarcasm, insults or metaphors; Maybeck is usually the source of these. The Cryptos introduced it to Finn in \\"The Insider\\", explaining the purpose behind The Dillard's existence. It had mostly unlimited knowledge at its disposal that could be called up in an instant, due to being linked to the internet - \\"basically the new Philby\\" - and could also see through cameras in the park. During the Keepers' missions, it mostly served to calculate the success rates and the best strategems; a secret the Cryptoes kept from them is that The Dillard records everything it sees and hears, using the hologram to spy on them. They use this function to communicate with Joe after the earthquake. * Gladis Philby: Philby's over-protective mother. Despite the paramedics explaining Philby is just sound asleep, she had him rushed to the hospital during Disney in Shadows; this nearly cost the Kingdom Keepers their lives as Philby's became woozy from the IV. Later, she understands the importance of the Keepers' mission, after Philby pointed out that she was keeping him from acting out the good qualities she had been preaching for years. She gets captured by Luoswski in her own home, but breaks free; she lies to her husband, saying a gator had gotten into their house. * Bessie (\\"Jelly\\") Maybeck: Protective of her nephew, Terence. Bessie says she got her name due to an embarrassing incident with jelly doughnuts. She owns a pottery store called The Crazy Glaze. In Shell Game she gets attacked by Luowski with a gun taser which made Finn and Maybeck consider killing the OTKs; they figured it would put an end to their threat, despite how horribly wrong it is to take a life. * Storey Ming: A college aged girl first appearing in Shell Game on the Dream. She helps Finn and the Keepers, and she somehow knows Wayne. In \\"The Insider\\", it's revealed that Storey went missing at sea a long time ago; ironically, she's a swim champ. Finn later discovers that Storey had in fact been saved by Ursula and used as a host by the sea witch to avoid suspicion. Once Ursula leaves her body, Storey regains her senses and swims Finn and Violet to safety; however, she lacks any memory of the time Ursula had possessed her. Finn tricks Storey into thinking that it's a dream, leaving her in Club 33 to awake and call her family. * Mattie Weaver: Appears first in Shell Game.

She is very strict, not (in the narrative description) allowing anything fun in her home; she is also VERY terrible cook, with Amanda saying one of her dishes tastes like dog food. The girls Nash looks after can outsmart her when they work together; they got Finn out of her house without getting caught in \\"Power Play\\". She doesn't let her charges \\"stew\\", forcing them to be open about their emotions. Amanda, being paranoid, believes Nash may be working for the Fairlie facility as she's threatened to return them there; however, Nash may have just used that to keep her and Jess in line. In The Insider, Nash has been keeping Amanda and Jess past foster care age; the Crytos gave her a month to straight up her act and let the other girls go too, or they'd report her. In The Syndrome, Mrs. Nash is revealed to have been offered a reward for Amanda and Jess's location; they sourly note that she'd sale anyone out for $5. * Sergio: the god that meets with the kingdom keepers in Dark Passage * Brad: Helped in the original green-screening in book 1.

Brooke's friend Austion joined them in the trip, but remained unconvinced of the Overtakers' existence despite an attack by ravens led by Diablo. * Austin: A college boy in love with Brooke. He offered to drive Philby and Willa to the nearest oil drilling station; they had found traces of oil where Tia Dalma stood in ToonTown. Unlike Brooke, Austin knows nothing of the Keepers and remains completely skeptical of their explanations. However, an attack by Diablo seems to change his mind. Prior to this, he found one of Tia Dalma's voodoo dolls next to a drilling site, clueing the Keepers in to her plan to cause a destructive earthquake in Disneyland. *Kenny Carlson: In Kingdom Keepers V: Shell Game he first appeared at the meeting in Magic Kingdom. That night, he crossed over to help with the siege at the Base where he joined up with Maybeck to defeat the Green Army Men. The next day, he was on board the Disney Dream. He was telling his roommate, Bart, that they were going to cross over and that they were only going to operate in the background. *Bart: In Kingdom Keepers V: Shell Game he was present at the meeting in Magic Kingdom with the other VKKs.

She was present at the meeting at the Columbia Harbour House. * Barracks 14: An organization that kidnaps children gifted with unusual abilities.

During The Syndrome, Barracks 14 managed to track down the three escaped Fairlies. However, Joe managed to make them more interested in Luowoski, who was enchanted by the Overtakers; they took him in place of the Fairlies, unaware that each side had a plan to deal with them. :The Return: Legacy of Secrets reveals that they backed the Overtakers in order to destroy Disney parks.

Also he is the Head of The Legacy of Secrets, or the Campaign of Darkness is the conspiracy of the Hollingsworth family to put an end the Disney Parks forever. It is the true reason that the Kingdom Keepers had been formed, to combat a human threat back in the 1950s where it all began with Amery Hollingsworth, who hated Walt Disney for apparently taking credit for creating the Evil Queen, Maleficent and the Wicked Stepmother. He did whatever he could to cripple the parks, eventually resorting to stealing the magic ink Disney owned and brought the villains to life with the goal of destroying the parks. However Amery eventually committed suicide, but not before his son Junior was poisoned with his insanity. Junior spent years looking for a back-up plan, finding it in the Fairlies. * Traveler: a witch doctor who lives in the Louisiana swamps who helps Amery Hollingsworth to help him create the Overtakers Disney villains.

It was released on 10 March 2006.http://gameguru.ru/games/neuro/vnimanie_konkurs_po_igre_neuro_2006-04-05/news.html The game's plot and world is tech-noir and cyberpunk-themed, as well as dystopian, with inspiration drawn from Blade Runner and Akira, and the works of writers such as William Gibson and Philip K. Dick.  Plot  Neuro is a low-key crime drama with a cyberpunk theme and backdrop that philosophizes on the devolution of humankind: Even though humans have spread themselves out amongst the stars and developed technology to improve and enrich their lives, they are still likely to exploit each other whenever possible. James Gravesen is a law officer who is attempting to arrest an elusive smuggler with government connections, Ramone, who is dealing in \\"Lilac Death,\\" a highly dangerous weaponized substance that can \\"wipe out Sorgo three times\\". James has biotechnology implanted in his brain that gives him a handful of psi- weapons: From 30 feet away and only using his mind, he can light enemies on fire, blow them off their feet and crush them, and make them go berserk and kill their allies. He can also see through walls to identify where enemies lurk, and he can heal himself. All of this takes a psi-energy which depletes with each use but resets over time. The enemies are mostly crooks trying to stop you from completing your various missions.  History  Prior to release, Neuro had been in development since 2002 and was demonstrated at E3s 2003 and 2004. While intended for worldwide release, it was only released in Russia, the CIS (dubbed into Russian) and Taiwan (dubbed into English). In 2010, an academic, Keith Duffy, found out about Neuro and, not knowing about the official English-language release in Taiwan, translated it into English. His translation was released for free on his blog.http://wkduffy.wordpress.com/2010/10/19/neuro-pc-russia-2006-the- greatest-game-you-never-played/ The Taiwanese release features a GFI Russia logo in the intro despite being distributed by Miracle Express, probably indicating that GFI would have been responsible for European and other Western distribution of the game.

The film was critically acclaimed and won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil at the 31st National Film Awards in 1984. Plot Anamika, a post-graduate student, along with her friends visit the Javadi Hills to make a study on the tribals who live there. During her stay, she befriends a tribal girl named Gangamma. Upon returning home, she wishes to do something for uplifting the lives of the people. She is encouraged in this regard by her father, and Agni, a journalist. After a while, Anamika goes to Javadi Hills and gets to know that Gangamma is dead. She comes to know that Gangamma killed herself after being raped. A frustrated Anamika sets out to inquire the local people. In the process, she is accompanied by a police officer named Muthuvel. Further inquiry reveals Gangamma was raped by Dhanapal, son of an influential minister Malaiyappar. Anamika gathers some evidence against Dhanapal and goes to the city and approaches Agni and other journalists to publish the news. When the news get published, Malaiyappar is asked to step down by the chief minister. However, Malaiayappar refuses to resign and further blackmails the chief minister of another issue.

Organized under the Minister of Culture W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kowalski, Polski Film had control over both domestic film production and distribution of all foreign films.

Ford taught at ≈Å√≥d≈∫ for twenty years. Poland's first postwar feature was Leonard Buczkowski's musical of the German occupation, Zakazane piosenki (Forbidden Songs). First released in January 1947 and very popular, in 1948 the film was re-edited and re-released, with more emphasis on Red Army's role as the liberator of Poland and the main ally of post-war Polish communist regime, as well as a more grim view of the German occupation of Warsaw and German brutality in general.Marek Haltof (2002).

The house has a side hall plan, a design featuring a hall on one side and rooms connected by the hall on the other. It is a rare -story side-hall plan house, as other houses using the plan in Grafton are all two stories. Locally quarried limestone was used to build the house; at the time of its construction, Grafton limestone was only used to build structures within the city, though it later became a widespread building material in the region. The limestone blocks on the front facade are visibly more ashlar than those on the sides, a masonry choice which gives the front corners a quoin- like appearance.

In mid-career it flew as a glider. Design and development The L15 in glider configuration L15 with revised undercarriage By the end of the First World War, Hanns Klemm had moved from Dornier to the aircraft branch of Daimler Motors and had designed two prototype fighters, the Daimler L11 and L14. With military aviation ended by the terms of the Versailles Treaty, he turned to developing a low-power light aircraft. The 1919 Daimler L15 was a high cantilever wing aircraft with a Indian motorcycle engine. Rather little detailed information on it seems to have survived; it had unusual rotating wingtips for roll control instead of ailerons and a single axle undercarriage. It suffered serious propeller damage in 1919, early in the testing programme. From then on Daimler and Klemm abandoned aviation; Klemm remained with Daimler, concentrating on streamlined racing cars and locomotives. During 1920 some German aviation enthusiasts realised that, though Germany was forbidden by the allies to build aeroplanes, gliders were not included in that category, resulting in a series of competitions on the Wasserkuppe that became known as the Rh√∂n contests. Perhaps stimulated by these events, Klemm proposed in 1922 that the L15 should be rebuilt as a glider and obtained approval from the Daimler management. The engine was demounted and replaced with a long, smooth nose, deliberately designed to be easily removable so that the engine could be reinstalled if desired. The pilot sat at the wing leading edge in a cockpit within the removable nose and there was a passenger cockpit between the two wing spars at about one third chord. The fuselage was formed from four longerons, positioned by formers and wire- braced into a rectangular section, but with rounded upper and lower fairings. Its smooth fuselage and cantilever wing, together with an empennage that had no external bracing, made it aerodynamically very clean for its time. The fabric-covered, tapered wings were built around two box spars. The 1919 machine had a single piece wing but gliders need to be easily transportable and so the wings were rebuilt in three pieces. The rudder and elevators were removable and the outer parts of the tailplane could be hinged upwards, again for ease of transport. At some point during the reconstruction the fixed axle undercarriage was replaced with a more refined arrangement where the wheels were separately mounted on hinged and faired V-struts from the fuselage underside and with vertical shock absorber struts to the wing underside, allowing much larger wheel deflections on landing than with the less than half wheel-diameter allowed by end-sprung rigid axle mountings. Unusually, the wheels, which had three-ply centres, were ash-tyred because rubber was expensive in postwar Germany. Given the limitations of its relatively low aspect ratio (about 7.5), the L.15 performed satisfactorily as a glider. In the summer of 1922 it made flights of up to 13 minutes, with an estimated L/D of about 16. Towards the end of 1923 the L15 received a second-hand, Harley- Davidson motorcycle engine, mounted with its cylinders exposed for cooling and driving a two-bladed propeller though 3:1 epicyclic reduction gearing. There were again two open cockpits in tandem, but since the nose was now much shorter the pilot occupied the cockpit previously used by the passenger on the glider and the passenger sat close behind him at the wing trailing edge. During tests, the powered L15 reached an altitude of with only the pilot on board and with a passenger; a solo flight lasting 185 minutes was made and one passenger-carrying flight lasted 122 minutes. Other flights covered solo and with a passenger. In the autumn of 1924 the L15 was fitted with floats and took off from water successfully, at first carrying only the pilot and then with a passenger. Takeoff took 12 seconds in both cases, even with 12.5 hp. Early in these tests a new engine, an uncowled Daimler-Versuchmotor F7506 was flown for the first time. This unusual small, two-stroke, six-cylinder, air- cooled radial engine, fitted with a Roots blower, had been designed specifically for light aircraft and produced , but could not be developed to produce higher powers and was soon abandoned in favour of the Harley-Davidson. The last new engine to power the L15 was a much more powerful () Salmson. With it in place, the L15 was considerably refined with flaps, slats and pneumatic, rubber-tyred wheels. The flights with the low-powered Harley-Davidson engine attracted attention and launched Klemm on a path which led him, after designing at least two more Daimler light aircraft, to set up his own light aircraft company in 1926. In 1924 the L15 was finally refitted with its motorcycle engine and was eventually put on display in the Deutsches Museum with the placard \\"The First Light Aircraft\\", but was destroyed during World War II.

Started as a micro-business, it has evolved into a company of products with an indigenous taste. History Balaji company started in 1976 by the members of Virani Group, when Chandubhai and his brothers Bhikhubhai and Kanubhai migrated from a small village Dhun Dhoraji, Jamnagar district of Gujarat. Their father Popatbhai Virani was a farmer, who sold ancestral agriculture land and gave to them to venture into business. The Viranis invested in farm equipment, but could not succeed and lost the money. Kakubhai and his brothers started a wafer business from a canteen of a cinema hall in Rajkot in 1974. Until 1989, the wafers were produced at the Viranis' house and distributed in and around Rajkot city. By their retail success they were inspired to set a semi- automatic plant instead of preparing wafers by the traditional frying method. The product gradually reached every part of Gujarat, and the Viranis wanted to take over the whole western India, so the biggest automatic plant of Gujarat came into the picture. In the initial stage Balaji Wafers set up their plant at Aji Vasad (Industrial Zone, Rajkot) with a new concept of making potato chips.

A striker, he played league football for Scarborough, Plymouth Argyle and Hereford United. After a break in his career because of injury, he played non- league football for Bromsgrove Rovers and Arnold Town. Football career =Scarborough= Robinson was born in Nottingham, and began his football career as a youngster with Notts County and then Bury. In 1989, as an 18-year- old, he had a trial with Scarborough, a Fourth Division club in only their third season in the Football League. Manager Colin Morris said later that he had been \\"frankly, quite awful\\", apart from one piece of skill \\"when he trapped a ball at pace and pinged it 50 yards in one movement out to the wing, from where we scored\\". Robinson signed for Scarborough on a free transfer. In his fifth competitive game for the club, Scarborough faced Chelsea, who were then in second place in the First Division, in the second round of the League Cup. Two goals behind on the night, 3‚Äì1 down on aggregate, With 24 minutes to go, Tommy Graham scored with a header. Four minutes later, Robinson scrambled the ball home to bring the scores level. Then after a further four minutes, Steve Norris was fouled in the penalty area. While Chelsea claimed the player had been offside, the referee awarded the penalty kick. Martin Russell converted to complete the victory on what the Scarborough Evening News years later labelled \\"one of the most memorable nights in the club's history\\". Robinson said afterwards: \\"Chelsea made the mistake of under-estimating us. We fancied our chances after holding them to a draw at Stamford Bridge. It's a lovely feeling.\\" In the next round, Scarborough lost 7‚Äì0 on Oldham Athletic's plastic pitch, and a few weeks later, Robinson was substituted at half-time as Scarborough lost at home in the FA Cup to Whitley Bay, three divisions below them in the league system. He scored three times in 20 league appearances over the season, at the end of which he moved up to the Second Division with Plymouth Argyle for a ¬£15,000 fee. =Plymouth Argyle= During Argyle's pre- season tour of Sweden, Sunday Independent journalist Rupert Metcalf assessed Robinson as more mobile than fellow new arrival, target-man Robbie Turner, and with \\"genuine potential, although he clearly still has some rough edges to be refined\\". On his first competitive start, Robinson scored twice in a minute ‚Äì first a header, then a run followed by a shot from distance ‚Äì in a 3‚Äì2 win against Millwall. This earned him a place in the starting eleven for the next few matches, but he failed to score and lost his place. In the second half of the season he scored once from three starts and one substitute appearance, and returned to the Fourth Division with Hereford United for 1991‚Äì92. He was reportedly disappointed at being given insufficient opportunity to succeed at the higher level. =Hereford United= Robinson began Hereford's new season in the starting eleven. He scored on his first appearance, in the Herefordshire Senior Cup, and hit a hat-trick against Mostyn in the Welsh Cup, but was sent off in his first league match and again in his fifth. He was denied a goal as non-League club Atherstone Town held Hereford to a goalless draw in the FA Cup: the goalkeeper turned Andy Theodosiu's header onto the bar, Robinson headed the rebound back into the net, but it was disallowed because Theodosiu was lying on the goalline in an offside position. Robinson played intermittently, making seven league starts and four substitute appearances without scoring, and played his last Football League match on 25 April 1992 at the age of 21. =Non-League football= He moved into non- league football with Cheltenham Town at the end of the season, and eventually retired from playing because of a back injury. However, in the 1998 close season he felt he had recovered enough to attempt a comeback. He played in a friendly match for Tamworth, but signed for Southern League club Bromsgrove Rovers instead. He played until late October, including a five-week spell out with a broken wrist, but then left the club for personal reasons and signed for Arnold Town.

It was built at the beginning of the 5th century and it is dedicated to \\"Our Lady of the Harbour\\". The basilica of Panagia Limeniotissa is situated in a short distance north of Paphos harbour, close to the restaurants of the harbour and it is part of the Paphos Archaeological Park. Visitors can see some colourful mosaics and a few restored columns. History =Medieval period= The basilica was built in the early 5th century, during the Early Christian period, when Cyprus was part of the Byzantine empire. It originally comprised three aisles with two rows of marble columns, an apse and a narthex. The floors and walls were decorated with coloured mosaics in geometric patterns. In 653 AD, it was almost destroyed during the Arab raids against the island. The Arabs maintained a garrison, using the structure as workshops, stables and living quarters for the army. They also built a tower in its narthex which could have served as a watchtower, lighthouse or a minaret. In 688 AD, after they evacuated the island, the church was restored as a three- aisled barrel vaulted basilica in a smaller scale than the previous one. In 1159 AD, the basilica was destroyed again. This time, according to St. Neophytos, an earthquake destroyed the church as well as thirteen churches in the whole district of Paphos. In the following years a smaller structure was built upon the ruins of the basilica but it was also destroyed by the 1222 earthquake. The church was left in ruins and forgotten. =20th Century= The exact location of the basilica was unknown among the other ruins of Nea Paphos (\\"New Paphos\\") until the 20th century. The Panagia Limeniotissa was first discovered in 1937 and was officially excavated in 1959. Today, the Panagia Limeniotissa basilica is part of Paphos Archaeological Park which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Gainsborough's House is the birthplace of the leading English painter Thomas Gainsborough. It is now a museum and gallery, located at 46 Gainsborough Street in Sudbury, Suffolk, England. Some of the pictures on display have been acquired with the help of the Art Fund. Overview The house is now 46 Gainsborough Street and dates back to around 1520. Thomas Gainsborough's parents, John and Mary Gainsborough, probably moved here in 1722 and the artist Thomas Gainsborough was born five years later. Thomas Gainsborough, the youngest of John and Mary's nine children, lived in the house and attended Sudbury Grammar School. At 13 he went to London to further his studies training with the French painter and illustrator, Hubert-Francois Gravelot. The house remained as a private residence until 1920, after which time it had various functions including a guest house and antique shop. In 1958, Gainsborough's House Society was formed to purchase the house and establish it as a museum and monument to Thomas Gainsborough. The museum opened to the public in 1961. History The oldest visible part of the house is the oak doorway into the entrance room, which could date back to 1490. Four distinct periods may be discerned in its architecture. The original house, represented today only by the Entrance Hall and Aubrey Herbert Room, probably dates back to around 1500. The oak doorway, was probably the original front door to the house, leading straight into the Entrance Hall from the street. Houses of the late 15th century show a type of structure closely related to the timbering visible in the Entrance Hall. The fireplace with its heavy oak lintel may have been a later addition to the room, being a common feature of early 17th century rooms. Around 1600, a house was built next door. The Parlour, across the corridor from the Entrance Hall, is the only visible part of this house, to have survived, and even there the character of the room has been greatly altered by subsequent modernisations. The basic structure of most houses of this period was made up of a skeleton of oak beams. The panels between those beams were filled with \\"plaster\\". In this particular case, the plaster was applied on to hazel sticks wedged between the timbers. It was composed of clay soil mixed with about half its bulk of reeds, both leaf and stem of which were used, and which were very plentiful in East Anglia. Such plaster was known as wattle and daub, raddle and daub, or pug, and was applied simultaneously by two men one on either side of the wall. This was allowed to dry hard before whitewashing, and was very tough, having the added advantage of being cheap. It was not, however, an entirely satisfactory building material, as it tended to shrink away from the beams in dry weather, and soaked up the moisture in wet weather. The interior walls would have been wainscoted with oak panelling usually \\"chair-high\\", the rest being stuccoed and covered either with wallpaper, or painted decoration. The structural beams would not, by the early 18th century, have been visible inside the house. The floors, which in the 16th century would have consisted of packed earth and ox-blood covered with herbed straw, would by this time, have been boarded with oak planks. In the absence of proper stains and polishes, 18th century housewives had to improvise; John Wood, when commenting upon the effected of his improvements in Bath recalls that: Gainsborough's parents bought the house for ¬£230 in 1722 and it remained in the family until 1792. When the house was sold at auction, it was described as: It continued as a private residence until the 1920s when it was converted into a guest house and tearooms. Lunches and teas were served and they also catered for wedding receptions. The garden was frequently open in the summer, both for teas and the hire of the two tennis courts. Photographs and reminiscences from this time indicate that the house adapted well for this purpose and was popular with both guests and locals alike. After the Second World War, the house had various functions including a period as an antique shop. In the mid 1950s, Mr Doward, an English art dealer working in America who had rediscovered a Gainsborough painting, bought the house intending to live in it. However, he failed to convince his wife to move to Sudbury. Therefore, in 1956 the house was once again put up for sale. Museum Initially, interest was stimulated by individuals: Michael Harvard, Aubrey Herbert and Sir Alfred Munnings. By October 1956, a Gainsborough's House National Appeal Committee was formed, under the Chairmanship of the Mayor of Sudbury, Councillor Arthur Essex JP. The committee brought together local businessmen and politicians, as well as those interested in art and history. Initially the President was the John Rous, 4th Earl of Stradbroke (Lord Lieutenant of Suffolk) and the Vice-President was the artist Sir Alfred Munnings KCVC, PPRA, who lived at nearby Dedham. Appeals were made to all sections of the local community. From the beginning, the House was to be a centre for the arts, as well as a museum and monument to Gainsborough. Fund- raising included collection boxes in local hotels as well as in major galleries around the country. Artists were particularly supportive. Sir Alfred Munnings hoped to encourage others to make major donations, when in 1957 he gave ¬£1,500, the proceeds of the sale of his painting of the Queen's horse, Aureole. The house was purchased on 20 January 1958 for ¬£5,250. By September, the Gainsborough's House Society was formally established to run the museum as an independent charity. Following the successful acquisition of the building, local companies and individuals also gave materials and their labour to help renovate the building and the garden. The museum was formally opened on 12 April 1961. The house opened as a public museum in 1961 but there was no permanent collection as such. People were encouraged to donate or to lend works of art, furniture, decorative objects or Gainsborough memorabilia to furnish the house, as well as Gainsborough paintings, drawings and reproductions. Including two Gainsborough drawings, teapots and a 17th-century chair. Other works deposited here in 1961 are still on permanent display in the House. Amongst these are five pieces of furniture on loan from the V&A; and the six portraits by Gainsborough initially loaned by Lord de Saumarez, which have since been acquired. Appeals for funds were ongoing. Major building work was carried out in 1967 and, initially, it was hoped to raise money for an endowment for the House to be taken over by the National Trust, a scheme that was later abandoned. Most recently a successful appeal for over ¬£1 million was raised to renovate the cottages and the main house and garden, which was carried out from 2005‚Äì7. In 2000, a Friends organisation was established to help with fundraising and a programme of social events. Since the initial appeal in the 1950s, artists have responded to the House and its attractive walled garden. The image of the historic house itself, as much as that of the artist or his work, has been most widely used to promote the museum. Thomas Gainsborough Throughout the 18th century, landscape painting was considered a rather lowly branch of art. However Gainsborough was innovative in often fusing these two genres within the same composition. Gainsborough was the first important British artist to consistently paint landscape and it provided the ideal subject for his poetic vision. While Gainsborough sold some of his landscapes, he found portraiture more lucrative. At the height of his career, from the 1760s onwards, the demands for his portraits were such that he suffered from overwork. Unlike many other painters of the time, Gainsborough was an avid draughtsman. He was always an experimental artist, using a wide range of drawing or printmaking techniques. In his later years, Gainsborough expanded his subject matter with some mythological and 'fancy' pictures with a stronger narrative content. Gainsborough's painting method was technically sound and his works have survived relatively well. It is his painting style, particularly his fluent brushwork, as well as his 'naturalism' that have been so admired by later generations. Gainsborough attended Sudbury Grammar School but at thirteen went to further his studies in London. There, he trained with the French painter and illustrator, Hubert-Francois Gravelot and associated with the artistic community around the St Martin's Lane Academy, which included William Hogarth (1697‚Äì1762) and Francis Hayman (1708‚Äì76). Their decorative Rococo style and introduction of the informal 'conversation piece' as a new portrait type were influential on the young Gainsborough. In 1749, after his marriage to Margaret Burr and father's death, he returned to his native town of Sudbury. He made a meagre living painting portraits of the local gentry and members of the professional classes. These early portraits were often rather stiff but demonstrated the artist's flair for capturing a likeness and a personality. At the same time, he was also painting landscapes. While clearly inspired by the Suffolk countryside, they were only rarely views of actual places. Gainsborough's early landscapes were imitative of 17th-century Dutch landscape painting, with their careful observation of nature and meticulous technique. By 1752, Gainsborough had probably exhausted the circle of potential patrons around Sudbury and moved to the larger town of Ipswich, then a flourishing port. There, he had greater opportunities to develop as an artist, with more exacting clients. In 1759, Gainsborough made a decisive move to Bath. As a rapidly growing spa town in the West Country, Bath became an important social centre for the wealthy and fashionable, where they consulted their doctors or had their portraits painted. His talents were in demand by more cosmopolitan and aristocratic sitters than before, and his larger studio space enabled him to paint full-lengths on a grand scale. While in Bath, he continued to paint landscape and made sketching excursions in the surrounding countryside. These moved away from the Dutch influence of his earlier landscapes to become imaginary pastoral visions. The growing confidence of Gainsborough as a painter from the 1760s onwards resulted not only from more sophisticated patronage but also his knowledge of the work of other artists. While at Bath, largely for the first time, Gainsborough was able to see paintings by Van Dyck, Rubens and other Old Masters in the great collections at Wilton, Corsham Court or Longford Castle. In 1768, the Royal Academy was established in London, giving artists an official position in society. Gainsborough was a founder member while his rival, Sir Joshua Reynolds, was its first President. This may have encouraged Gainsborough in his decision to move to the capital in 1774. The artist's relationship with the Academy, however, was not easy and by 1783, he eventually stopped showing at its annual exhibitions. In London, he resided in the west wing of Schomberg House on Pall Mall, where he held exhibitions at his studio. The portraits of his later years became more fanciful and graceful, often using thin paint applied in light, feathery strokes. The 'Cottage Door' subject was a recurrent theme, while he also developed new, more dramatic landscape subjects, particularly after his tour of the Lake District in 1783. In his last decade, Gainsborough started to broaden his range of subject matter with mythological or 'fancy' pictures. These were of great importance to the artist, who considered The Woodman (destroyed by fire in 1810) to be his finest work. Gainsborough died of cancer on 2 August 1788 and is buried in Kew Churchyard.
