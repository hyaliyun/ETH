It was written by Dan Mintz and directed by Tyree Dillihay, and was released on April 13, 2014. Parodying the \\"brony\\" fanbase of the animated children's cartoon My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, the episode's plot centers on Tina discovering her favorite animated pony cartoon has a fanbase of adult men, one of whom tricks Tina out of her rare toy pony, forcing Bob to go undercover and try to get it back. Plot Tina, Gene, Louise, and Linda visit an \\"Equestra Con\\" convention based on Tina's favorite animated show, The Equestranauts, based on a toyline of pony dolls. Bob refuses to attend, disregarding it as being exclusive to young girls, but is told by Teddy that it is actually a meeting ground for a subculture of adult male fans of the series who call themselves \\"Equesticles\\" because \\"they have testicles.\\" Tina is surprised to find that all the convention's attendants are middle-aged men wearing horse costumes, and feels out of place among them. She encounters a group of Equesticles led by a superfan who calls himself Bronconius, and befriends them over their shared interest in the series. Noticing Tina's \\"Chariot\\" pony doll, Bronconius coaxes her into trading it for a new toy, and promptly leaves. Louise overhears him gloating over the swindle and tells Tina about it. The Belchers learn online that Tina's Chariot doll is a collectible with a rare camel toe defect. Tina devises a plan for Bob to steal the doll back by disguising himself as an Equesticle nicknamed \\"Bobcephala\\" and infiltrating Bronconius' circle of fans, to which Bob reluctantly agrees. In order to convince the fans of his disguise, she has Bob studiously review every Equestranauts episode and book to ensure his complete knowledge of the series. At the convention, Bob impresses Bronconius with his display of Equestranauts trivia, and begins to partake in various Equesticle activities with the group, such as face-painting, eating from a trough, and getting drunk on cocktails the fans call \\"horse medicine.\\" Meanwhile, Tina looks through Bob's studying material to discover her self-written zombie-related Equestranauts fan fiction that is non-canonical to the series, and realizes that Bob will ruin his cover if he brings it up. At a hotel after-party, Bronconius shows Bob a safe where the Chariot doll is kept, and tells Bob his intent to achieve immortality by \\"merging mouths\\" with the doll. Bob openly recalls a zombie character from Tina's fan fiction, exposing him to Bronconius. Bob's family arrives to rescue Bob as Bronconius prepares to give Bob a large tattoo on his back in the shape of a horse with his own face on its posterior. Bronconius sets the other Equesticles on the family, but Tina turns them against him by arguing that he is using their core value of acceptance to achieve his own ends. Bob then calls the front desk to open the safe so he can recover the doll. However, Tina decides she has outgrown the doll and packs it away, thanking Bob for retrieving it anyway. Angered that his tolerance with the series and its fandom has been for nothing, Bob forces Tina to play with the doll before she goes to bed. Reception Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, saying it \\"offers a master class in the careful construction and destruction of its absurd scenario, and this is a feat that takes considerable skill. After all, such intentional undercutting of the story could backfire, especially with a premise like tonight's.\\" He also praised the episode's knowledge of the My Little Pony fandom, writing, \\"[This] real-world counterpart feels less like a target for mockery and more like an inspiration for affectionate parody and a jumping-off point for something far stranger.\\" Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode a 9.8, writing \\"Maybe I dont watch enough TV because I have to wonder what took a series this long to mock the brony phenomenon [...]. Well, the wait was worth it because Bob's Burgers damn near excoriated it.\\" The episode received a 0.8 rating and was watched by a total of 1.83 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show on Animation Domination that night behind American Dad!, The Simpsons, and Family Guy with 4.39 million.

Construction began in late 1947 at the Crest Street site of Kiger Stadium, with a goal of opening in Spring 1948 for the Class D Klamath Falls Gems, the Far West League farm team of the Philadelphia Phillies. The stadium was built by Klamath Baseball, Inc. and paid for by the sale of stock to local citizens. The opening, and the original Gems, were a huge success, as the team led the league in attendance in three of the four years they were in the League, and won the Far West League's final Championship before the league folded after the 1951 season. Since those days, the venerable stadium has stood against weather and other obstacles to become one of only two remaining all-wood stadiums in North America. Historic Kiger Stadium has hosted thousands of amateur baseball games, from Little League through American Legion through a semi-pro incarnation of the Gems, through the years. In 1968 the ballpark hosted the Babe Ruth World Series, and in 1970 the American Legion Championships. For a time in the 1950s, Kiger Stadium was even turned into an auto racing track. Through the years Kiger has seen it all, and in 2011 welcomed the new Klamath Falls Gems of the West Coast League. The Gems gave Klamath Basin families another reason to visit Kiger Stadium, and the success of the Gems and the WCL have brought many improvements to Kiger, without losing the charm of the original park. (The current Gems now play in the Great West League.) In 2014 the Klamath Falls Gems, have planned minor improvements to Kiger Stadium, such as making the restrooms ADA accessible, and painting the outfield wall, the stadium facades, and stadium bleachers.

History EFTPS started in 1996. Services EFTPS allows individuals and businesses to make their tax and estimated tax payments securely online using their bank accounts. Payments can be made only after enrolling in the system, and the enrollment process can take about a week (initial online enrollment is followed by relevant information being sent by physical mail, after which the online enrollment process may be completed). The enrollment process includes information about the bank account from which one's payments will be debited. Payments must be scheduled at least 1 day and at most 365 days in advance. Separate modalities exist for same-day payment. A Forbes article about EFTPS recommends using the service to make estimated tax payments, noting that one can schedule payments in advance but also modify the payments in case of some unexpected changes to plans. The article also notes the importance of planning in advance the first year one intends to use the service: \\"The first year you sign up for the federal online system you need some lead time because a PIN is sent via snail mail within five to seven days. Then you go back online to set up your quarterly estimated payments, plugging in your checking account information and the dates you want the estimated payments withdrawn.\\" Privacy The EFTPS website claims that the Internal Revenue Service and other government agencies do not obtain access to the enrollee's account, and only payments explicitly scheduled or authorized by the enrollee are processed by the website. In particular, the EFTPS account cannot be used by the IRS to confiscate assets if they believe that taxes were underpaid.

The WCG serves as a resource for learning about the care of art collections.  History  The Washington Conservation Guild (WCG) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization established in 1967 for professional conservators, students, and others interested in the preservation of art and historic materials. The idea for the regional conservation group was proposed as early as 1965, when the International Council of Museums (ICOM) Committee for Conservation met in Washington, DC. The first steering committee met informally in the summer of 1967; here, it was decided that the primary intentions of the group was to provide a public forum where members could meet and \\"sponsor presentations to promote the exchange of ideas among conservators in all fields in the Washington area.\\"  Bylaws/Code of Ethics for Members  Bylaws or Code of Ethics put forward by the WCG to define its governance and for its members as a condition of membership.  Organization & Governance  Based in Washington, D.C., the WCG draws its members primarily from Washington, Maryland, and northern Virginia. Members include both professional conservators and non-conservators - from government, state, and private museums; as well as studios, laboratories, and other cultural or academic organizations. There are no restrictions on who may apply for membership. The Washington Conservation Guild is governed by all-volunteered, membership-elected Board of Directors. The Board is composed of five officers and several directors. The WCG is also composed of several committees, led by Board-appointed chairs. Elections for WCG Board Officers and Directors take place May at the Annual Business Meeting.  Projects  =Events= The WCG holds meetings from October through May each year, generally on the first Thursday of each month. Once annually, the Guild hosts the 3-Ring Circus event. The '3-Ring Circus' held January 9, 2014 in partnership with the National Museum of African Art, ran with three consecutive sessions. The themes for the January 2014 3-Ring Circus were \\"Conservation in Far Flung Places;\\" \\"Analytical;\\" and \\"Contemporary.\\" The Guild also holds several monthly events over the course of the year. These events have included lectures, workshops, and networking sessions. =Angels Project= The Angels Project is designed to \\"promote a broader understanding of the importance of cultural preservation while providing meaningful assistance to important local collections.\\" Members participating in the Projects work pro-bono, volunteering their time and conservation expertise at a particular historic site. The Angels Project originally began in 1988 with the WCG's parent group, the American Institute of Conservation, pairing conservators with collections that need care. =Fire at the Georgetown Public Library= On April 30, 2007, a three-alarm fire caused significant damage to the Georgetown branch of the DC Public Library. City officials estimated the cost to repair the library at about $20 million; the renovation included the restoration of exterior doors and windows, stone masonry, and ornamental railings and grates. Members of the WCG responded and coordinated with the DC library officials to set up disaster recovery efforts. At its annual meeting days later on May 3, 2007, the WCG held a fundraiser raffle. The proceeds went to support the conservation of the library's artwork, manuscripts, maps, and documents damaged in the fire.  Publications  The Washington Conservation Guild published a quarterly newsletter written and edited by volunteers to benefit guild members. Offered at first only as a printed edition, the newsletter transitioned to an online PDF. The newsletter was published as a PDF until December 2012, when it was replaced by a continuously-updated blog-style website. Archived newsletters can be found on the WCG website. In 2004, the Washington Conservation Guild published the second edition of its eBook, Conservation Resources for Art and Antiques. Conservation Resources is a guide describing how to care for and preserve fine art, antiques, family heirlooms, memorabilia, and personal collections.

Constantinescu in 1914 Alexandru C. \\"Alecu\\" Constantinescu (September 4, 1859 ‚Äì November 18, 1926) was a Romanian politician. Biography =Background and early political activity= Born in Bucharest to a family of Wallachian lesser boyars, his father Costache (b. 1811) owned property in Poienarii-DƒÉne»ôti village, D√¢mbovi»õa County (now in Giurgiu County). His mother was one Ecaterina, and he had a number of siblings.R«édulescu, p.109 He began school in his native city before leaving for Paris, where he graduated with a law degree in 1879 and a doctorate in 1881. After returning to Romania, he first worked as a lawyer in private practice before serving as attorney for the state and for an agricultural bank from 1884 to 1889. Joining the National Liberal Party in 1882, he was elected deputy Mayor of Bucharest that year, remaining until 1884. In 1895, he was elected to the Senate for Putna County. He joined the Chamber of Deputies in 1901.Grigore and ≈ûerbu, p.179 He was Agriculture and Domains Minister from November 1909 to December 1910, and from January 1914 to December 1916. During the latter period, Constantinescu faced a problem posed by the outbreak of World War I and the position of neutrality adopted by Romania for the time being. The government refused to sell excess grain, as this could only be purchased by the Central Powers, which would have weakened the economic blockade imposed by the Entente Powers. Meanwhile, the grain was rotting, which led the large landowners to exert increasing pressure on the government. Prime Minister Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu received permission from the Entente leadership to sell part of the grain, and decided to sell from state to state rather than to the German-Austro-Hungarian cartel. Thus, in January 1916, the British government signed a contract for 80,000 wagons full of grain. The Romanian government built warehouses near railway stations; these were needed to store the grain prior to transport, since it could not be picked up directly from the country. =Wartime Interior Minister= He was Interior Minister from December 1916 to January 1918, also under BrƒÉtianu. His term coincided with a critical period: Romania had joined the war in August; a German offensive from mid-November to early December had forced King Ferdinand and the government to flee to the temporary capital of Ia»ôi, in the Moldavia region.Grigore and ≈ûerbu, p.179-80 The loss of two-thirds of the national territory posed acute problems, including for Constantinescu's ministry. He ordered numerous law enforcement agencies to retreat to Moldavia, although the Romanian Police and part of the Gendarmerie stayed in place. Subsequently, he reorganized the law enforcement and intelligence command structure, while strengthening police presence in Moldavian cities and towns. He made efforts to strengthen intelligence-gathering through special security brigades in Roman, Tecuci, Piatra Neam»õ and Vaslui, among other cities. The gendarmes guarded sites of economic and military importance, lines of communication and the military engineers' work along the front. A new agency was formed to guard dignitaries and counter espionage against the Romanian Army, while a group of 160 gendarmes was put together to guard military sites in the Danube Delta. Each infantry division was assigned a police company for counterespionage purposes.Grigore and ≈ûerbu, p.180 One of the ministry's challenges during 1917 was to identify new spies of the Central Powers in the occupied territory. At the beginning of the year, Romanian and Russian agents worked together, quickly identifying over 2500 suspected spies.Grigore and ≈ûerbu, p.180-81 Following the retreat to Moldavia, some of the most competent policemen were, following brief training, sent behind the front in order to organize a resistance movement and networks to keep the military command informed of developments. During the Romanian counteroffensive of the summer of 1917, thousands of policemen and gendarmes participated, serving as military police and ensuring security at the front. Meanwhile, the police, together with the army, guarded prisoner-of-war camps. =Subsequent career= Later on, Constantinescu held the Industry and Commerce (November 1918-September 1919) and the Public Works (February‚ÄìSeptember 1919) portfolios.Olaru, p.79 His final ministerial stint came from April 1922 to March 1926, when he returned to the Agriculture post.

Ion G. Duca notes in his memoirs that this originated during his school days and was due to his \\"short, thick, rotund physique, rosy skin and reddish hair\\", but later also applied to his reputed moral character. Whether fairly or not, all the negative aspects that the name implied were ascribed to him, although Duca says he never noticed dubious conduct about the man while they served in cabinet. This perception was confirmed by their fellow Liberal minister (and scrupulous moralist) VintilƒÉ BrƒÉtianu, who kept him under close observation.Duca, p.88-9 In 1935, a bronze statue of Constantinescu was unveiled before the Palace of Agriculture in BrƒÉila.

He was drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the first round of the 2014 Major League Baseball draft. He made his major league debut in 2018. Amateur career Toussaint was born in Pembroke Pines, Florida, to Dany Toussaint and Kahaso Kiti. He is of Haitian and Kenyan descent. Toussaint's nickname, Touki, is a portmanteau of his parents' surnames. The family moved to Haiti when he was three months old. Toussaint and his mother moved back to Florida when he was six. He stopped playing baseball at age 10 due to a strikeout-filled season as a batter, and focused on soccer and hockey only to return to baseball two years later. Toussaint attended Coral Springs Charter School for his freshman year before transferring to Coral Springs Christian Academy also in Coral Springs, Florida. As a junior in 2013, Toussaint was a MaxPreps All-American after he was 6‚Äì2 with a 0.78 earned run average (ERA) and 83 strikeouts. He also hit .458 with six home runs and 32 runs batted in. He was named Broward County's Class 5A-4A-3A-2A Player of the Year. Toussaint committed to play college baseball at Vanderbilt University. Professional career =Arizona Diamondbacks= Toussaint was considered one of the top prospects for the 2014 MLB draft. The Arizona Diamondbacks selected Toussaint in the first round, 16th overall, of the draft. He signed on June 20, agreeing to a $2.7 million signing bonus, and made his professional debut with the Arizona League Diamondbacks on July 2. On August 3, he was promoted to the Missoula Osprey. Toussaint pitched his first Pioneer League game on August 8, 2014. Toussaint finished his first professional season with a 2‚Äì4 record and an 8.48 ERA over 12 total appearances. Toussaint began the 2015 season at extended spring training, then joined the Kane County Cougars in May. =Atlanta Braves= On June 20, 2015 he was traded to the Atlanta Braves along with Bronson Arroyo for Phil Gosselin. He finished the 2015 season with a 4.83 ERA in 17 total starts, including 5.73 ERA in ten starts as a member of the Rome Braves. The rocky season was attributed to the Diamondbacks' request that Toussaint cut down on the use of his curveball, shortly after his debut for Kane County, as the team felt that becoming excessively reliant on the pitch early in his career would lead to injury. Not throwing his curveball gave Toussaint time to improve his changeup, which became a viable third pitch over the course of the season. Toussaint spent 2016 with Rome. He struggled to begin the season, but improved after making adjustments to his pitching delivery. Toussaint began 2017 with the Florida Fire Frogs and was promoted to the Mississippi Braves in late July 2017, making his Southern League debut on July 31 against the Mobile BayBears. In 145 total innings pitched between Florida and Mississippi, he pitched to a 6‚Äì13 record with a 4.53 ERA along with 167 strikeouts. He appeared in the offseason Arizona Fall League with the Peoria Javelinas. Toussaint started the 2018 season in Mississippi, recording a 2.93 ERA with 107 strikeouts until a midseason promotion to the Gwinnett Stripers. Toussaint faced the Norfolk Tides in his first International League game on July 5, 2018, pitching innings while yielding one run on five hits. He was named to the All-Star Futures Game, and appeared in relief to pitch the eighth inning. On August 13, 2018, the Braves purchased Toussaint's contract and added him to the roster. He made his MLB debut the same day with a start against the Miami Marlins, yielding one run on two hits in six innings pitched. Toussaint spent time at spring training prior to the start of the 2019 season, and began the year at Gwinnett. On July 4, 2020, it was announced that Toussaint had tested positive for COVID-19. In 2020, he was 0-2 with an 8.88 ERA over 24.1 innings.

Biography =Early life= Manuel was the son of Rodrigo da C√¢mara and D. Maria Coutinho, dame in the court of Queen Elizabeth of Bourbon. He was 21 years old when he testified against his father in front of the Holy Office of the Inquisition, for alleged practices of sodomy and for supposed incestuous relations. These crimes, at the time, resulted in the forfeiture of family possessions and loss of honour at Corte: his father eventually died miserable conditions in the convent of Cape St. Vicent. The remainder of the family, consequently, suffered a period of financial chaos and became social outcasts at court. Manuel Lu√≠s married late, and remained with his mother at the convent where his father was incarcerated, until his father's death. =Donat√°rio= Following the death of the 3rd Count of Vila Franca, the Countess used her family's connections (the Counts of Vidigueira were descendants of Vasco da Gama) with the royal family to attempt to recover the possessions confiscated following the scandal of her ex-husband, and to rehabilitate the family honour.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.52 She, therefore, sought from King Afonso VI to resuscitate the Captaincy and the incomes associated with this patronage. By royal letter, dated 15 September 1662, the monarch named D. Manuel Lu√≠s Baltazar da C√¢mara, the first Count of Ribeira Grande, returning his familial interests and providing an inheritance for him and his descendants. Shortly later, on 28 September, the King re-instituted all the possessions confiscated from his father, including the Captaincy of S√£o Miguel. =Later life= Manuel served in the Restoration Wars in the province of Alentejo, as master-of-camp in Setubal. The 1st Count of Ribeira Grande did not narrowly support the development of S√£o Miguel, and was instrumental in the support of the Catholic church, donating funds to the Imp√©rio dos Nobres on Faial, in order to fulfill a promise made to the Holy Spirit. In this intervention he promised to institutionalize the Cult of the Holy Spirit if God would provide him with a strong son: his son, Jos√©, would later inherit the Captaincy of S√£o Migel. He was believed to have gone mad before dying.

He was the son and successor of Ardashir I. Biography Rustam V was the second son of Ardashir I, and had three brothers named Sharaf al-Muluk, Sharaf al-Dawla, and Rukn al-Dawla Qarin. Although Sharaf al-Muluk was the eldest of the brothers, Sharaf al-Muluk was chosen as the heir of the Bavand dynasty. Rustam V is first mentioned as the leader of a group of nobles which plotted to overthrow Ardashir and crown him as the ruler of the Bavand dynasty. Ardashir, however, discovered about the plot, and had Rustam V imprisoned. In 1205, Ardashir died‚Äîabout the same time, Sharaf al-Muluk died, and thus the succession passed to Rustam V, who was freed from prison and brought to the throne at the Bavandid capital of Amol. However, his brother Rukn ad-Dawla Qarin, claimed the throne for himself and went to Khwarazm, where he requested aid from the Khwarazmian king Muhammad II. Muhammad II agreed to help him, and ordered his brother, Ali-Shah, who was the ruler of Damghan and Bastam, to invade Rustam's domains, which he did. The brothers, however, made a peace treaty, which resulted in Rukn ad-Dawla Qarin receiving the inheritance of Sharaf al-Muluk. Meanwhile, the relations between Ali-Shah and Muhammad II became hostile, and, in the end, Ali-Shah was killed by Muhammad II. During the rest of Rustam's reign, Mazandaran fell under heavy influence from the Khwarezmians, while the Nizari Ismaili's began conquering parts of Rustam's territory, and even assassinated Rukn ad-Dawla Qarin. On 1 April 1210, Rustam V was betrayed and murdered by his former subject the Alid Abu Ridha Husayn. With no Bavandid heir left, the Bavand kingdom was incorporated into the Khwarazmian Empire. However, Rustam's sister, bore a son named Shahriyar, who would later have a son named Kinkhwar, who in turn begot a son named Ardashir II, who restored the Bavand dynasty.

The Friends of the Uffizi Gallery and the Amici degli Uffizi directly support the Uffizi Gallery by helping build awareness of the museum and its cultural heritage and by raising funds for acquisitions, preservation, restorations, temporary exhibitions, and educational programming.  History  Uffizi Gallery viewed from the south In 1993 a terrorist bomb severely damaged the Uffizi Gallery and some of the artworks. In response to this attack, a group of concerned citizens founded the Amici degli Uffizi in Florence to help restore and preserve the artistic heritage of the museum. Since the bombing, the Amici degli Uffizi has supported the Uffizi Gallery by facilitating acquisitions, supporting restorations, and organizing special temporary exhibitions. In 2006, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery, Inc. was established in Palm Beach, Florida as the United States ‚Äúsister‚Äù organization to the Amici degli Uffizi. Granted 501(c)(3) Tax Exempt Status, its sole purpose is to support the activities of the Amici by helping to fund ongoing restoration projects and to bring these projects to fruition. Led by Executive Board President Contessa Maria Vittoria Colonna Rimbotti, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery in conjunction with the Amici degli Uffizi raises funds to support all of these activities through an international group of members and patrons. More than 30 restoration projects designated as priorities by the museum have been completed over the last several years and include renowned paintings, altarpieces, sculptures and tapestries.  Mission  The mission of both organizations is to support the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, Italy, by raising awareness of the museum and its collections and by providing resources for acquisition, preservation, restoration and education. The mission of the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery is to support the Amici degli Uffizi in raising funds and resources for the acquisition, restoration, preservation and maintenance of the Uffizi Gallery's cultural heritage as prioritized by its Director, Antonio Natali. = Friends of the Uffizi Gallery Symbol = Created by Sergio Bianco, the symbol represents the view of the Uffizi from the Arno arcade. The sky seen under the archway forms the shape of a horse head in the typical posture of the knight chess piece. Representing loyalty and the right cause, the horse symbolizes the commitment of the Associations Amici degli Uffizi and Friends of the Uffizi Gallery to the benefit of the Uffizi Gallery.  Activities and special events  =Florentine weekend, Florence Italy= Every two years, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery organize the Florentine Weekend, which includes art-focused activities at the Uffizi Gallery and in nearby locations throughout the City of Florence that relate to both Renaissance art and Italian culture. It is a members-only event open to Friends of the Uffizi Gallery members at the Botticelli, Michelangelo and Leonardo membership levels.  Completed restoration projects  Michelangelo's Tondo Doni is the centerpiece of the new room reconstructed through funds from the Friends of Uffizi Gallery More than thirty restorations designated as a priority by the Uffizi Gallery have been completed with funds raised by both Friends of the Uffizi Gallery and Amici degli Uffizi. The Michelangelo Room, which opened to the public on January 29, 2013, is an example of a completed project by this organization. The Friends of the Uffizi Gallery and the Amici degli Uffizi funded the re-construction of this room on the second floor and the re- installation of the paintings. The re-construction involved restoring the original marble floor and re-plastering the walls and painting them red. The re-installation included Michelangelo‚Äôs Tondo Doni (ca. 1507 oil and tempera on panel) which is the only confirmed panel painting existing today in its original frame. Other early sixteenth-century Florentine painters represented in the room include Francesco Granacci, Fra Bartolomeo (Paolo di Jacopo del Fattorino detto Baccio della Porta), Andrea del Sarto, Franciabigio, Giuliano Bugiardini, and Alonso Berruguete. Laoco√∂n by Baccio Bandinelli (Firenze 1493-1560), depicts the Trojan priest Laoco√∂n and his two sons ensnared in the toils of the sea serpents sent by Poseidon. A previous restoration was done when the sculpture was broken into more than 40 pieces by a fire that caused a partial roof collapse at the Uffizi on August 12, 1762. The new restoration improved on the previous one plus removed layers of dust and wax that had built up over the decades and caused the sculpture‚Äôs surface to become dull and darkened. This restoration will protect the beauty and condition of this sculpture for many generations.  Individual restoration projects  These two projects are examples of restorations funded by a single Leonardo-level member of the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery. The restoration of this late 2nd Century A.D. replica of a 5th Century B.C. Greek sculpture of Asclepius, the god of medicine, made it possible to confirm the pertinence of the head to the body. In addition to strengthening the sculpture by replacing old putty, recent cleaning of the surface revealed details from an early 12th Century restoration such as the figure‚Äôs left hand holding a medicinal plant well known since the Middle Ages. This restoration was funded by the Lisa Marie Conte Browne Family. This mid-2nd Century A.D. statue of Aphrodite & Eros is a replica of the original Capitoline Venus, apart from the addition of the small funerary Eros. The sculpture‚Äôs head, arms and right leg were integrated in 1584. The sculpture is likely to have never been restored since then and the recent restoration included removing the dirt deposits and addressing the ancient integrations and fractures repairs. This restoration was funded by Thomas J. and Judith A. Embrescia.  Community restoration projects  With this type of project, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery accepts donations from all sources (including non-members) interested in conserving a selected work of art. The 2014 project is a statue of Aphrodite (2nd Century AD). She is the Greek goddess of love, known as Venus to the Romans. This sculpture is a standing semi-nude female figure created using the ancient Roman fragments of the torso and head. The arms aned richly-draped lower part were added by Alessandro Algardi, an artist hired by the Medici in the 17th Century to integrate the fragments into a single sculpture. This restoration project involved removing thick layers of accumulated dust and greatly increased documentary information. =Gallery of restoration projects= File:Laocoon- Uffizi.png|Laoco√∂n.

The school was established in August, 1930.  History  = Before establishment = In 1820, Ruan Yuan, Viceroy of Liangguang, established Xuehai Hall (; literally \\"Sea of studies\\") by borrowing Wenlan Academy in western Guangzhou (now Wenlan Lane, Xiajiu Road). In 1824, Ruan Yuan moved Xuehai Hall to a new school building at the foot of Yuexiu Hill. Under the efforts of Ruan Yuan, Xuehai Hall became the cultural and academic center of guangdong at that time. Since its establishment, Xuehai Hall has cultivated many talents at that time. In 1903, the hall was abolished and replaced by Ruan Taifu Temple to commemorate Ruan Yuan. The temple was abolished in 1911. In 1867, Jiang Yili, the grand coordinator and provincial governor of guangdong, and Fang Junyi advocated the establishment of Jupo School (), and hired Chen Feng as a senior. Jupo School cultivated many talents at that time, whose students had a certain influence on the local culture of Guangdong. In 1903, the school was closed and replaced by Chen's Temple. In 1869, Wang Kaitai, Governor of Guangdong, founded Yingyuan Academy () before Yingyuan Palace, which was designated for Juren, and became the highest institution of Guangzhou. After the fall of imperial examinations, the academy was no longer popular. In 1903, the academy was closed. In 1906, the Qing government announced the formal abolition of the imperial examination system, and the academy originally set up for the imperial examination lost its value. In 1908, Zhang Renjun, grand coordinator and provincial governor of guangdong, founded the Guangdong Ancient Academy (), which aimed to preserve the quintessence of Chinese culture, on the former sites of Yingyuan Academy and Jupo School. After Xinhai Revolution, in 1921, Zhixin High School was built in the old site of Xuehai Hall but later moved to its current campus in 1923. In 1929, Guangzhou No.1 High School moved here. = After establishment = \\"Guangzhou No.2 Middle School\\" was formally established in August 1930. The first principal was Xu Gantang (), a well-known educator. It first rented the chapel and private houses in Xiguan as temporary buildings until 1932, moved to a new campus in Penglai Road (now Guangzhou No.1 High School, ). In 1938, after the Canton Operation, the school was suspended. In September 1947, No.2 middle school reopened on the site of No.1 middle school in Yingyuan Road, with legislator Wang Xiaoying () as the principal. In November 1949, CPC military representative Lai Yihui took over the school. In 1956, it was rated as the key middle school of Guangzhou. In the early 1960s, the school was designated as the experimental school for education reform with a five-year system for middle schools. In January 1967, after the outbreak of the cultural revolution, mass organizations seized power and the school work was completely paralyzed. In the winter of 1969, a rural branch school was established on the barren hillside of Baishui Village in Shiling, Hua County (currently Huadu District). In the winter of 1974, the branch moved to Chen Dong reservoir. In March 1978, the revolutionary committee of the school was abolished. In August of the same year, the branch school was cancelled. In 1994, the school was awarded as the first class schools of Guangdong. In 2007, it passed the acceptance of National Demonstrative High School of Guangdong. In 2012, the school's English name was changed from Guangzhou No.2 Middle School to Guangzhou No.2 High School. Campuses The school has 2 campuses. =Yingyuan Road Campus= Yingyuan Campus Yingyuan Road Campus () was built in 1930 on the south slope of Yuexiu Hill, Yuexiu District and used to be the site of Xuehai Hall. The campus now is the main campus of the school and used to serve students from grade 7 to 9. =Science City Campus= Central Square of Science City Campus Suyuan Hill Science City Campus () was built in 2005 on Suyuan Hill in Guangzhou Science City, Huangpu District. It is renowned in Guangzhou for its environment and high-quality education. This is an accommodation campus and serves high school students from grade 10 to 12.  Education  Guangzhou No.2 High School is ranked top five among high schools in Guangzhou, Guangdong, both officially and unofficially.

A series of T-shirts and hoodies of \\"Yi-Zhong-Ren\\" were designed by alumni, which has achieved its prevalence both inside and outside of the school campuses. In March 2018, \\"Yi-Zhong-Ren\\" obtained a trademark registration license.  Extracurricular activities  = Music Creator Concert = The Music Creator Concert () activity held by the students' union and the Art Department in every November is unique, while competitors are required to perform an original song or a song whose lyric or melody was rewritten by the competitors. Until the end of 2018, the concert has been held for 28 sessions. In 2015, the concert was awarded the first prize of \\"Brand activities of Schools in Guangzhou\\" (). = Lantern Festival Charity Sale = The charity sale () held in Lantern Festival every year since 1997. It was organized by student union, and parts of the profit from sales and auction would be used for charity. There are also entertainment and firework shows during the sale.  Education Group  The Guangzhou No. 2 High School Education Group () was founded in Dec 2017. Besides the school itself, the education group has founded 2 private schools and hosted 4 public schools. In 2019, the whole group has 7,066 students and 166 classes. = Private schools = Yingyuan School The two private schools have been assessed for good performances, but in recent years, it has been disputed and even punished for illegal enrollment. * Yingyuan School (, grade 7 to 9): This school was opened in 2002, which replaced a 70-year-old public primary school.

As of 2019, the school is under construction, and students have to take classes in a nearby primary school.  Controversy  = Dispute of cellphone ban = In early 2010s, the school issued a policy called \\"no IC\\" that no electronic products in teaching areas (\\"I\\" for electronic devices like iPhone, iPad etc.; \\"C\\" for computer). But in the late 2017, the executives of grade 10 issued a joint policy that the use of cellphones would no longer be allowed in the school including resting areas. The ban was fiercely opposed by grade 10 students, as the allowance of cellphones was a long-held policy of the school that demonstrated the freedom and humanity valued by prior principals and executive teams. In fact, many classes required in-class use of cellphones to finish assignments, and many students used their smartphones to study efficiently in their spare time. The policy was also criticized for unequal and biased treatment of students of grade 10 because students from grade 11 and 12 were not subject to the ban and could continue to use their phones. Under pressure from students and parents, executives held an unofficial conference at the end of the semester to revoke the ban.

With original hospital construction financed by the Duke family, Lincoln served as the primary African American hospital in Durham until 1976, when it closed and transferred its inpatient services to Durham County General Hospital. Despite its cultural setting within the Jim Crow South, Lincoln Hospital developed and thrived due to a complex web of inter- and intraracial cooperation. Lincoln's medical staff sought to reduce morbidity and mortality of Durham blacks by targeting maternal and child health, infectious disease, and health behavior through health education programs, specialized clinics, and free medical care. Lincoln expanded educational opportunities for blacks through their nursing, residency, and surgery programs during a time where few opportunities existed for blacks in healthcare.  History  = Origins = African Americans experienced serious health disadvantages in 20th century Durham, North Carolina. Modern analyses have shown that inadequate housing, insufficient heat, poor ventilation, inadequate diet, and overwork contributed to multiple medical problems, including malnutrition and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, pneumonia, diphtheria, measles, and influenza. Rapid industrialization from the tobacco and textile industries increased the spread of diseases caused by particulate matter and caused strain on existing infrastructure. Excluding stillbirths, the death rate among Durham African Americans in 1910 was 26.0/1000 compared to 16.6/1000 for whites. Widespread belief that blacks were physically and mentally inferior to whites led to white apathy towards disparities in white and black morbidity and mortality. Separation of Durham's black and white communities allowed health disparities to flourish. While this segregation widened the socioeconomic and health gap between black and white communities, it also facilitated the development of a strong black business community and a black elite with the power to address these disparities. The rise of \\"Black Wall Street\\" (Parrish Street, Durham) and black businesses at the turn of the century, such as NC Mutual Life Insurance, brought success and credibility to select members of Durham's black community. Leaders of these organizations exhibited social dexterity in maintaining good relations between blacks and whites through these economic connections. Recognizing Durham's health disparities, black leaders garnered support for a black hospital from white philanthropists. Arguing that a black hospital would ultimately benefit whites and maintain segregation, Aaron McDuffie Moore, Stanford Lee Warren, and John Merrick persuaded the Duke family (Washington Duke) to fund Lincoln Hospital in lieu of building a monument on the campus of Trinity College (today Duke University) to commemorate slaves who had fought in the Confederate Army. Aaron McDuffie Moore (Durham's first black physician) reminded the Duke family that blacks worked with whites in small intimate spaces, and that high rates of disease in blacks would affect the health of whites. Ben and James Duke gave an original donation of $8,550 for the hospital's construction in Hatyi, a black neighborhood in Durham. The cornerstone read: > With grateful appreciation and loving remembrance of the fidelity and > faithfulness of the Negro slaves to the Mothers and Daughters of the > Confederacy during the Civil War, this institution was founded by one of the > Fathers and Sons: B.N. Duke, J.B. Duke, W. Duke. Not one act of disloyalty > was recorded against them. The Duke Family remained patrons of the hospital until its closure. = Financial and material support = Lincoln Hospital founders. Lincoln hospital's black leaders claimed the hospital was \\"a striking example of what can be accomplished in a community where both races work together.\\" However, in the beginning, whites generally kept a distance by confining their involvement to financial contribution. Eventually, this relationship evolved to include whites in the running of the hospital. For example, Dr. Max Schiebel, who worked at the hospital in 1944, joined the surgery department long before official integration of the medical staff in 1925. (see surgery) The hospital functioned with support from private institutions, black and white individuals, and the governments of Durham County and other surrounding counties. Community support was reflected in the hospital's leadership bodies, including the Lincoln Hospital Board of Trustees. Begun in 1921, the 21-member board was made up of one-third members selected from the white community, while the rest were appointed from African American leading institutions and families in Durham, as well as the local city and county governments. The Board also included a member of the Duke family, an appointee from NC Farmers and Mechanics Bank, and a representative from NC Mutual Life Insurance Company. Finally, a black woman, white man, and black man were elected from the community to serve on the Board. Black and white women in the Durham community were responsible for supplying linens, furnishings, and other supplies for the hospital and the nurses' home through community-wide donation drives. White clubwomen tracked the hospital's quality of care, supervised nursing students, and acted as liaisons between the institution and the white community. Lincoln Hospital's Lady Board of Managers acted as a female leadership body in the hospital, responsible for fundraising for the hospital and institutional improvements. Durham County also supplied funds to run the hospital. With community support, the hospital established a mission to provide care regardless of a patient's ability to pay. The amount of charity patients admitted to Lincoln was not confined to a certain quota. According to its 1938 report, two-thirds of Lincoln Hospitals 1,879 patients were charity cases. On move-in day for the new facility in 1925, 18 of the 85 patients admitted were from other towns where there were no healthcare facilities for blacks. Reflecting the broad-based community support of and corporate pride in the institution, Durham residents frequently referred to Lincoln as \\"our hospital.\\" = Facilities = Lincoln hospital, second, brick structure circa 1938. The original wood-frame hospital building, located at the corner of Cozart St. (Alley) and East Proctor St. and housing up to 50 patients, was damaged in a 1924 fire. Recruitment of additional funds initially meant to expand the original facilities allowed the immediate construction of a new building, which was completed in 1924 and opened on January 15, 1925. The Nurses Home was also added in 1924 as a gift from B.N. Duke in memory of his son, Angier B. Duke.  Medical services  Consonant with its primary mission of patient care, Lincoln Hospital provided access to some of the best black physicians on the East coast through its departments of medicine, gynecology and obstetrics, and surgery. The department of medicine at Lincoln Hospital provided general services for venereal disease prevention and treatment, emergency care, cancer, and routine adult medicine. Over the years, the medical departments adapted to the specialties of the attending physicians, and the needs of the public at large. = Radiology and laboratory services = Full-time doctors at Duke and Watts hospitals provided lab and radiology services for Lincoln, providing qualified supervision for these specialties without on-site expertise. A notable pioneer in this department was Margaret Kennedy Goodwin (head radiology technician, 1938-1976), the first female African American to be elected to membership in the American Registry of Radiology technicians. Goodwin also led a two-year training program for lab and radiology technicians that began in 1950. = Gynecology and obstetrics = Dr. Moore, Obstetrician-Gynecologist, examining a patient, undated. The hospital focused on increasing the number of hospital deliveries, developing maternal education programs, and maintaining birth follow-up programs to reduce maternal and infant mortality. At the time, infant mortality was very high: 411 deaths per 1000 live births among black children, excluding miscarriages and stillbirths, versus 137.5 per 1000 for whites in 1910 and many mothers died at home due to birth complications. Education about the risks of birth increased rates of hospital deliveries for black women in Durham. Prenatal care at Lincoln Hospital also included screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as syphilis. Mothers who tested positive were counseled and treated to prevent transmission of STIs to their babies at birth. = Pediatrics = Well Baby Clinic at Lincoln Hospital, circa 1938. In addition to STI screening at birth, Lincoln also worked to reduce child mortality through postnatal and childhood care in the Well Baby Clinic. Black mothers were encouraged to bring their children back for check-ups, to ensure that their babies were reaching growth and weight standards for their age. Proper diets and feeding schedules were also taught to the mother. All babies at the clinic were immunized. In 1963, the state calculated the rate of infection among African American children to be lower than the rate among white children in Durham. The pediatric department also later offered specialized programs such as the Crippled Children's Clinic‚Äîa joint effort between Lincoln and Duke Hospital's orthopedic departments. In 1937, the infant death rate for babies under one year of age in Durham County was reduced to 52.2 per 1000 live births among whites and 94.2 per 1000 among blacks. = Surgery = The Lincoln Hospital surgery department provided comprehensive surgical services to African Americans unavailable at nearby hospitals. While services were considered subpar in the early years of the hospital, Dr. Max Schiebel (Chief of surgery, 1944-1971) revitalized the program by raising standards and providing surgical expertise. Dr. Charles DeWitt Watts (1917 - 2004) served as Chief of Surgery during the 1950s and 1960s he began training Howard University residents in a joint program with Duke University Medical School, where -because Duke was segregated - residents would come through Duke but be trained at Lincoln.  Health education  Lincoln Hospital Medical Staff, 1965-1966. In the hospital's early years, a partnership with Leonard Medical School at Shaw University (the first four- year medical school for blacks in the U.S. and the first medical school in North Carolina) served as a pipeline to practice at Lincoln. Seven of the original Lincoln physicians were graduates of Leonard Medical School. The Leonard school closed in 1918, limiting local opportunities for black medical education and spurring Lincoln to establish its own training programs. Lincoln became a magnet for some of the most talented black physicians on the East coast. Partnerships with Duke, Watts, and other hospitals in North Carolina ensured a steady supply of residents for Lincoln's education programs. The Lincoln Nursing School (1901-1976) drew young African American women to its well-regarded program throughout the hospital's tenure. In 1934, the reorganization of Lincoln hospital and the acquisition of funds from the Julius Rosenwald Fund and the Duke Endowment led to the establishment of medical internship and residency programs. = Lincoln Hospital School of Nursing = Lincoln nursing students, undated. The Board of Trustees organized the Lincoln Hospital School of Nursing in 1903. The program was approved by the Board of Nurse Examiners of the State of North Carolina. Julia Latta was the first director of nursing from 1903-1910. The curriculum design included courses to be taken at North Carolina College in Durham, N.C, and formal affiliation with the college was established in 1930. The specialty areas of Pediatrics and Psychiatry were taught through affiliations with other hospitals including Meharry Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee and Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro, N.C. After the first year of training, nursing students worked alongside nursing graduate students to take care of patients, supplying essential, inexpensive, primary care. The Nursing School provided greater job and educational opportunities for young black women in Durham. The hospital maintained accreditation with the NC Board of Nurse Examiners until loss of patients compromised the school's clinical program in the 1960s. = Medical internships and residencies = Residents, 1938-1939 Lincoln Hospital was accredited by the American Medical Association for internship training in 1925 and by American College of Surgeons in 1933. Pediatric, orthopedic, internal medicine, surgery, and ob-gyn residents, primarily from Duke University medical school rotated through Lincoln from 1930 into the late 1960s. Medical and surgical staff of the hospital spent time teaching residents and interns on rounds in the wards. Many Lincoln students, both black and white, went on to achieve distinction in their field. = Continuing medical education = Beginning in the 1930s, Lincoln hospital became a popular place to host continuing medical education conferences due to the proximity of the N.C. College for Negroes dormitories, which provided a place for physicians to stay in a time when most blacks were barred from southern hotels. In 1935, Lincoln hosted its first postgraduate clinic, which became an annual event. The clinic drew black and white physicians from all over North and South Carolina and Virginia to join speakers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University.  Later years  Lincoln Community Health Center, undated. The hospital emerged from the Depression as one of the leading hospitals for blacks or whites in the Carolinas. However, by 1950, Durham residents recognized that both Lincoln and Watts hospitals were providing outmoded services. A joint proposal for Federal funding to expand both Lincoln and Watts Hospitals was submitted to the North Carolina Medical Care Commission in 1950. A local bond measure passed, providing money for construction of a new 33 bed wing, completed in 1953 and increasing Lincoln's bed total to 123. Like many black institutions, Lincoln Hospital declined after integration. By the 1960s, both Lincoln and Watts Hospitals were providing subpar medical services to Durham. In 1965, Lincoln hospital integrated its medical staff. While white and black medical staff continued to practice at the hospital, patients of both races were increasingly admitted to other hospitals. Charles DeWitt Watts founded Lincoln Community Health Center (LCHC) in 1971. The health center and hospital operated together in the Fayetteville St. facility until September 25, 1976, when inpatients were transferred to Durham County General Hospital. Today, the center offers a wide range of health services including adult medicine, pediatrics, dental, social work/mental health services, family care nursing, and community outreach. Prenatal and family planning services are available at the Center in cooperation with the Durham County Health Department. Building on the legacy of its predecessor institution, Lincoln Hospital, LCHC is dedicated to fulfilling its mission statement: \\"As a leader in the provision of community health care, Lincoln Community Health Center is committed to collaborating with other institutions dedicated to the continuous improvement in services being provided to decrease health disparities, while assuring access to all.\\"  References   Bibliography   * Defunct hospitals in North Carolina Historically black hospitals in the United States Hospitals established in 1901 Durham, North Carolina African-American history in Durham, North Carolina ","title":"Lincoln Hospital (Durham, North Carolina)"},{"id":"42493559","text":"Economic Outlook is a twice-yearly analysis (available for online viewing, download, and in print) published by the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) with economic analysis and forecasts for future economic performance of OECD countries.

The Harian Rakjat motto was \\"Untuk rakjat hanya ada satu harian, Harian Rakjat!\\" (For the people there is only one daily, Harian Rakjat!). Harian Rakyat was managed by Njoto as a member of the editorial board and Mula Naibaho as editor in chief. History =Early history= Harian Rakjat was first published on January 31, 1951, and was originally named Soeara Rakyat (People's Voice). In its heyday, Harian Rakjat was the most popular political newspaper ever published in Indonesia, with average circulation of 23,000 copies in the 1950s and 1960s.\\"Harian Rakjat: Di Bawah Pukulan dan Sabetan Palu Arit\\", Jurnal Nasional, Senin, 23 Jul 2007 The newspaper was sold at a retail and subscription price of Rp 0.60 and Rp 14.5 a month, respectively. =Bans and closure= With its confrontational style, Harian Rakjat always opposed other parties and the authorities. Because its message was considered to have violated the rules imposed by the government of the time, Harian Rakjat was occasionally banned. The first ban occurs lasted for 23 hours, between September 13, 1957 at 21.00 and September 14, 1957 at 20:00. Other newspapers, such as Indonesia Raya, Bintang Timur, Pemuda Merdeka, Djiwa Baru, Pedoman, Keng Po, and Java Bode, as well as three news agencies: Antara, PIA, and INPS were banned for the same time period. The ban was repeated on July 16, 1959 for a month because the paper published the PKI Central Committee statement of July 3, entitled \\"Evaluation after one year of the Working Cabinet does not guarantee the implementation of the 3 chapters program, so they should be retooled immediately\\". On August 2, 1959, a month after the ban, Harian Rakjat returned to print. On November 2, 1959, the newspaper was banned again by the War Authority (Penguasa Perang). This time, the reason was not so clear. This led to the Harian Rakjat circulation expansion led by PKI officials D.N. Aidit, M.H. Lukman, and other PKI activists, who directly took to the streets. On December 9, 1959, Harian Rakjat was banned again for a story about \\"Njoto's November 23 lecture in the SBKA building\\", which was published on November 24, 1959. The reason for banning was also not clear, giving rise to protests. Following pressure, Harian Rakjat was finally permitted, and published again on December 23, 1959 . On February 3, 1961 the newspaper was banned again by in Greater Jakarta. The reason for the ban was the welcome address from PKI chairman D.N. Aidit on the 10th anniversary of Harian Rakjat. In his address, Aidit raised the question of democracy and political freedom. According to the War Authority, this could disrupt political stability in Indonesia. After the events of the September 30 Movement in 1965, all dailies published in Jakarta were banned, except the military-owned Angkatan Bersendjata and Berita Yudha. On October 3, 1965, Harian Rakjat finally ceased publication. It was not only disbanded: all the PKI members and activists who supported the newspaper were hunted down, arrested, imprisoned, and even killed. The final words from the editor to its readers were, \\"Many-many thanks, all the readers!\\" Journalism style The style of journalism carried by Harian Rakjat was 'confrontation journalism' with the explosive language. It editorials were confrontational, leading to conflicts with other media. It always took a bold and offensive stance against its opponents. Its simple, agile, and forthright language style - in accordance with the teachings of Marxism and Leninism - was easily understood by the peasants and workers who were the basis of the PKI support. Harian Rakyat was seen as the defender of the Sukarno's Political Manifesto (Manipol). While the right-wing or conservative newspapers were not too concerned about the manifesto, Harian Rakjat became the manifesto's propaganda mouthpiece. It remained anti-imperialist, and considered the right-wing newspapers to have insulted Sukarno for not supporting the manifesto. Harian Rakjat took the stance that it would not publish any writing that was contrary to the ideas of the revolution.

He was the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Congo. He served as leader of the Congolese government as chairman of the College of Commissioners. He is often called \\"The Father of Independence\\" for the Congolese. He also served as Foreign Minister for three different tenures: 1960‚Äì1963, 1965‚Äì1969, and again in 1981.http://www.rulers.org/2014-04.html April 2014 Bomboko died from a long- illness in Brussels, Belgium, aged 85.  Early life  Justin-Marie Bomboko was born on 22 September 1928 in Boleke, Belgian Congo.  Government career  In June 1960 Patrice Lumumba was tasked with forming the Congo's first independent government. He weighed his options for the Minister of Foreign Affairs between Thomas Kanza, Andr√© Mandi, and Bomboko. Lumumba mistrusted Bomboko, whom the Belgians supported and with whom he had political differences. Kanza, who was well acquainted with Bomboko, suggested that he should receive charge of Foreign Affairs, because he was an elected deputy and had more political support. Lumumba eventually agreed to this proposal, but made Mandi Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs so he could monitor his activities. Bomboko and Kanza ended up being the only two ministers in the government with university degrees. The government was officially invested by Parliament on 24 June. On 29 June Bomboko and Lumumba signed the Treaty of Friendship, Assistance, and Co-operation with their Belgian counterparts. On 30 June, Independence Day, they together signed the accords officially conferring sovereignty upon the Congo. In the days immediately after independence Bomboko was mostly preoccupied with the establishment of his ministry. He was upset by the fact that most foreign contacts were made either through the entire government or through Lumumba, instead of directly through him. On 5 July the Force Publique garrisons of L√©opoldville and Thysville mutinied. The revolt spread the next morning to other towns across the Lower Congo. Several soldiers had been convinced that Lumumba had brought Soviet troops into the country to disarm the Force Publique. Angered by this, they stormed the hotel rooms of the Soviet delegation (which had been present for the independence celebrations). Upon hearing what had occurred, Lumumba directed Bomboko to assume responsibility of the security of all foreign delegations present in the Congo and ensure that the Soviets could safely depart. He also devoted much of his time to assisting European residents that wanted to escape the violence and leave the country. On 10 July Belgian troops staged a military intervention to protect their nationals and began occupying portions of the Congo. Later that morning Bomboko met with fleeing Belgians at N'djili Airport. While there he declared that the Belgian intervention had been made at his request, though this was most likely untrue and probably only said to ease tensions; no record of any such request has ever been found, and the Belgians never cited one when attempting to justify their intervention. An interpellation was subsequently levied against him by Parliament concerning his involvement in the matter. On 15 July he appeared before Parliament to reject accusations of personal \\"complicity\\" in regards to the Belgian intervention and to affirm his concurrence with the actions taken by Prime Minister Lumumba and President Joseph Kasa-Vubu to restore order. On 28 July he was made a member of a cabinet committee tasked with managing the government's relations with the United Nations.

They are typically made from a barrel that has been filled with High Explosives, along with shrapnel and/or oil. In Syria they are typically dropped from a helicopter. Due to the large amount of explosives that can be packed into a barrel the resulting detonation can be devastating. The Syrian military often dropped these bombs in civilian areas leading to multiple civilian deaths. The BBC reported that between January 2014 and May 2015, only 1% of those killed by barrel bombs were rebel fighters.

Starring Caio Blat and Daniel de Oliveira as Frei Tito and Betto respectively, it follows the Dominican friars' resistance against Brazilian military dictatorship. Plot In 1968, the Dominican friars of S√£o Paulo became part of the resistance against the military dictatorship in Brazil. Under the pseudonyms of \\"Tito\\", \\"Betto\\", \\"Oswaldo\\", \\"Fernando\\", and \\"Ivo\\", the friars join the A√ß√£o Libertadora Nacional, a communist guerrilla movement headed by Carlos Marighella. The friars' superior, Diogo, recommends them to be more careful, and they decide to disperse themselves. Ivo and Fernando go to Rio de Janeiro but are intercepted and tortured by officers who accuse them for betraying the Church and Brazil. The officers ask about the place where they receive calls from their leader, and eventually they reveal it. After intercepting a conversation, the police headed by S√©rgio Paranhos Fleury discover where Marighella will be and kill him. Meanwhile, Betto is captured in Rio Grande do Sul, and is arrested at the penitentiary Tiradentes in S√£o Paulo along with the other friars. The friars are later judged and sentenced to four years of imprisonment. Tito is the only who is released in exchange for the West German ambassador in Brazil, Ehrenfried von Holleben, being exiled in France. He is psychologically shaken by the fact that he was tortured, and also because his attempt of suicide during the torture sessions was labeled as a coward act by Fleury. In 1974, he commits suicide in √âveux.

The friars' imprisonment was filmed in Rio de Janeiro, while Tito's exile was shot in France. Differently from other films about the period, the director wanted the torture scenes to be not be merely illustrative. The scenes were reimagined, and Ratton said \\"or [I would] do something shocking, as is the story, or [I] would not do the film.\\" The friars Betto, Fernando, and Ivo did a lecture about the 1960s Brazil and student activism to the cast.

The human homolog is the Nkx2-5 gene. tinman is expressed in the precardiac mesoderm and is responsible for the differentiation, proliferation, and specification of cardiac progenitor cells. This gene is named after the character Tin Woodman who lacks a heart. Function and homologues Homeobox genes are a group of transcription factors characterized by a homeodomain that initiates gene expression which regulates cell differentiation and development when it binds to a target promoter. tinman was first isolated in Drosophila and many vertebrate homologs have been discovered since and are considered part of a multigene family in vertebrates. The human homolog is Nkx2-5. tinman is dependent upon the JAK- STAT signalling of the precardiac mesoderm to differentiate into a more confined growth pattern for development of visceral mesoderm and the heart. It contributes to the looping of the heart during fetal cardiac development, but has also been found to contribute to the regulation of the heart's electrical system postnatally.[4] Expression tinman is expressed very early in Drosophila during the development of the embryonic mesoderm and is required for formation of the visceral and cardiac mesoderm. It is expressed transiently in the visceral mesoderm but continues to be expressed in the cardiac mesoderm. The two major cell types of the Drosophila heart, cardial and pericardial cells, express tinman. Clinical significance In both Drosophila and vertebrates, the temporal and spatial expression of tinman is critical in determining cell lineage and patterning of the heart. In mutant or knockout organisms, the loss of tinman results in the lack of heart formation. In humans, mutations of Nkx2.5 result in some of the most common congenital heart defects. These include atrial and ventricular septal defects and tetralogy of Fallot. Abnormal placental expression of Nkx2.5 has been associated with some cases of severe, early onset preeclampsia.

Early life and family  Prince Prisdang was born in Bangkok, as Prince Prisdang Chumsai, a grandson of Rama III. He was educated in Singapore and in England, subsequently graduated with all the top awards from King's College London in 1876. The event was reported in The Times of London on 7 July that year.  Career in Diplomacy  In 1881 he established the first permanent Siamese Embassy in England presenting his credentials to Queen Victoria in 1882. Over the next five years he became ambassador to eleven European countries and the United States. King Rama V asked Prince Prisdang his opinion on how to deal with European countries hunting for new colonies. In response Prince Prisdang and his associates‚ÄîPrince Naresr, Prince Svasti and Prince Sonabundhit and officials at the Thai embassy‚Äîpenned a draft democratic constitution which stipulated that the monarchy be subject to constitutional law and that there be a cabinet. The proposal is known as the Ror Sor 103 proposal. (\\"Ror Sor 103\\" refers to the Rattanakosin calendar that began in 1782, the year King Rama I established Bangkok as the capital of Siam.) The petition's points, in short, are: No means diplomatic, militaristic, buffer-state dependent, or treaties reliant, would suffice to save the country from being colonized. And so it was \\"mandatory\\" for the country to reform itself internally, in addition to reforms that had already been instituted but so far not adequate. These additional reforms included: \\"the change from absolute to constitutional monarchy\\", the more \\"clearly defined\\" Law of succession of the reign, the \\"eradication of corruption in official circles\\", \\"freedom of the press\\", the establishment of \\"the law of equality\\" that would \\"guarantee equal justice for all\\", the institution of a \\"fair system of taxation\\", a \\"gradual phasing-in of universal suffrage\\", the administrative system based on merit and not birth- right.(Manich Jumsai 1977:254-257 as quoted in Anonymous, ‚ÄúThe Life and Time of Prince Prisdang‚Äù Accessed on 15.02.2018 at http://www.geocities.ws/RainForest/Vines/8769/Prisdang.htm.)

The petition stated ‚ÄúUnder its present form of government the country faces danger from without. A change towards a ‚Äòcivilized‚Äô form of government is necessary, viz., the adoption of the European system, such as is being undertaken by Japan. This change can be brought about only with the king‚Äôs concurrence. The danger is colonization by the European powers, who claim the right to bring civilization, justice, law and order to the oppressed, to open up trade and develop resources.\\"Sumet Jumsai. ‚ÄúPrince Prisdang and the Proposal for the First Siamese Constitution 1885‚Äù, Journal of the Siam Society Vol. 92 2004. King Chulalonkorn disapproved of the proposal, replying that Siam was not yet ready for such a radical change. He was mainly displeased because Prisdang involved others. Since the proposal was signed by almost the whole staff of the two legations in London and Paris, it was regarded as holding the king to ransom. Prisdang's suggestion for the abolishment of polygamy in another correspondence also displeased the King. The four princes were recalled to Bangkok, but Prisdang stayed on since he attended the Universal Postal Union meeting in Lisbon in 1884 and in Berlin in 1885, successfully obtaining UPU membership for Siam. The prince returned to Siam in 1886 and was appointed director-general of the Post and Telegraph Department in which post he remained until 1890. He also helped to set up Siriraj Hospital, organized the Siamese section for the Paris Exhibition of 1889, made a survey map of the coasts and rivers of Siam, and drew up the charter for the establishment of the Ministry of Public Works. Due to disappointment and accusations, he resigned from his post without permission from the King. While on a trip to Japan to establish diplomatic relations, he did not return to Thailand but instead went Malaysia where he worked under the British as a road engineer.Sumet Jumsai. ‚ÄúPrince Prisdang and the Proposal for the First Siamese Constitution 1885‚Äù, Journal of the Siam Society Vol. 92 2004.

His preceptor was the well known scholar monk Waska·∏çuwe ≈örƒ´ Subh≈´ti, whom Prisdang had already met in 1881 while on a visit to DipaduttamƒÅrƒÅma Temple in a suburb of Colombo, and with whom he had since then kept up a correspondence.by Indrajith, Saman ‚ÄúTemple that keeps Thai - Sri Lanka ties strong‚Äù, The Island, 16.08.2003.

Through Jinavarava·πÉsa's intercession, the Viceroy of India agreed to give the relics to King Chulalongkorn of Siam, who had them placed in Wat Saket in Bangkok. After Jinavarava·πÉsa returned to Sri Lanka from India, he accepted the invitation to become the abbot of DipaduttamƒÅrƒÅma Temple. Here he made a stupa resembling the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodhgaya wherein he enshrined the small jewels from the Piprahwa relic casket that he had been given by Mr. Pepp√©. He also lived for some time with the German Buddhist monk Nyanatiloka on a tiny island in a bay near Matara, which he called ‚ÄúCulla Lanka‚Äù (‚ÄúSmall Lanka‚Äù with a pun on King Chulalonkorn's name).Hecker, Hellmuth and Bhikkhu √ëƒÅ·πáatusita, The Life of ·πÑƒÅ·πáatiloka: The Biography of a Western Buddhist Pioneer, Buddhist Publication Society, Kandy 2008: 27.

These are the seven points for the proposed constitution: ‚ÄúThe proposed Constitution does not mean, at this stage, setting up a Parliament. But it will involve the following measures: * 1. Change must be made from an absolute to a constitutional monarchy. * 2. Defence and administration of the country should be in the hands of ministers who will together form a Cabinet, and a clearly formulated Law of Succession should be promulgated. * 3. All corruption is to be stamped out, and to ensure this, the salaries of government officials are to be made sufficient. * 4. Universal contentment is to be met by ensuring equality before the law, including the tax system. * 5. Outdated traditions are to be done away with, however time-honoured they may have become. * 6. Freedom of thought, freedom of speech and freedom of the press are to be guaranteed. * 7.

He was the eldest son of the ch≈´nagon Fujiwara no Tanetsugu of the Fujiwara Shikike. He reached the court rank of and sangi.  Life  When Nakanari's father Tanetsugu was assassinated in 785, Nakanari was granted the rank of despite his youth. In Emperor Kanmu's court, he held various regional positions, as well as positions in the imperial guard and Daij≈ç-kan. He was also promoted three times, culminating in the rank of in 801. In the court of Emperor Heizei, Nakanari's younger sister Kusuko was favored by the Emperor, and Nakanari too was valued and boasted political power. Despite this, his treacherous and arbitrary actions made him unpopular. He may also have been involved in the Prince Iyo Incident of 807, in which Heizei's younger brother Prince Iyo was accused of leading a conspiracy and ultimately committed suicide, and after which Nakanari was promoted into more important positions. In 809 he was appointed as of the Hokurikud≈ç, a position roughly equivalent to sangi, thus joining the ranks of the kugy≈ç. Later that year, Heizei abdicated the throne in favor of his younger brother Emperor Saga. Nakanari and Kusuko, fearing the loss of their political influence, moved with him to Heij≈ç-ky≈ç and schemed for him to retake the throne, encouraging him to create an opposing court to Saga's in what became known as the Kusuko Incident. In 810, with the elimination of the kansatsu-shi system, Nakanari was moved into the equivalent rank of sangi. However, when Heizei ordered the return of the capital to Heij≈ç-ky≈ç that autumn, relations between the two courts worsened even further, and a few days later Nakanari was captured by Saga's side. He was confined and demoted to provisional governor of Sado Province, and the next day was executed by the archery of and . Nakanari's execution is held to be the last carried out by the central Japanese court until the H≈çgen Rebellion of 1156. However, according to the scholar Masataka Uwayokote, because the method of execution used did not comply with the beheading or strangling options defined in the Y≈çr≈ç Code, and because it happened after Nakanari was officially demoted, this execution may have been a personal command by the Emperor rather than a formal execution under the Ritsury≈ç law.  Personality  According to the Nihon K≈çki, Nakanari was a man of strong desires, and some of his actions were taken under the influence of alcohol. He was heedless of his personal position among his relatives, and could not be dissuaded of anything. As his sister Kusuko's influence grew, he rode higher and higher on the wave of her power, causing deep affronts to the royalty and to virtuous men. For example, Nakanari's wife's aunt was extremely beautiful, and he approached her, but when she refused him, he tried to take her by force. The aunt escaped to the protection of , but Nakanari invaded the house where the Prince and his mother lived. Spouting abusive language, he tied her up and raped her. When Nakanari was killed, the general opinion was that he got what was coming to him.

It is the first and only art biennale in the world focused on the work of female artists. Founding and challenges The Biennial was first conceived by local women artists in Incheon; many were fine art teachers in public and private schools. They had aspired to have large exhibitions that would connect with the rest of the world since 1996. They had to fight, however, against the prejudices against women artists' gatherings. Local male artists mounted an anti-biennale in 2006. 2009 edition The 2009 edition featured works by American feminist artists Faith Ringgold and Judy Chicago as well as 99 other artists from 25 other countries. Organized by Dr. Eunhee Yang, along with curators Dr. Thalia Vrachopoulos and Sutthirat Supaparinya, the main exhibition \\"So Close Yet So Far Away\\" brought together artists from diverse countries whose works question and go beyond the cultural boundaries of given identities. Heng-Gil Han was the operating committee chairman and curator of the Tuning Exhibition of 2009 entitled \\"The 21st Century, the Feminine Century, and the Century of Diversity and Hope,\\" and the work exhibited encompassing a larger variety of media like multimedia, performances, film, writing, discussion, and animation, and included male-identifying artists. It included artwork by Eun Mi Choi, Disband, Coco Fusco, Donna Huanca, Akiko Ichikawa, Chang-jin Lee, Hyuk Kang, Bo Sub Kim, Se Won Kim, Lee Mingwei, Xaviera Simmons, Carolee Schneemann, and Lorna Simpson.Han, Heng-gil, ed., 2009 Incheon Women Artists' Biennale, Tuning (catalogue) The Participation Exhibition showed the work exclusively of Korean artists, and, like the main exhibition, the work only of women. Kyung-ae Kwon was the president of the biennale organizing committee, and Eunhee Yang the commissioner of the main exhibition. 2011 edition The main exhibition for the 2011 edition, entitled \\"Terra Incognita,\\" was curated by Jane Farver, former director of MIT's List Visual Arts Center. It included the art of Joan Jonas, LaToya Ruby Frazier, and Yael Bartana, and 25 other women from a total 13 countries. The Tuning Exhibition that year was co-curated by Han, Gyoung Mo Rhee, Kyoeng Sub Yue, and two others, and the work shown focussed on social practice art by artists regardless of gender. The Participation exhibition included the work of female artists active in women's artists organizations around the world and those who specifically contributed to the advancement of the Incheon Women Artists' Biennale. 2013 The organizing committee lost its momentum in 2013 as the political environment was unfriendly enough to secure funding from the government. That year's version was held at a smaller scale with Korean artists, which became its last.

During the 1980s, he befriended the Italian artist and philosopher Joseph Pace, founder in Paris of Filtranisme, a neo-existential philosophical and artistic current, joining, in 1990, the enlarged \\"filtranistes\\" group.Letizia Fanari E&A; Art: Joseph Pace Filtranisme, 2007, p. 24/25, Roma, Italia Due to a leak in the roof of his artist studio at Spring Street during a summer storm in the late 1990s, much of his work was destroyed; it is rare to find analog works before this period. He authenticates his works with a thumbprint. Duarte focuses his personal expression interpreting freely sacred and profane themes.

Note the dual track gauges. The Torne River Railway Bridge is a dual gauge railway bridge between Haparanda, Sweden and Tornio, Finland; the 1524mm rails used for Finland, the 1435mm rails used for Sweden. A temporary ice river track was built over the Torne River in 1917. The current bridge was opened in 1919 and was the first direct connection between the towns until the road bridge opened in 1939. It was jointly built by the governments of Sweden and Finland, and by the railway. Map showing the bridge and the railway marshalling yards. Sweden is at the left, Finland at the right. The bridge is painted white from the Finnish side to the international border, and is blue from there to the Swedish side. The dual gauge tracks continue over the bridge into railway marshalling yard in either country (a Swedish-gauge marshalling yard in Tornio, and a Finnish-gauge yard in Haparanda). Passenger trains also went over the bridge but have been withdrawn; the Norwegian Railways ended passenger traffic to the Swedish side gradually between 1984 and 1988 while the last SJ passenger train left Haparanda in 1992. A train between Boden, Sweden and Haparanda was tried in the early 2000s, but was stopped as it was unprofitable. As of 2014, Green Cargo is shunting in Tornio, usually once or twice a day on weekdays and Saturdays. VR will shunt in Haparanda, if necessary. Current cross-border traffic consists of containerized goods and freight from Outokumpu. Cross- border freight transport is expected to increase on the Swedish side with construction of the new railway line between Kalix and Haparanda.  Technical details  The bridge is 245m long, and was built as a swing bridge (although it was seldom-used as such) which rotated in the horizontal plane around the central pillar.

During its 200 year history, the place was held by the Spanish Empire, Kingdom of France, Habsburg Austria and the Dutch Republic. The existing defenses were improved in 1678 by the famous military engineer S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban. The fort was attacked by the Grand Alliance in 1695 during the Nine Years' War but the French garrison successfully held out. It was captured from the French by a ruse in 1712 during the War of the Spanish Succession. Control of the fort and other strong places in the Austrian Netherlands was a key feature of the so-called Barrier Treaty in 1713. The French captured the fort after a two-month siege in 1744 during the War of the Austrian Succession. Emperor Joseph II had the citadel demolished in 1781. The site is on the Yser River about southwest of Diksmuide, Belgium. Geography The site of Fort Knokke is at the confluence of the Yser River and the Ypres Canal (Ieperlee) in the municipality of Lo- Reninge. It is approximately northwest of Ypres. At the location, a draw bridge (Knokkebrug) spans the Yser a few meters below the junction of the two streams. The trace of the one-time fort can still be clearly seen on a satellite image. File:Reninge - IJzer - Ieperlee 1.jpg|The Ypres Canal flows into the Yser at the left. The view is from the bridge looking southwest. The wedge of land between the streams is the site of the citadel. File:Knokkebrug R02.jpg|The Knokkebrug carries east-west traffic across the Yser. The modern draw bridge is located at the northern limit of the former fort's defenses. History On this World War I era map, Fort de Knocke is shown at the confluence of the Yser and the Canal de Yser √† Ypres. Note its relationship to Dixmude, Furnes and Nieuport. =Early history= A fort was first erected at the site by the Spanish between 1584 and 1591 during the Eighty Years' War. The able Spanish general Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma had captured Ypres and Veurne (Furnes). The fort was intended to block raiding parties of Dutch rebels coming from the port of Ostend. The successful Siege of Ostend removed the Dutch threat in 1604 and the fort fell into disuse. Spain awoke to the location's strategic importance during the Franco-Spanish War. In 1649 a new fort was constructed in the fork between the Yser River and the Ypres Canal. France acquired the Castellany of Veurne-Ambacht by the Treaty of Aix-la- Chapelle in 1668. King Louis XIV of France wanted a double line of fortresses to protect the northern border of his kingdom. The fortifications expert S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban immediately noted the importance of its location and set to work redesigning Fort de la Knocque in 1678. The core of the fort was a triangular island on the south side of the streams' confluence. A hornwork and ravelin with brick parapets protected the southeast side. The fort was expanded between 1690 and 1692 with the addition of two bastions, one on the north side and one on the south. Ravelins were added on the east and west sides, while three lunettes completed the defenses. All the new works were constructed of earth. Sometime between 1692 and 1712 a wide moat was added on the east and west sides. =Clash in 1695= Fort de la Knocque was attacked by the Grand Alliance during the Nine Years' War. In June 1695, the army of King William III of England was encamped at Aarsele between Tielt and Deinze. After detaching 11 squadrons of cavalry to join Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria's forces at Ninove, the army moved south on 10 June to threaten the French lines. French commander Marshal Fran√ßois de Neufville, duc de Villeroi put his defenses on alert at Veurne, Fort de la Knocque, Ypres and Menen (Menin). On 19 June 1695 the Duke of W√ºrttemberg with 3,000 soldiers and supporting artillery advanced on Fort de la Knocque. A half-league from the fort was a French outpost on the Yser held by Count de la Mothe and over 400 dragoons. This post was attacked and, though reinforced, it was captured after a tenacious defense. At their newly seized bridgehead, the Allies built a temporary fort and armed it with two cannons. The French constructed a nearby counter-battery and numerous casualties were inflicted on both sides. The Allies tried to expand their bridgehead, but were thwarted by French counter- measures and cannonfire from Fort de la Knocque. After several days of skirmishing, the Allies withdrew on the night of 26-27 June. It is assumed that the move against Fort de la Knocque was a feint attack, intended to distract the French from the Siege of Namur which followed in July. Even if the Allies had managed to widen their small bridgehead, they had to advance through a marsh which it would have been simple for the French to defend. However, the author felt that it was a serious attack and not a feint, because the British and their Dutch allies were particularly interested in seizing places along the Flanders coast. =Capture in 1712= Touraine Regt. 1734 In 1712 when the War of the Spanish Succession was turning against Habsburg Austria, Prince Eugene of Savoy cast about for a way for his shaken troops to gain a success. He heard that the garrison of Fort de Knocque was weak and its security was lax. Eugene called for a partisan named La Rue, told him his plan to surprise the garrison and instructed him to call on the governor of Ostend to give him whatever help he needed. At the same time Eugene alerted Lieutenant General Robert Murray at Lille to hold some troops ready to assist in the coup. La Rue's free company and some troops from Ostend stealthily took position in gardens near the fort where they caught and killed two sentries. La Rue disguised several of his men as peasants with their loaded weapons concealed in a cart. Appearing before the fort, they called out that they wanted to sell their wares to the officers and were admitted. The first group of partisans seized the door to the fort. After that, it was easy for a second disguised group to burst into the fort to find most of the officers and men inside their barracks. A few men raised the alarm but they were rapidly subdued at sword and bayonet point. When Murray arrived, he found the garrison prisoners of war. The general put a Dutch garrison into the fort and returned to Lille. This source only provided Murray's first name and rank. By the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, France ceded control of Veurne-Ambacht to the Austrian Netherlands. By a unique arrangement, a line of fortresses in Austrian territory were handed over to the Dutch Republic to provide a barrier against future French invasions. From west to east, these were Veurne, Fort Knokke, Ypres, Menen, Tournai, Mons, Charleroi and Namur. =Siege of 1744= On 26 June 1744 during the War of the Austrian Succession the fort was assaulted by 18 picked French companies under the command of General Boufflers. Evidently the initial attack was a failure because on 28 June the French opened a siege trench on the west side of the fort. When they sapped close to the defenses, the French artillerists established one battery with four cannons and a second battery with four mortars. The fort capitulated to the French on 29 August 1744. The French employed units of the Piemont, Bourbonnais, Rohan, Royal, Touraine, Noailles, Orleans, La Couronne, Richecourt, Valenceau and du Roy Infantry Regiments. The cavalry contingent consisted of elements of the Egemont, La Suze and Mestre de Camp Cavalry Regiments and the Royal and Egemont Dragoons. The map depicting the siege called the fort La Kenoque. The central citadel within the junction of the streams is clearly visible. It is separated from the southern ramparts by a moat, making the citadel an island. There is a bastion on the west bank and another on the east bank. Both are covered by outworks. =Demolition= Fort de la Knocque was described as being located at the confluence of the Yser and Ieperlee at a distance of 1.5 leagues from Diksmuide, 3 leagues from Ypres and 4 leagues from both Veurne and Nieuwpoort (Nieuport). The fort was 750 by 500 feet (pieds) in extent and entry to the fort was through a narrow door. There were only a few casernes for the soldiers to live in, though the fort's commander had his own house and there was a chapel. After the mid-1700s, the fortifications lost much of their purpose. In 1781 Emperor Joseph II ordered Fort Knokke to be \\"slighted\\" or dismantled. The fort south of the junction of the Yser and Ypres Canal with its brick parapet was completely removed. The remainder of the raised defenses remain partly preserved amid modern pastureland.

The Zags started off WCC Tournament play with a 78‚Äì77 win over St. Mary's on a game winning shot by Zykera Rice at the buzzer and losing Laura Stockton and Jill Townsend to injuries in the game. The Zags lost the championship game to the BYU Cougars 82‚Äì68. However, the Zags received an at-large bid in the Albany, New York region, where they were selected as the #5 seed and played against Arkansas-Little Rock in the first round. This marked the eleventh NCAA tournament appearance for the Zags and the fourth under Fortier. The Zags defeated the Arkansas- Little Rock Trojans 68‚Äì51 on March 23 at Gill Coliseum in Corvallis, Oregon. It was their first NCAA tournament victory since the 2014‚Äì15 season. The Zags faced the Oregon State Beavers in the 2nd round and their season ended with a 76‚Äì70 loss to the Beavers to finish the season with a 29‚Äì5 record. =USA Basketball assistant coach= In May 2019, Fortier was named one of the four assistant coaches for 2019 USA Basketball Junior National Team trials. 2019‚Äì2020 season The Zags finished non-conference for the second year in a row with a 11‚Äì1 record, including winning the Gulf Coast Showcase tournament Thanksgiving weekend, and defeating #20 Missouri State on December 20. The lone loss came on November 17 at then #3 Stanford in overtime. The Zags finished conference play with a 17‚Äì1 record, with the lone loss coming on February 8 at Saint Mary's, ending the Zags 21-games win streak, which was the longest in NCAA women's basketball at the time. The Zags clinched their 15th regular season WCC title and the fifth under Fortier. The 28‚Äì2 record is the best start in Gonzaga women's basketball history. The Zags lost to the Portland Pilots 70‚Äì69 on March 9 in the semifinals of the WCC tournament at the Orleans Arena in Las Vegas after leading 29-9 towards the end of the first quarter. On March 12, it was announced that the Lady Zags basketball season abruptly comes to an end, due to the coronavirus issue and the cancellation of postseason play, including NCAA basketball tournaments. The Lady Zags finished the season with a 28‚Äì3 record. Personal life Fortier is married to Craig Fortier, whom she met when they both attended Placer High School and Cal State Monterey Bay.

The lure of salt profits led to technological innovation and new ways to organize capital. Debate over government salt policies brought forth conflicting attitudes toward the nature of government, private wealth, the relation between the rich and the poor, while the administration of these salt policies was a practical test of a government's competence. Because salt is often considered a necessity of life, the tax on it (often called the salt gabelle) had a broad base and could be set at a low rate and still be one of the most important sources of government revenue. In early times, governments gathered salt revenues by managing production and sales directly. After innovations in the mid-8th century, imperial bureaucracies reaped these revenues safely and indirectly by selling salt rights to merchants who then sold the salt in retail markets. Private salt trafficking persisted because monopoly salt was more expensive and of lower quality, while local bandits and rebel leaders thrived on salt smuggling. Over time, however, this basic system of bureaucratic oversight and private management yielded revenue second only to the land tax, and, with considerable regional variation and periodic reworking, remained in place until the mid-20th century. Salt also played a role in Chinese society and culture. Salt is one of the \\"seven necessities of life\\" mentioned in proverbs and \\"salty\\" is one of the \\"five flavors\\" which form the cosmological basis of Chinese cuisine. Song Yingxing, author of the 17th century treatise, The Exploitation of the Works of Nature explained the essential role of salt: ::as there are five phenomena in weather, so are there in the world five tastes‚Ä¶ A man would not be unwell if he abstained for an entire year from either the sweet or sour or bitter or hot; but deprive him of salt for a fortnight, and he will be too weak to tie up a chicken‚Ä¶Yingxing Song, translated and introduced by E. Tu Zen Sun and Shiou-Chuan Sun. T'ien-Kung K'ai-Wu; Chinese Technology in the Seventeenth Century. (University Park: Pennsylvania State University, 1966). Reprinted: New York: Dover, 1997. Ch Five, \\"Salt,\\" pp. 109-113 Types and geographical distribution Aquaculture and Salt Production Bohai Bay (Seen from space 1979) Traditional Chinese writers and modern scholars agree that there are at least five types of salt found in different regions of what is now China: * Sea salt (): The most important source. In earliest times, coastal and island salterns used earthen and then iron boiling pans to reduce sea water to salt. By the 3rd century BCE, workers filtered sea water through flat beds of ashes or sand into pits to produce a brine which could be boiled or evaporated by the sun. By the Ming dynasty, salterns in the salt marshes of northern Jiangsu and the eastern seaboard at Changlu, Bohai Bay, near present-day Tianjin, became the largest salt producers and by the late 19th century supplied some 80% of China's salt. Over the course of the 20th century, industrial evaporators replaced these coastal salterns.Endymion Wilkinson, Chinese History: A New Manual (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Asia Center, 2012), p. 447 * Well salt (; j«êngy√°n): produced primarily in Sichuan, most famously at Zigong, but also to some extent in Yunnan. Deep borehole drilling technology tapped subterranean salt pools, sometimes to the depth of half a mile, which also produced the natural gas used to boil it.Joseph Needham, Colin Ronan, ‚ÄúSalt industry and deep borehole drilling,‚Äù in Brian Hook and Denis Twitchett, eds., The Cambridge Encyclopedia of China. (Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press, 2nd ed., 1991; ), pp. 446-447. However, even by the end of the 19th century, Sichuan produced only 8% of China's salt. * Lake salt (; ch√≠y√°n): produced from salt water lakes in Western China and Central Asia using the same evaporative techniques as for sea water.Tora Yoshida, translated and revised by Hans Ulrich Vogel, Salt Production Techniques in Ancient China: The Aobo Tu (Leiden; New York: E.J. Brill, 1993)p. 4 * Earth salt (; t«îy√°n): found in sand from the dried beds of ancient inland seas in Western areas and extracted by rinsing it to produce brine. * Rock salt (; y√°ny√°n): found in caves in Shaanxi and Gansu. Song Yingxing, the Ming dynasty technology writer, explains that in the prefectures where there is no sea salt or salt wells, people find ‚Äúrocky caves which produce salt by themselves, its color being like that of red earth. People can freely obtain it by scraping it off without refining it.‚Äù Ancient China and the early empire thumb|left|200px|Salt evaporation pans, Yangpu Ancient Salt Field, Hainan Island As in other ancient centers of civilization, when agriculture replaced hunting, farmers, who ate little meat, needed salt for themselves and for their draft animals. More than a dozen sites on the southwest coast of the Bohai Bay show that the Dawenkou culture was already producing salt from underground brine more than 6,000 years ago during the Neolithic.Li Liu and Xingcan Chen, The Archaeology of China: From the Late Paleolithic to the Early Bronze Age (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012, ), pp. 217‚Äì218. In the same region, the late Shang dynasty (ca. 1600‚Äì1046) produced salt on a large scale and moved it inland in \\"helmet shaped-vessels\\" (kuixingqi ÁõîÂΩ¢Âô®). These pottery jars may have served as \\"standard units of measurement in the trade and distribution of salt\\".Liu and Chen, The Archaeology of China, p. 364. Oracle bones mention \\"petty officers for salt\\" (lu xiaochen ÈπµÂ∞èËá£), suggesting that the Shang had officials who oversaw salt production and provisioning.Liu and Chen, The Archaeology of China, pp. 364‚Äì365. The earliest surviving record of salt production in what is now China is a text from roughly 800 BCE which reports that the much earlier (and perhaps mythical) Xia dynasty reduced sea water for salt. There are reliable reports of the use of iron salt pans in the 5th century BCE.Elise Hoi, \\"Salt of the Early Civilizations: Case Studies on China,\\" Penn History Review 18.2 (Spring 2011): 69-99. Early states often located their capital cities near ready sources of salt, a consideration which also affected locations in later times. Li Bing, Qin dynasty engineer In the 3rd century BCE, Li Bing, an official of the expansionist and innovative Qin dynasty, in addition to organizing the Sichuan basin water control system at Dujiangyan, discovered that the salt pools which had been used for many centuries were actually fed from deep under the ground, the remnants of an ancient inland sea. He ordered first that the pools be made deeper, then that wells be dug, and eventually that narrower and more efficient shafts be sunk. By the end of the 2nd century CE, workers had devised a system of leather valves and bamboo pipes which drew up both brine and natural gas, which they burned to boil the brine (the technology they developed for the bamboo piping was eventually applied to household plumbing).Kurlansky Salt p. 20-27. Before the Qin's wars of unification in 221 BCE, salt was produced and traded widely and presented as tribute to the courts of the regional states. The Guanzi, a Han dynasty compilation of texts attributed to the 4th century BCE, includes a perhaps apocryphal discussion between the philosopher Guan Zhong and Duke Huan of the State of Qi on a proposed salt monopoly. The dialogue raised both practical questions about the effectiveness of taxes and moral questions about the nature of government. Guan Zhong argued that direct taxes created resentment among the people, but extolled indirect taxes, such as those on salt and iron: :If you were going to issue an order, \\"I am going to collect head money upon all of you people, both adults and children,\\" they would certainly remonstrate loudly and angrily against you. However, if you take firm control over the policy on salt, the people cannot manage to dodge it even though you are going to take a profit of one hundred times over.‚ÄùCh 72 ‚ÄúOn Monopolizing the Salt and Iron Industry,‚Äù Translated by Jiangyue Zhai The New Legalist The draconian Qin dynasty, which unified the empire, and the succeeding Han dynasty still left salt production and distribution to merchants and local rulers. However, their profits rivaled the central government's own treasury in size and also took salt workers off the tax rolls. The central government took notice. In 119 BCE, Emperor Wu of Han cast about for ways to finance his expansionist policies, and at the urging of his Legalist advisors, decreed salt and iron to be state monopolies. Fifty or so foundries were established, each using hundreds or even thousands of convict or conscript laborers.Valerie Hansen, The Open Empire: A History of China to 1600. (New York: Norton, 2000; ), p. 50 After Emperor Wu's death, his successor convened a court debate in 81 BCE, called the ‚ÄúDiscourses on Salt and Iron.‚Äù These debates again revealed a sharp disagreement over the purpose of government.Kuan Huan, Translated by E. M. Gale. Discourses on Salt and Iron: A Debate on State Control of Commerce and Industry in Ancient China, Chapters I-XIX. (Leyden: E. J. Brill, 1931). Available online at Discourses on Salt and Iron The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities The Legalists, or (perhaps more accurately) the Reformists, argued that the state rather than private merchants should organize trade and realize the profits. Confucian moralists replied that a minimalist government was best and argued that for the state to make a profit was to steal from the people and to undermine morality: ‚Äútrade promotes dishonesty.‚Äù The Legalists won the debate; salt provided a major part of government revenue for the remainder of Han rule. After the fall of the Han in the 2nd century CE, weak successor states could not enforce the monopoly reliably and the Sui and early Tang dynasties relied instead on land taxes. Official supervision, merchant transportation in the Tang and Song dynasties In the 6th and 7th centuries, the Tang government attempted to control markets and the economy directly, but after a period of success, the expense of suppressing the Anshi Rebellion in the 750s drained the treasury at just the time as the government's loss of local control made it difficult to collect the land tax and other direct taxes. Officials looked for ways to raise revenues which did not depend on direct control of production and retail sales. Chancellor Liu Yan had already proved his worth by using impressed labor to dredge the long silted-over canal connecting the Huai and Yellow rivers; this project lowered transport costs, relieved food shortages, and increased tax revenues with little government investment. The Huai river ran through Northern Jiangsu, the location of coastal salt marshes which were the major source of salt. Liu realized that if the government could control these areas, it could sell the salt at a monopoly price to merchants, who would pass the price difference on to their customers. This monopoly price was an indirect tax which was reliably collected in advance without having to control the areas where the salt was consumed. Liu created a Salt and Iron Commission whose revenues were particularly important since the central government had lost control of the provinces. Even better, the revenue originated in the south, where it could be safely used to buy grain to ship to the capital, Chang'an, by river and canal. In the last century of Tang rule, salt provided more than half of the government's annual revenue and prolonged its life, for a government which managed to control the salt production areas, the canal, and the capital was hard to dislodge. The basic principles of \\"official supervision, merchant transportation\\" established at this time lasted fundamentally unchanged until the 20th century.Samuel Adrian M. Adshead. T'ang China: The Rise of the East in World History. (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004; ), p. 50. The high price of salt enforced by the monopoly, however, also created an opening for local bandits and rebels who could finance their activities by smuggling salt. Huang Chao, for instance, the late Tang rebel, was a failed exam candidate who became a salt merchant.Ebrey, Patricia, et al. East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History to 1800 (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2009) p. 91. In the Song dynasty, the 11th century minister Wang Anshi used state policies to expand the rural economy with crop loans and to reduce social inequality by bringing farmers into the commercial economy. In order to finance these goals, Wang relied on methods like expanding the state's monopoly on salt. Wang's allies had his rival, the poet and official Su Shi (1036-1101), arrested for \\"defaming the emperor.\\" Su confessed to having written this poem: :An old man of seventy, sickle at his waist, :Feels guilty the spring mountain bamboo and bracken are sweet. :It's not that the music of Shao has made him lose his sense of taste, :But just that he's eaten his food for three months without salt. The poet admitted that to write of an old man who had no salt was to point to the harshness of the imperial salt monopoly.Patricia Buckley Ebrey, Anne Walthall and James B. Palais. East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History (Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin, 2006; ), pp. 163-164. The poem quoted is translated by Charles Hartman. The profitable monopoly again survived criticism and was refined for new uses. In the salt marshes of the Huai valley, some 280,000 families worked for the state and were required to sell fixed quotas of salt at low prices. Workers who were forced into debt fled or joined the army. pp. 102-103. Merchants who helped to provision troops on the frontier were compensated with certificates which entitled them to buy salt and sell it in areas where they were given exclusive rights.Cecilia Lee-Fang Chien. Salt and State: An Annotated Translation of the Songshi Salt Monopoly Treatise. (Ann Arbor: Center for Chinese Studies the University of Michigan, 2004; ). Yet the benefit to the central government was limited by regional administrators who intercepted salt revenues for their own purposes.Edmund H Worthy, Regional Control in the Southern Sung Salt Administration. in J. W. Haeger, (ed.), Crisis and Prosperity in Sung China (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1975). The Liao dynasty, a Central Asian neighbor of the Song which adopted many Chinese institutions, had a Salt Monopoly Office which supervised salt production and distribution, though it is not clear how effective it was.Karl August Wittfogel, Feng Jiasheng, tr. History of Chinese Society: Liao, 907-1125. (Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1949), pp. 144-146. Early modern technology Increased population, especially in cities, created demand for salt. A combination of government officials and merchant entrepreneurs eagerly invented and deployed new technologies and new ways of organizing salt production, distribution, and taxation. Each type of salt and place of production had a slightly different story. Salt wells were found primarily in what is now Sichuan, but it was not until the Song dynasty that advances in technology brought increases in production and created tax revenues of consequence (the combination of gas and brine had been exploited from early times, but did not reach volumes useful for transporting any distance for sale until even later, in the 19th century).Madeleine Zelin. The Merchants of Zigong: Industrial Entrepreneurship in Early Modern China. (New York: Columbia University Press, 2005). p. 19 The poet and official Su Shi who criticized the salt monopoly also described the salt wells in Sichuan: :A round drilling edge is used, being the size of a drinking bowl, while the depth of the borehole amounts to several tens of zhang. Large bamboo stems are used with the septa removed and fitted together by male-female joints to form the well, thus keeping the fresh water out so that the salty spring water comes up by itself. Smaller bamboo tubes are also used which travel up and down in the wells as buckets. They have no bottom, but an orifice is mounted at the top. A piece of leather of several inches in size is hung up. As the tubes go in and out of the brine, the air pushes and sucks, closing and opening the leather valve. Each tube brings up several dou of brine‚Ä¶ Where profit is to be had, people do not fail to know about it.Yoshida Aobo Tu p. 15 Raising brine from the bottom of a salt well (Sichuan) Marco Polo visited salt areas in the 13th century Yuan dynasty. His detailed and accurate descriptions of salt production confirm that he had actually been in China.Some scholars have suggested that Polo's knowledge was so detailed that he must have been the imperial official in charge of the Yangzhou salt works, but this suggestion has not been accepted. Leonardo Olschki, Marco Polo's Asia: an Introduction to His \\"Description of the World\\" Called \\"Il Milione.\\". (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1960), p. 174. Marco described salt wells and hills where salt could be mined, probably in Yunnan, and reported that in the mountains ‚Äúthese rascals ‚Ä¶ have none of the Great Khan's paper money, but use salt instead‚Ä¶. They have salt which they boil and set in a mold‚Ä¶. ‚Äù (The use of salt for currency continued into at least the 19th century.)Vogel, Marco Polo Was in China, pp. 290, 301-310. As an official of the Mongol empire, however, Polo was more impressed by salt as a source of government revenue than by technology.Hans Ulrich Vogel. Marco Polo Was in China: New Evidence from Currencies, Salts and Revenues. (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2013; ), pp. 273-275. The Venetian traveler described the Changlu salt region in present-day Hebei province in terms which probably come from direct observation: :Men take a sort of earth which is very saline, and of this they make great mounds. Over these they pour a lot of water so that it trickles through it and becomes briny‚Ä¶ Then they collect the water by means of pipes and put it in great vats and iron cauldrons not more than four fingers deep and boil it thoroughly. The salt produced is very pure and fine grained‚Ä¶. [It] is a great source of wealth to the inhabitants and of revenue to the Great Khan.Vogel, Marco Polo Was in China, p. 333, quoted from Marco Polo: The Travels, translated by Ronald Latham (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1958), p. 167. Polo did not entirely understand what he saw, however. As explained in the Aobo Tu, workers actually sprinkled sea water on the fields which then filtered through sand or fine ash into pits, or perhaps he could have seen ‚Äúearth salt‚Äù derived from soil.Vogel, Marco Polo Was in China, p. 334-335. Complication and frustration in the Ming dynasty Beginning almost immediately after the founding of the dynasty in 1368, the Ming government found it hard to supply its armies in Central Asia. Officials granted merchants who delivered grain to the frontier garrisons the right to buy salt certificates (ÈπΩÂºï y√°ny«ên) which entitled them to buy government salt at monopoly prices which they could then sell in protected markets. One scholar has called this salt-grain exchange a ‚Äúunique combination of state monopoly and market initiative, bridging state and market.‚Äù The merchants, however, soon circumvented the system by selling the certificates to others rather than undertaking risky expeditions to deliver the salt, leading to hoarding and speculation.Wing-Kin Puk, \\"The Ming Salt Certificate: A Public Debt System in Sixteenth-Century China?,\\" Ming Studies 2010.61 (2010): 1-12. Q at p. 3, 8. Èπµ) (Rock Salt; Salt on Land)Lin Yutang. Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage (Hong Kong: Chinese University Press, 1972), p. 325C. The system of government production and merchant distribution required a strong and adaptive bureaucracy. To begin with, the Ming government inherited from the Mongols not a unified national system but a dozen or more regional monopolies, each of which had a different production center, none of which was allowed to distribute salt to the others. Officials tried to control production by continuing the Yuan system of registering hereditary salt producing households (Á´àÊà∂ z√†oh√π). These families were not allowed to change their occupation or where they lived and were required to produce a yearly quota of salt (in the beginning, a little more than 3,000 catties). Initially, the government paid these saltern families with rice, then in the 15th century in paper money. By the 16th century the system broke down. Government monopoly salt was too expensive to compete with smuggled blackmarket salt, forcing officials to raise prices in order to meet their tax revenue quotas, making the government salt even less competitive and giving saltern families even more reason to sell to smugglers. Officials estimated that two-thirds of the salt in the Lianghuai region was contraband. A series of crises followed in which inland prices dropped too low for merchants to make a profit, armies on the frontier went without grain, and small mountains of salt might sit unused because officials impounded them for taxes then could not sell them.Ray Huang, \\"Ming Fiscal Administration,\\" in Denis Twitchett and Frederick W Mote, eds., The Cambridge History of China Volume 8 The Ming Dynasty, 1368-1644 Part 2 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), pp. 139-144. = Salt Producers in Ming = Salt production during China‚Äôs Ming period mainly took place in China‚Äôs coastal regions and salt lakes . Although there were different techniques to obtain salt, boiling seawater and evaporating seawater under the sun were the two popular methods of isolating salt. Both techniques of salt production required dry and sunny weather. During Ming times, boiling seawater was the most prevailing technique. Salt producers laid down reeds and straws to absorb and concentrate seawater and then boiled to isolate the salt grains. The technique was of sunshine exposure occasionally used in Fujian and was not commonly applied nationally until the late Ming period. Saltern households were generally called yan hu(ÁõêÊà∑), and specifically, those who boiled seawater were called zao hu(ÁÅ∂Êà∑). Other techniques were applied in inland regions of China. In Yunnan, salt was obtained through the mining of saline rocks. In Shanxi and Shaanxi, salt was gathered in the summer when the salt lake dried up. And in Sichuan, brine wells were dug and then the brine was boiled. Household that boiled brine also had to obtain fuel, in the form of natural gas or burning firewood and straw, in order to heat up their furnaces. The majority of salt producers in Ming times consisted of young men from saltern households, who were assigned by the government, although some prisoners were also forced to produce salt as part of their sentence until they had served their prison terms. Salt production was passed on generationally within their households. The households would be registered under a regional distribution center, where they would receive a quota on the quantity of salt produced. Families that produced salt through boiling brine could receive tools from the state if they did not have that capital. In early Ming, salt producers would congregate under the supervision of salt patrols and boil the seawater in an officially provided iron plate. The government believed that this congregational salt production allowed the officials to conveniently control the amount of fuel, iron plates, and salt produced so that they were able to prevent the trade of contraband salt. However, in reality, salt producers would collude with salt patrols to gain profit from contraband salt. After Jiajing‚Äôs reign (1522-1566), the salt ministry became financially unable to provide iron plates due to the great cost of manufacture and replacement. As a result, the government reluctantly permitted merchants to provide cauldrons to the producers, although it was argued that cauldrons were the reason for contraband salt. The congregational salt production in turn collapsed into individual saltern household production. The methods of payment from the government differed throughout the Ming period, but included grain, money, subsidies, and decreased or voided land tax. In the 16th century, salt producers were able to sell over-quota salt directly to licensed salt merchants who purchased a fixed amount of salt from the imperial government first. Before the government held an absolute monopoly of salt industry and would not legitimate salt producers' direct transaction to the merchants, until it encountered a serious financial shortage of salt manufacture. Salt merchants, however, were only licensed to purchase a limited amount of salt, and they had to pay the tax to the government for exceeded amount. Towards the end of the Ming period, selling the non-quota salt became the main income source for salt producing families. Some salt producers became wealthier and purchased other saltern households, while providing them with the tools and capital to do their work. These wealthier producers could then benefit from the low land tax given by the government and could further rent out the extra farmland as another source of income. Those that kept salt producers under them could meet the salt quota, and therefore avoided the corvee work that the government asked of salt producers. Throughout the Ming dynasty, the number of salt producers had suffered a great decline, and one of the reasons is the corvee labor that salt producers had to take on. In Ming times, the corvee assigned to salt producers included being enlisted as soldiers in the local army and navy, as servants for local government, or as criminal patrolmen, etc. The extra agricultural work contributed the most burden to salt producers, as they had to plant and harvest as intensively as a farming household, while collecting and drying salt. Although in 1384, the government had already exempted the salt-producing households from extra work, this policy was not effectively enforced throughout the country, because salt producers were administered by both the salt ministry, who collected salt from them, and the local government, who collected the crops. This led to a large number of salt producers fleeing from their occupation, which caused a huge loss in the national salt industry and economy. =The moral debate over salt and society= Writers turned to poetry and fiction to continue a debate which had been started centuries earlier by Guanzi and the Han dynasty Discourses on Salt and Iron: practical men argued that monopoly revenues helped the state to carry out its mission while Confucian critics argued that government monopolies made some groups rich and left others poor and exploited, and that salt taxes afflicted the people and encouraged expansionary wars which would doom the empire. Each side claimed the moral high ground.Ming Wan, \\"Discourses on Salt and Iron: A First Century B.C. Chinese Debate over the Political Economy of Empire,\\" Journal of Chinese Political Science 17.2 (2012): 143-163. Bai Juyi's Tang dynasty poem, ‚ÄúThe Salt Merchant‚Äôs Wife‚Äù (c. 808), commented on the luxurious life of the salt merchant's wife whose boat took her from place to place: :The salt merchant‚Äôs wife has gold and silver in plenty, :Yet she does not work in the fields or tend silkworms. :Wherever she goes, north, south, east, or west, she never leaves her home. :Wind and waves are her village, her ship her mansion.Mark Edward Lewis. China's Cosmopolitan Empire : The Tang Dynasty. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2009). p. 25 A 13th century Yuan dynasty poem describes the quite different conditions among the hereditary \\"boiling households\\" (saltern households): :The boiling households‚Äô distress is growing day by day :The village jails are constantly in disorder :The wretched clothes are too short to cover the shins :and sometimes there is no rice in the broken steaming pot. :Towards the end of the year no brine can be produced, :and many are put in shackles and flogged to death. :Where will there be parents [i.e. virtuous officials] for the people?Yoshida, Aobo Tu p. 46. Hereditary salt merchants in the city of Yangzhou became the symbol of wealth. One merchant commissioned a chamber-pot made of gold which was so tall that he had to climb a ladder to use it. These families maintained their positions for generations by emphasizing education for their sons and steady payments to government officials.Ping-Ti Ho, \\"The Salt Merchants of Yang-Chou: A Study of Commercial Capitalism in Eighteenth-Century China,\\" Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies 17.1/2 (1954): 130-168. The foundation of this luxurious life-style was the exploitative monopoly prices charged by the village retailers whose wealth put them above the law. The late Ming and early Qing writer, Pu Songling caught this cynicism when he remarked that \\"What the state defines as illegal is that which does not follow its rule, while officials and merchants label as smuggling that which they do not smuggle themselves.\\"quoted in Man Bun Kwan,The Salt Merchants of Tianjin: State-Making and Civil Society in Late Imperial China. (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2001). . p. 7. Pu's short story, \\"The Salt Smuggler\\" told of the Judge of Purgatory who needed help cleaning out newly arrived sinners who were choking the rivers and eighteen hells. The Judge sent to the upper world for one Wang Shi, a village salt peddler. When Wang demanded to know why he, of all people, had been chosen, the Judge of Purgatory gave this satirical and paradoxical explanation: :Those who drive an illicit trade in salt, not only defraud the State of its proper revenue, but also prey upon the livelihood of the people. Those, however, whom the greedy officials and corrupt traders of to-day denounce as unlicensed traders, are among the most virtuous of mankind, needy unfortunates who struggle to save a few cash in the purchase of their pint of salt. Are they your unlicensed traders?Herbert Giles Strange Stories From A Chinese Studio \\"The Salt Smuggler\\"(London, 1880 etc.; various reprints), story #112. Prosperity, culture, corruption, reform in the Qing dynasty When the Qing dynasty was founded in the middle of the 17th century, Manchu conquerors immediately seized the saltern areas in order to cut off supplies to their enemies and gain the revenues for themselves. They revived the ten zone system set up in the Song dynasty which the Ming inherited from the Yuan, and continued the merchant-official alliance. Over the course of the dynasty, even vigorous administration could not prevent the accumulation of problems. Salt evaporation Manchu armies nearly destroyed the prosperous salt city of Yangzhou when it offered resistance. Although it had no natural resources or production, the city recovered quickly because it was the country's single most important salt administrative headquarters.Yang Jeou-yu, \\"Defining features of Qing Salt Monopoly: An Institutional Analysis,‚Äù Bulletin of the Institute of Modern History, Academia Sinica 47 (March, 2005), p. 41 The city was strategically located on the north bank of the Yangzi River near the junction with the Grand Canal which transported salt and grain north. The Salt Commissioner who was headquartered at Yangzhou supervised the Lianghuai district, which shipped salt to seven provinces: Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Guizhou. The rights to salt produced along the coast were controlled by some 200 Yangzhou merchants who were supervised by the Commissioner but operated privately, making them richer and more powerful than those in other regions. These merchants became patrons of opera, publishing, and painting, but depended on imperial whim. They prudently showered the Kangxi Emperor with praise and gifts when he visited their luxurious gardens and attended their opera performances.Tobie S. Meyer-Fong. Building Culture in Early Qing Yangzhou. (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2003). . pp.93, 114, 136, 174-76 The merchants of the Changlu Salt Syndicate in Tianjin were only slightly less wealthy and influential. Like Yangzhou, Tianjin had little natural wealth, but used its location on the Grand Canal to become a transshipment center and developed the nearby Changlu salterns as a source of capital.Kwan,The Salt Merchants of Tianjin pp. 14-28. Government Salt Superintendents also accumulated fortunes. They could under- report tax revenues and keep the difference for themselves; they could accept fees from applicants for office; or, with a clear conscience, simply accept gifts from salt merchants who were grateful for their help. A good example is Cao Yin (1658-1711). As a personal bondservant and childhood playmate of the Kangxi Emperor, Cao became so rich and influential that he played host four times to the Emperor in his tours of the south. In 1705, as a mark of favor, the emperor ordered Cao, an accomplished scholar, to compile all shi (lyric poems) surviving from the Tang dynasty. Cao compiled and published the Complete Poems of the Tang using proceeds from the Salt Administration. Yet even such a well-connected official relied on the whim of the emperor. The Cao family lost favor and fortune when a new emperor came to the throne, a fall from grace reflected in Dream of the Red Chamber, the nostalgic novel written by Cao Yin's grandson Cao Xueqin.Jonathan D. Spence. Ts'ao Yin and the K'ang- Hsi Emperor: Bondservant and Master. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1965), esp. pp. 157-165. Drilling a well Ziliujing, Sichuan, 19th centuryThe early Qing emperors placed personnel decisions and supervision of the salt gabelle in the hands of the Imperial Household Department. Since the Department was housed within the Forbidden City, where the emperor lived for much of the year, the emperor and his personal servants could control the revenues directly, whereas much of the land tax, the other major revenue source, was siphoned off at the local level or committed to other expenses. In the last years of the Qianlong era at the close of the 18th century, the Household Department under the eunuch Heshen became corrupt and lax, filling the salt administration with lax and greedy officials. Without competent and honest supervision, merchants once again speculated in salt certificates and officials were incapable of raising their assigned levels of revenue. By the early 19th century, merchant families could not deliver the massive amounts of salt they had contracted but instead raised prices to yield steady profits. Smuggled and black market salt then rose to meet demand and soon outweighed official sales. Government revenues fell.William T. Rowe. China's Last Empire: The Great Qing. (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, History of Imperial China, 2009; ), p. 162-163 Ziliujing Sichuan, 19th century When the Daoguang Emperor came to the throne in 1820, he was alarmed at the outflow of silver to pay for opium. In the years leading up to the Opium Wars fiscal reform became an emotional as well as fiscal issue. In 1832, the emperor appointed the reform-minded official Tao Zhu to head the Lianghuai Salt Administration. Tao immediately ended the Ming franchise system in favor of a relatively open market. He ordered that merchants of good standing could buy salt certificates for a large or small amount of salt which could be retailed wherever the merchant wished. The certificates themselves could be bought and sold. In the short term, however, Tao could not make good on his promises for delivery of salt and revenue, and was forced to retire. Nevertheless, the system had been changed and the bureaucracy of the dynasty showed a greater ability to adapt than later critics gave it credit for.Thomas Metzger, \\"The Organizational Capabilities of the Ch'ing State in Commerce,\\" in William E Willmott, ed., Economic Organization in Chinese Society (Stanford University Press, 1972) pp. 42-43 By the beginning of the 20th century, there was not so much a national system as a venerable patchwork of production, distribution, and taxation. The salt trade in one province, Hunan, was estimated to involve some 1,000 traders, six to nine thousand junkmen, and about 1,000 state employees and officials, including police. In the broader Lianghuai region altogether some 369,000 people were employed, including 230,000 laborers in the salt fields.Metzger, \\"The Organizational Capabilities of the Ch'ing State in Commerce\\" p. 9. The 20th century and the end of the salt gabelle =The Sino-foreign Salt Inspectorate and the Republic of China, 1913-1949= With the 1911 Revolution, the imperial system fell, but the old patchwork salt system survived. In 1913, the President of the young new republic, Yuan Shikai, negotiated with foreign banks a series of Reorganization Loans which were intended to shore up the central government in relation to the provinces. The foreign banks insisted that the loans were to be repaid from the most reliable sources of government income, that is, the maritime customs, the land tax, and the salt tax. Yuan agreed to set up a joint Sino-Foreign Salt Administration to monitor collection of the salt tax and remit the required portions to foreign creditors.Albert Feuerwerker, \\"The Foreign Presence in China,\\" in John King Fairbank, ed., The Cambridge History of China. Vol 12 Republican China, 1912-1949 Pt 1 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983), pp. 189-192 The Sino-Foreign Salt Administration, which lasted until 1949, became, in the words of one historian, a \\"veritable model of a successful, well-institutionalized, high prestige organization that elicited the loyalty and commitment of its Chinese and foreign staff even as it operated in an extremely turbulent, often hostile environment.‚Äù Moreover, it provided a series of central governments in this period with their second most important source of tax revenues.Julia C. Strauss Strong Institutions in Weak Polities: State Building in Republican China, 1927-1940 (Oxford, New York: Clarendon Press; Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 60. The Salt Administration faced continuous challenges. From 1913 to 1918 it was led by Sir Richard Dane, a British citizen and experienced administrator retired from the Salt Excise in India, where he had been called ‚Äúthe salt king.‚Äù Dane was, in the words of one writer, ‚Äúa British colonial clich√©,‚Äù complete with a bushy moustache and walking stick, who might have provoked nationalist opposition.Mark Kurlansky. Salt: A World History. (New York: Penguin Books, 2003). p. 370 Yet the historian S.A. M. Adshead sees Chinese and foreigners in the Salt Administration as being \\"co-modernizers.\\" He puts Dane among the \\"leading figures of European imperialism in China\\" but one who took his responsibility seriously. Dane resisted both foot-dragging by the Chinese local authorities and the attempts by foreign powers to get more than what was legally required. Dane restructured the bureaucracy and hired energetic and competent Chinese and foreign officers.Samuel Adrian M. Adshead, The Modernization of the Chinese Salt Administration, 1900-1920 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1970 ), p. ?? In contrast to the Imperial Maritime Customs Service, the Salt Administration had only a few dozen foreign employees and more than 5,000 Chinese ones. It did not enter domestic salt trade and tax collection; it concerned itself only with gathering salt revenues to repay the Reorganization Loans and depositing the \\"salt surplus,\\" that is, what was left over, to foreign banks for use by whichever Chinese government was recognized by the foreign powers. But after 1922, Chinese provincial leaders and local military commanders no longer allowed these funds to leave the territories they controlled; central government salt revenues fell disastrously, though payments to foreign governments continued. The Salt Administration was also useful in organizing and financing army units. The eight regiments under General Sun Li-jen were among the most effective Chinese troops during the Second Sino-Japanese War. When these foreign governments extended diplomatic recognition to the Nationalist Government of Chiang Kai- shek in 1928, they used salt revenue to reward the new government's agreement to continue loan payments contracted by its predecessors. In 1931, salt taxes provided nearly a third of the revenue in the government's public budget.Arthur N. Young. China's Nation-Building Effort, 1927-1937: The Financial and Economic Record. (Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, Hoover Institution Publications, 104, 1971). . Private competition with government salt soon appeared. The Jiuda Salt Industries, starting in 1914, had built a modern chemical and salt works, with seven production plants at Tianjin. The company eventually manipulated its political networks so that by 1936 it had challenged the monopoly of the salt gabelle in order to take advantage of its more efficient technology but still did not gain a major share of the market.Man Bun Kwan, \\"Managing Market, Hierarchy, and Network: The Jiuda Salt Industries, 1917-1937,\\" Enterprise and Society 6.3 (September 2005): 395-418. Some salt merchants, such as the Sichuan merchant Zeng Junchen, in the face of rising salt taxes and government monopoly, used their capital and official connections to enter the opium trade.}, p. 160 At the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Japanese troops quickly seized the salterns in North China. Soon more than half the salt revenue was either uncollected, retained by needy local governments, or taken by the Japanese. The Nationalist government reluctantly allowed the Salt Administration, which legally was a foreign agency, to maintain offices in Shanghai to avoid providing the Japanese with an excuse to set up a puppet salt administration. Payments to the foreign banks were maintained, but at great cost. After 1941 the foreign staff largely resigned or left. Smugglers managed to meet much of the demand for salt in Free China, but the government lost important revenue.Arthur N. Young. China's Wartime Finance and Inflation, 1937-1945. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, Harvard East Asian Series, 1965), p. 50-53. Since Japanese homeland did not produce enough salt to meet the demands of industrial production, the Japanese organized special companies which early in the war exported over 900,000 tons a year from North China and Manchuria.Orchard, John E. \\"Japan's Economic Invasion of China.\\" Foreign Affairs 18. 3 (1940): 464-76.JSTOR Nationalist government attempts to collect salt taxes during and immediately after the war provoked resistance from small-scale local salt producers in North China. The Chinese Communist Party gained a foothold in these areas when it promised to support salt produces against government collectors.Ralph Thaxton. Salt of the Earth: The Political Origins of Peasant Protest and Communist Revolution in China. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997). . =Salt, politics, and health in the People‚Äôs Republic of China= Industrial Salt Evaporators at Zigong With the founding of the China National Salt Industry Corporation in February 1950, the new government re-established the monopoly of salt production, eventually driving old style and private salt companies out of business. By the 1960s, old style methods of producing salt gave way to large scale production in state owned factories. Improved infrastructure increased access to the major salt flats of Qinghai, such as those surrounding Dabusun Lake. The Zigong Salt Museum preserves one well to demonstrate the traditional methods,Kurlansky, Ch 23 ‚ÄúThe Last Salt Days of Zigong but by 2011, China's production of table salt was the largest in the world. In 2014, the Chinese government announced plans to end the salt monopoly and government price controls starting from 2016.The Chinese Government Salt Monopoly Has Lasted for 2,600 Years and It's About to End Present Day Salt Flats at Tianjin As elsewhere in the world, salt became a public health concern. The government took steps to combat the historical problem of iodine deficiency in the western, southern, and eastern regions of the country, which historically did not derive their salt from ocean water. To eliminate sources of non-iodized salt from private salt producers, the Chinese government established a salt police with 25,000 officers to enforce the salt monopoly. Consumption of iodized salt reached 90% of the Chinese population by 2000. Salt in Chinese cuisine ‚ÄúSalty‚Äù is one of the ‚Äúfive flavors‚Äù of Chinese herbology and Chinese cuisine which Chinese see as the basis of good food. Salt is not generally sprinkled on a dish at the last moment or at the table, as is often the case in western cooking, but is more often one of the ingredients.Jacqueline M. Newman. Food Culture in China. (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 2004; ), p. Salt on a Chinese Restaurant Table The ancient Chinese found that salt, because it inhibits bacteria, was useful both in preserving foods and in controlling fermentation; without salt, the yeasts and sugars produced by vegetable decay would rot and turn to alcohol.H.T. Huang (Huang Xingzong). Fermentations and Food Science. Science and Civilisation in China, Part 5 of Biology and Biological Technology, Volume 6 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000; ), 416-419. From early times, pickles, sauces, and special dishes featured salt a main ingredient. Douchi, which was found in a tomb dated 165 BC, is salted and fermented soy beans, the oldest food made from that product. Soy sauce, produced when the fermentation of the beans is controlled by salt at just the right stage, may have originated in the desire to make the supply of salt go farther. Chinese vegetable pickles may be either fermented or marinated, most famously in Pao cai from cabbage, or Zha cai (pressed vegetable), also known as Sichuan vegetable. Present day Chinese cooking techniques include using salt to preserve eggs, such as Salted duck eggs; roasting a chicken in a crust of salt; and serving fish on a bed of salt. The index of one authoritative Chinese cookbook lists nine recipes with \\"salt\\" in the title.Pearl Kong Chen, Tien Chi Chen and Rose Y. L. Tseng, Everything You Want to Know About Chinese Cooking. (Woodbury, NY: Barron's, 1983; rpr. 1995. ), p. 501. In recent years, Chinese cooks have become concerned about the health risks of sodium. The Hong Kong food authority Pearl Kong Chen admonishes that traditionally Chinese people ate large amounts of plain rice, with no soy sauce or salt added and only small amounts of meat or vegetables seasoned with salt or soy sauce. In recent times, she warns, the proportion of meat and vegetables has increased, along with seaweed, oyster sauce, and salted fish and vegetables, causing an unhealthy increase in sodium consumption.Pearl Kong Chen, Everything You Want to Know About Chinese Cooking. p. 499.

The two couldn't be more different from each other, as Billy is the smart one while Tom comes from the poor side of town, yet they're the best of friends. That friendship has begun to crumble as of late with the impending threat of college and separation. Tom's habit of using their movie nights as an excuse to meet up with his girlfriend has also taken a strain on the friendship as well. However all of that changes in one night after aliens take over the townspeople one by one and the teens must rely on their horror movie knowledge to survive. Reception Critical reception for Video Night has been mostly positive and Fearnet called it one of their \\"Best Reads of 2012\\".

The concept of life style of human beings falls in two categories: personal and public. The genre dealing with poems about love affairs is called Akam (‡ÆÖ‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡Øç) while the other genre, called puram, concerns many subjects such as wars, kings, poets and personal virtues, besides others. TolkƒÅppiyam, the earliest work of Tamil grammar and literature available in Tamil, divides each genre into seven strands (Thinai) comparing and connecting the one in personal with the other in public life of style. Another work that belongs to a period of a thousand years later, Purapporul Venpamalai, divides the puram concept into twelve according to its view, without concerning the other part life-style. The genre of puram concept speaks on the excellency of life-style of different people. As the kings are famous, their life-styles of war and gifts are spoken in plenty. Unlike Puram, the personal name of a person will never be identified in Akam concept of literature of poem, as it is common all. Puram leads to consideration as a historical record by Tamil literary scholars as it has details such as names of kings, poets, and places.

Plot  Seven friends, every week, have an appointment that they cannot, and do not want to miss for any reason: their five-a-side football match, for which they leave family, work, meetings, university lessons. The team participates in an amateur tournament, the winners of which will play against the Old Boys, a team of former professional players. The striker Vittorio Trebbi is a fifty-year-old divorced, owner of the Diana company, manufacturer of coffee machines and sponsor of the team; Adam, Vittorio's son, is the goalkeeper, who in life is a tattoo artist; Piero, an economics student and Adam's best friend, is in defense; Lele, chief worker in Diana, is the median; Filippo is specialized in going to him and provoking his opponents in order to knock them down or give them warnings; Mina, the captain, is a sports journalist former player of C, now fat and smoker, who enters the field only to beat the free-kicks (\\"He plays 3 minutes in the whole championship, but scores 20 goals. Mina confirms his average match : 6 cigarettes, 4 coffees, 1 goal and 2 packets of chips \\"); the Venezia is a worker in Diana, the bench par excellence. The progress of the championship and the lives of the seven protagonists intertwine and influence each other. Vittorio is in negotiations for the sale of the company to a French group and is dating Viola, a twenty- two year old who juggles various occasional jobs: therefore, he has a forward mentality, vigorous and proactive; Adam was emotionally hurt by an ex- girlfriend of his and badly tolerates his father for cheating on Diana, his mother: he has therefore decided to live his life without initiative and in defense, so the goalkeeper is the perfect role; Piero organizes everything in his life, from the hours of study to those of the couple with Martina (Viola's friend): on the pitch he manages to organize his teammates, from whom he is called \\"Precisetti\\"; Lele, as a midfielder, is forced to run on the pitch, but also in life having to juggle work, sport and family life with his wife Silvia and two small children; Filippo manages to be hard-hearted both in the field and at work, often putting the gain in front of human relationships; Venezia has no particular quality, in fact in the game it is always on the bench; Mina is the captain and her role is to advise the team. Vittorio tries to sell the company (whose name was clearly given in honor of his ex-wife when they were married) to a French group, but mysteriously the group withdraws the offer, the company is devalued enormously and goes into crisis. He also begins to struggle on the pitch, and one night has a tachycardic attack while in bed with Viola. Vittorio at the hospital meets Diana, a doctor on duty: she discovers a series of doping substances in his blood that were about to cause a heart attack. Threatening him to report, she orders him to detox by having her visit him every week. Adam, while bringing his father the change for the night, discovers that he is sleeping with Viola, his ex who broke his heart. Martina discovers she is pregnant, but confesses to Viola that her father is Adam: suffocated by Piero's meticulous precision she had allowed herself a little leisure on March 8 and, thanks to alcohol and marijuana, she went to bed with him. When Piero accidentally discovers the fact (thinking he is the father) he asks Mina for advice and totally changes his attitude towards life, he takes more initiative and proposes to Martina to open a business of exchange and sale of all those objects for newborns of which after a certain age of the child, families no longer need. Lele and Silvia experiment with various possible solutions to their married life, arriving at a disastrous dinner in which he puts marijuana in the vegetable pie that serves his wife and Silvia some Viagra in his broth: everything seems to be fine, when the daughter, left on purpose from his grandparents, he breaks his arm and they have to go to hospital in pitiful conditions. In the end, Lele also asks Mina for advice and finds a solution: since Silvia has given up her career as a restorer, she puts herself on leave at the company, becoming a housewife and making her wife work. She thus finds serenity with the job she studied for, and he manages to feel useful for his wife and family. These upheavals are also reflected on the pitch: Piero and Vittorio switch roles, Adam is completely lost and Lele, after an initial phase of exhaustion, finds strength. Vittorio talks to Adam and discovers that Diana is still in love with him: the weekly visits are just an excuse to be able to see him. Vittorio finally leaves Viola, to Adam's delight. The company is finally sold to the French, and Vittorio receives a visit from Piero, who asks him for a loan to start the business of buying and selling baby items: Vittorio accepts, as long as he swaps roles in the game with the Old Boys. Vittorio's new vigor leads him to score a goal. Just after this game (disastrously lost) Vittorio discovers that it was Filippo who maneuvered the movements of the French to make the company devalue and buy it back at a lower price: after hitting him in the face, Vittorio chases Filippo from the team. Here Mina admits that she has always understood Filippo's nature for Nereo Rocco's law, \\"on the pitch as in life\\". He bitterly admits that he can only give advice to others and stay on the bench: he too is divorced and his ex-wife is remarrying. Lele and Silvia rediscover the balance and she is pregnant again. The new season begins: the new sponsor of the team is Piero's business, Vlad, a violent Serbian client of Adam's, has been taken in for Filippo, and Piero is convinced that he is a father.

A professor at National Taiwan University in Taipei, he has conducted research in areas including coastal engineering and computational hydraulics. In politics, he served in various positions in the Chen Shui-bian administration in the mid-2000s, and rose to greater prominence for his protests in support of the Taiwan independence movement. Early life and academic career Tsay was born in Ziguan District, Kaohsiung on Taiwan's southwestern coast. He attended National Cheng Kung University, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1971 and a master's degree in 1973. From 1975 to 1978, he was a lecturer in National Chung Hsing University's Civil Engineering Department. He then moved to the United States to pursue a Ph.D. at Cornell University, where he defended his doctoral dissertation on numerical solutions to certain hydraulics problems in 1982. Because of Tsay's support for the Tangwai movement, Taiwan's Kuomintang government blacklisted him, making it impossible for him to return. Instead, he pursued his academic career in the United States for the next eight years, and was naturalised as a U.S. citizen. After conducting postdoctoral research at Cornell University from 1982 to 1983, he took up a position as an assistant professor at Syracuse University, and was promoted to associate professor in 1986. He returned to Taiwan in 1990, a few years after the end of martial law on the island, to take up a new position as a professor at National Taiwan University. In government In 2002, Tsay was named vice-chairman of the Executive Yuan's Research, Development and Evaluation Commission. Because Taiwan does not allow civil servants to hold dual citizenship, he renounced U.S. citizenship to take up the position. He served in that position until 2004, after which he became vice-chairman of the Environmental Protection Administration until 2005, and took up the position of acting chairman in between the terms of Chang Juu-en and Chang Kuo-long. Political protests In October 2008, Tsay led the Taiwan Association of University Professors in a hunger strike outside the Legislative Yuan building in support of relaxation of the procedures for public referenda. Since the passage of the 2003 Referendum Law, the government would only review referendum proposals supported by the signatures of at least 0.5% of the voter turnout in the most recent presidential election; whether or not to hold the referendum remained the decision of a government-appointed board. Tsay's goal was to make it easier for a Taiwan independence referendum to be proposed and conducted. He eventually created the Taiwan Referendum Alliance in support of this goal. What was initially intended to be a 24-hour protest ended up turning into a years-long event. By January 2010, he had been assessed fines of more than NT$800,000 relating to his occupation of public space during the sit-in protest. Lacking funds to pay the fines, Tsay and his supporters began soliciting donations outside the Presidential Office in Taipei, due to which he was arrested and had further fines assessed against him, in that case for alleged violations of the Assembly and Parade Act. The donations were largely in the form of coins; Tsay and his fellow protestors spent nine hours in the police station counting the reported three hundred and sixty thousand coins. In 2012, Tsay and the TRA also initiated a walking protest in support of clemency for former president Chen Shui-bian, who had been imprisoned after a conviction for corruption charges. In late February 2014, about a week before the 67th anniversary of the February 28 Incident, Tsay led a group of fellow Taiwan Referendum Alliance members in removing a statue of Sun Yat-sen from Tang De-jhang Memorial Park in Tainan, a park named for a local lawyer executed during the military crackdown which followed the February 28 Incident. Kuomintang politicians including Fan Chiang Tai-chi condemned the TRA's actions. During the March and April 2014 Sunflower Student Movement, Tsay and the TRA also led sympathy protests outside of the Legislative Yuan. After the removal of protestors from the square in front of the Legislative Yuan, Tsay led further protests outside the Zhongzheng First Police Precinct station.

During the Second World War he participated in the 1941 Uprising in Montenegro, but has soon turned to collaboration with Axis occupation forces until 1944, when he was killed during the bombing of Podgorica.  Early life  La≈°iƒá was born in village of Kami near Andrijevica, Principality of Montenegro. He completed his primary education in Lijeva Rijeka. He started his secondary education in Berane Gymnasium, but due to his bad financial situation he left school in 1918 and enrolled in military school in ƒÜuprija which he completed in 1922.http://www.ravnagorachetniks.org/Djordje_Markov_Lasic.html  World War II  = Uprising in Montenegro = At the beginning of June 1941 he met with the other officers of Royal Yugoslav Army to discuss potential actions against the occupying Axis forces in Montenegro. According to Ugo Cavallero, most of the insurgent forces were led by former officers of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia until the end of October 1941. During preparation for uprising in Montenegro, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia came in touch with active and reserve officers of the former Royal Yugoslav Army, because there were many young people in the ranks of the insurgents who did not know how to handle a firearm. Thus La≈°iƒá became a member of the Partisan Military Committee for Andrijevica. When Axis Albanian units started to concentrate toward the liberated territory, La≈°iƒá was co-opted in the District Military Command. La≈°iƒá often spoke out against the communist leadership of the uprising. The leadership itself didn't have illusions of prolonged cooperation with La≈°iƒá, but were trying not to aggravate relations with him until the Partisans liberated Plav and Gusinje. When the Royal Italian Army began its offensive against the Partisans, La≈°iƒá on 4 August abandoned his position in partisan District Military Command and joined the anti-communist group of Ljubo Vuksanoviƒá, who opposed further struggle against Axis occupation. After Partisan withdrawal from Berane and Andrijevica in early August, La≈°iƒá was a member of the delegation sent to meet the Royal Italian Army. On 5 September La≈°iƒá in Lijeva Rijeka gathered people and called for combat against communist rebels. After the initial major success, the uprising was suppressed within three weeks. Most nationalist commanders took neither side in the sporadic clashes between Italian forces and insurgent forces that became increasingly dominated by Partisans. La≈°iƒá went to Ravna Gora in Serbia to meet Chetnik leader Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá. In mid-October 1941 Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá appointed La≈°iƒá as commander of Chetniks in (Old) Montenegro. Although some evidence suggest that nationalist officers advised civilians to take passive attitude toward Italian forces, there is no indication that they were to collaborate with Italians and their governor Alessandro Pirzio Biroli. In Lijeva Rijeka (former municipality near Podgorica) La≈°iƒá established the first Chetnik military organization at the end of November and Chetnik battalion (Battalion of Lijeva Rijeka) at the beginning of December 1941. He was the first commander of this battalion, which was the first Chetnik battalion in Montenegro. = Collaboration with Axis forces = In the second half of December 1941, Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá and La≈°iƒá began the mobilization and establishment of armed units separated from Partisans. By the middle of January 1942 these units were in armed conflict with Partisans. La≈°iƒá was heavily wounded when two companies of the Kom Partisan detachment attacked Chetniks in Bare Kraljske (near Kola≈°in), so the command of Chetnik forces at this sector was transferred to Andrija Veskoviƒá. In period between German capture of Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá on 14 May 1943, during their Case Black operation, and his return from German prison in November 1943, La≈°iƒá was the only remaining Chetnik commander in Montenegro. His forces were probably no more than 500 men. La≈°iƒá was killed on 5 May 1944 during the bombing of Podgorica by Allies.

Directed by Joanna Godwin-Seidl and starring Daniel Annoh (Avery), Jason Cloud (Sam), Denise Teipel (Rose) and Jack Midgley (Skylar/Dreaming Man). Overview The Flick is set in a run down movie palace in Worcester, Massachusetts and follows three underpaid movie ushers, Avery, Sam and Rose (who also runs the film projector) who do the humdrum and tedious labor necessary for keeping it running, including toiling to clean spilled soda from the floors. The show is a comedy of the mundane delivered in bits of conversation that might be considered insignificant. Sam Gold said Baker's comedic writing was cleverly and surprisingly understated. Gold added that rhythm, meter and pace of the dialogue were cardinal to the comedy. Running three hours, the show has received complaints regarding its length. While recognizing the dissonance, Playwrights Horizons artistic director Tim Sanford sent a letter to some subscribers, acknowledging the concern, but finding it outweighed by the praise of others. He concluded there was no need to edit the play down. Critical response StageGrade gives a median critics' rating for The Flick of B+ based on 22 reviews. Despite doubts about the play's length, the characters are said to be rich and the dialogue nuanced and entertaining. The lack of traditional theatricality is seen by some as a strength, and a weakness by others. Charles Isherwood, reviewing for The New York Times described Baker as one of the most impressive dramatists from the Off-Broadway scene of her generation and noted that she \\"writes with tenderness and keen insight\\". John Del Signore, reviewing the play in Gothamist, praised Baker \\"for capturing the halting, self-conscious vernacular of cerebral yet underachieving twenty-something suburbanites\\". Although Del Signore noted that the significance of some of the elements of Baker's presentation were challenging to summarize, he noted that \\"[T]he three misfits blunder in and out of each other's isolated bubbles, making contact in any way they can to alleviate the oppressive drudgery of their tasks.\\" Jesse Green acknowledged the need for brevity and clarity in his review for New York, and wrote: > No one does anything generally regarded as theatrical. ... So what does > happen in The Flick? A lot of sweeping and mopping of the floor of a grotty > old movie house near Worcester, Massachusetts. Also the tenderest > drama‚Äîfunny, heartbreaking, sly, and unblinking‚Äînow playing at a theater > near you. ... It's uncanny; rarely has so much feeling been mined from so > little content. Something's lost in the process, of course: brevity. In a Playbill article, Robert Simonson noted that despite its irksome lengthy, static actionlessness to some viewers the show was a splendid theatrical experience for serious theatregoers that wowed them with \\"existential minutiae\\" as presented by three performers who brought the themes to life. Critics of The New York Times listed The Flick in 2018 as the third-greatest American play of the past 25 years. The following year, writers for The Guardian ranked it fourth on a list of the best theatrical works since 2000. Awards and nominations The play won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Drama; the Pulitzer committee stated that the play is a \\"thoughtful drama with well- crafted characters that focuses on three employees of a Massachusetts art- house movie theatre, rendering lives rarely seen on the stage.\\" Baker was awarded the 2013 Susan Smith Blackburn Prize and the 2013 Obie Award for Playwriting for this play. The play received Drama Desk Award nominations for Outstanding Play, Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play (Aaron Clifton Moten) and Outstanding Set Design.

Early life and education Mayberry has played the piano since she was a child and drums since she was a teenager. Mayberry attended Beaconhurst School, an independent school in Bridge of Allan. After completing a four-year undergraduate law degree at the University of Strathclyde, she earned a master's degree in Journalism in 2010. This led her into a career in freelance journalism and production running. From 2009 to 2010 she was a contributor to the UK music website The Line of Best Fit. Musical career From age 15 until 22, she played drums in various bands. Prior to Chvrches, Mayberry was involved in two local bands, Boyfriend/Girlfriend and Blue Sky Archives. In Blue Sky Archives, she was a vocalist and played the drums and keyboards. As a member of Blue Sky Archives, Mayberry also covered the Rage Against the Machine song \\"Killing in the Name\\" which was released as a single. In September 2011, Iain Cook of Aereogramme and The Unwinding Hours produced Blue Sky Archives' Triple A-Side EP. Cook started a new project with his friend Martin Doherty and asked Mayberry to sing on a couple of demos. They wrote together for seven or eight months in a basement studio in Glasgow. Cook, Mayberry and Doherty decided to form a new band after the sessions proved to be successful. The band chose the name Chvrches, using a Roman \\"v\\" to distinguish themselves from actual churches on internet searches. In 2013, the band signed to Glassnote Records after releasing the tracks, \\"Lies\\" and \\"The Mother We Share\\" in 2012. Their debut EP, Recover, was released in 2013.

Her ongoing work with the organisation includes written contributions to the online magazine and blog, and she can be heard regularly on TYCI podcasts. The group also hold live events, raising money for charities like Glasgow Women's Aid. In September 2013, Mayberry wrote an article for The Guardian in response to misogynist messages she received online. She wrote: Lauren Mayberry - Chvrches - Birmingham 2015 She discussed the issue again in a Talks at Google session in 2014 and on Channel 4 News, following aggressive responses to the band's video for \\"Leave a Trace\\". Mayberry is a patron of Rape Crisis Glasgow and has been involved with other organisations such as Water Aid, The Yellow Bird Project, Wild Aid and Plus 1, donating a portion of Chvrches' ticket sales to Amnesty International.

You can't say you don't think he's a sexist. You can't say you don't think he's transphobic and homophobic, 'cause he has shown us who he is.\\" Mayberry is a staunch advocate for gun control in the United States. Following the Sutherland Springs church shooting, Mayberry released a video on her Twitter account criticising President Trump's response, arguing that \\"it‚Äôs somewhere on the scale from ironic to disgustingly hypocritical that Donald Trump is talking about mental health with regards to this attack when his administration has done nothing but try to restrict access to help get care for people who need it the most\\". She further recounted her memory of the Dunblane massacre in which 16 children and one teacher were murdered with handguns, resulting in sweeping gun control legislation in the UK. Mayberry credits these efforts with substantially decreasing the number of mass shootings in the UK. Personal life Mayberry currently resides in Los Angeles. Mayberry and actor Justin Long have engaged in multiple philanthropic activities together, including hosting a holiday variety show charity fundraiser at The Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles and travelling together to Nicaragua to visit a women's shelter.

The goal is to allow them to find qualified jobs in the bakery-pastry making sector and lead an independent life after graduation.  History  Shanghai Young Bakers was initiated in 2008 as a social innovation project by the French Junior Economic Chamber of Shanghai. A group of 12 French people, who had been living in China for a few years, wished to contribute a meaningful project to the country that had welcomed them. Inspired by a social bakery La Boulangerie Fran√ßaise in Hu·∫ø, Vietnam, they discovered that there was a high demand for French bakery in China as well, due to the rapid growth of bakeries and 4/5 stars hotels. Given the lack of a high-quality French bakery training in China at that time, SYB was created in order to equip the underprivileged with a skill that was needed on the job market. The project was officially launched in February 2009 with the first batch of 16 students. Initially six-months long, the training now lasts one year. On 16 May 2010, the project was handed over to a charity with a longstanding history of effective social work in China, the Chi Heng Foundation, in order to guarantee the program's social mission and ensure its long-term continuity.  Social Mission  Inspired by the Chinese proverb, SYB's motto is \\"Give an orphan some bread, you feed him for one day; teach him how to bake, you feed him for a lifetime!\\" With that in mind, SYB program puts a greater emphasis on equipping its trainees with skills rather than simply providing them with knowledge. SYB's mission can be highlighted in three key words: * Charity: Enable disadvantaged youth to lead independent lives through a qualified, empowering job SYB recruits students who formerly had no viable employment options, offers the training for free and targets 100% successful employment in bakery after graduation. Chi Heng Foundation, its governing body, guarantees the social mission of the SYB training program. * Expertise: Become a leading reference in French traditional bakery training in China SYB works with the Ecole Francaise de Boulangerie et P√¢tisserie d‚ÄôAurillac (EFBPA), qualified bakery professionals and local authorities to ensure a high-quality training that will eventually be officially and widely recognised throughout China. * Sustainability: Achieve financial autonomy through a social enterprise model The baking and pastry classes are given by SYB graduates educated at EFBPA in France, which forms a \\"giving back\\" cycle to support SYB sustainable development in return. SYB Baking Center and teaching resources allow more commercial activities to take place so that the generated revenue can support the training program, complement donations and alleviate financial burdens.  Recruitment and Training  SYB students, who come from all over China, undergo a year of intense vocational training. Shanghai Young Bakers cooperates with a network of local and international partner NGOs which recommend students based on their financial background and motivation to pursue a career in bakery. The program accepts up to 32 students per year to ensure that a high-quality training is provided. The SYB program is based on learning and working alternation system with two weeks of bakery/pastry class and two weeks of interning at international hotels. It is based on the French professional diploma Certificat d'aptitude professionnelle (CAP), as developed by the Ecole Fran√ßaise de Boulangerie et Patisserie d‚ÄôAurillac. Given that, the curriculum and exams are designed under the supervision of EFBPA. The students also learn how to make Chinese-style breads and pastries, a curriculum that is taught at the Shanghai Caoyang Vocational School. Within the one-year program, students attain both basic and intermediate levels of the official Western Bakery diploma, awarded by the Shanghai Labor Bureau and recognized throughout China. The training also includes theory classes covering topics such as ingredients composition and nutrition, food quality and safety and workplace hygiene. In addition to that, SYB offers its students English and life skills classes which are vital to further the graduates' career development opportunities.  Social enterprise  Since 2011, the program has created a social enterprise that offers a range of commercial services whose proceeds go to the charity program. Among the services available are catering, teambuilding activities, public baking and pastry classes, DIY workshops for kids, and consulting services for F&B; professionals.

In an interview, co- founder Victor Chu said that the company aimed to provide the technology behind online comics publishing, in terms of hosting, promotion of great titles, monthly sponsorship and print on demand book publishing. The company was more a service provider to independent artists and this sets them apart from other e-comics initiatives. Crowdsourcing Inkblazers.com took a crowdsourcing approach to publishing. Key benefits of crowdsourcing drove the company's decisions included: 1\\\\. Fan support for authors. 2\\\\. Data backing up decisions on marketing and content rights acquisition. 3\\\\. More sales resulting from content aggregation. Furthermore, the website created an environment in which authors and member contributors can interact and share advice as well as an area in which project collaborations become possible. Inkblazers shut down on February 1, 2015 as the creators could no longer financially support the continuation of the site, causing many members to search for another webcomic site.

It offered a system in which exchange students could view many vacancies and easily apply to them or find accommodation and book it online using a secure payment system, what allows the students to have a room or apartment before they arrive in their Erasmus destination.http://www.holanda.es/es/empresas/empresas?page=14&c;=506 Since February 2018 the website is no longer in use, and the domain is occupied by a porn site.  History  Eurasmus was founded in 2014 and is based in Seville, Spain. The company was given funding by the European Regional Development Fund scheme, allowing it to expand across Europe. The company had the aim to integrate by the end of 2015 a free internship portal for students looking to find internships, work placements and even jobs across Europe.http://elcorreoweb.es/2013/12/11/la-realidad-exprime-el-mejor- talento/http://www.diariodesevilla.es/article/economia/1862015/eurasmuscom/nominada/premio/emprendedor/europeo/joven.htmlhttp://startupbeat.com/2014/05/06/eurasmus- qa-id3778/  Operational  Eurasmus was a free to use platform for both landlords and users such as universities and students. Both sides had to create an account filling in the necessary information. Once a booking was successfully made, the landlord received the first month of rent minus a small fee, which was calculated based upon the number of months the tenant would be staying. The company offered these services: = Accommodation = Students could find a room in most European cities and Erasmus destinations by the integrated system. = Internships/Student jobs = Users could look through the list Internships and Student jobs all over Europe in any field and apply for them using the platform, which also allowed the users to create their CV online or apply by a LinkedIn profile. = Student guides = Student reviews created from students to students.  Secure Payment  In order to ensure that there were no scams, the money was held until 24 hours after the tenant had arrived at their destination. If a complaint was made, then a team was assigned to investigate the complaint.http://eurasmus.com/en/list-your-room/ References Spanish travel websites Defunct websites Internet properties established in 2014 Internet properties disestablished in 2018 2014 establishments in Spain 2018 disestablishments in Spain ","title":"Eurasmus"},{"id":"42495991","text":"The Mailoni Brothers were a trio of serial killers and gang members in Zambia, consisting of brothers, Mika, Stephano and Fabian, alias Tunda.

Potter originally planned to place the center at the intersection of River Oaks Boulevard and Westheimer Road where St. John the Divine Church was built, but in 1930 he changed the location to where it would be ultimately built.Longstreth, p. 9 The preliminary studies began in 1932.Longstreth, p. 10 Potter commissioned architects Edward Arrantz and Oliver C. Winston to create the plans for the study. Arrantz died, so he was replaced by Stanton Nunn. Winston was later hired by the Public Works Administration to be the housing division project planner. In the early fall of 1936, H. G. Frost committed to financing the center. Potter asked Winston to finish the process, so Winston took one month of leave of absence from his job with the federal government.

The THC ruled it to be eligible to be on the National Historic Register, along with the Alabama and River Oaks Theatres. That year, the City of Houston Planning Commission recommended that the shopping center be designated as a historic landmark. This designation would give tax breaks discouraging demolition. In July 2007 some trees in the area were felled to prepare for the demolition. The City of Houston designated the River Oaks Shopping Center, Alabama Theatre, and the River Oaks Theatre as historic landmarks. Under the city law at the time, the owners and developers of a building designated as a landmark can still demolish a building designated as such without penalty if they apply for a certificate of nondesignation.

Mechanics' Institutes were introduced in 1821 to help the working class educate themselves, giving access to newspapers and books. The design of the building is attributed by English Heritage to William Richardson and John Ross, both born in 1836 and apprenticed to Joshua Sparkes (d.1855). However, a book of original architectural designs in Darlington Library includes Sparkes's original design for the Institute, alongside designs by Richardson and Ross dated 1851, when they were only 15. The foundation stone was laid 12 May 1853 by Elizabeth Pease of Feethams, whose ¬£400 donation was the largest received towards the building's ¬£2,300 cost. It was officially opened on 1 September 1854 by Elizabeth and her new husband, John Pringle Nichol, who she had married ten days after laying the foundation. In November 1877, two plaster casts of Thomas Earle's (d.1876) busts of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were unveiled on either side of the stage at the Institute. These were considered art treasures of Darlington, but were destroyed during World War I. At this time the Institute was at its peak with over 400 members and a library numbering over 3,000 books. With the emergence of public libraries and technical colleges, the Institute's role as a centre for self-improvement became less essential, and by the end of the 19th century, it was more of a social venue. Through the first half of the 20th century films, auctions, and public meetings were held there. In January 1959 the building let its ground floor to Newcastle Savings Bank, while the Institute relocated to the upper floor. Following the bank's vacating in the early 1980s, the building stood empty until becoming an American diner/bar in 1991. The Institute, now reduced to 30 members, met in the attic. As of 2014, the building is being refurbished as a nightclub and bar, while the Institute is a private snooker club located in nearby Bondgate.

She currently sits on the Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) and Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) Committees. She is also Chairwoman of the Delegation of the European Parliament for relations with the Mashreq countries (Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria). Between 2010 and 2016 she was Vice-President of the Party of the European Left. In November 2015 she announced her candidacy for the 2016 Portuguese presidential elections, supported by her political party, Left Bloc. She finished 3rd, with 10,12% of the votes, the best result ever achieved by a woman in a presidential election in Portugal.  Biography  Marisa Matias studied Sociology at the University of Coimbra, where she completed her doctorate thesis: ‚ÄúIs nature sick of us? Health, environment and emerging forms of citizenship‚Äù (2009). Her areas of specialisation include environmental health, sociology of science, political sociology, democracy and participation. She has published several scientific articles, chapters in books and other publications, national and international, on the relations between environment and public health, science and knowledge, democracy and citizenship. Matias has collaborated as a training/teacher in various training courses and postgraduate programs (including master and PhD programs), and conducted scientific research in the areas of environmental health, sociology of science, sociology of health and political sociology. She was a research member of the Centre for Social Studies of University of Coimbra (since 2004); research assistant of the Centre for Social Studies of University of Coimbra, Portugal (2000‚Äì2004); teacher of Sociology and other disciplines in ITAP and Profitecla schools (2000‚Äì2001); secretary of newsroom of the Scientific Magazine of Social Sciences (1998‚Äì2000). = Civic and political activity = Matias is a member of the Left Bloc National Board and Executive Board; as well as a member of board of Pro-Urbe, a civic association in Coimbra. She was national trustee of the movement \\"Cidadania e Responsabilidade pelo Sim\\", during the campaign for decriminalization of abortion in Portugal. She was also an activist in the movement against co-incineration in Souselas (pt) and head of the Left Bloc list in the elections for Coimbra Municipality (2005). =Member of the European Parliament=  2009 ‚Äì 2014  In 2009 Matias was elected as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Left Bloc, which sits as part of the political group GUE/NGL in the European Parliament. She was made a member of the Industry, Research and Energy Committee and Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee and a member of the delegations for relations with the Mashriq Countries, with Palestine, and with South Africa. At the beginning of mandate, Matias was nominated the Parliament‚Äôs rapporteur to write and negotiate the directive preventing the distribution of counterfeit medicines, a business that generates more than ‚Ç¨400 billion per year for the counterfeiting networks and puts at risk the life of patients. The directive, negotiated for almost two years with the parliamentary groups and the governments, was approved in 2011. This was only the second time since Portugal‚Äôs entrance into the EU that a Portuguese MEP had led the process of a framework-directive - a law that will be transposed to the judicial system of each of the EU Member States. At the same time, she was also rapporteur of the European strategy in the fight against Alzheimer and other dementias, that was also approved in 2011. She was co-president of the European Work Group for Diabetes, being co-author of the first resolution to ever be approved in the European Parliament aiming at the definition of a political strategy to fight the diabetes epidemic (2010). Was also involved in the planning and approval of resolutions on cancer and HIV, and was an active member of the parliamentary committee inquiry on the H1N1 vaccine. In 2011, Matias was chosen by her peers, with more than 350 votes, as MEP of the Year for health - the only MEP from the United Left Parliamentary Group to receive this honour since its creation. In the years 2011 and 2012, Matias was the Parliament‚Äôs rapporteur for the definition of a Common Strategic Framework for Research and Innovation. The report was approved in 2012 and established the bases for what should be the proposal for the Horizon 2020 programme on the European financing of research and innovation for the period 2014‚Äì2020. Besides the proposal to reinforce the funds and of a better geographical distribution of the funds, the approved proposal also included a significant increase of support to the scientific work and to the attribution of scholarships within the European financing framework. Later, would also be part of the team of six rapporteurs, nominated by the European Parliament, to the definition and negotiation of the proposal about the Horizon 2020, being responsible for one of the legislative regulations on the Strategic Agenda for Innovation. The legislative package would end up being approved at the end of 2013, being already active since January 2014. In 2012 she was still nominated rapporteur of the European Parliament for the evaluation of the European Central Bank (ECB) activities of 2011, the year the ECB presidency changed. In a very disputed process and hard negotiations, her report would be approved by one vote of difference in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. Later, the report would be approved, in plenary, still in 2013, but Marisa Matias requested her name to be withdraw as a result of approved changes in the final vote. Those changed took out of the report all the critical references to the ECB as member of the European Troika, equally eliminating the proposal to oblige the ECB to restore to the countries under the Troika‚Äôs intervention the profits resulting from the complex processes of buying and selling of public debt titles. Marisa Matias was, still, the Parliament‚Äôs rapporteur for four opinion on European strategy for adapting to climate change, resettling of GDP calculation, proposal for a new pluri-annual financing framework and regulation defining indexes on the goods traded in stock market. As shadow rapporteur, meaning, MEP responsible within its parliamentary group, to follow and negotiate proposals led by other colleagues from other parliamentary groups, Marisa Matias followed, during the mandate, the making of 25 parliamentary proposals, having presented proposals for change and being present in negotiation meetings. So far, was also co-author of 119 proposals of parliamentary resolutions. While Vice-President of the Parliament to the relations with the Mashreq countries (Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt) was part and presided to several parliamentary negotiations with these countries, coordinating processes of negotiation with the correspondent national parliaments. This was also done during the period known for the transformations introduced by the Arab Spring. Marisa is also member of the Parliament‚Äôs Delegation to the relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council, having developed initiatives mainly concerning the siege of the Gaza Strip. = Presidential candidacy = On 18 October 2015, Catarina Martins, co-ordinator of the Left Bloc, announced that, as no credible unifying leftist candidate had thus far come forward for the Presidential elections of January 2016, Marisa Matias allowed her name to be put forward as representing her party in those elections. She finished 3rd, with 10,12% of the votes, the best result ever achieved by a woman in a presidential election in Portugal. She has announced she would run for president again on the 2021 Portuguese presidential election.

Warwickshire Local History Society, 1983 Little is known about the first hall built on the site following this declaration except that ¬£1,161 was levied for repairs and alterations (and the erection of a gaol next door) in May 1674 to be raised by taxes. Work was undertaken by Mr William Hurlbert who had previously erected the town's Market Hall and refurbished Warwick Castle.The Shire Hall Before 1675, pages 53-54. Warwickshire County Record Office, 1946 Due to the fact that it was a sturdy brick-built structure the hall survived the Great Fire of Warwick on 5 September 1694 which destroyed all the surrounding town centre buildings.Cluley, Christine M: Northgate Street, page 15.

Yale University Press, 1995 It was originally used as a facility for dispensing justice but, following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it also became the meeting place of Warwickshire County Council. The first major extension of the complex beyond the traditional hall and court rooms took place in 1932. Massively increasing its size they spread eastward towards the former barracks, onto the site where the Militia Hall once stood.Cluley, Christine M: Northgate Street, page 44. Riley, Dunn & Wilson Ltd, 2006 The building was brought up to its current size by construction of the council chambers and further offices in 1958 and a final expansion in 1966. The latter two developments are classic examples of Brutalist architecture. Included in these alterations were the relocation of the Warwickshire County Emergency Centre, effectively a bunker allowing emergency council business to continue during wartime or terrorist attacks. There are currently two man-made ponds located in the complex, one in the 1930s courtyard and another outside the 1966 section, with metallic sculptures of a heron and fishes added in 2000.Author Unknown: Artist wades in with inspiration.

It is a colony-forming orchid which grows in peaty swamps near the coast. Its flowers are purple with ribbon-like strands attached to its labellum and a broad, petal-like column.  Description  Epiblema grandiflorum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb with a few inconspicuous, fine roots and an oval- shaped tuber lacking a protective sheath. The tuber produces replacement tubers on the end of short, root-like stolons. There is a single, tubular leaf about long, about wide at the base of the plant. There are between two and eight resupinate flowers on the end of a wiry stem high. The flowers are purple, long and wide, on a short stalk surrounded by a leaf-like bract. The three sepals and two lateral petals are free from, and more or less similar to, each other. The labellum is similar in size, shape and colour to the petals and has a callus consisting of a swelling with ribbon-like or club- shaped appendages. The sexual parts of the flower are fused to the column, which is erect and has wing-like structures on its sides. Flowering occurs from late November to January and is followed by the fruit which is a non- fleshy, glabrous, dehiscent capsule containing a large number of seeds. Taxonomy and naming This orchid was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae. The genus name Epiblema is an Ancient Greek word meaning \\"a coverlet\\" or \\"something thrown over\\" (such as a blanket) and the specific epithet \\"grandiflora\\" is derived from the Latin words grandis meaning \\"noble\\" or \\"magnificent\\" and flos meaning \\"flower\\". Distribution and habitat Babe- in-a-cradle grows in wet, peaty swamps, often initially underwater but by the time the flowers appear, the water has usually receded. It is found in coastal areas between Gingin north of Perth and Esperance in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren biogeographic regions. Conservation Epiblema grandiflorum is classified as \\"Not Threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife.

ZANLA put up stiff resistance and the tactical success of the RSF did not lead to the expected strategic changes. Background After successful Rhodesian air attacks on ZANLA bases, such as Operation Snoopy, the guerilla chose to set a new camp under the shelter of the forest near Mavonde, a few kilometers from Chimoio. As the Lancaster House discussions were taking place, RSF attempted to annihilate this base, hoping to weaken the Zimbabwean position. The base was held by 6,000 ZANLA partisans, with many anti-aircraft weapons on hills. Many guns were located on the highest hill, later to be nicknamed \\"Monte Cassino\\". Two secondary hills, Hill 774 and Hill 761, were also dotted with anti-aircraft guns. Trenches were dug in the 64-square-kilometers surface of the camp. The base was commanded by Solomon Mujuru, known by his nom-de-guerre Rex Nhongo. These weapons were received from the Ethiopian Derg. Small-scale Rhodesian reconnaissances erroneously estimated the ZANLA force to be 2,000 men strong. 200 Rhodesian soldiers were engaged. 100 men of the Selous Scouts were to spearhead the raid. Each of the ten-men was transported in a Unimog truck. The whole column, commanded by captain Richard Passaportis, contained 20 Unimogs, protected by Eland-90 armoured cars of the Rhodesian Armoured Corps. A detachment of QF 25-pounder guns was also part of the column. The Selous Scouts were supported by 100 men of the Rhodesian Light Infantry (2 Commando, 3 Commando and Support Commando), air-dropped 10-kilometers away from the camp.  First day  Before attacking the base, the RSF ground forces had to cross a river. The artillery was bogged down and the guerilla was alerted of the size of the column. The column was further delayed by ZANLA fire. The first wave of the Selous Scouts began clearing the trenches but the rest of the column only arrive late in the afternoon. Meanwhile, the airdropped Rhodesian Light Infantry joined the battle and Mpunzarima, a key ZANLA military leader, was killed. At dawn, Nhongo distributed marijuana to some of his troops, to reduce their stress. The Rhodesian troops were harassed during the night by RPG-7s, recoilless-rifles and mortars.  Second day  RSF renewed its assault. Nhongo personally went to the front to increase the moral of his troops, using a big stick to hit the reluctants. Guided by a Westland Lynx helicopter, Hawker Hunter attack jets neutralized ZANLA fortifications in Hill 774. The position was taken at 3 pm by a troop of the Selous Scouts. English Electric Canberra bombers also bombed the anti-aircraft positions.  Third day  During the night, RSF artillery fired at ZANLA positions, not to make damages but to prevent the partisans to rest. At 10 am, two troops of Selous Scouts and a RLI section (around 100 men) led an assault to Monte Cassino. The summit was taken after the partisans had retreated, as was Hill 761. At the end of that day, Nhongo ordered his fighters to retreat During the late night, FRELIMO sent three or more T-34 or T-54 tanks and a squad of infantry to support the Rhodesian rebels but RSF 25-pounders quickly reacted, guided by Rhodesian SAS, and the tanks retreated after the lead tank was put out of action.  Consequences  The Rhodesian force withdrew on the next morning, taking captured equipment with them. To avoid retaliation attacks from Mozambique, the Rhodesian Air Force bombed FRELIMO facilities but one Canberra and one Hunter were shut down. The battle had no consequences on the Lancaster House discussions.

It was designed by Edwin Morton Hockings and built in 1914. It is also known as River Motors Pty Ltd, Rockhampton Motors Garage and Engineers, and Sydney V Golik and Co Motor and Car Truck Dealers. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Edwards Chambers was constructed in 1914 as a motor garage for the Howard Motor & Cycle company of Rockhampton. It is representative of an early motor garage in a provincial city. The Archer brothers had made a private expedition to the Rockhampton district in 1853, and were the first Europeans to record and chart the Fitzroy River. In 1855 the Archers overlanded cattle to the region of the Fitzroy. After the short lived Canoona gold rush of 1858 Rockhampton was proclaimed as a town and declared a \\"port of entry\\" in 1858. The first sale of town allotments was held in Rockhampton on 17 and 18 November in the same year. In May 1859 Frederick Robert Hutchinson applied for title to land along the forefront of what is now Quay Street not far from the Archer landing place. Hutchinson had been an early arrival in Rockhampton. At the time of the Canoona gold rush he was appointed as the Clerk of Petty Sessions. For Hutchinson this was a time of great social disturbance coping with the aftermath of several thousand diggers descending onto a settlement consisting of three buildings and a small wharf. In May 1859 Huthchinson had written a letter to the New South Wales colonial government in Sydney (the separation of Queensland did not occur until December 1859) requesting the construction of a public wharf (Queens wharf) for the loading and unloading of vessels. In the same period Hutchinson was also requesting that the government provide public works in Rockhampton especially roads, as the tracks existing in the town at that time were impassable. In 1860 Hutchinson, Hunter and Company established a store at this location in Quay Street. The store traded mainly for pastoralists heading into the interior of central Queensland. In June 1895 a Certificate of Title was issued on Allotment 7 of Section 45. The Certificate of title was issued to George Ranken of Young, and Harriet Ann Cathcart Hutchinson of Windsor. She was described as being the widow of Frederick Hutchinson, orchardist of Mildura. George Ranken died on 6 May 1895. In October 1913 James Howard purchased the property. James Howard was a well known name in the motor vehicle and cycle business in Rockhampton. Howard had a business listed in the Post Office Directory as a bicycle depot and importer since 1897. In 1898 James Howard's father William had constructed for himself the first motor cycle in Rockhampton, a tandem bicycle with a single cylinder 4 h.p. engine attached. The Howard business was situated at 95 East Street opposite the Rockhampton Post Office. The business acted as a cycle importer until 1907, when Howard & Co. listed themselves as \\"cycle and motor dealers.\\" Howard & Co. was one of the first businesses in Rockhampton to cater for the sale of motor vehicles and motorcycles. The horseless carriage had made its first appearance in central Queensland in 1902 when Dr FH Voss became the owner of a steam powered locomobile. He eventually sold this vehicle to W Howard who then converted it into a car powered by an internal combustion engine. W Howard was referred to as the father of the automobile industry in Rockhampton. Howard & Co opened a branch of the company in Brisbane in 1903. Premises were initially at 333 Queen Street, before moving to 376 Queen Street in 1906. A new showroom, workshop and garage was opened at 303 Adelaide Street in 1909. Howard & Co were also to open other branches of the business in Hope Street, South Brisbane, Ipswich, Maryborough and Neil Street, Toowoomba, at later periods. Agencies for the company were to expand into most country towns in Queensland. The Adelaide Street building was described in 1913 as being a spacious and handsome motor garage. The workshop, garage and display area occupied half an acre of floor space. The company at this period employed between 60 and 80 people in Brisbane, and was producing 1000 bicycles a year from its workshops. In 1909 the Rockhampton Post Office directory listed the business as Howard Motor and Cycle Co. Ltd (late Jas Howard & Co.), cycle & motor manufacturers and importers, indicating a name change by the company. In the 1913-4 directory the business was listed as being the Rockhampton branch of Howard Motor & Cycle Co. Ltd \\"carrying large stocks of cycle and motor sundries.\\" Repairs were carried out on motor cars, motor cycles and bicycles in the East Street office and workshops. Howard Motor & Cycle Co Ltd operated the motor dealership for vehicles from companies such as Buick, Cadillac, Dennis motor lorries, Wolseley, B.S.A. and motor cycles from Triumph and New Hudson. In the period of 1906-15 four bicycle and motor dealers were trading in Rockhampton, Howard Motor & Cycle Co Ltd, A E Beal, Canada Cycle & Motor Agency at the corner of William and Fitzroy Streets, and Theo Kingel's bicycle factory in Bolsover street which was the local Ford dealer. The C C M Garage was the largest of the garages operating in Rockhampton until 1914. The evolution of motor transport in Rockhampton was similar to the experience in Brisbane. Private vehicles were imported from overseas manufacturers, sold by the local dealerships, and maintained by the companies mentioned above. By October 1913 The Morning Bulletin commented on the growth of the motor industry, with vehicles being purchased for commercial purposes, and the modifications carried out by local workshops and garages: > \\"Motor vehicles are gradually being brought into use in Rockhampton for > business purposes... Messrs T McLaughlin have purchased from the Howard > Motor and Cycle Company, a two ton Dennis four cylinder, twenty eight horse > power motor lorry... The body of the lorry was built by Mr Walley and fitted > up in the Howard Motor Cycle Company's garage.\\" Following Howard's purchase of the land in Quay Street in October, tenders were called by Edwin Morton Hockings, the architect on 15 December 1913 for the erection of a concrete garage in Quay Street for the Howard Motor & Cycle Company. The new garage was part of the expansion and diversification of the company in Rockhampton. Edwin Morton Hockings (1870-1942) was the son of Albert John Hockings one of the early mayors of Brisbane. Edwin Hockings was educated at Brisbane Grammar School, and became the articled pupil of architect Richard Gailey. In 1890 Hockings won a design competition for the Rockhampton Girls Grammar School. Gailey's office took over documentation of the building and Hockings went to Rockhampton as clerk of works. He began his own architectural practice in Rockhampton in the mid 1890s. Hockings enlisted and served in the Third Queensland Contingent during the Boer War, and re- enlisted and served during the First World War. Hockings formed partnerships with A M Hutton from 1898 until 1904 and LT Palmer from 1916 until 1938. Hockings was architect on buildings such as St Peter's Church of England, Barcaldine (1898‚Äì99) and the Rockhampton Town Hall (1939‚Äì41). On 1 July 1914 a lease was taken out by Howard Motor & Cycle Co. Ltd for five years at per year on 174 Quay Street. The garage was opened by July 1914, as advertisements in the Morning Bulletin refer to the Howard Motor & Cycle Co. garage in Quay Street. The business was referred to as Howard's Motor Garage. Howard Motor & Cycle Co. Ltd also continued to trade from the East Street premises, using these as its show rooms. Howard's Motor Garage registered itself as an importer of motor cars and accessories, with repair work by skilled mechanics. The building was designed as a motor show room and garage, with two entrances either side of the central show/ work area. Access to the front part of the building was through the arched doorways. Motor vehicles from companies such as Buick were delivered by ship to the town wharves. Vehicles were then driven up Quay Street to the Motor Garage from the wharves. In 1927-28 the Howard Motor Garage was renamed the Rockhampton Motor Garage and Engineers, although it traded as Rockhampton Motors Ltd. The Howard Motor & Cycle Co Ltd had changed its name in 1925 and transferred the lease on the property to ownership. In 1929 Howard Motor Co Ltd changed its name to Howard Investment Co Ltd. The Howard Investment Co. Ltd had a further name change to Howard Ltd in 1932. The Howard Motor Garage changed its name in 1938 to become River Motors Pty Ltd - Motor Car Dealers. River Motors opened a second office at 72 William Street, Rockhampton in 1941. A plan of the re-subdivision of allotment 7 in June 1945 shows a main building identified as River Motors with several ancillary buildings fronting on to Quay Lane. These are identified as a lavatory fronting on to Quay Lane (enlarged in 1944), wood and fibro shower sheds, and a shed. Two areas were also identified at the rear of the allotment as being a washing section and a greasing section. A gate gave access on to Quay Lane between the washing section and lavatories. The dealership changed hands in 1947 to become Sydney V Golik and Co. Motor Car and Truck Dealers. The premises in Quay Street continued to be run as a motor show room, however an addition had been made to the rear of the building when a galvanised extension was constructed to act as a workshop and repair facility. Agricultural vehicles such as tractors and ploughs, were also displayed on the premises. At the time that the dealership changed hands a large electric advertising sign was fixed to the front of the building. A photograph from 1955 shows the building with an awning smaller than the present one affixed to the front of the building. In 1959, CJ Edwards and Co. Ltd bought the property from Howard Ltd. The former garage, workshop and showroom was then converted into several businesses operating from the one building in 1960 at a cost of . C J Edwards was a public accountant company, leasing several professional offices and businesses. With the change in use of the building from a workshop to offices major internal changes were made to the building but the ceiling was left untouched. Garage space for the tenants was also increased in 1963. Various tenants in the chambers have included apart from CJ Edwards real estate agents as well as other semi professional offices. In 1987 further alterations were made to offices in the interior of the building. In 2015, the building is occupied by a number of businesses including Foxlaw.  Description  Edwards Chambers is a simple single storeyed building on Quay Street Rockhampton, situated overlooking the Fitzroy River. The building extends to the Quay Lane boundary of the site, with access provided via a doorway to the rear of the adjacent Trustee Chambers' site. The building is constructed with rendered masonry walls supporting a corrugated iron roof. The roof has a hipped section running parallel to the Quay Street facade perpendicular to which two long hipped sections run, forming a U-shaped ridge, ventilated in places with a long corrugated iron ridge ventilators. The roof is partially concealed by the Quay Street facade which extends beyond the line of the roof and on the long elevations by simple parapets. The Quay Street facade of the building is symmetrically composed and dominated by a cantilevered awning running along the entire face and interrupting the composition. The facade comprises a central section with decorative, curved parapet profile, capped with a decorative moulding. The face of the parapet has the lettering \\"EDWARDS CHAMBERS\\" painted centrally and the number of the building above. At the street level of this section several openings for both windows and glazed doors have been inserted, and these are separated by corbelled mouldings. Flanking this central section are symmetrical end bays featuring large archways with architraves and keystone and voussoir elements scoured in the render. Though previously opened these archways, identifiable only above the awning, have been filled with glazed doors and windows, forming shopfronts. A panelled section of rendered masonry forms the parapet to these end bays. The south eastern side party wall is shared with the one storeyed building adjacent to Edwards Chambers. The north western concrete wall has several small infilled openings at the far end where toilets are located internally. Surface mounted water pipes run the over this wall. Because the building was originally a showroom, the interior was simply designed as a large open space and is therefore with subsequent renovation devoid of any features which suggest its early date. A 1970s office fitout has been inserted into the building and this comprises a central hall off which many small tenancies are accessed. These are formed with glazed and plasterboard partitioning, a suspended ceiling grid with fibrous cement panels, and a ceramic tiled floor. Many of the walls in the offices are veneered with acrylic timber cladding and carpeted. The rear section of the building, separated by a concrete wall is a large unceiled shed which extends to the Quay Lane boundary.  Heritage listing  C J Edwards Chambers was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Edwards Chambers built as a car garage is important in demonstrating the evolution of motor transport in Rockhampton and central Queensland. The building demonstrates the servicing requirements associated with the introduction of motor transport in the early part of the twentieth century. Edwards Chambers is an example of a purpose built motor vehicle garage and service centre established in a provincial centre in Queensland in the early twentieth century, and is a surviving example of a substantially intact motor garage building. Edwards Chambers has architectural significance as an example of a precursor to modernism linked with the establishment of motor transport. The building illustrates an early parallel between the development of the automobile industry and the design of the buildings accommodating this industry. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Edwards Chambers has an association with the development of the motor industry in Rockhampton, and the company founded by Howard & Co which was one of the first businesses in Rockhampton to cater for the sale of motor vehicles and motorcycles. Howard & Co were to establish branches in Brisbane and throughout Queensland to become one of the major automotive dealers and suppliers in the state in the period of 1920- 1950. Edwards Chambers has a special association with the life and work of E M Hockings, architect. Hockings practiced in Rockhampton from the mid 1890s until 1940, producing some of the regions most impressive edifices, including the Rockhampton Girls Grammar School (1890), St Peter's Church of England, Barcaldine (1898-9) and the Rockhampton City Hall (1939‚Äì41).

Altena was a tobacco farm owned by Marc de Borchgrave, a white Rhodesian landowner who was unpopular among the local civilians. Some sources have indicated that this marked the beginning of the conflict proper, despite the minor threat already represented by guerrilla movements in Rhodesia in the late 1960s. Background Rhodesian intelligence, which had been monitoring ZANLA's activity and preparations, grew curious when over a four-week period in November 1972 sources of information suddenly began to \\"dry up\\", in the words of historian Alexandre Binda. \\"They sensed that something was afoot, but their superiors brushed off their fears,\\" Binda says. \\"The senior Rhodesian authorities had been lulled into a sense of arrogant self-confidence based on the security forces' past successes.\\" This false veneer of security was smashed on 21 December 1972 when a group of ten ZANLA cadres led by Rex Nhongo attacked the white-owned Altena Farm near the north-eastern village of Centenary, about west of Mount Darwin. ZANLA had planned for four attacks to take place simultaneously but in the event only Nhongo's men did so. According to the historian Elaine Windrich, Nhongo was a former employee of the tobacco farm's 37-year-old owner, Marc de Borchgrave, and held a grudge against him. The Raid Having established a presence in the nearby Chiweshe Tribal Trust Territory, a cadre of Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) insurgents armed with AK-47s, hand grenades, and at least one light machine gun (most likely an RPD) trekked about six miles to reach Altena. A list of white farmers in the Centenary district was drawn up and de Borchgrave was marked for elimination due to his poor reputation among black farmworkers. Farmers known for their popularity in the workforce were also identified and removed from the list of potential targets. Cadre leader Rex Nhongo planned to carry out the attack and observe follow-up operations carried out by the Rhodesian Security Forces. Around three o'clock that morning, the guerrillas cut the telephone lines and laid a land mine in the driveway. Nhongo undertook a reconnaissance of the farmhouse before the attack commenced. Each insurgent then expended at least two magazines of ammunition apiece at the structure. Hand grenades were also thrown. Despite the damage caused to the structure, only de Borchgrave's eight-year-old daughter Jane was injured. Deducing that Nhongo may have mined the driveway, de Borchgrave set off on foot to seek assistance. The insurgents retreated, burning down what they believed to be a white-owned store during the withdrawal. Rex Nhongo was later stopped and questioned by some members of the British South Africa Police, but as his identity documents were in order and he had concealed his weapons, he was not detained. Aftermath Late on the 22 December, a troop from the Rhodesian Special Air Service, followed shortly by the Rhodesian Light Infantry, reported to the police station in Centenary. The land mine in Altena's driveway was discovered, disarmed and removed. For their own safety, Marc de Borchgrave and his family were sent to another farm while their home was being repaired. Having been alerted to the de Borchgraves' new location through sympathetic farmworkers, guerrillas from the original cadre requested permission from ZANLA to carry out another attack. After ZANLA's area commanders in Centenary had been consulted, a raid on the second target (Whistlefield Farm) was planned. The property was owned by an Archie Dalgleish. At about one o'clock on the morning of 23 December, the insurgents reconnoitred Whistlefield Farm and shelled the structure with mortar fire. An RPG-7 was also discharged at the window of the de Borchgraves' bedroom. Several occupants, including de Borchgrave, were slightly wounded. ZANLA claimed that Rhodesian troops posted within shouting distance of the home responded to the scene and saved the lives of Dalgleish and his guests by engaging the assailants. Six huts and a mosque in the farmworkers' compound were also torched during the skirmish, although accounts differ on who started the fire.

Books written by Dr. Prajapati Trivedi Dr. Trivedi has authored the following books: * Applied Microeconomics for Public Policy Makers ‚Äì A Provisional Text International Management Publisher, India () Year 1991 This book is a guided tour through an economist's workshop, introducing readers to various microeconomic concepts and their utility in analyzing economic problems. However, unlike many textbooks, this book does not present microeconomics as just one thing after another. The choice of topics was guided by one over-riding criterion: Whether the concept included in the book is useful for understanding or analyzing economic policies, in general, and public policies, in particular. For every concept included, this book answers the following questions: (a) Why do we need the concept? (b) What is it all about? (c) How can it be used? (d) What are its limitations? This book differs from other microeconomics texts in another more fundamental way. Each policy is analyzed primarily from the 'public' perspective rather than 'private' perspective. That is, it focuses on 'costs' and 'benefits' from the society's point of view rather than an individual's point of view. It does not, however supplant the private perspective, rather, it supplements it. This book has emerged out of the author's lecture notes which have been used for more than four decades at several workshops (e.g., Public Enterprise Workshop and Budget Workshop) organized by the erstwhile Harvard Institute for International Development (HIID) and the Mid-Career Masters Programme in Public Administration (MPA) at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University. In addition, this book has been used in training programs at the World Bank. Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Public Administration, and in regular courses taught at leading universities in the United States, India and Singapore. * How to Implement Privatization Transactions ‚Äì A Manual for Practitioners Rutledge Books, USA () Year 2000 One of the first such practical toolkits for privatization written in early 90s. This book demystifies the process of implementing privatization transactions and shares international experience in privatization implementation. It is a practical guide that informs the reader in simple, non-ideological, and clear terms of the various steps in implementing a privatization decision. The focus is on the \\"how to\\" aspects of implementing privatization rather than the \\"why to\\" side of the privatization debate. This book: (a) Provides an overall understanding of the privatization process; (b) Assists in the planning the logistics to implement the privatization decisions; (c) Facilitates in the implementation of the privatization transaction; (d) Guides in the supervision of consultants (financial advisors) recruited to implement the privatization transaction; (e) Improves the design of privatization policies by painting a realistic picture of the implementation phase. This manual for practitioners will be useful to policymakers responsible for implementing privatization transactions, those attending or running training programs on privatization, and those who serve as privatization consultants and advisors on both sides of the privatization transaction. \\"How to Implement Privatization Transactions\\" is also replete with ready-made tools for speedy implementation of a privatization transaction. Examples of these tools include the following: * Sample forms and tables which as be adapted for use in most privatization transactions. * Sample outlines and documents which offer samples of real-life, best practice documents used in various countries. * Sample advertisements can be most helpful in kicking off a fast-track implementation program. Amazon * Memorandum of Understanding ‚Äì An Approach to Improving Public Enterprise Performance International Management Publisher, India () Year 1990 The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is a major policy initiative of the Indian Government towards its public enterprises. Currently more than 100 of the largest public enterprises, accounting for approximately 95 percent of the total public sector turnover in India, sign MOUs with the Government. The concept of the MOU is very straightforward. Essentially, it is a contract between the Government and a public enterprise in which the two parties come to a mutual understanding regarding the targets to be fulfilled by the public enterprise and the corresponding obligations of the Government which are considered essential to ensure the fulfillment of these targets. It is also referred to as Performance Contract, performance Agreement, Contratos de Rendemientos, etc. in different parts of the world. However, curiously enough, there is tremendous misunderstanding regarding this important subject. A major reason for this lack of public discussion is the fact that there is hardly any material available on MOUs. This book was the first of its kind on this important subject. It brings together a rare collection of reading dealing with the international experience with MOUs. The book is divided into seven sections. The first one presents an overview of the conceptual and empirical issues relating to MOUs. The subsequent sections deal with the experience of MOU type approaches in France, Senegal, Pakistan, Korea and Bangladesh. The last section documents the Indian experience with regard to the design and implementation of MOUs. Using his vast experience and familiarity with the public enterprise literature, Professor Prajapati Trivedi has carefully selected a set of papers and documents that have become essential reading for policy makers, academicians and public enterprise managers dealing with MOUs, not only in India but around the world. Amazon * A Critique of Public Enterprise Policy International Management Publisher, India () Year 1992 This book contains a collection of original papers written and published by Professor Prajapati Trivedi on various aspects of public enterprise management and policy. While the book is centered around the Indian public enterprise policy, the issues (problems and solutions) discussed in the book are truly transcendental in their relevance. Policy makers from other countries have found it equally relevant to their context. The distinguishing feature of this book is a common framework for analyzing various aspects of public enterprise policy. This approach allows the reader to see the interrelationships between them and is also designing public policies that are consistent with each other. The unifying conceptual framework used in the book has come to be known as the Signaling System Approach. According to this framework, the root cause of most of the problems associated with public enterprises can be traced to the fact that they are confronted with multiple principals who have multiple goals, which are often conflicting. The book describes various approaches to manage public enterprises and design public policies given this background. The book contains nine sections dealing with the following areas of public enterprise policy: # Origins of Public Enterprises # Performance Evaluation of Public Enterprises # Comparative Performance of Public and Private Enterprises # Institutional Arrangements for Managing Public Enterprises # Performance Information Systems for Public Enterprises # Public Enterprise Pricing Policies # Expert Committees on Public Enterprises # Issues Relating to Motivation (incentives) in Public Enterprises # Privatization of Public Enterprises This unique book combines state of the art in public enterprise theory as well as practical insights regarding the design and implementation of public enterprise policy. It is an essential reading for all students of public enterprise management and policy. * Performance Management in Government ‚Äì A Primer for Leaders Commonwealth Secretariat, London SW1Y5HX, UK Governments are complex, multi-layered organisations and, not surprisingly, government effectiveness and efficiency have many dimensions. However, the diversity that exists among nations and their governments tends to obscure three key facts. First, many of the problems involved in managing government are a result of a few underlying causes. Second, the underlying causes of poor government performance are similar in nature across a diverse set of countries. Third, countries have successfully dealt with these (few) underlying causes using remarkably similar approaches. Viewed in this light, the challenge of government performance management appears more manageable. Written succinctly in non-technical language, this book is meant to help government leaders identify the underlying causes of poor government performance and then apply proven strategies to fix these. The book cautions Government leaders against the natural temptation to cure the symptoms - this approach represents a temporary solution at best, and the list of symptoms can be too large to fix. Fixing underlying causes, on the other hand provides a more sustainable long-term solution. www.thecommonwealth.org * Performance Related Pay ‚Äì A Primer on 7th Pay Commission Indian School of Business, Mohali, December 2015 This book fills a perceived glaring void in the availability of information on the key building blocks for the Seventh pay Commission recommendations on Performance Related Pay (PRP). It brings together at one place all relevant information for making an informed decision about the merits of the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations on PRP. The three building blocks for the recommendations for the PRP are: Results- Framework Document (RFD), Performance-Related Incentive Scheme (PRIS) and Annual Performance Appraisal Report (APAR). It is hard to fully appreciate the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission without a solid understanding of these three distinct though interrelated concepts. This Primer includes three sections giving details of these concepts. These sections are designed to be self-contained essays and can be read individually.

It was directed by Mahesh Kothare. It was inspired by the 1988 Hollywood movie Child's Play. It's followed by the sequel Zapatlela 2, released 20 years later (in 2013). The film was remade in Telugu in the year 2001, with the title Ammo Bomma, with Rajendra Prasad playing the lead role. The film has the renowned artist ventriloquist Ramdas Padhye along with his famous evil puppet Tatya Vinchu. The film stars Laxmikant Berde as Laxmikant Bolke, with Mahesh Kothare as CID Inspector Mahesh Jadhav and Dilip Prabhavalkar as Tatya Vinchu. This film was also dubbed into Hindi as Khilona Bana Khalnayak. Plot The film begins with a car approaching at night. Tatya Vinchu (Dilip Prabhavalkar), a famous gangster and his henchman Kubdya Khavis enter the cave of Baba Chamatkar (Raghvendra Kadkol) in search for mrutunjay mantra, a voodoo spell which can transfer the soul of the chanter to any living or nonliving object. Tatya threatens Baba Chamatkar for his mantra. Baba, out of fear, gives it to him. CID Inspector Mahesh Jadhav (Mahesh Kothare), who is trying to arrest Tatya, raids his warehouse. Mahesh finds Tatya, and gives chase until Tatya hides in a post office. There, they fight and Tatya gets hit by a fatal gunshot. He uses the mantra to transfer his soul into the body of a ventriloquist's doll lying nearby. Meanwhile, Kubdya Khavis is captured and taken into custody. The police believe that Tatya is dead. Gauri (Kishori Ambiye) returns from USA to India for pursuing PHD in Criminal Psychology. In the meantime Gauri's father gets transferred to Shrirangpur. She meets her brother Lakshya. Lakshya has a talent of ventriloquism, and Gauri gives him a doll as a gift she got from USA, which happens to be the doll in which Tatya Vinchu's soul is trapped. Tatya tells Lakshya that he is not a doll, he is a criminal. Later, the Sarpanch of the village is insulted when Lakshya publicly makes fun of him. He takes all of Lakshya's belongings on the pretext of unpaid rent. He also takes Tatya Vinchu. Tatya Vinchu shows his true identity and kills him. Lakshya gets home, only to find his house completely ransacked by Sarpanch's men. An angry Lakshya goes to the Sarpanch's godown (warehouse), where he sees that the Sarpanch is dead. Just then, Mahesh comes in the scene and thinks that out of rage, Lakshya has killed the Sarpanch. In jail, Lakshya desperately tries to explain, but fails to prove his point. The doll is also kept as evidence. Tatya rises from the evidence box and asks Lakshya about transport which would get him to Mumbai. Lakshya in fear of Tatya tells him. Post-mortem reports prove the innocence of Lakshya and he is freed. Mahesh and Gauri confess to each other their love. Tatya reaches Mumbai in the Cave of Baba Chamatkar, where he asks him how to get transferred from a puppet to a mortal human body. Baba disagrees to give him further knowledge, but Tatya threatens him and makes him tell. He understands to become mortal again he has gain the body of the 1st person whom he has told his name and that person is Lakshya. Tatya goes back to Shrirangpur to gain the body of Lakshya. One night he climbs through the window and attempts to possess Lakshya's body, but Lakshya manages to lock him in the cupboard. In the morning Lakshya's lover Gangi takes Tatya out from cupboard and buries him underground, to cure Lakshya from his anxiety on the night's events. Tatya still manages to dig his way out and scares Lakshya. All the villagers think that Lakshya is going crazy and forcefully hospitalize him into a mental hospital. Tatya attempts to possess Lakshya again, but Lakshya escapes just in time. Lakshya, scared, runs away home. Meanwhile, Mahesh gets the whereabouts of Baba Chamatkar's cave. He approaches Baba and gets the truth about the possessed doll. Baba says that the only way to defeat the doll is to shoot him between his eyebrows. Mahesh comes back to Shrirangpur, in order to save Lakshya. Tatya meets Kubdya, who has escaped from prison. He tells him about Lakshya, and Kubdya takes him to Lakshya's house. Tatya once again attempts to possess him. Mahesh reaches Lakshya's home just in time at Shrirangpur, where he and Kubdya fight. Meanwhile, Tatya chases Lakshya all the way to the terrace of the house. Mahesh injures Kubdya and reaches there just in time. But Tatya pushes him and he almost falls, hanging to the edge of the roof. Tatya then takes advantage of this situation and starts saying the mantra to possess Lakshya. When Tatya is just about to say the last verse, Mahesh gets up just in time and fires a shot from his gun, and it hits Tatya Vinchu in between the eyebrows. The doll falls down, now lifeless. Kubdya is taken in custody again. The film ends with the renowned ventriloquist Ramdas Padhye giving a present to Lakshya in the presence of Mahesh; it turns out to be a doll. Due to his fear of dolls since the incident, Lakshya yells at Mahesh in fear as the movie ends.

He constructed the first railway in India and later built railways in Ceylon and South Africa.  Biography  Faviell was born in 1822 in Yorkshire. Son of a builder of bridges and canals, he began to work as a railway engineer on the Great Eastern Railway in Colchester with two of his brothers. Later, he decided to move his interests overseas and built railways in India, Ceylon and South Africa. Back in England, he bought the estate of Down Place in the Surrey where he lived with his wife Sarah and their six children until 1890. There, he decided to create one of the first Model Farm of the South of England at Blackwell Farm. He employed Henry Peak to design the new building. He died on 3 July 1902 at Tunbridge Wells. Work =India= Bhor Ghat incline of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway In 1850, Faviell obtained the contract to build the first section of railway in India. Although the idea came in 1843 from the chief engineer of the Bombay Government G. T. Clark, the construction of the 15.75-mile route began 7 years after under the direction of Faviell. It connected Bombay with Thane, Kalyan and with the Thal and Bhor Ghat inclines. Given the topography of the area on the crest of the Western Ghat mountain ranges, about 42,000 workers had to travel 15‚Äì20 miles each day carrying an estimated 6,296,061 cubic yards of earthwork on their heads. The low wages and the working conditions resulted in a riot in January 1859. Europeans were attacked by the Indian workforce with sticks and stones. Finally, Faviell gave up his contract in 1859 and was replaced by Solomon Tredwell. =Ceylon= In 1863, Faviell began a new project of railway from Colombo through the hills of Kandy. In spite of the difficult geographical condition, the construction of the 73-mile route was a success when it was finished four years later. =South Africa= His last foreign contract was in South Africa in 1877, where he undertook to extend the Port Elizabeth railway, then only 67 miles long, into the interior in the direction of Cradock and Graaff-Reinet.

It was built in two parts to match the UK's Gee system, and could be swapped with Gee in a few minutes. LORAN, short for long range navigation, was a hyperbolic radio navigation system developed in the United States during World War II. It was similar to the UK's Gee system but operated at lower frequencies in order to provide an improved range up to with an accuracy of tens of miles. It was first used for ship convoys crossing the Atlantic Ocean, and then by long- range patrol aircraft, but found its main use on the ships and aircraft operating in the Pacific theater during World War II. LORAN, in its original form, was an expensive system to implement, requiring a cathode ray tube (CRT) display. This limited use to the military and large commercial users. Automated receivers became available in the 1950s, but the same improved electronics also opened the possibility of new systems with higher accuracy. The U.S. Navy began development of Loran-B, which offered accuracy on the order of a few tens of feet, but ran into significant technical problems. The U.S. Air Force worked on a different concept, Cyclan, which the Navy took over as Loran-C, which offered longer range than LORAN and accuracy of hundreds of feet. The U.S. Coast Guard took over operations of both systems in 1958. In spite of the dramatically improved performance of Loran-C, LORAN, now known as Loran-A (or \\"Standard LORAN\\"), would become much more popular during this period. This was due largely to the large numbers of surplus Loran-A units released from the Navy as ships and aircraft replaced their sets with Loran-C. The widespread introduction of inexpensive microelectronics during the 1980s caused Loran-C receivers to drop in price dramatically, and Loran-A use began to rapidly decline. Loran-A was dismantled starting in the 1970s; it remained active in North America until 1980 and the rest of the world until 1985. A Japanese chain remained on the air until 9 May 1997, and a Chinese chain was still listed as active as of 2000. Loran-A used two frequency bands, at 1.85 and 1.95 MHz. These same frequencies were used by radio amateurs, in the amateur radio 160-meter band, and amateur operators were under strict rules to operate at reduced power levels to avoid interference; depending on their location and distance to the shore, U.S. operators were limited to maximums of 200 to 500 watts during the day and 50 to 200 watts at night. History =Project 3= At a 1 October 1940 meeting of the U.S. Army Signal Corps' Technical Committee, Alfred Loomis, chair of the Microwave Committee, proposed building a hyperbolic navigation system. He predicted that such a system could provide an accuracy of at least at a range of , and a maximum range of for high-flying aircraft. This led to the \\"Precision Navigational Equipment for Guiding Airplanes\\" specification, which was sent back to the Microwave Committee and formed up as \\"Project 3\\". Orders for initial systems were sent out at a follow-up meeting on 20 December 1940. Edward George Bowen, developer of the first airborne radar systems, was also at the 20 December meeting. He stated that he was aware of similar work in the UK, but didn't know enough about it to offer any suggestions. Project 3 moved to the newly formed Radiation Laboratory's Navigation Group in 1941. Early systems operated around 30 MHz, but it was later decided to try experiments with different equipment that could be tuned from 3 to 8 MHz. These lower frequency systems were found to be much more stable electronically. After first considering setting up transmitters on mountain peaks, the team instead settled on two abandoned Coast Guard stations at Montauk Point, New York, and Fenwick Island, Delaware. On the receiving end, a station wagon was fitted with a simple receiver and sent around the country looking for solid signals, which were found as far away as Springfield, Missouri. For a production system, the team began working with a system using a circular J-scope display for improved accuracy. The more common A-scope represents distances across the diameter of the tube, while the J-scope presents this as the angle around the cathode ray tube's face. This increases the amount of room on the scale by a factor of œÄ for any given display size, improving accuracy. In spite of using the J-scope, and adopting the lower frequency change for more stability, the team found accurate measurements of range quite difficult. At the time, the procedure for generating sharp pulses of signals was in its infancy, and their signals were considerably spread out in time, making measurements difficult. By this time the team had become aware of the UK's Gee efforts, and were aware that Gee used a system of electronically generated strobes that produced pips on the display that were accurately aligned with system timing. They sent a team to the UK to learn about the strobe concept, and immediately adopted it for their work. As part of this exchange, the Project 3 team also found that Gee was almost identical to their own system in concept and desired performance. Unlike their system, Gee had largely completed development and was proceeding to production. The decision was made to abandon the current efforts, use Gee on their own aircraft, and re-develop their system for the long-range role instead. =LORAN= AN/APN-4 LORAN in RCAF Canso (PBY) aircraft. The decision to switch to the long-range role meant that the high accuracy of the Gee system was not needed, which greatly reduced the need to address the timing problems. This change in purpose also demanded the use of even lower frequencies, which could reflect off the ionosphere at night and thus provide over-the-horizon operation. Two frequency bands were initially selected, 1.85 and 1.95 MHz for nighttime use (160 meters), and 7.5 MHz (40 meters). The 7.5 MHz, labeled \\"HF\\" on early receivers, was never used operationally. In mid-1942, Robert Dippy, the lead developer of the Gee system at the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) in the UK, was sent to the US for eight months to help with LORAN development. At the time the project was being driven primarily by Captain Harding of the U.S. Navy, and they were concentrating entirely on a shipboard system. Dippy convinced them that an airborne version was definitely possible, leading to some interest by the U.S. Army Air Force. The Navy was unhappy about this turn of events. Dippy also instituted a number of simple changes that would prove extremely useful in practice. Among these, he outright demanded that the airborne LORAN receivers be built physically similar to the Gee receivers, so that they could be swapped out in service simply by replacing the receiver unit. This would prove extremely useful; RAF Transport Command aircraft could swap their receivers when moving to or from the Australian theatre. Dippy also designed the ground station timing equipment. It was around this time that the project was joined by both the U.S. Coast Guard and the Royal Canadian Navy. The project was still top secret at this time, and little actual information was shared, especially with the Coast Guard. The Canadian liaison was required, as ideal siting for the stations would require several stations in various locations in the Canadian Maritime Provinces. One site in Nova Scotia proved to be a battle; the site was owned by a fisherman whose domineering teetotaler wife was dead set against having anything to do with the sinful Navy men. When the site selection committee of J.A. Waldschmitt and Lt. Cdmr. Argyle were discussing the matter with the husband, a third visitor arrived and he offered the men cigarettes. They refused, and the hostess then asked if they drank. When they said they did not, the land was quickly secured. LORAN was soon ready for deployment, and the first chain went live in June 1942 at Montauk and Fenwick. This was joined shortly thereafter by two stations in Newfoundland, at Bonavista and Battle Harbour, and then by two stations in Nova Scotia, at Baccaro and Deming Island. Additional stations all along the U.S. and Canadian east coast were installed through October, and the system was declared operational in early 1943. By the end of that year additional stations had been installed in Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands and the Hebrides, offering continuous coverage across the North Atlantic. RAF Coastal Command had another station installed in Shetland, offering coverage over Norway, a major staging ground for German U-boats and capital ships. =Expansion= The enormous distances and lack of useful navigation points in the Pacific Ocean led to widespread use of LORAN for both ships and aircraft during the Pacific War. In particular, the accuracy offered by LORAN allowed aircraft to reduce the amount of extra fuel they would otherwise have to carry to ensure they could find their base after a long mission. This reduced fuel load allowed the bombload to be increased. By the end of World War II there were 72 LORAN stations, with over 75,000 receivers in use. Additional chains in the Pacific were added in the post-war era. A spurt in construction followed the opening of the Korean War, including new chains in Japan and one at Busan, Korea. Chains were also installed in China, prior to the ultimate end of the Chinese Communist Revolution, and these stations remained on the air at least into the 1990s. A final major expansion took place in Portugal and the Azores in 1965, offering additional coverage to the mid-Atlantic. =SS LORAN = During early experiments with LORAN's skywaves, Jack Pierce noticed that at night the reflective layer in the ionosphere was quite stable. This led to the possibility that two LORAN stations could be synchronized using skywave signals, at least at night, allowing them to be separated over much greater distances. Accuracy of a hyperbolic system is a function of the baseline distance, so if the stations could be spread out, the system would become more accurate, so fewer stations would be needed for any desired navigational task. A test system was first attempted on 10 April 1943 between the LORAN stations at Fenwick and Bonavista, away. This test demonstrated accuracy of ¬Ω mile, significantly better than normal LORAN. This led to a second round of tests in late 1943, this time using four stations, Montauk, East Brewster, Massachusetts, Gooseberry Falls, Missouri, and Key West, Florida. Extensive evaluation flights revealed an average error of . The nighttime mode of operation was a perfect fit for RAF Bomber Command. The four test stations were dismantled and shipped across the Atlantic, and re- installed to form two chains, Aberdeen-Bizerta, and Oran-Benghazi. Known as Skywave-Synchronized LORAN, or SS LORAN, the system provided coverage anywhere south of Scotland and as far east as Poland with an average accuracy of one mile. The system was used operationally in October 1944, and by 1945 it was universally installed in No. 5 Group RAF. The same basic concept was also tested post-war by the Coast Guard in a system known as \\"Skywave Long Baseline LORAN\\". The only difference was the selection of different frequencies, 10.585 MHz in the day, and at 2 MHz at night. Initial tests were carried out in May 1944 between Chatham, Massachusetts, and Fernandina, Florida, and a second set between Hobe Sound, Florida, and Point Chinato, Puerto Rico, in December‚ÄìJanuary 1945‚Äì46. The system was not put into operation, due to a lack of suitable frequency allocations. = Loran-B and C= LORAN was a simple system that compared the arrival times of pulses to make a measurement. Ideally, perfectly formed rectangular blips would be displayed on the CRT, whose leading edge could be compared with a high degree of accuracy. In practice, the transmitters cannot turn on and off instantly, and due to a variety of factors the resulting blips are spread out in time, forming an envelope. The sharpness of the envelope is a function of the frequency, meaning the lower-frequency systems like LORAN will always have longer envelopes with less well-defined start and stop points, and thus generally have less accuracy than higher-frequency systems like Gee. There is an entirely different way to accomplish the same timing measurement, not by comparing the timing of the pulse envelopes, but timing the phase of the signals. This is actually quite easy to perform using simple electronics and can be displayed directly using a simple mechanical pointer. The trick to such a system is to ensure the master and secondary stations are phase-coherent, a complex proposition during World War II. But by isolating the expensive portions of the system at the few broadcast stations, the Decca Navigation System using this technique went active in 1944, offering accuracy similar to Gee but using low-cost mechanical displays which were also much easier to use. The downside to the phase comparison system is that it is not possible to know from a continuous wave signal, like Decca's, which part of the signal you are measuring. You could be comparing the first waveform from one station to the first from another, but the second waveform looks identical and the operator may line up those two waves instead. This leads to a problem where the operator can generate an accurate measurement, but the actual fix might be at a wide variety of locations. These locations are separated radially around the station, meaning a fix might be within a given radial direction or a fixed distance to either side. Decca referred to these radial areas as \\"lanes\\", and used a mechanical system to keep track of which one the receiver was in. By combining the two concepts, envelope timing and phase comparison, both of these problems could be eliminated. Since phase comparison is generally more accurate at low frequencies due to details of the electronics, taking accurate fixes would be based on this technique. But instead of broadcasting a continuous signal, as in the case of Decca, the signal would be in the form of pulses. These would be used to make a rough fix using the same technique as Gee or LORAN, positively identifying the lane. The only problem from a development standpoint would be selecting frequencies that allowed reasonably accurate pulse envelopes while still having measurable waveforms within the pulses, as well as developing displays capable of showing both the pulses as a whole, and the waves within them. These concepts led to experiments with Low Frequency LORAN in 1945, using a much lower frequency of 180 kHz. A system with three transmitters was set up on the US east coast using long antennas supported by balloons. The experiments demonstrated that the inaccuracy inherent to the design while working at such low frequencies was simply too great to be useful; operational factors introduced errors that overwhelmed the capabilities. Nevertheless, the three transmitters were re-installed in northern Canada and Alaska for experiments in polar navigation, and ran for three years until shutting down again in March 1950. These experiments demonstrated accuracy on the order of 0.15 microseconds, or about , a great advance over LORAN. Maximum usable range was over land and on the sea. Using cycle matching, the system demonstrated an accuracy of at . But it was also discovered that the system was very difficult to use and the measurements remained subject to confusion over which cycles to match. During this same period, the U.S. Army Air Force became interested in a very-high accuracy system for bombing pinpoint targets. Raytheon won a contract to develop a system called \\"Cytac\\", which used the same basic techniques as LF LORAN, but included considerable automation to handle the timing internally without operator intervention. This proved to be extremely successful, with test-runs placing the aircraft within 10 yards of the target. As the mission changed from short-range tactical bombing to over-the-pole nuclear delivery, the (newly formed) U.S. Air Force lost interest in the concept. Nevertheless, they continued experimentation with the equipment after adapting it to work on LF LORAN frequencies and renaming it \\"Cyclan\\", lowering accuracy compared to the original, but providing reasonable accuracy on the order of a mile at greatly increased distances. The Navy had also been experimenting with a similar concept during this period, but using a different method to extract the timing. This system, later known as Loran-B, ran into significant problems (as did another Air Force system, Whyn and a similar British system, POPI). In 1953 the Navy took over the Cyclan system and began a wide series of studies ranging as far away as Brazil, demonstrating accuracy to about . The system was declared operational in 1957, and operations of LORAN and Cyclan were handed to the U.S. Coast Guard in 1958. At that time, the original LORAN became Loran-A or standard LORAN, and the new system became Loran-C. =Commercial use, decommissioning= In spite of the greatly increased accuracy and ease-of-use of Loran-C, Loran-A remained in widespread use. This was due largely to two important factors. One was that the electronics needed to read a Loran-C signal were complex, and in the era of tube-based electronics, physically very large, generally fragile, and expensive. Further, as military ships and aircraft moved from Loran-A to Loran-C, the older receivers were made surplus. These older units were snapped up by commercial fishermen and other users, keeping it in widespread service. Loran-A continued to improve as the receivers were transistorized and then automated using microcontroller-based systems that decoded the location directly. By the early 1970s such units were relatively common, although they remained relatively expensive compared to devices like a radio direction finder. But the improvement of electronics through this period was so rapid that it was only a few years before Loran-C units of similar size and cost were available. This led to the decision to open Loran-C to civilian use in 1974. By the late 1970s, the Coast Guard was in the midst of phasing out Loran-A in favor of additional Loran-C chains. The Aleutian and Hawaii chains shut down on 1 July 1979, the remaining Alaska and West Coast chains on 31 December 1979, followed by the Atlantic and Caribbean transmitters on 31 December 1980. Several foreign chains in both the Pacific and Atlantic followed suit, and by 1985 most of the original chains were no longer operational. Japanese systems remained on the air longer, until 1991, serving their fishing fleet. Chinese systems were active into the 1990s before their replacement with more modern systems, and their nine chains were still listed as active in Volume 6 (2000 edition) of the Admiralty List of Radio Signals. Operation A single leg of a LORAN system lies along the \\"baseline\\" from stations A to B. At any point between these stations, a receiver will measure a difference in timing of the two pulses. This same delay will occur in many other locations along a hyperbolic curve. A navigational chart showing a sample of these curves produces a graph like this image. = Basic concept = Hyperbolic navigation systems can be divided into two main classes, those that calculate the time difference between two radio pulses, and those that compare the phase difference between two continuous signals. To illustrate the basic concept, this section will consider the pulse method only. Consider two radio transmitters located at a distance of from each other, which means the radio signal from one will take 1 millisecond to reach the other. One of these stations is equipped with an electronic clock that periodically sends out a trigger signal. When the signal is sent, this station, the \\"master\\", sends out its transmission. 1 ms later that signal arrives at the second station, the \\"secondary\\". This station is equipped with a receiver, and when it sees the signal from the master arrive, it triggers its own transmitter. This ensures that the master and secondary send out signals precisely 1 ms apart, without the secondary needing an accurate timer of its own or to synchronize its clock with the master. In practice, a fixed time is added to account for delays in the receiver electronics. A receiver listening for these signals and displaying them on an oscilloscope will see a series of \\"blips\\" on the display. By measuring the distance between them, the delay between the two signals can be calculated. For instance, a receiver might measure the distance between the two blips to represent a delay of 0.5 ms. This implies that the difference in the distance to the two stations is 150 km. There are an infinite number of locations where that delay could be measured ‚Äì 75 km from one station and 225 from the other, 150 km from one and 300 from the other, and so on. When plotted on a chart, the collection of possible locations for any given time difference forms a hyperbolic curve. The collection of curves for all possible measured delays forms a set of curved radiating lines, centered on the line between the two stations, known as the \\"baseline\\". In order to take a fix, the receiver takes two measurements based on two different master/secondary pairs. The intersections of the two sets of curves normally result in two possible locations. Using some other form of navigation, dead reckoning for instance, one of these possible positions can be eliminated, thus providing an exact fix. =LORAN stations= The signal from a single LORAN transmitter will be received several times from several directions. This image shows the weak groundwave arriving first, then signals after one and two hops off the ionosphere's E layer, and finally one and two hops off the F layer. Operator skill was needed to tell these apart. LORAN stations were built in chains, one master and two secondaries (minimally, some chains were constituted of as many as five stations) typically separated by about . Each pair broadcast on one of four frequencies, 1.75, 1.85, 1.9 or 1.95 MHz (as well as the unused 7.5 MHz). In any given location it was common to be able to receive more than three stations at a time, so some other means of identifying the pairs was needed. LORAN adopted the use of varying the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) for this task, with each station sending out a string of 40 pulses at either 33.3 or 25 pulses per second. LORAN tower station on Sand Island in Johnston Atoll, 1963 Stations were identified with a simple code, with a number indicating the frequency band, a letter for the pulse repetition frequency, and a number for the station within the chain. For instance, the three stations on the Hawaiian Islands were arranged as two pairs 2L 0 and 2L 1. This indicated that they were on channel 2 (1.85 MHz), used the \\"L\\"ow repetition rate (25 Hz), and that two of the stations were on the base repetition rate, while the other two (master and the third station) used repetition rate 1. The PRF could be adjusted from 25 to 25 and 7/16th for Low, and 33 1/3 to 34 1/9th for High. This system shared the middle tower, which broadcast on both frequencies. In the case of Gee, signals were direct from the transmitter to receiver, producing a clean signal that was easy to interpret. If displayed on a single CRT trace, the operator would see a string of sharp \\"blips\\", first the master, then one of the secondaries, the master again, and then the other secondary. Gee CRTs were built to be able to display two traces, and by tuning several delay circuits, the operator could make the first master-secondary signal appear on the upper display and the second on the lower. They could then take a measurement of both delays at the same time. In comparison, LORAN was deliberately designed to allow skywaves to be used, and the resulting received signal was far more complex. The groundwave remained fairly sharp, but could be received only at shorter distances and was primarily used during the day. At night, as many as thirty different skywaves might be received from a single transmitter, often overlapped in time, creating a complex return pattern. Since the pattern depended on the atmospherics between the transmitter and receiver, the received pattern was different for the two stations. One might receive a two-bounce skywave from one station at the same time as a three-bounce wave from another, making interpretation of the display quite difficult. Although LORAN deliberately used the same display as Gee in order to share equipment, the signals were so much longer and more complex than Gee that direct measurement of the two signals was simply not possible. Even the initial signal from the master station was spread out in time with the initial groundwave signal being sharp (if received), while the skywave receptions could appear anywhere on the display. Accordingly, the LORAN operator set the delays so the master signal appeared on one trace and the secondary on the second, allowing the complex patterns to be compared. This meant that only one master/secondary measurement could be made at once; to produce a \\"fix\\", the entire measurement procedure had to be repeated a second time using a different set of stations. Measurement times on the order of three to five minutes were typical, requiring the navigator to take into account the motion of the vehicle during this time. = Measurement = Canso (PBY) aircraft. The original airborne receiver unit was AN/APN-4 unit of 1943. It was physically identical to the UK's two-piece Gee set, and could be easily interchanged with these units. The main unit with the display also housed most of the controls. General operation started by selecting one of nine stations, labeled 0 to 8, and setting the sweep speed to 1, the lowest setting. The operator would then use the intensity and focus controls to fine tune the signal and provide a sharp display. At the lowest sweep speed, the system also produced a local signal that was fed into the display and produced a sharply defined \\"pedestal\\", a rectangular shape displayed along the two traces. The amplified signal from the stations would also appear on the display, highly compressed in time so that it displayed as a series of sharp spikes (blips). As the signal was repeating, these spikes appeared many times across the width of the display. Because the display was set to sweep at the pulse repetition rate of the selected station pair, other stations in the area, at different repetition rates, would move across the display while the selected one would remain stationary. Using the \\"left-right\\" switch, the operator would move the upper pedestal until one of the signal spikes was centred within it, and then moved the pedestal on the lower trace to center a second signal using coarse and fine delay controls. Once this was done, the system was set to sweep speed 2, which sped up the traces so that the section outlined by the pedestals filled the entire trace. This process was repeated at sweep speed 3, at which point only a selected part of the signal was visible on the screen. Turning to sweep speed 4 did not change the timing, but instead superimposed the signals on a single trace so final tuning could take place, using the gain and amplifier balance controls. The goal was to perfectly align the two traces. At that point, measurement starts. The operator switches to sweep speed 5, which returns to a display with two separated traces, with the signals inverted and running at a lower sweep speed so that multiple repetitions of the signal appear on the traces. Mixed into the signal is an electronic scale produced in a time base generator, causing a series of small pips to appear over the now- inverted original signals. At setting 5, the pips on the scale represent differences of 10 microseconds, and the operator measures the distance between positions. This is repeated for setting 6 at 50 microseconds, and again at setting 7 at 500 microseconds. The difference as measured at each of these settings is then added up to produce the total delay between the two signals. This entire procedure was then repeated for a second master-secondary set, often the second set of the same chain but not always. Receiver units improved greatly over time. The AN/APN-4 was quickly supplanted by the AN/APN-9 of 1945, an all-in-one unit combining the receiver and display of greatly reduced weight. = Range and accuracy = During the day the ionosphere only weakly reflects shortwave signals, and LORAN was usable at using the groundwaves. At night these signals were suppressed and the range dropped to . At night the skywaves became useful for measurements, which extended the effective range to . At long ranges the hyperbolic lines approximate straight lines radiating from the center of the baseline. When two such signals from a single chain are considered, the resulting pattern of lines becomes increasingly parallel as the baseline distance becomes smaller in comparison to the range. Thus at short distances the lines cross at angles close to 90 degrees, and this angle steadily reduces with range. Because the accuracy of the fix depends on the crossing angle, all hyperbolic navigation systems grow increasingly inaccurate with increasing range. Moreover, the complex series of received signals considerably confused the reading of the LORAN signal, requiring some interpretation. Accuracy was more a matter of signal quality and operator experience than any fundamental limit of the equipment or signals. The only way to express the accuracy was to measure it in practice; average accuracy on the route from Japan to Tinian, a distance of , was , 2% of range. =AT and Mobile LORAN= AT LORAN, for \\"Air Transportable\\", was a lightweight LORAN transmitter set that could be rapidly set up as the front moved. Operations were identical to \\"normal\\" LORAN, but it was often assumed charts would not be available and would have to be prepared in the field. Mobile LORAN was another lightweight system, mounted on trucks.

The title was first conferred to Rui Gon√ßalves da C√¢mara in 1662, and his branch of the C√¢mara dynastic family continued to receive the title long until the possessions and privileges of Rodrigo da C√¢mara. History The provincial capital of Vila Franca do Campo until 1522, the seat of the Counts of Vila Franca In 1573, the captain of S√£o Miguel, Manuel da C√¢mara passed on the administration of the island to his son Rui Gon√ßalves da C√¢mara (the third such Rui in the family), and went to live in Lisbon until his death in 1578, at a time when the reign of the Cardinal King was nearing its end.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.47 Following the king's death several pretenders lined-up to assume the monarchy, including Philip II of Spain, Ant√≥nio, Prior of Crato and the Infanta Catherine, Duchess of Braganza, among others. But, it was the conflict between Ant√≥nio and Philip II that took centre stage: following Ant√≥nio's defeat at the Battle of Alc√¢ntra, he remained king in only the Azores (barring S√£o Miguel, where the nobles were indifferent to the monarch). Rui, meanwhile, following his father's death had chosen to remain in Lisbon, and was there when the continent fell to Philip II. He aligned himself, and by association, his family to the Philippine succession. For his part, King Philip conceded to him, the title of Count of Vila Franca. At the time, the Countship was the highest honorific title that the King could bestow on a Portuguese citizen, especially one that was not his own son. There were few counts in Portugal, and many of them were wealthy and powerful. The selection of the designation was specifically chosen to privilege the nobles of the island of S√£o Miguel, where the provincial capital had been of Vila Franca do Campo until 1522. Yet, the municipal authorities at the time did not appreciate that D. Rui was named Count in their name, since that title was conferred by a Spanish King. Philip II undeterred responded that the title was merely honorific, and that the title did not transgress any of the rights and privileges of the \\"citizens\\" of the town. Rui da C√¢mara eventually arrived in his countship along with a second fleet, ordered to the archipelago to conquer the island of Terceira, which had held out (along with other islands) the acclamation of Philip as King of Portugal. This began a period of unified power in the Azores under the flag of Spain, that would continue until the Restoration of Portuguese independence. In the meantime, the Gon√ßalves da C√¢mara line enjoyed privileges in the Azores, under successive Captains- Donatar√°ios and Counts of Vila Franca.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.48Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.49 The end occurred in the aftermath of the succession of John IV to the throne. Many of the islands of the Azores acclaimed the truly Portuguese monarch (in 1641), and Rodrigo da C√¢mara (3rd Count of Vila Franca) eventually accepted his governance following the defeat of the Spanish at the fortress of Terceira and a personal letter from John IV.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.50 Rodrigo kept his titles and privileges following the defeat, but, in 1650, the Inquisition investigated and arrested the Count from several complaints raised against him associated with sexual escapades (a scandal at the time). His possessions, privileges and titles were confiscated and his family's position was in crisis: the noble eventually died a miserable death in the Convent of Cape St. Vincent in 1601. Through the influence of his spouse and her familial line, though, the C√¢maras regained some prestige, eventually obtaining the new title of Counts of Ribeira Grande.

Plot The Belstone Fox is the nickname given to Tag, a fox cub rescued from the woods and adopted by huntsman Asher. The young fox is reared in captivity with a litter of hound puppies, including Merlin, with whom Tag becomes especially friendly. Asher and Tod are fascinated by Tag, who combines cool cunning and knowledge of human habitation to lead the pack and hunters in many a \\"merry chase.\\" This gives the fox a status of local celebrity, enough to be published in magazines. Merlin, at first not interested in the hunts, becomes an active hound but protective of Tag. Asher, now an aging huntsman to the hunt club, was mildly protective of the fox until Tag leads the pack of hounds into the path of a train, killing many, and the club resolves to shoot the fox. Asher sees this as disturbing and against the natural order of life, and determines to bring down the fox in the approved manner, rather than with a firearm, however he dies from a sudden heart attack while attempting to do the deed. His once beloved fox and its friend Merlin sit beside their master until the rescue party comes. Cast *Eric Porter - Asher *Jeremy Kemp - Kendrick *Bill Travers - Tod *Rachel Roberts - Cathie *Dennis Waterman - Stephen *Heather Wright - Jenny Critical reception Time Out called the film \\"a dismayingly literal and unimaginative version of David Rook's novel,\\" ; the Radio Times gave it two out of five stars, calling it a \\"workmanlike adaptation,\\" adding, \\"Porter and Rachel Roberts acquit themselves adequately but the film ultimately impresses more for its wildlife photography than for its dramatic interest,\\" ; whereas TV Guide gave the film three out of four stars, writing, \\"Porter is solid as the hunter who brings the baby fox to the hound for nurturing. Hats off to the trainers and technical experts who let the animals steal the show.\\" ; and Britmovie described it as a \\"touching tale,\\" adding, \\"Eric Porter as Asher and Rachel Roberts as his wife are first- rate.\\" Home media The movie has been released a few times in PAL format (changing the film runtime from 103 minutes to 98 minutes). A Region 1 American DVD was released in 2013 as the \\"40th Anniversary Edition.\\" It is merely reformated from the PAL video and still plays faster, runtime at 98 minutes. The 2017 blu-ray from Network UK is the correct film speed transfer, runtime 103 minutes, but is Region B locked. The cover art includes the captions \\"The Original Timeless Tale of True Friendship\\" and \\"The Story that Inspired The Fox and the Hound\\". The first may refer to a different movie altogether; the second is at odds with Disney's attribution to Daniel P. Mannix's novel, The Fox and the Hound (1967). David Rook's novel and the James Hill film do however bear striking similarities in outline to the earlier Mannix novel.

At the start of her story, Mona gets word from her sister, Babs, that their brother, Kello, is dying. Kello tells his family that he is dying of lymphoma, but later reveals that he is actually dying from AIDS. He reveals to his sisters that he is in a relationship with a man, but swears them to secrecy. As the oldest, Kello asks Mona to return to Trinidad after his death and buy the family land back. Mona is hesitant, but eventually learns that she was given this opportunity to discover more about her family history, their journey from India to Trinidad, and the hardships they had to face along the way. Throughout the novel, Mona unveils the significance of the historical archive for the history of her family, women, and the greater Indo-Trinidadian culture over the course of several generations and migrations. She gives voice to the marginalized voices that were silenced by the past and even by her own people. Set in modern times, this novel interconnects the past to the present. As Mona discovers these hidden histories, she also comes to discover herself. The \\"Swinging Bridge\\" serves as a symbol of her life journey and the journey of her ancestors.

Founded in 2014, it campaigns for the establishment of a devolved Yorkshire Assembly within the UK, with powers over education, environment, transport and housing. It describes itself as a centrist party built on social democratic principles and believes that \\"changing the way the UK political system works is the best way to address the everyday issues faced by people living in Yorkshire.\\" The party has parish, town, district and county councillors, stood 21 candidates at the 2017 general election and secured 8.6% of the vote in the 2018 Sheffield City Region mayoral election. The party nominated 28 candidates for the 2019 general election.  History  The party was founded (as \\"Yorkshire First\\") in 2014 by the businessmen Stewart Arnold and Richard Honnoraty, and the management consultant Richard Carter. Carter was the party's first leader. The party's launch was welcomed by a spokesperson for Mebyon Kernow. Contesting the 2014 European Parliamentary elections in the Yorkshire and the Humber constituency, the Yorkshire Party received 19,017 votes (1.5%). Arnold, its lead candidate, described this as \\"a hugely significant result\\". In 2015, the party fought its first general election, standing 14 candidates. The party also gained its first town and parish council seats. Internationally, the party was granted observer status in the European Free Alliance grouping and has since become a full member. In 2016, the party contested 17 candidates across six local authorities, and also fought the Sheffield Brightside & Hillsborough by-election. In July, Arnold took over from Carter as leader of the party, with Chris Whitwood becoming deputy leader. The party joined the Make Votes Matter Alliance for Proportional Representation. In May 2017, the Yorkshire Party stood in Doncaster for the first time, contesting the mayoral election and saving its deposit. In addition, the party stood seven candidates for council elections. In June that year, the party stood 21 candidates in the general election, coming third place in three constituencies. This resulted in the Yorkshire Party becoming the sixth most voted for party in England and one of only three parties to increase its vote share on 2015. In 2018, the party's Rotherham candidate, Mick Bower, was selected to contest the Sheffield City Region mayoral election. Securing 8.6% of the vote, gaining fourth place of the seven parties standing, the party also came third in three of the four participating council areas, beating the Liberal Democrats and Greens in Barnsley, Doncaster and Rotherham. The 22,318 votes gained was also the largest ever individual tally gained by the party. In summer 2018, the party gained its first district and county level councillors when the former mayor of Northallerton and Hambleton District councillor, Claire Palmer, and the senior Conservative councillor on Selby District Council and North Yorkshire County Council, Mike Jordan, defected. Jordan said that he was joining the Yorkshire Party because he believed the government was \\"not doing Yorkshire the justice it deserves\\". In March 2019, Whitwood became party leader and Laura Walker took on the role of deputy, Whitwood expressed his optimism at the positive role the Yorkshire Party could play in the politics of people's everyday lives, describing the period as a golden opportunity where \\"small parties can make a huge difference and carry a huge amount of influence\\". In April 2019, with the fifth anniversary of the party's formation, it fielded a record number of candidates in that year's local elections, more than double the previous record. The party fielded six candidates in the 2019 European elections. None were elected. They fielded 28 candidates in the 2019 general election: none were elected, but with 29,201 votes, they received the third highest number of votes of any party that did not get an MP elected, after The Brexit Party and the Ulster Unionist Party. In May 2020, Dr. Bob Buxton, a teacher, was elected to serve a two-year term as leader following the resignation of Whitwood,. In June 2020, a Shipley businessman, Darren Longhorn, was appointed interim party chairman. At the end of August 2020, Councillor George Derx of the Stainforth and Barnby Dun ward in Doncaster defected from the Labour Party and joined the Yorkshire Party. He said that he believed that the party had the \\"right policies for our region\\". As a result of this defection, the Yorkshire Party is now represented by eight councillors in local government.  Ideology  The party advocates regional devolution for Yorkshire in the form of a democratically elected assembly as \\"the best way to achieve a stronger Yorkshire in a fairer United Kingdom\\". The party's argument for regional devolution is said to be founded on the principle of subsidiarity ‚Äì the belief that matters ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest or least centralised competent authority. The party promotes a range of policies covering education, environment, transport and housing, which it describes as being economically centrist and underpinned by social democratic principles. Electoral performance In 2014, the party started by fielding candidates for the EU Parliament election in the Yorkshire and the Humber constituency, winning 1.5% of the vote with just over 19,000 votes. In the 2015 general election the party contested 14 constituencies, winning 6,811 votes and an average vote share of 1.04%. The party increased its number of candidates in the 2017 snap election to 21, winning 20,958 votes, a huge increase from the previous election. The party also increased its average vote share in seats it contested to 2.1% of the vote. While contesting seats only within Yorkshire the party, received enough votes to become the sixth most popular party in England. The party won its first principal authority elections at the 2019 local elections, taking seats on Selby District Council and East Riding of Yorkshire Council. In the 2019 European Parliament election in the Yorkshire and the Humber constituency it received over 50,000 votes (4% of the vote share). It was the only non-parliamentary party to out poll Change UK. In the 2019 general election, the party further increased its number of candidates to 28 and secured 29,201 votes in total ‚Äî its best electoral performance in a general election. The party's average vote share remained constant at 2.1%, with a slight increase of 0.07%. Elected representatives In the 2019 local elections the Yorkshire Party won four seats on Selby District Council and two on East Riding of Yorkshire Council. When taken alongside the two respective seats the party holds on the North Yorkshire and South Yorkshire County Council due to defections, this leaves the party with eight principal authority councillors in Yorkshire. The party is also represented on town and parish councils across the region.

He was an ardent royalist and opposed to the freedom of press. After the July Revolution of 1830 he was tried in absentia and sentenced to civil death. He was later pardoned and returned to France. Early years Guillaume-Isidore de Montbel was born in Toulouse, Haute-Garonne, on 4 July 1787. His grandfather, Jean Baron de Montbel, had been Treasurer of France. His parents were Jean-Louis Baron de Montbel (1727‚Äì1793) and Catherine-Rosalie de Reynal (1766‚Äì1843). His father was a councilor at the parliament of Toulouse in 1753 and a king's advocate from 1777 to 1791. His father was executed in the French Revolution. Montbel was a fervent royalist. He enlisted in the Royal Volunteers in 1815. During the Hundred Days of Napoleon's return to power he was placed under police supervision. He was a property owner in Toulouse, a councilor of that city, and was appointed mayor by the restored Bourbon regime, replacing his close friend Jean-Baptiste de Vill√®le. On 17 November 1827 Montbel was elected deputy for the second district of Haute-Garonne. As a deputy Montbel was active and zealous, devoted to the monarchy and a fluent speaker. He defended the views of Vill√®le in matters of policy and finance, presented many proposals and amendments, and was a tireless opponent of the Liberals. He was appointed to the committee to examine the proposed law on periodicals, and showed himself hostile to the freedom of the press, for which he blamed the assassination by Louis Pierre Louvel of Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry. He was the candidate of the extreme right for vice-speaker of the chamber in 1829, but only received 62 votes. On 7 April 1829 he criticized as wasteful and romantic the French intervention on behalf of the Greeks, who were seeking independence. Minister Montbel was Minister of Religious Affairs and Public Education from 8 August 1829 to 18 November 1829. In this position he continued the tolerant policy of Antoine Lefebvre de Vatimesnil and rejected the demands of the Ultras to suspend the courses of Victor Cousin and Fran√ßois Guizot. He was appointed Minister of the Interior on 18 November 1829 after the resignation of Labourdonnaye, at the personal desire of King Charles X. He placed Sirieys Mayrinhac in charge of the general police. He spoke several times in the Chamber, trying in vain to overcome the unpopularity of the ministerial cabinet. He played an active role in the discussion of 5 March 1830 over the Royal Address, fighting the attacks of the constitutional party. He was then Minister of Finance from 19 May 1830 until 29 July 1830 in the last days of the Bourbon Restoration. He signed the July Ordinances which inadvertently led to the July Revolution and the end of the Bourbon dynasty. Later career Montbel accompanied the king to Rambouillet. After the Duke of Orleans had been appointed lieutenant-general of the kingdom, he returned to Paris and then went to Vienna, Austria. He was included in the trial of ministers of Charles X of France and on 28 September 1830 was sentenced in absentia to civil death and life imprisonment. A central charge was that he had taken 421,000 francs on 28 July to supply the royalist troops during the height of the struggle. Montbel was granted an amnesty by the Mol√© ministry in 1837.

History The Galerie Max Hetzler was founded in Stuttgart in 1974. In 1981, the gallery presented the first exhibitions of Martin Kippenberger and Albert Oehlen. In 1983 the gallery moved to Cologne, the centre of the contemporary art scene in Germany at the time, and pursued a programme with some of the most significant German and American artists from the 80's. From 1989 until 1992, Max Hetzler partnered with Luhring Augustine Gallery on establishing Luhring Augustine Hetzler in Los Angeles.Shauna Snow (January 19, 1992), Galleries Lose Out to Recession, Motherhood Los Angeles Times.

The following year, a second space opened on Zimmerstra√üe, next to Checkpoint Charlie. This soon became the main gallery, where exhibitions by artists from different generations took place. In the late 1990s, Max Hetzler joined forces with Jeffrey Deitch and Anthony d'Offay to invest heavily in the costly fabrication of Jeff Koons's Celebration series at Southern California-based Carlson & Company (including his Balloon Dog and Moon series),Jori Finkel, \\"At the Ready When Artists Think Big,\\" The New York Times, April 27, 2008.

Biography Alan Watson Featherstone was educated at Strathallan School in Perthshire, Scotland. During the 1970s he travelled extensively throughout the United States, Canada and South America. On his return to the United Kingdom, he joined the Findhorn Foundation in 1978, and for the next fifteen years was at the forefront of its work with nature. In October 1986 he was the main organiser for a major international conference on the world's ecological crisis called, 'One Earth: A Call to Action', involving 240 delegates. In 1986 he formed Trees for Life, with the aim of restoring the Caledonian Forest and its unique wildlife to the Scottish Highlands. The charity works in partnership with the Forestry Commission, the National Trust for Scotland and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) at a number of sites to the west of Loch Ness and Inverness. As of April 2014, the charity has planted over one million native trees. In August 2008, Featherstone oversaw the purchase of the 4,000 hectare Dundreggan Estate for ¬£1.65 million in Glenmoriston. The charity has received numerous awards. He has helped to inspire similar ecological restoration projects in the Scottish Borders, Dartmoor in England and the Yendegaia National Park Project in Tierra del Fuego, Chile. Featherstone has given lectures and workshops all over the world and spoken at various international conferences including: the World Wilderness Congress, the Society for Conservation Biology annual conference and the Society for Ecological Restoration conference.

About five of the whales which died are hunchbacks which were stranded in Ghanaian waters. Ghana‚Äôs coast forms part of the distribution range of a ‚ÄòGulf of Guinea‚Äô humpback whale breeding stock with estimated population at over 10,000 individuals.  Paths of whales  Ghana is on a path of migration for whales heading from South Africa to the waters off Britain and with the current flowing east, whatever killed the whales could be off the coast of Ivory Coast or further west. Some whales from the eastern North Atlantic migrate to the tropical coast of western Africa and the Cape Verde Islands Various methods are used including satellite tags which can track whale movements in near real time. It is not known why humpback whales migrate although possible suggestions include predator avoidance and the energetic benefits of warm water during the winter when food production is low in the feeding grounds. Swimming off the coast of Africa, humpback whales encounter more than warm waters for mating and bearing young, according to a new study led by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). They also encounter offshore oil rigs, major shipping routes and potentially harmful toxicants.  Death of whales  Some of the strandings have been at Axim, a fishing village Most of the deaths of the whales have occurred at the coast of the Western Region of Ghana and raised fears that it was the oil drilling that is responsible for the deaths. Since the discovery of oil in 2007 some environmentalists are skeptical whether oil and gas will be handled judiciously to avoid environmental degradation.Paul Collier (2012), One Year of Oil and Gas production in Ghana. Speech made at University of Ghana New Year School Decomposed whale carcasses have been washing onto beaches in western region making environmental groups worried the country's growing petroleum industry may be killing marine life. Local people count a total of 20 dead whales discovered along Ghana's coastline in the last four years, including at least eight since September 2013. Whales are mammals and what kills them is still unresolved. = Causes of death of whales = Speculations on the causes of death have generated heated arguments. Some Ghanaians believe that with the start of the exploration of oil and gas in 2007 to 2010 eleven whales have died within three years. They believe that seismic air guns used for oil exploration generate so much noise that if a whale goes deaf it cannot survive. The academia is not sure of the causes of death of the whales. \\"It's definitely unusual. But what may be the cause we can't put our finger on,\\" said A.K. Armah,https://www.google.com/ALeqM5gTSRM-FH32Uks_jAvrmzRdnr4esA a lecturer at the University of Ghana, who studies marine life. ‚ÄúIt is important to note that dead whales that have been washed ashore in Ghana were in a decomposed state and, therefore, samples could not be taken for laboratory analysis to ascertain the cause of death,‚Äù the Ministry of Fisheries and the Fisheries Commission said in a joint statement signed by the sector Minister, Mr Nayon Bilijo.http://www.ghanaweb.com ‚Ä∫ News ‚Ä∫ 2013-09-09 The Fisheries Commission said: ‚ÄúThe cause of death of the whales is not due to negligence or inaction on the part of competent authorities responsible for the regulation and management of the Ghanaian marine waters‚Äù. It explained that the death of a whale could be due to ageing, infectious disease related to bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic infection or non-infectious diseases related to failure of internal organs. The Environmental Protection Agency officials took samples of the carcass for analyses. The Agency said the incidence of whales being washed ashore was a global occurrence and not limited to Ghana.ghanaoilwatch.org/ghana./3305-epa-activities-of-oil-companies-not From February 2011 to September 2, 2013, over 120 different types of whales have been reported washed ashore at various locations around the globe\\", a statement from the Public Affairs Department of the EPA said. The EPA said after the discovery of the five dead whales last year that the situation was \\"of much concern\\" but it was not unprecedented.http://www.epa.gov.gh/dead whales washed ashore It is believed that whales and other marine mammals rely on their hearing to find food, friends and mating partners and when a very powerful sound fills their ears this can reorient them. The Natural Resources Defense Council an environmental advocacy group believes that oil and gas exploration is leading to overwhelming whale deaths in the Gulf of Guinea. Similar cases have happened in the Canary Islands and Hawaii. There is a belief that ocean noisehttp://www.nhm.ac.uk ‚Ä∫ Nature online ‚Ä∫ Life ‚Ä∫ Mammals presents a significant threat to marine mammals and other marine species. The head of the International Fund for Animal Welfare's whale programme, Patrick Ramage said collisions with ships, water pollution and seismic activity from oil drilling can kill or disorient whales. = Local reaction = The local people along the beach have reacted to the deaths in a variety of ways. On November 21, 2013, people of Domunli, a coastal community in the Nzema East Municipality in the Western Region, held a funeral for a 10.4 meter long dead sperm whale that has washed ashore at the beach. This was the 21st dead whale washed ashore on the coast of Ghana since 2009. The Chief Fishermen and elders from nearby communities Axim and Egyan got together to pour libation and say prayers to the gods to help them unravel the mystery of the rampant washing ashore of dead whales. Community members complained to the EPA that the rampant washing ashore of dead whales was rather bad omen for the fisher folks and coastal communities and that they needed answers from them as to what was the cause. In the case of the dead whale washed up in Nkontompo, local fishermen hauled the carcass to the beach where they dug a hole. It was then buried after pouring libation. Being an uncommon event for the local community, crowds of curious people had gathered to catch a glimpse of the dead mammal.  Public calls  The increased rate of whales death became great concern to the general public. Environmental Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) Chiefs and people have called on institutions such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Fisheries Commission (FC), Ghana Navy, Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation (MESTI), Ministry of Energy (MoE) and Ministry of Fisheries (MoF) to investigate the causes of the deaths and find lasting solutions to this problem.

An Objects conservator is a professional, working in a museum setting or private practice, that specializes in the conservation of three- dimensional works. They undergo specialized education, training, and experience that allows them to formulate and implement preventive strategies and invasive treatment protocols to preserve cultural property for the future. Objects conservators typically specialize in one type of material or class of cultural property, including metals, archaeological artifacts, ethnographic artifacts, glass, and ceramic art. Objects conservation presents many challenges due to their three-dimensional form and composite nature. Responsibilities and duties The diverse nature of artifacts that fall into the category of three dimensional objects presents a unique challenge to compiling a set of common procedures. However, preventive measures and treatment methodologies involve similar considerations that need to be addressed, regardless of the object's composition. In the words of Cesare Brandi, \\"Restoration must aim to reestablish the potential unity of the work of art, as long as this is possible without producing an artistic or historical forgery and without erasing every trace of the passage of time left on the work of art.\\" This means that an Objects Conservator needs to know when to draw the line, and communicate that limit to the object's custodian. =Preventive Measures= Mallory Marty prepares an object to be moved at the Indianapolis Museum of Art to prevent damage while in transit. While not as glamorous or hands-on as the other steps in this process, collections care, or Preventive conservation, is arguably the most important. To truly preserve cultural heritage for the future, it is imperative to minimize deterioration by developing and implementing procedures to minimize the amount of physical and chemical stress an object encounters. This includes its environmental conditions (relative humidity, temperature, exposure to light), integrated pest management protocols, use of specialized storage containers, strategies for packing and shipping, exhibition conditions, and an emergency preparedness plan. The initial expense of such measures often causes institutions and private collectors to balk, but in comparison to the expense of the invasive treatments that will be needed if one does not take such preventive measures, the benefit outweighs the initial investment. Preventive conservation is also something that a private collector can implement for their own pieces. Controlling the amount of light an object is exposed to, the source of illumination, the ambient temperature of its environment, and protecting it from rapid changes in relative humidity goes a long way towards ensuring that an object will be around to pass down to future generations. =Treatment Protocol= While each object is unique, conservators begin with a similar process regardless of the artifact being assessed. A Conservator may need to stabilize an object at any stage in the process to prevent further loss, or, in extreme cases, begin by stabilizing an object before further examination can occur. Documentation takes place during every step of treatment, including: original condition, sample sites (if taken), different types of damage, areas of significant weakness before and after stabilization, and potential infestation sites. It is also important to document the objects condition before and after moving it, especially in the case of off-site transport. The ultimate goal of treatment is to preserve both the physical object and its interpretation, or cultural context. Examination The first step of any treatment protocol is a thorough examination of the object. This includes both its physical components and its cultural importance. Physical components include the materials used, its construction, and the appearance of the object's surface. The conservator often employs different techniques for this portion of the examination, including photographs taken in different light conditions such as visible, raking, and Ultraviolet to examine the surface, and x-rays to reveal the structure within. Cultural significance is more challenging to determine, including the object's meaning, function, intended use, and importance to society. Thorough examination and research allows the Conservator to reconstruct an object's history and, together with the object's custodian (the owner, a curator, registrar, or collection manager) determine the object's ideal state and determine a realistic treatment goal. Laura Kubick treats an object at the Indianapolis Museum of Art Treatment Following examination the Conservator will prepare a pre-treatment report that discusses the treatment goal for the object and the planned course of action. As defined by AIC, treatment is \\"The deliberate alteration of the chemical and/or physical aspects of cultural property, aimed primarily at prolonging its existence.\\" This can be something as minimal as reinforcing flaking paint, or something as complex as the migration of metals and salts through a wooden statue, leading to loss of strength, shrinkage, separation between the wooden support, metal fastenings, and decorative outer surface. Knowledge, abilities, and skills Objects Conservators must be an expert collaborator, working with members of the public and museum professionals alike. Conservation is not a vacuum and practitioners collaborate with colleagues around the world, lending expertise and receiving guidance. They need to advocate for the object, explain their treatment protocol, the importance of preventive measures, and stand firm when asked to reconsider a \\"no\\". They must also be open to alternative interpretations, have an understanding of different materials and construction techniques, keen observation skills, and deft hands. Education & training Most museums and prestigious private firms require graduate degrees in Conservation. Without graduate level education, knowledge of chemistry, hands-on experience, and a thorough foundation in documentation, evaluation, and treatment an institution or firm is taking a serious risk. Anyone can call themselves a conservator, but it is the specialized training gained through graduate programs or similar experiences that count. Gaining admission to a conservation graduate program includes an undergraduate degree, a concentration in chemistry (specifically organic chemistry), and a significant number of hours working under a trained Conservator. This ensures that the candidate has a through foundation upon which to build and is already familiar with many aspects of the process. These programs include University of Delaware, NYU, Buffalo State University, Queens University, University College London, Cardiff University Areas of Specialty Due to the diverse nature of this type of cultural heritage, most objects conservators specialize on one type of artifact or material.

It is a transcription activator involved in vertebrate gastrulation which controls posterior mesoderm patterning and notochord differentiation by activating transcription of genes expressed throughout mesoderm. The effects of Xbra is concentration dependent where concentration gradient controls the development of specific types of mesoderm in Xenopus. Xbra results of the expression of the FGF transcription factor, synthesized by the ventral endoderm. So while ventral mesoderm is characterized by a high concentration of FGF and Xbra, the dorsal mesoderm is characterized by a reunion of two others transcription factors, Siamois and XnR, which activates the synthesis of Goosecoid Transcription Factor. Goosecoid enables the depletion of Xbra. In a nutshell, high concentrations of Xbra induce ventral mesoderm while low concentration stimulates the formation of a back. Posterior mesoderm development presents two types of cell behaviors, cell migration and convergent extension, in prechordal mesoderm and chordamesoderm cells, respectively. Cell migration is exhibited by the prechordal mesoderm cells, resulting in the formation of the future anterior end. Xbra induces convergent extension which inhibits cell migration and rearranges the chordamesoderm cells into a structure that will later differentiate into notochord. As a result, Xbra acts as a switch to convert between these two behaviors. Xbra is able to activate itself indirectly, specifically for dorsal mesoderm, through FGF signaling while eFGF maintains Xbra expression, creating an autoregulatory loop. Inhibition of Xbra leads to abnormal patterning of mesoderm, such as shortened trunk. In a previous study, the activation domain of Xbra was replaced by repressor domain of Drosophila engrailed protein in order to form a dominant-interfering Xbra construct that would help to study the function and regulation of Xbra. The injection of RNA encoding this construct has led to various birth defects such as defective blastopore closure and abnormal notochord differentiation in the developing embryo.

Israel In the late 1940s, Mordechai Shenhavi, one of the early supporters of the creation of an Israeli national memorial authority whose efforts would eventually lead to the building of Yad Vashem, made the first proposal to grant honorary posthumous Israeli citizenship to all of the victims of the Holocaust. Israeli legal experts looked into the idea, but the government eventually decided to move ahead with the building of the memorial first, leaving the idea of posthumous citizenship to be resolved later. There were voices of opposition to Shenhavi's plan, such as Jacob Blaustein of the American Jewish Committee, and as a result, the Israeli government at the time chose not to make a blanket grant of posthumous citizenship but instead granted it only upon application by a relative or friend of one of the dead. However, in 1985, Israel granted posthumous citizenship to all the six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust. After the Knesset approved the decision, the Israeli Minister for Education, Yitzhak Navon, signed a proclamation granting posthumous citizenship to all the six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust.Holocaust Victims to Receive Posthumous Israel Citizenship Netherlands Dutch nationality law makes no provision for a posthumous grant of citizenship. In 2004, a television programme about Anne Frank sparked public interest in granting her posthumous citizenship. Frank had moved to the Netherlands with her family while a young girl, and her father became a Dutch citizen after her death. A spokeswoman for Immigration Minister Rita Verdonk stated that the ministry was trying to find a way in which this could be accomplished, but expressed her doubt that it would be possible. However, the proposal did not enjoy universal support; Patricia Bosboom of the Anne Frank House museum stated, \\"She was as Dutch as you can be. Giving her citizenship would add nothing\\", while David Barnouw of the Dutch Institute for War Documentation described it as insulting to other victims of the Holocaust. In the end, Frank was not granted citizenship under the proposal. United States In the United States, () allows the next-of- kin of non-U.S. citizens who died due to injuries sustained while on active duty with the United States Armed Forces to request that the Secretary of Homeland Security grant posthumous citizenship to the deceased. That is an honorary status which does not confer any immigration benefits to the decedent's relatives. In the 2000s and 2010s, there were roughly 30,000 to 40,000 service members who were not U.S. citizens; by 2007, a total of 59 non- citizens who had died on active duty had been granted posthumous citizenship. The process of gaining posthumous citizenship is not automatic and requires the submission of an application form, but family members of soldiers killed on duty have suggested making the grant of posthumous citizenship automatic instead, and a number of members of Congress have sponsored bills to that end. There have also been calls for the granting of posthumous citizenship to other individuals or groups. In 2004 and again in 2007, Congressman Steve Israel sponsored a bill to grant posthumous citizenship to Anne Frank. Her cousin Bernhard Elias expressed misgivings about the idea, stating that Anne herself had wanted to be Dutch, and others including Emory University Institute for Jewish Studies director Deborah Lipstadt stated that the United States should not have the right to claim Frank's legacy after having rebuffed the efforts of her family and thousands of other Jewish refugees from Europe to immigrate to the United States in the early years of World War II. In 2013, Daniel Swalm, the grandson of a Minnesota woman who had lost US citizenship under Section 3 of the Expatriation Act of 1907 for marrying a Swedish immigrant and died without regaining her citizenship, began lobbying Congress for posthumous citizenship to women like his grandmother. He contacted his senator Al Franken, who in 2014 sponsored a resolution () expressing regret for the passage of the 1907 Act.

The uprising in the Palatine Electorate and its surrounding area took place in April to June 1525.  History  The start of the German Peasants' War in West Rhenish Palatinate was marked by the gathering of a band of peasants, a so-called Haufe, at Nu√üdorf near Landau on 23 April 1525. The Palatine peasant mobs plundered several surrounding monasteries (including the Knights Hospitaller commandry of Heimbach near Zeiskam as well as H√∂rdt, where the provost was killed) and castles, before they took Neustadt on 6 May without a fight. The peasants' programme was based on the Twelve Articles, which were drawn up at Memmingen and of which 25,000 copies were printed. A second Haufe gathered near Bockenheim. As a result, the Palatine prince-elector, Louis V felt forced into negotiations with the Geilweiler and Bockenheim groups; these began on 10 May in Forst. The complaints were to be handled by a Landtag. The Elector finally resorted to military force against the peasants on 23 May with the support of troops from the Archbishop of Trier, after other princes had defeated the uprisings in W√ºrttemberg and in the Alsace. The Palatine peasants mobs were crushingly defeated at the Battle of Pfeddersheim on 23/24 June. Eight thousand peasants were reported to have been killed in the battle.

It lies, partly submerged, in Sutton Lock on River Weaver in Cheshire, England. The lock and its contents are designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Mersey flats Mersey flats were sailing barges that were used in the inland waterways of Northwest England. They were carvel-built with rounded bilges and sterns, and had a shallow draught. As originally built, the flats had a single mast that could be lowered or lifted out. Typically they were about long by wide. Some flats were larger and could be used as small coasters. Other flats were unrigged and were designed to be pulled by horses or tugs, but strong enough to survive conditions on the river estuaries. The waterways in which the flats were used were the rivers Mersey, Dee and Weaver, and canals and navigations such as the Bridgewater Canal, the Sankey Canal, the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, the Weaver Navigation, the Rochdale Canal, the Chester Canal and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. History The Daresbury was constructed in 1772 by a boat builder named Samuel Edwards. By 1792‚Äì96 she was employed on the Weaver Navigation carrying coals. It is thought that she was lengthened in the early 1800s. At some time in the 19th century, possibly in 1864, she was converted into a floating derrick. Repairs were carried out on the vessel in 1926 and in 1934, and she was still afloat in 1956. She was moved to Sutton Locks on the River Weaver in 1985 and sunk. Plans were made to recover and restore her and to move her to the National Waterways Museum at Ellesmere Port, but these were found to be impractical and were abandoned. Location and description The flat lies partly submerged towards the west end of Sutton Lock, with part of the hull above the water line. The barge measures long by long. The hold, about long, is full of water. Also partly submerged, about from the projected position of the bow of the barge, are some metal objects and a piece of timber, which are thought to have come from the Daresbury. Appraisal The Daresbury was designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument on 21 March 2014. Scheduling gives legal protection to an archaeological site that is considered to be of national importance. In the reasons given for scheduling, Daresbury is described as being \\"the only known pre-1840 survival of a once widespread regional sailing vessel\\". It has survived reasonably well and has retained a number of key characteristics, and has the potential for providing insight into the construction of boats in the 18th century. There is also \\"abundant contemporary documentation\\" about this particular vessel. The area covered by the scheduling is the whole of Sutton Lock, an area measuring a maximum of by ; this is to ensure that any fixtures from the vessel that have been detached are also included.

These policies are found in the museum's collections policy, the guiding tenet of the museum explaining why the institution is in operation, dictating the museum's professional standards regarding the objects left in its care. Registrars focus on sections that include acquisitions, loans, exhibitions, deaccessions, storage, packing and shipping, security of objects in transit, insurance policies, and risk management. As a collections care professional, they work with collection managers, conservators, and curators to balance public access to objects with the conditions needed to maintain preservation. Focusing on documentation, registrars are responsible for developing and maintaining records management systems, with individual files for each object in the collection. Smaller and mid-sized institutions may combine the role of registrar with that of collections manager, while large institutions often have multiple registrars, each overseeing a different curatorial department. Responsibilities and duties The role of registrar was first defined in the early 1900s, and while the job description has not changed appreciably over time, the responsibilities have evolved with technology and increasing global awareness. Successful registrars deftly manage many projects at once, maintain calm focus, and diligent attention to detail. Collaborating with other departments and community associations is key.Schlatter, Elizabeth (2008)Museum Careers: A Practical Guide for Students and Novices. Left Coast Press, California. Chapter 3. A selection of the most critical responsibilities include: *Documentation: From the position's creation, registrars are most concerned with documentation and record keeping. This documentation includes information about an object's condition, its accession number (or identification number, depending on its status at the museum), provenance, materials, and all of its movement within the museum or out on loan. Paper registers have been replaced by Collection Management Software, and this data is stored in multiple locations as a safeguard. *Acquisitions: When an object arrives at the museum for the first time as a prospective addition to the collection, a registrar immediately begins the documentation and tracking process by assigning a temporary identification number and assembling records that include the object's condition, date of arrival, the reason for its arrival at the museum, and a photograph documenting its physical appearance. This information follows the object through the acquisition process, tracking its movements. If the museum decides to accept the object, the registrar will then update the record, assigning a permanent accession number to the object. The registrar also makes recommendations to the Collections Committee. Using the museum's Collections Management Policy, the registrar assesses whether or not the object fits the collection, determines whether the museum has the necessary resources to properly care for the object, and ascertains that provenance can be established to protect the museum from potential litigation. *Loans: Objects are loaned between museums for a variety of reasons, typically for special exhibitions. As with acquisitions, the registrar assigns a temporary identification number to objects on loan to the museum, documents their condition, and creates a file to follow the object's movement while it is in the museum. Registrars are also present at the loading dock upon arrival to supervise the unloading, condition of packing material, and ensure that the objects are handled properly. In the case of outgoing loans, the registrar documents which objects are leaving the museum and either carries out or oversees their packing for shipment, and loading into the shipping vehicle. *Exhibitions: Working together with curators and collection managers, the registrar helps select objects for display or loan. This means occasionally saying 'no' to colleagues to safeguard objects for the future. If an object will not withstand the stresses of travel and/or an exhibition, it is the registrar's duty to make that clear and stand behind their decision. Once objects are selected and agreed upon, the registrar updates the records to reflect the display location. *Deaccessions: Registrars are also involved in carrying out deaccessions. Historically, museums did not follow strict guidelines for accepting donations. As a result, objects that have little or nothing to do with the institution's mission statement sit in storage until they can be deaccessioned, or removed from the museum's collection. Storage space and resources are valuable, and therefore it does not make sense to maintain objects that the museum cannot display. Registrars assess these objects, make recommendations, and verify that all legal conditions are met to deaccession the object, and document every step of the process. Since this process can be controversial, it is critical that every step, as described by the museum's policy, are carried out diligently and openly. *Packing and Shipping: When objects are sent out of the museum, either being returned to the institution that provided them or as an outgoing loan to another museum, the registrar updates the registration system to documents which objects are leaving the museum. The Condition report is updated to reflect the pre- shipping state of the object, and the registrar either carries out or oversees the packing for shipment, and loading into the shipping vehicle. *Security in Transit: Most, if not all, objects on outgoing loan are accompanied by a courier. The registrar selects and trains this individual, and, in the case of extremely important objects, the registrar may accompany the shipment, acting as a courier themselves. *Risk Management: A main task for a registrar is also determining risk factors to a collection and mitigating them. Risk factors include vandalism, theft, pests, emergencies, and natural disasters. It is the responsibility of the registrar to develop and implement strategies to minimize these risks, such as integrated pest management, guards, and secure display cases. Additionally registrars oversee the development and implementation of a disaster management policy to safeguard both staff and collections objects in case of emergency. Knowledge, abilities, and skills A registrar should show strength and skill when handling objects. From physically moving an object to being able to identify any stress points or cultural significance, a registrar must take the initiative to study the museum's collection. They must be calm, flexible, resourceful, and focus on the details. Registrars can be described as academic generalists, who, over time, can develop specializations. Working knowledge of American Association of Museum's Code of Ethics as well as the Collecting Guidelines for Museums should be required to be successful and respectful of any cultural or intrinsic objects. A registrar should be familiar with the AAM Guide to Provenance Research, as well as the Nazi-Era Provenance Internet Portal. A registrar should also be familiar with Digital Fair Use and the US Indemnity Program. In addition, a registrar should understand repatriation processes, both nationally and internationally. As a member of a unique institution, a registrar must possess the ability to be successful in a team-oriented environment. Teaching qualities and customer service skills are helpful when trying to relay the importance of a collection's protection or access to a different department within the museum. Education and training Individuals looking to begin a career in the Collections Management field generally possess a bachelor's degree in history, art history, fine arts, or a field related to museum interests. Many institutions now require a graduate education in museum studies or field relating to the museum's collections in this competitive job market. Candidates are also expected to have hands-on experience in museum collection database management, object packing and handling, digitization, collections cataloging, and accession and loan procedures. Internships and volunteer work in cultural institutions are excellent ways to gain experience and make connections with museum professionals. By taking initiative to acquire experience, paid or unpaid, a candidate will also develop their organizational skills, familiarity with procedure, and the inherent flexibility needed to succeed as a registrar. Related positions Smaller museums tend to combine the role of registrar with that of collection manager, in which case one person (or team) would oversee the traditional responsibilities of a registrar with the addition of a more hands-on role in collections care. Added duties include: overseeing and maintaining environmental conditions in storage and exhibition facilities, taking a more active role in conditions assessments and contacting conservators directly, managing physical storage needs, and taking inventory of the collection at regular intervals. = Organizations/professional societies = State and regional associations (such as the Southeastern Registrar's Association) often organize classes, workshops, or conferences surrounding a contested topic or previously scheduled cultural event. * American Alliance of Museums (AAM) * Registrars Committee of the Association of Museums (RCAAM) * Association of Registrars and Collections Specialists * Collections Trust * Committee on Museum Professional Training * Heritage Preservation * International Council of Museums (ICOM) * National Association for Museum Exhibition * Preparation, Art Handling, Collections Care Information Network (PACCIN) * PIC Green Network * Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections (SPNHC) See also * Collection * Collections care * Collections policy * Conservation-restoration * Curation (disambiguation) * Digital preservation * Disaster recovery plan * Nazi plunder * Object conservation * Provenance References External links * NAGPRA * Art Loss Register * FBI Art Theft * AAM Guidelines for Antiquities * Collections Management at the MFA Museum occupations Collections care ","title":"Registrar (museum)"},{"id":"42497948","text":"Agnes Bluhm (9 January 1862 ‚Äì 12 November 1943) was a German winner of a Goethe medal. She was trained as a medical doctor and won prizes for her research. She believed that German women could improve the race using eugenics and forced sterilisation. She wrote that the \\"female psyche\\" made her gender predisposed towards working for \\"racial hygiene\\". Life Bluhm was born in Constantinople in 1862. She was trained as a medical doctor and won prizes for her research. She believed that German women could improve the race using eugenics. While a student, she met Friedrich Nietzsche and became part of the students in his circle, which included Eva Corell, Meta von Salis, Resa von Schirnhofer and Clara Willdenow. In 1886 she fell in love with Alfred Ploetz who was already involved with another scientist named Pauline R√ºdin. They became involved whilst conducting dissection and they decided to get married early in 1887. Ploetz was also seeing an American named Mary Sherwood who was studying hypnotism. Ploetz returned to R√ºdin in 1888 and married her. Bluhm however kept Ploetz as a close friend throughout her life and they both shared similar views on racial purity and the benefits of eugenics. Bluhm became the third female doctor in Berlin and she joined two fellow Zurich trained doctors to staff a clinic for poor women there in 1890. She joined the Racial Hygiene Society in 1906. Bluhm had to retire from practising medicine due to problems with her ears but she redirected her efforts to medical research. After 1918 she conducted extensive research on heredity in animals to try to determine how a race could be improved. She is said to be first German female doctor known for her research. She carried out research on alcoholism and heredity under early funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. Bluhm was awarded a silver Leibnitz medal for her work. In 1936 she published her book which laid out her views on the role of women. The Racial Hygiene Problem for Women Physicians described how she saw women's role to work hard at reproduction in order to improve humanity. She strongly advocated against smoking, noting research which showed lower fertility in women who smoked. Women should look to motherhood and not to emancipation as their contribution. Although Bluhm had a career she saw this as a special case because of the need for speciality doctors. In general she thought that women should not have careers. Moreover, she recommended that the \\"female psyche\\" made her gender predisposed towards working for \\"racial hygiene\\". She won the Goethe-Medaille f√ºr Kunst und Wissenschaft during the war. Adolf Hitler awarded about 400 of these medals during his time in power but only five were awarded to women and the rest were a singer, actresses and writers.

It saw active service during the First World War in the Middle Eastin the Senussi Campaign and the Sinai and Palestine Campaignfrom 1915 to 1918. A second line battery, 2/1st Nottinghamshire RHA, served in the Mesopotamian Campaign in 1917 and 1918 as a Field Artillery battery. Post-war, it was reconstituted as a Royal Field Artillery battery. History =Formation= The Territorial Force (TF) was formed on 1 April 1908 following the enactment of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which combined and re-organised the old Volunteer Force, the Honourable Artillery Company and the Yeomanry. On formation, the TF contained 14 infantry divisions and 14 mounted yeomanry brigades. Each yeomanry brigade included a horse artillery battery and an ammunition column. On 18 March 1908, the Nottinghamshire Royal Horse Artillery (Territorial Force) was proposed as a new unit and it was recognized by the Army Council on 31 July 1908 (and the ammunition column on the same date).Litchfield, pp. 197‚Äì8. The unit consisted of :Battery HQ at Nottingham :Nottinghamshire Battery at Nottingham :Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Mounted Brigade Ammunition Column also at Nottingham The unit was equipped with four Ehrhardt 15-pounder guns and allocated as artillery support to the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Mounted Brigade. The battery was raised and trained by Major Joe Laycock. =First World War= In accordance with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. 2nd Line units performed the home defence role, although in fact most of these were also posted abroad in due course.  1/1st Nottinghamshire The 1st Line battery was embodied with the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Mounted Brigade on 4 August 1914 at the outbreak of the First World War. Initially, the brigade concentrated in Berkshire and on 5 August 1914 was assigned to the 1st Mounted Division. A decision was made to form a new mounted division from the mounted brigades in and around the Churn area of Berkshire. On 2 September 1914, 2nd Mounted Division, with Headquarters at Goring, came into being and the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Mounted Brigade was transferred to the new division. I Brigade and II Brigade, RHA (T.F.) were formed for the division and the battery was assigned to II Brigade, RHA at Churn, along with Berkshire RHA and A Battery and B Battery, Honourable Artillery Company. In November 1914, the division moved to Norfolk on coastal defence duties. Artillery headquarters was established at Cromer, before joining the divisional headquarters at Hanworth in December, and Nottinghamshire RHA was at Letheringsett (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Mounted Brigade was at Holt). ;Overseas service In March 1915, the 2nd Mounted Division was put on warning for overseas service. In early April, the division starting leaving Avonmouth and the last elements landed at Alexandria before the end of the month. By the middle of May, the horse artillery batteries were near Isma√Ølia on Suez Canal Defences. The 2nd Mounted Division was dismounted in August 1915 and served at Gallipoli. The artillery batteries and ammunition columns (along with the signal troops, mobile veterinary sections, Mounted Brigade Transport and Supply Columns and two of the Field Ambulances) were left behind in Egypt. The division returned from Gallipoli in December 1915 and was reformed and remounted. The battery never rejoined the division; on 28 November 1915 the battery departed Ismailia for the Western Desert and joined the Western Frontier Force on formation at Mersa Matruh. It served throughout the Senussi Campaign, taking part in the Affairs at Wadi Senab (1113 December 1915), Wadi Majid (25 December), and Halazin (23 January 1916), and in the Action at Agagiya (26 February) which effectively ended the campaign. ;Imperial Mounted Division The Imperial Mounted Division was formed in Egypt in January 1917 with four cavalry brigades: the Australian 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades and the British 5th and 6th Mounted Brigades. The Nottinghamshire Battery was one of four that formed the XIX Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (T.F.) to support the division. In practice, the battery was attached to 3rd Light Horse Brigade. The battery served with the Imperial Mounted Division in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign as part of the Desert Column. With the division, it took part in the advance across the Sinai. The battery was re-equipped with four 18 pounders in time for the First Battle of Gaza (2627 March 1917). It also took part in the Second Battle of Gaza (1719 April 1917). ;Australian Mounted Division Gunners of A Battery, Honourable Artillery Company, attached to the Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade, crouch between their 13 pounder quick fire field guns and a cactus hedge near Belah, Palestine, in March 1918. At this time, they were in the XIX Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (T.F.) along with 1/1st Notts RHA. In June 1917, the Desert Column was reorganised from two mounted divisions of four brigades each (ANZAC and Imperial Mounted Divisions) to three mounted divisions of three brigades each (ANZAC, AustralianImperial Mounted Division renamedand the new Yeomanry Mounted Division). 6th Mounted Brigade, along with Berkshire RHA, joined the Yeomanry Mounted Division and on 20 June 1917 the Imperial Mounted Division was redesignated as Australian Mounted Division as the majority of its troops were now Australian. On 12 August 1917, the Desert Column disappeared and the Desert Mounted Corps was formed. The battery served with the Australian Mounted Division for much of the remainder of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. As part of the Desert Mounted Corps, the division took part in the Third Battle of Gaza (by now the battery was re-equipped with four 13 pounders), in particular the Capture of Beersheba (31 October) and the Battle of Mughar Ridge (13 and 14 November), and the defence of Jerusalem against the Turkish counter-attacks (27 November3 December). Still part of the Desert Mounted Corps, the division took part in the Second Trans-Jordan Raid (30 April4 May 1918). XIX Brigade, RHA supported the 4th Light Horse Brigade in the advance on the Jisr ed Damiye‚ÄìEs Salt track on 30 April. The next day, a strong Turkish force attacked from the direction of Jisr ed Damiye and soon the artillery was in danger. B Battery, HAC was in the rear and managed to get away with all but one of their guns (stuck in a wadi) but the Nottinghamshire RHA and A Battery, HAC were less fortunate. Machine gun fire cut down the horse teams before the guns could be gotten away. XIX Brigade lost 9 guns in total, the only guns to be lost in action in the entire campaign. ;5th Cavalry Division The battery was attached to the 5th Cavalry Division in September and October 1918 to support the division in the Final Offensive including the Battle of Megiddo (1925 September), the Capture of Damascus (1 October), and the Occupation of Aleppo (26 October).  2/1st Nottinghamshire Nottinghamshire RHA formed a 2nd line in 1914, initially designated as the Nottinghamshire (Reserve) Battery RHA and later given a fractional designation as 2/1st Nottinghamshire Battery, RHA. By February 1915, the battery joined the 2nd Line 2/1st Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Mounted Brigade, duplicate of the 1st Line Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Mounted Brigade. On 6 March 1915, the 2/2nd Mounted Division was formed as a duplicate of the 2nd Mounted Division which had been warned for overseas service. The brigade joined the division on East Coast Defences in March 1915 and concentrated at Narborough with the battery at Scarning and Wendling. The batteries of the division were quite unready for war. Three had no horses, the fourth had just 23; three batteries had over 200 men on average, but the other just 91; one battery had no ammunition and another reported that its 15-pounders were \\"practically useless\\". The battery remained with the division when it was redesignated as 3rd Mounted Division in March 1916 and as 1st Mounted Division in July 1916. In September 1916, the battery was attached to the 8th Cyclist Brigade in 2nd Cyclist Division (former 4th Mounted Division) until the division was broken up on 16 November 1916. An 18 pounder crew of another battery in action in the open desert of lower Mesopotamia, March 1917. The battery was posted overseas in June 1917, arriving at Basra on 13 August when it joined CCXV Brigade, RFA (T.F.) and was numbered as 812th Battery, RFA (T.F.). At this point it was armed with six 18 pounders. CCXV Brigade was serving with 3rd (Lahore) Division but was transferred to 15th Indian Division on 4 October. The battery remained with the 15th Indian Division, participating in the Mesopotamian campaign, for the remainder of the war. It took part in the Occupation of Hƒ´t (9 March 1918) and the Action of Khan Baghdadi (2627 March). After the end of the war, the division was run down as units were posted away or repatriated, being disbanded in March 1919. The 15th Indian Division was formally disbanded in March 1919, and there is no further mention of the 2/1st Nottinghamshire RHA in the official histories. Most British troops attached to Indian Army divisions in Mesopotamia found themselves in India when their divisions were disbanded/repatriated, as there was a shortage of shipping to get the men home to Britain. In April 1919 the Third Anglo-Afghan War broke out, and British troops were inducted into various units to serve. At least one soldier of the 2/1st Notts is known to have fought in this war with another battery.Public Record Office, war record of Gunner William Kind. =Post war= The Nottinghamshire RHA was not reconstituted until 7 February 1920 when it formed a battery (later numbered 240th) in 1st North Midland Brigade, RFA (later 60th (North Midland) Field Regiment, RA)Litchfield, p. 142. and ceased to be a Royal Horse Artillery battery. The Leicestershire RHA also joined the brigade as 240th Battery.Litchfield, p. 138‚Äì9. In 1938 these two batteries were detached from 60th (NM) Field Regiment (as it had become) to form a separate 115th (North Midland) Field Regiment, RA, which saw service in the Battle of France and Burma Campaign in World War II. In 1950 it was amalgamated into 350 (South Notts Hussars Yeomanry) Heavy Regiment, RA.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced it in September 2013 and invited leaders of governments, the private sector, and civil society to unite in taking concrete action towards a low-carbon emission world. The Climate Summit 2014's focus was on initiatives and actions rather than on negotiations between countries. It was seen as a milestone towards closing the emissions gap between reduction pledges and the necessary emission cuts for the 2 ¬∞C scenario (with \\"pursue efforts to\\" limit the temperature increase to 1.5 ¬∞C). It was also seen as a key step towards a new legal agreement on climate change, the Paris Agreement, which was adopted by the COP21 in Paris in December 2015 and became effective in November 2016. Another direct product of the Climate Summit 2014 was the New York Declaration on Forests.  Developments and positions prior to the Summit  After the COP19 in Warsaw, the Climate Summit was the next high-level gathering on climate change. Since the Kyoto Protocol's second commitment period expires in 2020, the UNFCCC process attempts to establish a new worldwide contract about climate protection and emission reduction objectives, drafted in 2014 at the COP20 in Lima and adopted in 2015 at the COP21 in Paris. The Climate Summit in September 2014 was not part of this negotiating process, but served as a kick- off for a year of intense activity in climate policy and an indicator on the countries' ambitions to reduce emissions and support climate protection. Having this in mind, UN Secretary-General Ban invited leaders of governments, the private sector and civil society from all over the world to unite in action: In December 2013, Secretary-General Ban appointed the former President of Ghana, John Kufuor, and Jens Stoltenberg, former Prime Minister of Norway, as special envoys on climate change, to assist Ban in connection with the Climate Summit and provide strategic advice.Secretary-General appoints special envoys on climate change , unicnetwork.org; visited March 19, 2014.

It aired on Fox in the United States on April 6, 2014. Plot Linda falls and hits her head, leading her to believe that she has psychic powers: she tells Mort that his missing wallet is in the bathroom and guesses that the caller on the phone is a telemarketer. Bob is skeptical, though all of Linda's predictions come true. She tells Teddy that he will meet a woman in a yellow dress, that Mort will have good financial prospects, and that Gretchen should go on a trip to Philadelphia to win back her ex-boyfriend. The kids are convinced of Linda's psychic abilities and ask her which horse she thinks will win at the track. They prepare to bet their money on \\"Gelding the Lily.\\" Bob tries to prove Linda isn't psychic, but she manages to guess that he is holding an orange in his hands, which only further convinces her and the kids. As he continues to doubt her, Linda cryptically and hostilely tells him to be careful going down stairs. Seeing a new report about a missing statue on the pier, Linda calls in a tip as \\"a local psychic\\" stating that she sees the statue surrounded by water. Indeed, the statue fell off the pier and the news of her powers reaches Sergeant Bosco. With his job on the line and no other options, he enlists her to help them find \\"The Little Boy Bandit,\\" a suspected little person who dresses as a child and commits high profile thefts. Linda unproductively tries to predict where the bandit will strike, until Bosco hurriedly interprets her vague guesses as indicating the Wharf Arts Center as the next target. Meanwhile, the kids go with Teddy to the racetrack as he searches for the woman in a yellow dress. They put their money on Gelding the Lily. Linda returns home, everyone angrily confronts her about her psychic readings: Gretchen's ex-boyfriend is now married and faithful, Mort's financial advisor told him he was being audited, and Bob has yet to fall down any stairs. Linda realizes that her earlier correct predictions were just based on common sense: she saw Mort's wallet falling out as he walked to the bathroom, telemarketers usually call during that time of the day, and Bob's hands smelled like oranges after holding one. Linda sadly concludes that she isn't psychic and hurries to tell Bosco, so he won't lose his job. Bob goes to the racetrack to find the kids, and spots Tina talking to Gelding the Lily's horse jockey. The jockey drops a duffel bag full of costumes that the Little Boy Bandit used in his robberies, giving him away as the thief. Bob immediately calls Linda, who tells Bosco to get to the track. Gelding the Lily is set to win, but just before he does, the police arrive and the jockey flees, causing Gelding the Lily to lose the race, to the kids' dismay. The Little Boy Bandit is arrested, Sergeant Bosco boastfully takes all the credit, and at home, Linda tells Bob that though she is not psychic, she still believes in psychic phenomena, just as Bob slips and falls down the stairs. Reception Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, saying \\"And, if nothing else, ‚ÄúI Get Psy-chic Out Of You‚Äù earns its keep with the all-important revelation that Tina is the Belcher family‚Äôs real comedic genius; she‚Äôs just stuck writing all the best gags for that natural showman Gene. Even when Bob‚Äôs Burgers can‚Äôt quite pull off its main story, it‚Äôs at a point in its creative life where it can quite effectively coast on the hilarity that ensues whenever two or more Belchers are in the same room together.\\" Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode an 8.9 out of 10, saying \\"Not a barnburner of an episode, really. Just a rock solid one, with an outlandish premise sold at every turn by the great voice talent on the program. They do give awards for that, don‚Äôt they? If not, I think the Emmys or Golden Globes should create one just to show their support of the full cast of this show. Or we should, simply by watching them every week and keeping Bob‚Äôs Burgers in our lives for decades to come.\\" The episode received a 0.9 rating and was watched by a total of 2.27 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show on Animation Domination that night, losing to American Dad!, The Simpsons, and Family Guy with 4.77 million.

Nelson, 17th president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the President of the Church is the highest office of the church. It was the office held by Joseph Smith, the church's founder. The President of the LDS Church is the church's leader and the head of the First Presidency, the church's highest governing body. Latter-day Saints consider the president of the church to be a \\"prophet, seer, and revelator\\" and refer to him as \\"the Prophet,\\" a title that was originally given to Smith. When the name of the president is used by adherents, it is usually prefaced by the title \\"President\\". Russell M. Nelson has been the president since January 14, 2018. Latter-day Saints consider the church's president to be God's spokesman to the entire world and the highest priesthood authority on earth, with the exclusive right to receive revelations from God on behalf of the entire church or the entire world. The President of the Church serves as the head of both the Council on the Disposition of the Tithes and the Council of the Church. The President of the Church also serves as the ex officio chairman of the Church Boards of Trustees/Education. History =Joseph Smith= Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter-day Saint movement The concept that the Church of Christ would have a single presiding officer arose in late 1831. Initially, after the church's formation on April 6, 1830, Joseph Smith referred to himself as \\"an apostle of Jesus Christ, and elder of the church.\\"\\"Articles and Covenants of the Church of Christ\\", June 9, 1830; see also However, there was another apostle, Oliver Cowdery, and several other elders of the church, making the formal hierarchy of the church unclear. In September 1830, after Hiram Page said he had received revelations for the church, a revelation to Smith stated that \\"no one shall be appointed to receive commandments and revelations in this church excepting my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., for he receiveth them even as Moses.\\" That established Smith's exclusive right to lead the church. In early June 1831, Smith was ordained to the \\"high priesthood,\\" along with twenty-two other men, including prominent figures in the church such as Hyrum Smith, Parley P. Pratt, and Martin Harris. As \\"high priests\\", they were higher in the priesthood hierarchy than the elders of the church. However, it was still unclear whether Smith's and Cowdery's callings as apostles gave them superior authority to that of other high priests. On November 11, 1831, a revelation to Smith stated that \\"it must needs be that one be appointed of the high priesthood to preside over the Priesthood and he shall be called President of the high priesthood of the Church... and again the duty of the President of the high priesthood is to preside over the whole church.\\" Smith was ordained to that position and sustained by the church on January 25, 1832, at a conference in Amherst, Ohio. In 1835, the \\"Articles and Covenants of the Church of Christ\\" were revised, changing the phrase \\"an... elder of the church\\" to \\"the first elder of this Church.\\" Thus, after 1835, Smith was sometimes referred to as the \\"First Elder\\" of the church. The 1835 revision also added a verse that referred to the office of \\"president of the high priesthood (or presiding elder)\\", which had since been added to the church hierarchy. =Succession crisis= In 1844, in jail awaiting trial for treason charges, Joseph Smith was killed by an armed mob. Hyrum Smith, his presumed successor, was killed in the same incident. Smith had not indisputably established who was next in line as successor to President of the Church. Several claimants to the role of church president emerged during the succession crisis that ensued. Before a large meeting convened to discuss the succession in Nauvoo, Illinois, Sidney Rigdon, the senior surviving member of the church's First Presidency, argued there could be no successor to the deceased prophet and that he should be made the \\"Protector\\" of the church. Brigham Young opposed that reasoning and motion, as Smith had earlier recorded a revelation, which stated the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles was \\"equal in authority and power\\" to the First Presidency, so Young claimed that the leadership of the church fell to the Twelve Apostles. Most who were in attendance were persuaded that the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles should lead the church and Young was sustained as \\"the president of the quorum of the Twelve and first presidency of the church,\\" thereby assuming leadership of the church.Times and Seasons, 5 [1 November 1844]: 692 However, Young was not ordained President of the Church at the time. =Later developments= On December 27, 1847, three-and-a-half years after Smith's death, Young was ordained the President of the Church. At the time, seniority was determined by the first date of ordination as an apostle. By that definition, Heber C. Kimball was the most senior. However, since he was called to the First Presidency, Orson Hyde, who was the next most senior apostle became the President of the Quorum. In 1869, Brigham Young changed the order of the seniority, placing Brigham Young Jr., who was the most recently called member of the Quorum, ahead of Joseph F. Smith. Smith had been in the Quorum longer, but Young Jr. had been an apostle longer. In 1875, Young changed the definition of seniority to be determined by the longest continuous term as an apostle. Since Orson Hyde and Parley P. Pratt had been temporarily removed from the apostleship during Nauvoo, they were removed from their position and placed in seniority, based on when they were reinstated as an apostle. That gave John Taylor the highest seniority, since Kimball had died. When Young died in 1877, Taylor assumed leadership instead of Hyde. Wilford Woodruff, explained in 1879, \\"Elder Taylor is the oldest in Ordination and that is why he presides today.\\" The First Presidency was absolved, and the previous members were ordained as counselors to the Twelve. Other men were called to fill the vacancies in the Quorum. When Taylor died, the pattern changed, and the members of the First Presidency rejoined the Quorum based on their seniority. Two years later, Wilford Woodruff was ordained as President of the Church and Lorenzo Snow was the President of the Quorum. When Woodruff died, his counselors returned to the Quorum based on the date they were ordained an apostle, placing George Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith below Brigham Young Jr. and John Willard Young. Heber J. Grant objected to that arguing that seniority should be based on ordination to the Quorum rather than ordination as an apostle. Young argued that an apostle should not be demoted as long as he is worthy of the position. On March 31, 1900, Snow met with his counselors, Cannon and Smith, and decided to change the policy to gauge seniority based on entrance to the Quorum, rather than ordination as an apostle. Part of the reasoning was the ordination of Brigham Young Jr was done privately by his father, Brigham Young, without the members voting on the ordination. That put Cannon and Smith ahead of both Brigham Young Jr. and John Willard Young. However, Brigham Young Jr. maintained his position as President of the Quorum. Before Snow died, he instructed Smith not to wait to reorganize the First Presidency, which gave no time to John Willard Young to object. From then on, apostles were not ordained without also being called to the Quorum. On November 23, 1918, Anthon H. Lund, the most senior apostle, was called to serve in the First Presidency. Rather than give up his title as President of the Quorum, as had been done earlier, he maintained his title, and Rudger Clawson was given the title of Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. That pattern is the pattern that is followed today. LDS Church president =Current= Following the January 2, 2018 death of the 16th church president, Thomas S. Monson, Russell M. Nelson was ordained and set apart on January 14, 2018 as the church's 17th president. In an unprecedented move, Nelson was introduced as the new church president by D. Todd Christofferson, the senior apostle on the Church Public Affairs Committee on January 16, 2018, in a broadcast originating from the annex of the Salt Lake Temple. Nelson then introduced his counselors and the new leadership of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. That introduction was followed with a traditional press conference, which has been typical for new church presidents and their counselors since being originated in 1973 with new church president Spencer W. Kimball.Russell M. Nelson Named 17th Church President, Mormon Newsroom, 16 January 2018. Retrieved 17 January 2018. =Succession to the presidency= In the LDS Church, when a president of the church dies, the First Presidency is dissolved, and the members of the First Presidency who were formerly members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles rejoin it. The Quorum of the Twelve, which may number greater than twelve with the returning members from the First Presidency, then becomes the presiding council of the church, with the senior apostle as its president. (Seniority is determined by the time since joining the Quorum, not by age.) The President of the Quorum of the Twelve becomes the highest-ranking official in the church and has always become the next church president.Brent L. Top and Lawrence R. Flake, \\"'The Kingdom of God Will Roll On': Succession in the Presidency\\", Ensign, August 1996, p. 22. However, the appointment is not made official until the Quorum of the Twelve meets and selects the next president of the church. Since the late 19th century, the Quorum of the Twelve has moved quickly to reconstitute the First Presidency within days or weeks of the late church president's death. However, Brigham Young presided over the church for three years as the President of the Quorum of the Twelve before the First Presidency was reconstituted after the death of Joseph Smith. The tradition of waiting for two to three years before selecting a new president continued until the 1898 death of the fourth president of the church, Wilford Woodruff. Since then, the surviving apostles have typically met in the Salt Lake Temple on the Sunday following the late president's funeral, to select and set apart the next president of the church (that was done in 1973, and described in detail by N. Eldon Tanner to Brigham Young University students in 1978).N. Eldon Tanner, \\"Administration of the Restored Church\\", Tambuli, September 1978, p. 2.\\"Succession in the Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\\", churchofjesuschrist.org. At the next regularly scheduled general conference, the membership of the church have the opportunity of sustaining their new leader by common consent, at a special conference session referred to as a \\"solemn assembly.\\" =Seniority in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles= Seniority in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles is important, as the senior apostle presides over the Quorum and usually becomes the president of the church after the current president's death. Specific rules have been applied to unusual situations that have arisen over time, including a member being removed from the quorum by disfellowshipment or excommunication and later being restored to the quorum. It was decided that, the removed apostle then loses his seniority in the quorum. For example, Brigham Young decided that John Taylor was to be President of the Twelve and Wilford Woodruff would follow him in seniority because of the readmission to the quorum of Orson Hyde, who had been disfellowshipped in 1846, and Orson Pratt, who had been excommunicated in 1842. Young ruled in 1875 that when Hyde and Pratt rejoined the quorum, they became the newest junior members of the quorum and their previous service was not considered when calculating quorum seniority. Later, whether or not an apostle was a member of the Quorum and when the apostle was added as a member of the Quorum became an important factor. For example, following the death of Lorenzo Snow, John Willard Young (ordained 1855 but never in the Quorum) became the senior apostle, and Brigham Young, Jr. (ordained 1864 and added to the Quorum 1868), the senior apostle serving in the Quorum. However, on April 5, 1900, the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve unanimously decided that the date an individual became a member of the Quorum of the Twelve was the relevant date for succession purposes, not the date an individual was ordained as an apostle. Thus, Joseph F. Smith (ordained apostle 1866 and added to the quorum 1867) became president of the church in 1901, since he was the living apostle who had become a member of the Quorum of the Twelve at the earliest date. In another instance, Ezra Taft Benson left active status in the quorum for a time when he was serving as the United States Secretary of Agriculture in the Eisenhower administration. However, Benson did not lose seniority in the Quorum, and he became the president of the church upon the death of Spencer W. Kimball. If the President of the Quorum of the Twelve has been called to be a counselor in the First Presidency, the most senior apostle not in the First Presidency is set apart and referred to as the Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. At the death of the president of the church, the Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve retains his position in the quorum's membership, and the President of the Quorum of the Twelve takes his role as President of the Quorum. Establishing doctrine, infallibility, and opinion When the church president is speaking in his official capacity, his words are not considered \\"infallible.\\" Members of the church are considered not fully justified in their actions if they \\"blindly\\" follow the president.Brigham Young taught that \\"the greatest fear I have is that the people of this Church will accept what we say as the will of the Lord without first praying about it and getting the witness within their own hearts that what we say is the word of the Lord.\\" From Teachings of Harold B. Lee, p. 541; See Discourses of Brigham Young, sel. John A. Widtsoe (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book., 1941) p. 135; 64-04, pp. 162‚Äì63.Harold B. Lee, Stand Ye In Holy Places, pp. 162‚Äì63, \\"The Prophet, Seer, and Revelator,\\" Address delivered to seminary and institute teachers, BYU, 8 July 1964. The church has counseled its members that they should reject statements that contradict what is found in church scriptures \\"regardless of the position of the man who says it.\\"\\"Church Response to Jon Krakauer's Under the Banner of Heaven\\", churchofjesuschrist.org. Instructions given or positions taken by the president of the church can be changed by a future president of the church because of the Latter-day Saint belief in \\"continuing revelation.\\" It is accepted that a church president will occasionally revise or clarify instructions of past church presidents. One apostle of the church counseled to \\"beware of those who would pit the dead prophets against the living prophets, for the living prophets always take precedence.\\" Not everything said by the prophet is considered to be doctrine. Joseph Smith taught that \\"a prophet is a prophet only when he was acting as such.\\"Joseph Smith, History of the Church, 5:265. When the church president declares new doctrine, \\"he will declare it as revelation from God, and it will be so accepted by the Council of the Twelve and sustained by the body of the Church.\\"Harold B. Lee, The First Area General Conference for Germany, Austria, Holland, Italy, Switzerland, France, Belgium, and Spain of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in Munich, Germany, 24‚Äì26 August 1973, with Reports and Discourses, 69. . \\"[N]o member of the Church has the right to publish any doctrines, as the doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, without first submitting them for examination and approval to the First Presidency and the Twelve\\" (Proclamation of the First Presidency and Twelve, dated 21 October 1865, The Seer. Printed in Messages of the First Presidency, edited by James R. Clark, Vol. 2, (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965), 238‚Äì39). If the doctrine is not accepted by the church as the word of God, members are not bound by it,\\"The rule in that respect is‚ÄîWhat God has spoken, and what has been accepted by the Church as the word of God, by that, and that only, are we bound in doctrine.\\": B. H. Roberts, Deseret News (23 July 1921) section 4:7. even if it comes from the President of the Church.Harold B. Lee taught that \\"if he says something that contradicts what is found in the standard works (I think that is why we call them 'standard'‚Äîit is the standard measure of all that men teach), you may know by that same token that it is false; regardless of the position of the man who says it.\\" (Harold B. Lee, \\"The Place of the Living Prophet, Seer, and Revelator,\\" Address to Seminary and Institute of Religion Faculty, BYU, 8 July 1964). When the president of the church speaks, it is not always in his official capacity. The president may offer opinion and conjecture about topics that may or may not be church doctrine or inspired by God. It may be difficult to know when the president of the church is speaking in his capacity as such and when he is offering personal opinion. Most Latter- day Saints assume that statements made by the president in sermons at a church general conference or other formal church meeting would constitute statements made in the capacity of church president. However, even then, the president may explicitly indicate that he is expressing only a personal opinion.See, for example, Gordon B. Hinckley, \\"War and Peace\\", Ensign, May 2003, p. 78, in which Church President Hinckley indicated that he was expressing his \\"personal feelings\\" and \\"personal loyalties\\" on the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. However, because of the accepted principle that a prophet's teachings need not include the declaration \\"thus saith the Lord\\" to be considered binding, individual members of the church may feel cultural pressure to follow suggestions from the president of the church, just as if they were commandments.Boyd K. Packer, \\"The Unwritten Order of Things\\". Presidents of the church have taught that God will never allow the president to lead the Latter-day Saints astray and that God will \\"remove\\" any man who stands at the head of the church who intends to mislead its members.Wilford Woodruff, Doctrine and Covenants \\"\\"Official Declaration 1\\". That is not a statement of belief that they are \\"infallible\\"\\"The position is not assumed that the men of the New Dispensation‚Äîits prophets, apostles, presidencies, and other leaders‚Äîare without faults or infallible, rather they are treated as men of like passions with their fellow men.\\" (James R. Clark, quoting B. H. Roberts, Messages of the First Presidency, edited by James R. Clark, Vol. 4, (Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft, 1970), p. xiv‚Äìxv.). but that their errors will not result in \\"the permanent injury of the work.\\"Boyd K. Packer, \\"I Say unto You, Be One,\\" in BYU Devotional and Fireside Speeches, 1990‚Äì1991 (Provo, Utah: University Publications, 1991) p. 84.\\"With all their inspiration and greatness, prophets are yet mortal men with imperfections common to mankind in general. They have their opinions and prejudices and are left to work out their own problems without inspiration in many instances.\\" Bruce R. McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, 2nd ed., (Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft, 1966) p. 608.\\"Revelations from God... are not constant. We believe in continuing revelation, not continuous revelation. We are often left to work out problems without the dictation or specific direction of the Spirit.\\" Dallin H. Oaks, \\"Teaching and Learning by the Spirit,\\" Ensign, March 1997, p. 14. Thus, the current prophet can clarify, correct, or change any previous teachings.Ezra Taft Benson, \\"Fourteen Fundamentals in Following the Prophet\\" , 26 February 1980. Counselors When a new president of the church is selected, he chooses counselors to assist him. Most presidents have had a minimum of two counselors, but circumstances have occasionally required more than two. For example, David O. McKay had five counselors during the final years of his presidency and at one point, Brigham Young had eight. Counselors are usually chosen from among the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, but there have been a number of exceptions where members of the church's Presiding Bishopric or persons from the church at large were called to be counselors. Any high priest of the church is eligible to be called as a counselor in the First Presidency. There have also been a few cases of counselors being ordained to the priesthood office of apostle and becoming members of the Quorum of the Twelve after they had been chosen as counselors in the First Presidency, like J. Reuben Clark. There have been other cases of counselors being ordained to the office of apostle but not set apart as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, such as Alvin R. Dyer. Other counselors in the First Presidency were never ordained to the office of apostle, such as Charles W. Nibley and John R. Winder. Whether or not a counselor in the First Presidency is an ordained apostle, he is accepted by the church as a prophet, seer, and revelator. Counselors are designated \\"First Counselor in the First Presidency\\" and \\"Second Counselor in the First Presidency,\\" based on the order of being selected by the president. Additional counselors have been designated in different ways, including \\"Third Counselor in the First Presidency\\" (such as Hugh B. Brown), \\"Assistant Counselor to the President\\" (such as John Willard Young), and simply \\"Counselor in the First Presidency\\" (such as Thorpe B. Isaacson). The president and all his counselors constitute the First Presidency, which is the presiding quorum of the church. The next senior apostle to the president of the church is set apart by the president to be the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Removal Though there has never been a popular movement in the church to have a president removed or punished, he could theoretically be removed from his position or otherwise disciplined by the Common Council of the Church. The only president of the church brought before the Common Council was Joseph Smith, who was tried for charges made against him by Sylvester Smith after the return of Zion's Camp in 1834.Joseph Fielding Smith (1953). Church History and Modern Revelation (Salt Lake City: Council of the Twelve Apostles) 2:21.

After leaving school he was unemployed for some years, till, prompted by Rev. Sir James Stonehouse, he decided to enter the Church of England, and after three years' preparation was ordained in 1786, and became curate of Tilshead and Imber, villages about four miles distant from Lavington. He remained in the area, adding to his income by taking pupils, till his marriage in 1800. He then moved to the curacy of Botley, near Southampton. Gauntlett left Botley in 1804 for the curacy of Wellington, Shropshire, which he occupied for a year, and then took charge of a chapel at Reading, Berkshire, not under episcopal jurisdiction. After two years' time he moved to the curacy of Nettlebed and Pishill, Oxfordshire; and then in 1811 to Olney, Buckinghamshire. In 1815 the vicar of Olney died, and Gauntlett obtained the living, which he held till his death in 1833.

It is on display at the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon (oil on canvas 202 x 241 cm).  History  Jacob Jordaens (also known as Jacques Jordaens) was born in Anvers, United Provinces of the Netherlands, in 1593. He was brought up in a rich family and received a good education, proven by his biblical and mythological knowledge. In 1620, he painted Mercury and Argus and started collaborating with Van Dyck and Rubens. The Mayor of Lyon Jean-Fran√ßois Termes acquired the artwork in 1843 for the sum of 2,000 francs (US$1,990). It was restored in 1991 and was lent to the Petit Palais during the exhibition \\"Jordaens (1593-1678), la gloire d'Anvers\\" from September 19, 2013 to January 19, 2014.Jordaens, la gloire d'Anvers  Description  The painting refers to the myth of Mercury, Argus (Argos) and Io, found in The Metamorphoses written by Ovid (I, 583 ; IX, 687): Jupiter (Zeus) falls in love with Io, a priestess of Hera, his wife, who quickly discovers the affair. Jupiter transforms himself into a bull and transforms Io into a beautiful, white heifer in order to hide from Hera's wrath. Hera understands his strategy and demands the heifer as a present. To end their affair, Hera puts Io under the guard of the giant Argus Panoptes, who has 100 eyes. Jupiter commands his son Mercury (Hermes) to set Io free by lulling Argus to sleep with an enchanted flute. Mercury, disguised as a shepherd, is invited by Argus to his camp. Mercury charms him with lullabies and then cuts his head off \\"Thus Argus lies in pieces, cold, and pale; And all his hundred eyes, with all their light, Are clos'd at once, in one perpetual night. These Juno takes, that they no more may fail, And spreads them in her peacock's gaudy tail.\\"Metamorphoses (tr. Garth, Dryden, et al.), Book I, The Eyes of Argus transform'd into a Peacock's Train  Analysis  = Disposition = The framing is narrowly focused on the figures; the canvas is cut on the right-hand side and there is little room left for scenery. The heifers are located on the superior part of the painting. Their bodies form an upside down triangle and form, along with the bodies of the characters, a chiasmus (heifer, human, human, heifer) that appeals to the eye. The background is in fact a foreshadow of the murder; the colours of the sky and the bushes are dark, and three of the heifers are looking at the spectator. Mercury, disguised as a barefooted young shepherd with a straw hat, is gazing at Argus (who, unlike the myth, has only two eyes) and is about to strike a lethal blow. Argus is asleep, his hand on his stick. Argus' dog is also present, but seems sheepish and impassive. In fact, the dog is looking at the hidden knife under Mercury's leg. Mercury's movement with his knife, from the bottom to the top in a circular way, is highlighting the impression of movement and reinforces the suggested dramatic tension. = Colours and lights = The colours are dark; there are brown and dark green tones for the bushes at the left bottom corner, on the right hand side and in the middle; dark blue and shades of grey for the sky, but also very light colours, typical of the baroque style with the chiaroscuro technique, that enlightens the characters and the action and highlights their anatomy. The light of the artwork is similar to the light of a thunderstorm; the sky is dark and the light is raw. The sky confirms this feeling of a calm before the storm and sets a dynamic characteristic to the artwork along with curves that set an impression of movement. The leaves and the heifers also give a gloomy impression because of their very dark colours. While the landscape is a foreshadow, the scene is not violent because the murder is on the verge of happening. Mercury is dressed in blue and white while Argus is dressed in red, and these two colours are opposed. Blue refers to Mercury's divinity and white his feigned innocent. The red colour announces Argus' death because it is the colour of blood, but it also is an echo to Caravaggio who painted his Saint Jerome (Valletta) in red, the colour of wisdom. It can also be interpreted as the colour of lust, as if Argus, charmed, was in the same time perverted by Mercury. The colours of the heifers are in opposition too; while Io is white, the colour of purity, there is also a black one, a symbol of fatality and death, that covers a corner of the painting, showing a point of no return. = Esthetic and reception = The contrasts and the movements are highlighted by a low angle shot point of view of the scene. There is no supernatural aspect and the painting is clearly influenced by realism, as if the scene could happen in real life, except the fact that the characters are only dressed with togas. There is a real precision in the traits of the human characters, precision that can be found once again in paintings of Caravaggio. There is a true study of anatomy, shown in Argus' shrivelled up skin. Mercury's muscles are prominent. This precision reinforces the baroque style of the artwork. The 16th century Flemish painter and poet Karel van Mander gave an example of interpretation of Ovid's myth; more than a conflict between two generations, there is a lesson of morality. Argus is charmed by Mercury who represents lust and desire, and finally dies from his hand. Jordaens likes to give an echo to morals in his paintings, even in those with prosaic subject-matters. Mercury and Argus is a representation of the myth, but also renews it with a very baroque style influenced by realism that re-establishes the myth in reality and popularises it.

The comic follows the adventures of the title character and his uncle Vukoje as they travel around the Balkans as early Slavic scouts during the 6th century. During the 1970s, Dikan was one of the most popular comics in Yugoslavia.Sa≈°a Rakeziƒá, \\"Buzdovan i meko srce\\", vreme.com Dikan was originally created in 1969 by artist Lazo Sredanoviƒá for Politikin Zabavnik magazine. Since that date, 24 Dikan stories were published in the magazine.D. Sto≈°iƒá, \\"Dikan ponovo ≈°eta Balkanom\\", danas.rs History The creation of Dikan is linked to the changes in Politikin Zabavnik magazine. In 1968, Politikin Zabavnik switched from newspaper to magazine format, and the magazine's editor-in-chiefs, Nikola Lekiƒá, thought that the magazine should, beside foreign comics, publish a domestic comic based on national history, perhaps modeled after Asterix. Lekiƒá asked several artists to send their ideas about an early Slavic hero to the magazine. The working title of the comic was Bikan. On the editorial staff meeting, the drawings of painter Lazo Sredanoviƒá, who was a graduate from the University of Arts in Belgrade and until then had little to do with the Yugoslav comics scene, gained most attention. Translator Krinka Vitoroviƒá suggested that the name of the character should be changed to Dikan. First part of the first Dikan story, entitled \\"Buzdovanske igre\\" (\\"Morning Star Games\\"), was published in 903rd issue of Politikin Zabavnik on April 18, 1969. Dikan stories were, during the years, written by a number of writers: Ninoslav ≈†ibaliƒá, Milenko Maticki, Branko ƒêurica, Slobodan Ivkov, and Lekiƒá himself. Last three Dikan stories, published in 2004, 2009 and 2014 respectively, were written by Sredanoviƒá himself. In Politikin Zabavnik, Dikan was published in sequels, usually a page per issue. Until today, 24 Dikan stories were published. In 1973, Politikin Zabavnik appeared in Slovenian language, and in Slovenian issues Dikan was renamed to Tilen. In 2013, Serbian publisher Everest Media published first out of four planned books with collected Dikan stories. =List of episodes= #\\"Buzdovanske igre\\" (\\"Morning Star Games\\", 1969) #\\"Bitka u Crnoj ≈†umi\\" (\\"Battle of the Black Forest\\", 1969) #\\"Tajne Singidunuma\\" (\\"Secrets of Singidunum\\", 1969/1970) #\\"Zovite me Zokan\\" (\\"Call me Zokan\\", 1970) #\\"Mis Papriƒçica\\" (\\"Miss Pepper\\", 1970) #\\"Gospodar Dioklecijanove palate\\" (\\"The Master of Diocletian's Palace\\", 1970) #\\"Uzbudljiva plovidba\\" (\\"Exciting Sail\\", 1970/1971) #\\"Dikan i car Justinijan\\" (\\"Dikan and Emperor Justinian\\", 1971) #\\"Velika trka\\" (\\"The Big Race\\", 1971) #\\"Put u Sirimijum\\" (\\"The Road to Sirmium\\", 1971) #\\"U zemlji Gepida\\" (\\"In the Land of Gepids\\", 1971/1972) #\\"Dikan i poslednje Frruke\\" (\\"Dikan and the last Frrrukas\\", 1972) #\\"Dikan i prvi reli\\" (\\"Dikan and the First Rally\\", 1972/1973) #\\"Dikan i turistiƒçka zver\\" (\\"Dikan and the Touristic Beast\\", 1973) #\\"Dikan i lokalni tiranin\\" (\\"Dikan and the Local Tyrant\\", 1973) #\\"Dikantrop i Vesna Sapiens\\" (\\"Dikantrope and Vesna Sapiens\\", 1973/1974) #\\"Dikan i ≈°pijuni\\" (\\"Dikan and the Spies\\", 1974) #\\"Dikan i stari Sloveni\\" (\\"Dikan and the Early Slavs\\", 1975) #\\"Dikan i pretnja sa Oriona\\" (\\"Dikan and the Threat from Orion\\", 1982/1983) #\\"Dikan i Hazari\\" (\\"Dikan and the Khazars\\", 1993) #\\"Dikan i Atlantida\\" (\\"Dikan and the Atlantis\\", 1993/1994) #\\"Plava ≈°pilja\\" (\\"Blue Cave\\", 2004) #\\"Praznik mimoze\\" (\\"Mimosa Days\\", 2009) #\\"Dikan i Vukoje\\" (\\"Dikan and Vukoje\\", 2014) Synopsis and characters Dikan and his uncle Vukoje are Slavic scouts, traveling around the Balkans. Originally, the comic was set in the 6th century, before the migration of the Slavs to the Balkans, but some of the later stories are set in the ancient and more recent past. Dikan, armed with a morning star, is very strong, but is also sensitive. His uncle Vukoje is wise and has the experience which Dikan lacks.

While in college, she joined the Fabulous Dirt Sisters, an acoustic band that she traveled and played with for four years. After her time with the band, she found a job as an engineer at an acid house recording studio in Nottingham. Here she was introduced to the sampler, which she took on board. However, she was interested in the computer glitches and accidents that would produce unexpected sounds rather than in the sampler‚Äôs capacity to create rhythmic music. Initially she returned to the violin, using a midi violin and a sampler to perform. She was one of the early users of the LiSa software developed at Steim. Her sonic armchair and sonic bed are both meant for listening to electronic music in different ways as what we are used to. In 2013 she founded the Bicrophonic Research Institute together with Dave Griffiths. The institute is specialised in developing sonic bike projects.

Later on the prominent Barelvi leaders Shah Ahmad Noorani, Shaikh ul Quran Allama Ghulam Ali Okarvi, Muhammad Shafee Okarvi, Syed Shujaat Ali Qadri, Iftikharul Hasan Shah and Khalid Hasan Shah also joined them to oppose the Ahmadiyya Movement. After Independence of Pakistan The roots of Majlis-e-Tahaffuz-e-Khatme Nabuwwat can be traced back to the 1880s when Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian proclaimed himself to be a prophet in Islam. The organization gained momentum during the 1953 riots against Ahmadi Muslims. The Court of enquiry report on the disturbances explains the real reasons for this violent uprising against Ahmadiyya. Main reasons being criticism of Ahmadi was due to the theological differences and using the Ahmadiyya issues by Muslim conservatives to gain political mileage. The rioters had three major demands: # Removal of Sir Muhammad Zafarullah Khan from the foreign ministry # Removal of Ahmadi Muslims from top government offices; # Declaration of Ahmadis as non-Muslims. The movement launched countrywide campaigns and protests to persecute Ahmadis across the nation. Majlis, along with many religious leaders, spearheaded this movement to declare Ahmadis as non-Muslims.Profile of Mufti Mahmood on storyofpakistan.com website Retrieved 9 April 2019 Ahmadis declared Non-Muslims in 1974 Many Islamist theologians Pakistan particularly Ulama-I-Ahle-Sunnat under the leadership of Shah Ahmad Noorani Siddiqui started a successful campaign against the Ahmadis and compelled the members of the National Assembly to declare Ahmadis as non-Muslims. And such a clause was inserted in the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan declaring that followers of Mirza Ghulam Ahmed are non-Muslims by Second Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan. After meeting the first agenda, Khatme-Nabuwat started the next phase of their campaign ‚Äì to force Ahmadis to comply with the new law. They started demanding legal sanctions on Ahmadis barring them from using the title of Muslim. This campaign was at its peak when Shah Ahmad Noorani and Punjab-based Khalid Hasan Shah were leading the Kul Jamaati Majlis-e-Amal Tahafuz-e-Khatam-e-Nabuwat in 1984 and 1985. The then president General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq passed an ordinance in 1984 amending the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) that called for punitive sanctions on Ahmadis in 1984, commonly known as Ordinance XX.Pakistan and Ahmadis (Government of Pakistan - Law for Ahmadis) on The Gazette of Pakistan - a government website Published 26 April 1984, Retrieved 10 April 2019 =Activism of Khatme Nabuwwat leaders= As early as 2011 and later in 2015, Jalali was leading anti-government protests in support of Barelvi militant Mumtaz Qadri, who had assassinated governor Salmaan Taseer.Rana Tanveer, Qadri supporters stage Mall sit-in The Express Tribune (newspaper), 4 October 2011.

The Classical Revival building, built in 1926 to a design by James J. Baldwin, was the second built on the site. The prior courthouse on the site burned twice, but after the second fire was not salvageable. The blue marble- faced two story building has a five-bay diagonal section facing the roadway that forms its entrance. It has a four-columned Corinthian Greek portico, and is topped by a monumental cupola which rises well above the structure. All the blue marble used for the construction was quarried locally from area mines. The building interior, especially its courtroom, has retained much of its original woodwork and stone styling. The courthouse underwent a substantial remodel around 2011, which modernized the interior, but in turn cost the building some of its original interior features. The remodel also added additional court rooms, and offices to the rear section of the building. The old Cherokee County Jail which was built in 1922 was demolished in order to make room for the new addition. The copper lantern which sits atop the dome, was removed around 2017 to make crucial repairs to the lantern. It was in danger of collapsing in on itself, due to structural deterioration over the years, as well as being riddled with bullet holes. The lantern was restored locally with help from The Cherokee County Board of Commissioners, the Cherokee County Maintenance Department, Tri-County Community College Welding Department, as well as numerous other skilled local residents.

Cherokee county has a list of former courthouses, either destroyed by fire, or replaced by improved models. The first courts in the county were held at Fort Butler, which was constructed as a holding area for the native Cherokee people during the Trail of Tears. Around 1840 Archibald Russell Spence Hunter, who was a prominent merchant, and first postmaster in the area, had the first brick courthouse constructed on the current public square. It was burned down in 1865 by raiders, right after the Civil War had ended. The third was built of brick as well, two stories, and square in its design, the county quickly outgrew this courthouse. A forth courthouse was built on the site of the current marble courthouse on Peachtree Street, down the street from the traditional public square where previous courthouses sat. It was also constructed of brick, had a clock tower, offices on the first floor, and a courtroom on the second. It was constructed in the early 1890s, and burned twice, finally being demolished after the second fire. The fifth, and final building sits on the foundations of the former 1890s courthouse.

James. It stars Caity Lotz and Toby Stephens as computer scientists who create an artificial intelligence for the British military.  Plot  In the future, at an underground subterranean base, the United Kingdom only has a couple of weeks before the city of Taipei, Taiwan falls to the Chinese. The British need soldiers who are both fluent in Chinese dialect as well as ruthless killers. Scientists employed by Britain's Ministry of Defence produce a cybernetic implant that allows brain-damaged soldiers to regain lost functions. Scientist Vincent McCarthy sets up a cognitive test for soldier Paul Dawson, a recipient of the cybernetic implant to rehabilitate his left hemispherectomy. Upset with Dawson's inability to remember anything about his past and apparent lack of empathy, McCarthy ignores Dawson's requests to see his mother. Dawson turns hostile, kills a scientist and wounds McCarthy, before apologizing and being shot. Afterwards, Dawson's mother regularly stays on the road to the entrance of the secret base, though McCarthy denies that her son was ever there. McCarthy's research leads to a series of more stable cyborgs. Although they lose the capability for human speech, the cyborgs develop a highly efficient method of communication that they keep secret. When researcher Ava demonstrates her latest work in artificial intelligence, McCarthy recruits her by promising her unlimited funds for her research. Thomson, the director, is suspicious of Ava's countercultural politics and sympathy for Dawson's mother but he relents when McCarthy insists that she is the only one who can provide the necessary programme for their latest project, a self-aware and conscious android. McCarthy plans to use this technology to help his daughter Mary, who suffers from Rett syndrome, a neurological disorder. When she finds out, Ava volunteers to help and McCarthy maps her brain. During a demonstration of cybernetic arms that provide superhuman strength, amputee soldier James whispers a cry for help to Ava, who becomes suspicious of the treatment of the wounded soldiers. After she goes exploring in the base, McCarthy sternly warns her to avoid causing trouble. The warning comes too late and Thomson arranges to have her murdered by a Chinese Ministry of State Security agent, who impersonates Dawson's mother. Grieved by the loss of Ava, McCarthy insists that they use her brain scan and likeness for the new project, whom they dub Machine. Machine turns out to be more human than they expected or even wanted; she shows regret when she accidentally kills a human and refuses orders that violate her sense of morality. As Thomson's demands on her grow more at odds with her morality, Machine becomes increasingly distressed and asks McCarthy to protect her. An antagonism grows between Thomson and McCarthy; Thomson promises that he will relent if McCarthy can prove that Machine is sentient. After Mary dies, Thomson uses her brain scans as leverage against McCarthy, threatening to destroy the scans, unless McCarthy excises Machine's consciousness. Machine, who has come to love McCarthy, offers to sacrifice herself for Mary and he removes a chip from Machine's head. Thomson reneges on his deal and orders Machine to kill McCarthy. Although Machine seems at first to obey, a scientist alerts Thomson that the operation was a sham and it only disabled fail-safe routines designed to destroy Machine. Machine and the cyborgs rebel against the humans and free McCarthy. From his computer console, Thomson disables half the cyborgs but Suri, his cyborg aide, overrides his access before he can kill the rest. Thomson shoots and wounds Suri but Machine corners him in his office; wounded, he first orders her to obey, then begs for his life. Although Machine agrees not to kill him, she lobotomizes him, as he attempted to do to her. After leaving Thomson for dead, Machine downloads Mary's brain scan. Machine, McCarthy and Suri escape the base; outside, McCarthy hands the base records to Dawson's mother and leaves to start a new life with Machine. In the final scene, McCarthy talks to a computer virtualisation of his daughter and she requests to play a game with her mother. McCarthy hands the tablet to Machine, and she is then shown gazing alternately at the device and at a beautiful orange sunset over the Atlantic Ocean.

Shooting took place mostly in Wales. Caity Lotz performed her own stunts. Writer-director Caradog James prepared by reading books on robotics, AI and quantum mechanics. He said that he wanted to ground the film in science rather than fantasy.  Release  The Machine premiered in New York City, New York, at the Tribeca Film Festival on 20 April 2013. It was released on 21 March 2014, in the United Kingdom. XLrator released it in the United States on 8 April 2014, on video on demand, and 25 April 2014, in a limited release.

Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 79% of 28 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the weighted average rating was 6.2/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"The Machine proves an audacious debut for writer-director Caradog James and a solid entry in modern British sci-fi, with thematic heft to match its genre thrills.\\" Metacritic rated it with a score of 52/100 based on 8 critics, signifying \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter called it a \\"brooding, stylish, highly atmospheric future-noir thriller.\\" Matt Glasby of Total Film rated it 3/5 stars and called it unsubtle and derivative. Anna Smith of Time Out London rated it 3/5 stars and called it \\"a smart, thought- provoking little thriller\\". Kim Newman of Empire rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, \\"Brimming with ideas and laudable ambition, it's well worth a look.\\" Leslie Felperin of The Guardian rated it 3/5 stars and called it predictable but full of ideas. Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote that it \\"works modestly well\\" but has trouble appealing to both science fiction and action film fans. Jon Espino from TheYoungFolks.com rated the film 8 out of 10 stars and wrote that despite some flaws, it compares favorably with major Hollywood blockbusters. The Machine won three BAFTA Cymru awards, Best of UK Film Award at Raindance Film Festival, and Achievement Against the Odds Prize by the British Independent Film Awards. TV adaptation In September 2016, Syfy ordered a TV series based on the movie with Caradog W. James as executive producer.

In addition to software products, GB Information Management also provided bureau services relating to postcodes, names, addresses and other information. In July 1999 GB Information Management was acquired by Phonelink, a company founded by Trevor Burke. At the time of acquisition, GB Information Management had a turnover of ¬£6.9million, an operating profit of ¬£1million and employed approximately 80 people in Chester, United Kingdom. On 1 April 2000, the company changed its name from Phonelink plc to TelMe.com plc in response to the success of their early Tel-Me application. In February 2004, the company changed its name to GB Group as part of a movement to distinguish itself from its previous travel interests. In 2006 the company launched an international identity verification service covering 21 countries. In 2011 GB Group moved to a listing on the London Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market.

History  Before Ume√• had a bridge the inhabitants crossed the river using ice roads during the winter and with ferries the other seasons. During the second Russian occupation of Ume√• in the Finnish War the Russians in 1809 built a floating bridge of logs across the river. However, soon thereafter it was destroyed by a spring flood. To build a bridge over the Ume River was long considered to be too costly, but the governor Gustaf Munthe became interested in the issue when he took office in 1856 and 1858. He gave a mandate to investigate where the bridge would be most appropriate, to create proposals on drawings and calculate what it would cost. The investigation indicated that just outside the city, upstream of the river, the river's base was most favorable to carry the bridge. The expected cost of the bridge would be 65,450 kronor. With the attendant cost, the total cost would be 86,000 kronor. The bridge was opened in 1863 and for a long time travelers had to pay a fee to use the bridge. After only a decade the original woodwork needed to be changed and in 1894-95 it was replaced with steel and the bridge got the appearance it has today.

It aired from 2009 to 2017, with the final program airing on 27 June 2017. The program was aired by TV P√∫blica Digital, the state broadcaster, with matches aired by various stations in the interior of the country. In its final year, other commercial broadcasters joined the broadcast. History alt= From 1991 to 2009, the rights to Primera Divisi√≥n matches were held by Televisi√≥n Sat√©lite Codificada, a company co-owned by Grupo Clar√≠n and Torneos y Competencias. Most of the matches were broadcast on the cable channel TyC Sports, and some were broadcast as pay-per-view events. The rights included a restriction for other outlets: until the Sunday night highlights show F√∫tbol de Primera was broadcast, no other media could air highlights of the matches. After the 2008-09 season, several Primera Divisi√≥n clubs began to run into severe financial troubles that also put the 2009-10 championship at risk. The Argentine Football Association (AFA) asked TSC to pay 720 million pesos to ameliorate the situation, but TSC, which had already paid 230 million pesos to the AFA, declined, saying that the payment would put the company at risk of major losses. On 8 August 2009, the Argentine government made an offer for 600 million pesos for the rights to broadcast the games, which would be placed on over-the-air television. Three days later, the AFA announced it was breaking the contract it had with TSC, which extended until 2014, and on 20 August, President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner announced in a cadena nacional that over-the-air TV stations would offer free broadcasts of the matches. The deal was to run ten years, beginning with a 21 August match between Gimnasia and Godoy Cruz. In 2011, the AFA broke its television contract with TRISA, another joint venture between Clar√≠n and TyC, for Primera B Nacional matches. F√∫tbol para Todos also carried World Cup qualifying matches and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Broadcast The F√∫tbol para todos broadcast included its own announcers and advertising, which all repeaters carried. At the beginning and end of its time, FPT was successful in luring advertisers to its broadcasts. However, in February 2010, after just six months on the air, all but two advertisers were forced out. One was truck manufacturer Iveco, which paid for some of the air time in trucks; the other was the Argentine presidency. The program was described as \\"a factory of official announcements\\". In 2014, agricultural implement maker New Holland replaced Iveco. In 2011, repeats began to be shown on Gol TV, which was replaced in 2012 with the startup state-run channel DeporTV. Also in 2011, the first high definition broadcast was conducted, of a Supercl√°sico match between Boca Juniors and River Plate. Internationally, F√∫tbol para Todos matches were screened on TyC Sports Latin America, ESPN, Fox Sports and Claro Sports in Latin America; TyC Sports USA, ESPN Deportes, Fox Deportes and GolTV in the United States; TV Esporte Interativo, ESPN, Fox Sports and SporTV in Brazil; and Canal+ (in Spain). Criticism As an official program and initiative of the federal government, F√∫tbol para todos received support from cultural and sports figures in Argentina, but also criticism from opposition politicians. Senator Gerardo Morales noted that the presidential advertising on the program was \\"shameless\\", while members of the PRO party noted that \\"the purpose of its broadcast is not public but partisan.\\" Government supporters respond that the average spending on the program is far less than that on the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires, but with a greater national impact. In 2010, two environmental NGOs noted that 144 million pesos had been diverted from funds earmarked to implement a forestry law to F√∫tbol para Todos. Several criminal proceedings have been launched against government officials over mismanagement of funds earned from FPT. Former Cabinet Chiefs An√≠bal Fern√°ndez and Jorge Capitanich, along with one- time coordinator Gabriel Mariotto and a group of former directors of the AFA, are all being investigated. Closure and return to pay TV The election of Mauricio Macri as president in 2015 signified major changes for almost every aspect of Argentine government policy. It was decided to wind down F√∫tbol para Todos and to return the rights to pay broadcasters. In an interim step, in early 2016, commercial broadcast television stations began carrying matches alongside TVP (the Copa Argentina was also picked up by TyC Sports after the government returned the rights to the AFA), and at the same time, commercial advertising returned. On February 24, the government informed the AFA that it was to end the contract two years early. The final broadcasts of F√∫tbol para Todos, two matches on the same day, occurred on 27 June 2017. Beginning with the 2017-18 tournament, a consortium of Fox Sports and Turner will hold the exclusive rights to Primera Divisi√≥n tournaments. Fox Sports's three Argentina channels, as well as Turner channels to be named, will carry the matches. From 2009 through February 2017, the Argentina government had spent 10.178 billion pesos on the transmission of F√∫tbol para Todos.

He worked for the band of Paul Whiteman and was long associated with Glen Gray and the Casa Loma Orchestra. His compositions \\"Whistler's Mother-in-Law\\", \\"No Name Jive\\" and \\"Turn Back the Hands of Time\\" became nationally popular. Early life and career Larry Wagner was born in Ashland, Oregon, on September 15, 1907. He graduated from Ashland High School in 1926, and went on to attend the University of Oregon, majoring in journalism. He dropped out of college in 1930 to play trumpet in the West Coast territory band of Johnny Robinson at Jantzen Beach Amusement Park. He moved with the band to Seattle during their tenure at the Olympic Hotel. During this time he took a correspondence course in musical arrangement offered by Archie Bleyer. He moved to New York and existed in subsidence mode as a freelance arranger, including work for Cass Daley, George Hall, and the publishing company of Clarence Williams. While in New York he befriended Bleyer on a personal basis; Bleyer helped him land a job arranging for Paul Whiteman's vocalist Durelle Alexander. Success Wagner joined Whiteman's outfit permanently in 1936, but left as an employee in November of that year. When Whiteman needed a composition he could use for a theme-song in response to the ASCAP boycott, Murray McEachern brought Wagner's composition \\"Whistler's Mother-in-Law\\" to him as a possibility. The song greatly pleased Whiteman, who wanted to record it but did not have a recording contract at the time. Before Whiteman could record it, the song was published; a Bing Crosby and Muriel Lane duet took it to #9 on the charts and several other bands made recordings. This led to a permanent souring in Whitemans's and Wagner's relationship. Very late in 1937, Wagner led his own band under the moniker of \\"Larry Wagner and his Rhythmasters\\", which recorded and released three sides for Victor Records. Wagner was a member of Glen Gray's Casa Loma Orchestra, doing arranging and composing for the band between the years 1938 and 1942. \\"No Name Jive\\", which was a hit (#9) for Gray and his orchestra, was written by Wagner and in 1954, he recorded the song for A440 Records as the leader of a studio orchestra. Wagner served in the United States Marine Corps during World War II and was part of an entertainment unit serving in the Pacific Theater. An ASCAP member, he wrote \\"The Men of Iwo Jima\\" for the Corps. Post-war record label, A440 records, Larry Wagner OrchestraFollowing his military service, Wagner re-joined the Casa Loma Orchestra as arranger, and continued studies at the Schillinger School, which he credited with furthering his abilities as an arranger. The Casa Loma outfit disbanded around 1950, leaving Wagner to pursue other projects, such as writing musicals intended for high-school performance, fronting a studio band featuring Billy Butterfield for A440 Records, forming a touring band, and recording with his band in 1956 for Forest Records in a favorably-reviewed single. During this time Wagner had another hit song with his composition Turn Back the Hands of Time which Eddie Fisher took to #8 on the charts. He continued his association with Glen Grey into the 1960s and helped perpetuate the Casa Loma leader's name after his death. Family Wagner married Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Brown, his high-school sweetheart, in 1931; they had a daughter, Linda. At his death, he was survived by his daughter, two grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

Its rear monoshock unit is placed horizontally within the subframe to give a shorter wheelbase, to save weight and to lower the centre of gravity. The front forks are conventional telescopic items, whereas its 3-cylinder sibling, the MT-09, has inverted forks. The anti-lock braking system is available as an option on 2015‚Äì2017 models, but became standard equipment in 2018. Both the MT-07 and the MT-09 are base models from which a range of derivative bikes was intended to follow. Yamaha commissioned designer Shinya Kimura to create a caf√© racer special based on the MT-07. In June 2015, Kimura revealed the machine, which he called \\"Faster Son\\".

This format helps to harmonize the inertia forces inside the engine, resulting in a more responsive and \\"torquey\\" sensation for the rider, a feeling not unlike that of a V-twin.  Reception  The MT-07 received positive reviews from motorcycling journalists. In The Daily Telegraph, Roland Brown rated the bike at five out of five stars, praising the engine, handling, value for money and overall riding experience, while criticising the front brake, calling it \\"adequate but less powerful than is suggested by its superbike-style specification of twin discs and four-piston Monobloc calipers\\". Motorcycle News awarded five stars also, praising the light weight and engine response, although noting that \\"at high speed it will start to get breathless\\".http://www.motorcyclenews.com/mcn/bikereviews/searchresults/bike- reviews/yamaha/yamaha-mt-07-2014-current/ Motorcycle Consumer News declared the engine response \\"remarkable for its smoothness\\"; and their dynamometer tests showed rear wheel horsepower of @ 9,200 rpm, and torque at @ 6,600 rpm.

Sebasti√°n has worked in various techniques, particularly watercolor.Gallerie EspacioRevista Biograf√≠a Sebasti√°n has had two distinct periods: * A more classical stage, wherein he specialized in realistic watercolors that denote the contrast between transparency and opacity. The subject matter captures the majestic Mexican countryside: beautiful landscapes and quaint towns with their native inhabitants. * His current lyrical, spontaneous, evocative and deeply personal phase, in which the artist focuses on abstract depictions of moods, feelings and emotions, transgressing forms and colors, with veiled images filled with incognitos and conjecture. His most recent work is characterized by the use of mixed techniques and collage, experimenting with color, contrast, objects, pigments and textures that capture the audience's imagination.

The company was founded in 2013 and has offices in UK, Finland, Chile, Indonesia and Poland. The company's services are aimed at all lenders ‚Äì banks, payday lenders, peer- to-peer lending platforms, microfinance providers and leasing companies. Big data based credit scoring models =Based on Facebook information= On April 9, 2013, the company announced that they have built a credit scoring model based purely on information from Facebook. According to the company, the scoring model has a Gini coefficient of 0.340. In order to build the model, Facebook data about individuals was collected in various European countries with prior permission from the individuals. This data was then combined with the actual loan payment information for the same people and the scoring models were built using the same tools used in building traditional credit scoring models. =Based on publicly available sources= Big Data Scoring collects vast amounts of data from publicly available online sources and uses it to predict individuals‚Äô behavior by applying proprietary data processing and scoring algorithms. Based on client feedback, their solution delivers an improvement of up to 25% in scoring accuracy when combined with traditional in-house methods. This also robustly translates to an equivalent increase in the bottom line. In markets where traditional credit bureau data is lacking, the added benefit can be even greater to people with little or even no credit history, for example: * young people * unbanked and underbanked * recent immigrants This results in more people receiving access to credit with a better interest rate thanks to increase of scoring model accuracy. Predictive powers of big data in credit scoring =Facebook information= The company is not the first to show the predictive powers of Facebook data. Michal Kosinskia, David Stillwella, and Thore Graepelb from University of Cambridge have shown that \\"easily accessible digital records of behavior, Facebook Likes, can be used to automatically and accurately predict a range of highly sensitive personal attributes including: sexual orientation, ethnicity, religious and political views, personality traits, intelligence, happiness, use of addictive substances, parental separation, age, and gender.\\" =Public sources= Filene Research Institute published a paper showing clear patterns in transactional data, credit score and external factors like the recent price of S&P; 500. Press coverage and acknowledgements In October 2013, Big Data Scoring was selected as one finalist of the Websummit exhibition start-up ALPHA program. In March 2013, Big Data Scoring was selected as one finalists of the Code_n competition, which is part of the CeBIT exhibition in Hannover, Germany. During Finovate Fall 2015 conference the CEO of Big Data Scoring presented their solutions live on stage. The company has been featured in many on-line magazines, including MarketWatch, PCWorld and eWeek. Big Data Scoring is working together with MasterCard in their Start Path program. Criticism Estonian business daily √Ñrip√§ev raised the question whether data mining used for credit scoring is done legally. According to the company, their solution requires a permission from the users of Facebook to access their data and nothing is collected without the prior permission. Other sources such as MSN News have cited invasion of privacy as an additional concern regarding using social media information in credit scoring.

China Dream  Liu is most well known for his book China Dream, and also for the thoughts associated with it. The work does not predict inevitable conflict with the United States, but advocates China deterring the U.S.: \\"China's military rise is not to attack America, but to make sure that China is not attacked by America,\\" Liu says. China must thus pursue a \\"military rise with Chinese characteristics that is defensive, peaceful, limited, necessary, important and urgent.\\" William A. Callahan, a professor at the London School of Economics, says \\"rather than the win-win solutions suggested by both, The China Dream sees [international relations] as a zero-sum game where victory and defeat are total.\\" Liu's book and thinking on China's power is part of a large debate in the country, centered on the question of what a China-led world order would look like. Some high-profile military personnel in China, including Major General Luo Yuan, have raised questions about Liu Mingfu's analysis‚Äîpointing out, for example, the vast gulf between the current state of China's armed forces, and the state they would need to reach in Liu's vision of a China-led global order. Western observers have described the book as a challenge to the United States role as a dominant power. In an apparent effort to diffuse American concerns about China as a challenger, Liu told ABC News, \\"there is no need for the American public to be afraid of China,\\" adding that it's \\"impossible and unnecessary for China's military to surpass the United States.\\" Observers noted that the forward to the book was penned by Lieutenant General Liu Yazhou, son-in-law of former top Party official Li Xiannian. This \\"suggests that at least one politically connected senior officer is willing to associate himself with the author‚Äôs views,\\" and the book's advertising in China heavily played up this official imprimatur. Chinese exceptionalism Liu has advocated for China to \\"be ready to become the world's helmsman,\\" in part because \\"China possesses a superior cultural gene needed to become the world's leader.\\" References Chinese military writers Living people People's Liberation Army officers People's Republic of China essayists Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Liu Mingfu"},{"id":"42499552","text":"Al-Sabboura () is a Syrian village in the Qatana District of the Rif Dimashq Governorate.

He is affiliated with the National Regeneration Movement and is the current Governor of Chiapas. Before becoming governor, he represented Chiapas as a senator of the LVIII and LIX and as a federal deputy in the LX Legislature. Life Escand√≥n grew up in Baja California, where he obtained a law degree at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Baja California in 1981 and was deputy director, and then director, of the state public property registry from 1981 to 1986. He became a law professor at the UNAM and the Universidad La Salle in 1989, obtaining a master's degree in law from the UNAM in 1990 and a doctorate the next year. After several years at the Instituto Nacional de Migraci√≥n in Guerrero and Chiapas, he became the director general of the Chiapas Electoral Commission in 1994 and returned to teaching at the Institute of Higher Studies in Tuxtla Guti√©rrez. In 1998, Escand√≥n joined the PRD. After losing a bid to be elected to the Chiapas state legislature that year, Escand√≥n became the state PRD's secretary general. In 2000, he was elected senator, serving as a secretary on the Governance and Justice Commissions in the LVIII Legislature and as the president of the Social Development Commission in the LIX Legislature. He also was a national councilor for the party. Termed out of the Senate, he was placed on the PRD proportional representation list from the third region and served as a federal deputy in the LX Legislature, where he presided over the Special Commission for the National Farm Agreement. After his tenure in Congress, in 2013, Governor Manuel Velasco Coello nominated him to preside over the state's courts with the support of the PVEM, Velasco's party, which controlled the state legislature. Escand√≥n is known to be close with Velasco Coello's grandfather.
