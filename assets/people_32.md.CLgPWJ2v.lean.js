Described by Allmusic as \\"Presley-esque\\" and by Richard himself as \\"my one outstanding rock 'n' roll classic\\", \\"Move It\\" was written on the top deck of a Green Line bus by the Drifters guitarist Ian \\"Sammy\\" Samwell while making the trip to Cliff's house for a band rehearsal. Samwell did not complete the second verse, so on the record Cliff sang the first verse twice. Samwell finally finished the second verse in 1995 and sent it to Hank Marvin who included \\"Move It\\" on his album Hank plays Cliff, with Cliff Richard having recorded a new vocal track which included the new verse. The new version was debuted live at a Royal Variety Performance in front of Queen Elizabeth II that year. Since then, Richard has continued to perform the song with the additional verse.

Rising to an elevation of above sea level, House Mountain is the highest point in Knox County. The House Mountain State Natural Area-- designated in 1987-- consists of , mostly on the south side of the mountain. House Mountain is known for its huge sandstone boulders, its wide variety of bird and plant life, and for the views from its two peaks. On a clear day, the Great Smoky Mountains and the upper Unaka Range are visible to the south and east, the Cumberland Plateau is visible to the west, and Powell Mountain and Clinch Mountain are visible to the north and northeast. The origin of the mountain's name is unknown, though a local legend suggests early settlers thought the mountain was shaped like the roof of a house.Jim Matheny, \\"Why do they Call it that?

Geographical and natural setting House Mountain rises from a large plain in eastern Knox County, about southwest of the southern terminus of Clinch Mountain and immediately north of McAnnally Ridge. House, McAnnally, and Clinch are all part of the Appalachian Ridge-and-Valley Province, which consists of a series of narrow, elongate ridges stretching in a northeast-to-southwest direction between the main Appalachian crest to the east and the Cumberland Plateau to the west. These ridges are typically flanked by fertile river valleys that are part of the upper Tennessee River watershed. House Mountain stretches for just over from its southwestern base along Hogskin Branch to its northeastern base along Flat Creek, and covers approximately . The mountain's crest is crowned by two main peaks-- one rising southwest of the center of the mountain and one rising on the mountain's northeastern end. The southwest peak is the true summit, although both peaks rise above 2000 feet. Geologically, House Mountain is a \\"synclinal outlier\\" of Clinch Mountain. Erosion by Flat Creek-- which lies halfway between House and Clinch-- separated the two mountains in ancient times. Like all of the Ridge- and-Valleys, House Mountain was created approximately 250 million years ago during the Alleghenian orogeny mountain-building epoch.Information obtained from interpretive kiosk at House Mountain State Natural Area, 14 June 2008. House Mountain's base is covered with a mesophytic forest consisting chiefly of maple, tulip poplar, ash, and buckeye. Chestnut oak and table mountain pine dominate the mountain's steeper slopes and upper elevations.\\"TDEC: DNH: House Mountain State Natural Area.\\" Retrieved: 17 June 2008. Broadcasting history Located about a half mile east of House Mountain on much lower Zachary Ridge (behind House Mountain in the picture) is a broadcasting tower, formerly owned and used by WBIR-TV, Channel 10, Knoxville. The tall tower was actually built in 1963 because the former owners of WBIR-- seeking to expand their broadcast coverage in the early 1960s-- were unable to purchase private property atop House Mountain to build a new, much shorter tower for their antenna. In a 1983 interview with PM Magazine, John Reece, former WATE-TV program director and former shareholder in the station's ownership, told the intriguing story of how House Mountain contributed a small part to Knoxville's broadcasting history. According to Reece, WBIR-- WATE's VHF rival in Knoxville-- had long wanted to move from its original tower on Sharp's Ridge in downtown Knoxville (which is still standing), to a much higher site atop House Mountain. If a new WBIR tower had been built atop House Mountain away as the station's owners had planned, the tower would have only needed to be about 600 to to reach the allowable height above average terrain (HAAT) the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had already approved for the station. According to Reece, so sure was WBIR of moving to House Mountain, the station had concrete piers staked off in 1962, and had already drilled through some of the rocky escarpment on the mountain's apex. Some of those are visible rock outcroppings today.John Reece, interview. PM Magazine. WATE-TV, Knoxville, Tennessee. 30 September 1983. Reece said his former co-investors, Mountcastle Broadcasting, the then-owners of WATE, who had been anticipating a WBIR House Mountain tower and its wide broadcasting coverage area, quickly purchased that property, which happened to be the only property for sale on the mountaintop that could be used as a tower base. The WATE owners then convinced the adjoining property owners not to sell their property atop House Mountain, citing aesthetic reasons. Thus, WBIR was forced to spend millions of dollars in 1963 to build a taller tower for its broadcasting antenna in the surrounding valley below. The resulting tower, now owned by South Central Communications and used by its local station, WIMZ-FM 103.5, was and still is the tallest man-made structure in the state of Tennessee. After WBIR was forced to build the tall tower, WATE then sold its newly acquired House Mountain property to a private owner. Eventually, WBIR-TV moved to a shorter tower (1,504 ft) back on Sharp's Ridge in downtown Knoxville, built right next to its original tower. Ironically, WATE-TV now operates an adjacent tower on Sharp's Ridge, which is higher than WBIR-TV's.

An anthology magazine with no major main character, its style of humor focused mostly on satiric and toilet humour, including sexual, toilet, and farting jokes. Most of Pyton's material was produced by the magazine's own staff, but a handful of foreign comics also appeared in the magazine, including Gary Larson's The Far Side, and the German comic Werner. The name is Norwegian for python, a term which in Scandinavia also have gained a slang adjective meaning of \\"disgusting\\" or \\"sick\\". The magazine also adopted a python snake as mascot (after discarding their original polar bear), who occasionally featured in his own comics. The comic reached its peak around 1990 when it sold around 35,000 copies per month. The Essential Guide to World Comics by Tim Pilcher and Brad Brooks says that the anthology and its sister series MegaPyton had \\"short- lived but important MAD-style humour anthologies with an underground comix edge.\\"Pilcher, Tim and Brad Brooks. (Foreword: Dave Gibbons). The Essential Guide to World Comics. Collins and Brown. 2005. 260. The magazine's editor was Dag Kolstad, who prior had been the editor for Norsk MAD, the Norwegian edition of MAD Magazine. Kolstad was also a writer for many of the series (under the pen name Dick Kolby), and was also featured in the actual series as the sadistic and overweight character Redakt√∏ren (The Editor). Another prominent writer was Rolf H√•ndstad (pen name: Rhesus Minus, Balle Brock). Some of Pyton's most prominent artists were Tommy Syds√¶ter, Bj√∏rn Ousland, Arild Midthun (pen name: Arnold Milten), Kristian B. Walters and Frode √òverli who a few years later created the successful and popular comic strip Pondus. Martin Kellerman, who later went on to create Rocky, also made a few contributions to Pyton in the mid-1990s. In 2009, the old magazine had gained a large nostalgic appeal, and it was decided to launch the massive collector box MegaPyton (not to be confused with the Swedish magazine Mega-Pyton, see below), featuring classics from the magazine collected in hardcover books.  Recurring features  The monthly publication had no constant features, nevertheless several new features were created almost monthly. Some of the most popular features were: * D√∏lle D√∏ck, created by Dick Kolby and Tommy Syds√¶ter * Rhesus Minus og Tommy Tusj, created by Rolf H√•ndstad and Tommy Syds√¶ter * Pervo-Kris, created by Kristian B.Walters * Hellitern og Halvlitern, created by Bj√∏rn Ousland * Lucky Duck, created by Bj√∏rn Ousland * Bottolf Nerd, created by Arnold Milten * Deep Shit Junkies, created by Frode √òverli * Wunder-Bjarne, created by Tom Ostad * F√∏rerhunden Adolf, created by Erik Nordg√•rd * Skateboard-Fantomet, created by Erik Nordg√•rd Foreign editions In 1990, a foreign edition was launched in Sweden, also named Pyton. Apart from publishing older Norwegian material, this spinoff edition also showcased Swedish artists such as Joakim Lindengren, Mikael Grahn and Alf Woxnerud etc. This soon led to much international collaboration between the two editions with many cartoonists, both Norwegian and Swedish, producing work published in both editions. The Swedish edition folded in 1998. In 1992, the Swedish spinoff Mega-Pyton appeared, in the beginning it was mostly a thicker version of the original magazine, but after a while it evolved into a more alternative/underground-oriented magazine featuring artists such as Ivan Brunetti, Mike Diana and Sam Henderson, as well as local Swedish artists including David Liljemark. This edition folded in 2001. In 1994, after the success of the Swedish launch, there was an attempt to release a Danish edition under the same name. For some reason, this edition wasn't as successful as the other Scandinavian editions, and the magazine was cancelled after only seven issues in 1995. The longest lasting of these editions was in Finland, where the magazine was launched in 1989, titled Myrkky (Finnish for \\"poison\\" or \\"venom\\"), published by the Finnish branch of the Nordic publisher Egmont. Originally, the magazine featured mostly translated Swedish and Norwegian material, but after these editions folded, the magazine published more and more native material, as well as material imported from other sources. The most popular character in Myrkky was Pera Pervo (Pervo-Kris). This edition didn't fold until 5 November 2008, with a final summer special appearing in 2009. Regular strips in Myrkky included Myyntimies Mynttinen, Pera Pervo and Firkin the Cat. Perhaps the most famous cartoonist whose work appeared in Myrkky is the British Hunt Emerson. However, most of the strips - particularly after the other editions had folded - were drawn by Finnish cartoonists. Regular Finnish cartoonists included Santtu Liima, Armas Salakka and Samson.

It is loosely based on the 1990 Malayalam movie Thoovalsparsham https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/marathi/movies/photofeatures/laxmikant- berde-superhit-comedy-films-of-the-actor-you-should-not- miss/zapatlela/photostory/63415234.cms Thoovalsparsham was remade in Telugu in 1990 as Chinnari Muddula Papa and in Tamil twice - as Thayamma in 1991 and as Asathal in 2001. It is the first full-length feature film directed by Sajid Khan. It released on 24 August 2007 to a good response. Plot Arush Mehra (Akshay Kumar) lives a fairly wealthy lifestyle in Sydney, Australia with roommates Tanmay Joglekar (Ritesh Deshmukh) and Ali Haider (Fardeen Khan). Arush works for a popular dance club, while Tanmay entertains children as 'Eddy Teddy', and Ali takes care of their apartment. He mostly watches cricket on the television and places bets on it. All three are womanizers and usually end up sleeping with different women. One day, they find a baby girl (Juanna Sanghvi) outside their door with a note instructing them to take care of her, since one of them is her father. The three men go to all the women they dated and slept with, but none claim the baby as theirs. The men try to take care of the baby, but she becomes a huge pain. So, they drop her off at a house near a church. Then, they set off for a Christmas party. They are all thinking of the girl. A big rainstorm occurs, and the baby develops pneumonia after being left in the rain. The three men rush the baby to the hospital, realizing how much they love her, and regret their decisions. She recovers, and the three become changed men. They love her, pamper her, and grow an attachment towards her and even apologize to all women they used. They name her Angel due to the miracle that she survived. One morning, a woman named Isha (Vidya Balan) comes to take Angel back, claiming the baby to be her daughter. The guys are shocked as Arush tells them about his past. One year ago, Arush travelled to Delhi to attend his cousin Arjun's wedding. There, he met Isha Sahni, who also resides in Australia. He put up a facade of being a guy with traditional Indian values, won her over and they spent the night together. Shortly after, Isha caught him in a compromising situation with Devika Sharma (Sindhura Gadde), Isha's friend, so the couple split up. It was not Arush's fault as Devika forced herself on top of him. Arush returned to Sydney and forgot about the incident. The guys find it very difficult to live without Angel. Arush ends up challenging Isha to marry someone faithful within seven days who will accept Angel as a daughter. If she's unsuccessful, she will have to give Angel back to him. They sign a contract to finalise the deal. The men worry that they might lose the bet since Isha is beautiful and wealthy. Arush plans with Tanmay, Ali, and Bharat, who is Isha's father in order to keep Angel with him. His first attempt involves Ali posing as a botany professor named Parimal Tripathi who speaks very pure Hindi. Bharat is impressed by Parimal by this and Angel recognises him as well. They manage to get through a few days of the week until one day Isha asks him about marriage for the next day. After Isha says this, Ali talks to Arush and Tanmay who tell him to go to Disneyland where Ali gets Bharat attacked. He is stopped from further efforts by Tanmay in the 'Eddy Teddy' costume. Bharat decides that Tanmay is the right man for Isha. Tanmay, Arush, and Ali make plans to stop Isha from marrying someone else and tell the truth to Angel about their plans to convince her mother. As the contract is about to terminate, Isha somehow manages to find out the truth that she has been cheated by her father, Tanmay, Ali and most of all Arush. Isha goes with Angel to her private jet to go somewhere very far because she has lost the deal. As she is about to leave she is stopped by some cops because Ali and Tanmay called them. As they are arguing, Arush turns up showing Isha the contract and tearing it up indicating that Isha now has every right over Angel. But before the three men leave heartbroken, Arush says that a child needs a mother the most but it also needs a father. Just as they are leaving, Angel takes matters in her own hands and says her first word \\"Dada\\", but nevertheless Isha takes her away in the aeroplane. The three men are depressed as they assume that they may never see Angel again until they are surprised to see her on their doorstep. Isha finally realises that Angel needs her father too and the film ends with their marriage taking place, and Angel's photoshoot.

(DVSI).  Overview  In 1967 Osamu Fujimura (MIT) showed basic advantages of the multi-band representation of speech (\\"An Approximation to Voice Aperiodicity\\", IEEE 1968). This work gave a start to development of the \\"multi-band excitation\\" method of speech coding, that was patented in 1997 (now expired) by founders of DVSI as \\"Multi-Band Excitation\\" (MBE). All consequent improvements known as Improved Multi-Band Excitation (IMBE), Advanced Multiband Excitation (AMBE), AMBE+ and AMBE+2 are based on this MBE method. AMBE is a codebook-based vocoder that operates at bitrates of between 2 and 9.6 kbit/s, and at a sampling rate of 8 kHz in 20-ms frames. The audio data is usually combined with up to 7 bit/s of forward error correction data, producing a total RF bandwidth of approximately 2,250 Hz (compared to 2,700‚Äì3,000 Hz for an analogue single sideband transmission). Lost frames can be masked by using the parameters of the previous frame to fill in the gap.  Usage  AMBE is used by the Inmarsat and Iridium satellite telephony systems and certain channels on XM Satellite Radio and is the speech coder for OpenSky Trunked radio systems. AMBE is used in D-STAR amateur radio digital voice communications. It has met criticism from the amateur radio community because the nature of its patent and licensing runs counter to the openness of amateur radio, as well as usage restriction for being \\"undisclosed digital code\\" under FCC rule 97.309(b) and similar national legislation. The NXDN digital voice and data protocol uses the AMBE+2 codec. NXDN is implemented by Icom in the IDAS system and by Kenwood as NEXEDGE. APCO Project 25 Phase 2 trunked radio systems also use the AMBE+2 codec, while Phase 1 radios use the earlier IMBE codec. Digital Mobile Radio (DMR) and Motorola's MOTOTRBO use the AMBE+2 codec.  Licensing  Use of the AMBE standard requires a license from Digital Voice Systems, Inc. While a licensing fee is due for most codecs, DVSI does not disclose software licensing terms. Anecdotal evidence suggests that licensing fee begin from between $100,000 to $1 million. For purposes of comparison, licensing fees for use of the MP3 standard started at $15,000. For small-scale use and prototyping, the only option is to purchase a dedicated hardware IC from DVSI. These ICs can be purchased for less than $100 in small quantities. DSP Innovations Inc. offers a software implementation of APCO P25 Phase 1 (Full-Rate) and Phase 2 (Half- Rate) codecs as well as DMR and dPMR codecs. A technology licence from DVSI is required. The patent for IMBE has expired.  Alternatives  Codec2 is an open source alternative which uses half of the bandwidth of AMBE to encode speech of similar quality, created by David Rowe and lobbied by Bruce Perens. Codec2 still continues to evolve, with additional \\"modes\\" being developed, refined and made available on a continuous basis. This has resulted in an open source codec that has progressively increased its robustness and performance ‚Äì when subjected to some of the most challenging RF and acoustic environments.

The sportsboat is notable for its ability to plane over the water downwind in modest winds, and for its combination of a simple design that is highly tunable. The Melges 32 is produced by Melges Performance Sailboats, a United States company founded by Harry Melges. It was designed by the Reichel/Pugh design team and went into production in 2005. The boat is long and wide at the beam. It carries around of sail area, main, jib and asymmetrical spinnaker combined. Upwind, it has a mainsail and 105% jib. Downwind, it has a large Asymmetrical spinnaker that flies from a retractable bowsprit. The boat's hull is made from lightweight fiberglass. The mast, rudder, bowsprit, and keel fin are made from carbon fiber for light weight. The hull is generally flat on the bottom, making it plane easily. The keel fin and keel bulb can retract up to the hull bottom to make it easier to put on a trailer. The boat is generally raced with a crew of five or more. Because the boat sails faster with a heavier crew, class rules for racing limit crew weight to 629 kg total. Strict one design class rules govern the Melges 32 amateur owner/driver requirements, professional crew limitations and crew weight maximum to limit the number of crew. On 21 November 2008 the ISAF (international sailing federation) recognised the Melges 32 as an international class, having fleets in Europe, North America and Australia.

He was imprisoned, with other Franciscans, for refusing to take the oath of the royal supremacy, and declaring the king to be a heretic. He was considered an accomplished preacher, and wrote a sermon on the text, 'Behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses' (Matt. xi. 8), in which he lashed the vices of the court and the avarice and inconstancy of the clergy. At the intercession of Thomas Wriothesley some of the friars were released. Belchiam was kept in Newgate, where he died of starvation on 3 August 1537. Belchiam survived the last of his two fellow-prisoners upwards of a month, he likely being the youngest. As he lay dying, \\"...it so fell out that the frame of the earth gave a surprising shock, that the jail keepers were affrighted, and it was thought to be a universal earthquake...It is said that the king gave orders for the burial of Belchiam, his majesty being startled at the uncommon accidents that happened at his departure out of this life.\\"Modern British Martyrology, Keating, Brown, 1836, p. 87 A copy of his sermon, found in the prison after his death, was brought to Henry VIII, who was affected by it, but had it burnt. Another copy was preserved by the friars, and Thomas Bourchier, writing in 1583, expressed a hope that it might be published; which apparently was never done.

It is grown as an ornamental because of its nocturnal flowers and unusual, leaf-like stems. Common names include fishbone cactus, rick rack cactus, zig-zag cactus and St. Anthony's rik-rak, and is sometimes referred to as an orchid cactus. History This species is named after Harold E. Anthony who first flowered this species in June 1950. The former generic name Cryptocereus (literally, \\"hidden cereus\\") recalls the fact that the species remained long unknown in a region that had been thoroughly investigated by Thomas MacDougall, who found this species in 1946. He thought he had found a close relative to Epiphyllum anguliger. When it flowered in the greenhouses of Dr. Harold E. Anthony in Jersey in 1950 it was obvious that this was a great novelty. The species is rarely collected and most plants in cultivation descend from this first collection. Description The stems of the plant are ascending or climbing.

Systematics This is an isolated species with no close allies. Selenicereus chrysocardium seems to be the closest relative. Two other epiphytic cacti from other genera show similar strongly notched flat stems and which, when not in flower, are not readily distinguishable from this species: these are Epiphyllum anguliger and Weberocereus imitans. Cultivation An easily cultivated, fast growing epiphyte, S. anthonyanus needs a compost containing plenty of humus and sufficient moisture in summer. Should not be kept under in winter. Can be grown in semi-shade or full sun. Extra light in the early spring will stimulate budding. Flowers only open for one night and are very fragrant, as to attract nocturnal pollinators. Flowers in late spring or early summer.

Biography Domenico Giani was born on 16 August 1962 in Arezzo, Italy. He graduated with honors in pedagogy from the Faculty of Education of the University of Siena, he served as a non-commissioned officer and as an officer of the Guardia di Finanza. Then he worked in the Intelligence and Democratic Security Service, part of the Italian Intelligence Service. In 1999, Domenico Giani became the deputy to Camillo Cibin, longtime chief of the Vatican's police force, then known as the Security Corps of Vatican City State. He became its head on 3 June 2006, when it was known as the Corpo della Gendarmeria. He headed a unit of 130 military-trained policemen. Giani tackled Susanna Maiolo twice in two separate attacks on Pope Benedict during Christmas Eve Midnight Mass at St. Peter's Basilica in 2008 and 2009. Under his command, the Vatican City State became part of Interpol at the general assembly held in St. Petersburg on 7 October 2008. The Vatican was represented by Giani and Monsignor Renato Boccardo, Secretary General of the Governorate of the Vatican City State. Giani was involved in 2013 in the interceptions concerning Monsignor Nunzio Scarano. In early October 2019, at the request of the IOR, Pope Francis authorised the Gendarmerie to raid the offices of the Sostituto within the State Department as part of an investigation into financial irregularities related to a failed London real estate deal. Giani then authored an internal flyer that named and pictured five Vatican employees who were suspended as part of that investigation. That flyer was leaked to the Italian weekly magazine L'Espresso which published it. Though not associated with the leak, Giani resigned on 14 October to allow an impartial investigation to proceed. News coverage of his resignation resulted in additional dissemination of the names of those suspended. On 15 October, Pope Francis appointed Gianluca Gauzzi Broccoletti, who had served as Giani's deputy since 2018, to succeed him. The Pope also visited Giani, his wife, and one of their two children at their Vatican City home on the evening of 15 October to reiterate his appreciation for Giani's service. Cardinal Angelo Becciu criticized Giani for creating the leaked document; he said a leaflet identifying the accused with mug shots in the style of a wanted poster was excessive.

The mission was one of the first geodesic (or geodetic) missions carried out under modern scientific principles, and the first major international scientific expedition.  Background  In the 18th century, there was significant debate in the scientific community, specifically in the French Academy of Sciences (Acad√©mie des sciences), as to whether the circumference of the Earth was greater around the Equator or around the poles. French astronomer Jacques Cassini held to the view that the polar circumference was greater. Louis XV, the King of France and the Academy sent two expeditions to determine the answer: one was sent to Me√§nmaa in Lapland, close to the Arctic Circle, under Swedish physicist Anders Celsius and French mathematician Pierre Maupertuis. The other mission was sent to Ecuador, at the Equator. Previous accurate measurements had been taken in Paris by Cassini and others.  Expedition  Ecuador The equatorial mission was led by French astronomers Charles Marie de La Condamine, Pierre Bouguer, Louis Godin and Spanish geographers Jorge Juan and Antonio de Ulloa. They were accompanied by several assistants, including the naturalist Joseph de Jussieu and Louis's cousin Jean Godin. La Condamine was joined in his journey down the Amazon by Ecuadoran geographer and topographer Pedro Maldonado. (Maldonado later traveled to Europe to continue his scientific work.) The Ecuadoran expedition left France in May 1735. They landed on the Caribbean coast in Colombia, sailed to Panama where they traveled overland to the Pacific, and continued by sail to Ecuador, then called the Territory of Quito by Spain. In Ecuador, they split into two groups, traveling overland through rain forests, arriving in Quito in June 1736. Pierre Bouguer established the length of a pendulum beating seconds on the Equator at Quito, near Quito at the top of Pinchincha, and at sea level to determine gravity of Earth. La Condamine had a marble plaque prepared, with a bronze exemplar (varilla metalica) of the length of such a pendulum set into it, which he presented to the Jesuit College of San Francisco in Quito in 1742, engraved with an inscription reading: Penduli simplicis aequinoctialis, unius minuti secundi temporis medii, in altitudine Soli Quitensis, archetypus (mensurae naturalis exemplar, utinam et universalis) [\\"Archetype of the equinoctial simple pendulum, of one second of a minute of mean time at the latitude of Quito (a natural and, may it be, a universal model of measure)\\"]. The plaque is now in the Observatorio Astron√≥mico in the Parque La Alameda.Charles-Marie de La Condamine, Journal du Voyage fait par Ordre du Roi √† l‚Äô√âquateur, Paris, Imprimerie Royale, 1751, pp.162-163 ; and idem, ‚ÄúNouveau Projet d‚Äôune Mesure invariable propre √† servir de mesure commun √† toutes les Nations‚Äù, M√©moires de l‚ÄôAcademie Royale des Sciences, 1747, pp.489-514. Bouguer, La Condamine, Godin and their colleagues measured arcs of the Earth's curvature on the Equator from the plains near Quito to the southern city of Cuenca. These measurements enabled the first accurate determination of the shape of the Earth, eventually leading to the establishment of the international metric system of measurement. When an International Commission for Weights and Measures was convened in Paris to settle the true length of the metre, it adopted on 22 June 1799 a standard metre based on the length of the half meridian connecting the North pole with the Equator. The French Academy of Sciences had commissioned an expedition led by Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre and Pierre M√©chain, lasting from 1792 to 1799, which attempted to accurately measure the distance between a belfry in Dunkerque and Montju√Øc castle in Barcelona at the longitude of Paris Panth√©on. This portion of the Paris meridian was to serve as the basis for the length of the half meridian connecting the North Pole with the Equator. The metre was defined as the ten-millionth of the half meridian's length extrapolated from an Earth's flattening of 1/334 obtained from the results of the survey by Delambre and M√©chain combined with those of the Peru meridian arc as established by La Condamine and his colleagues. They completed their survey measurements by 1739, measuring the length of a meridian arc of three degrees at the Equator. They did this in spite of earlier news that the expedition to Lapland led by Maupertuis had already finished their work and had proven that the Earth is oblate; i.e., flattened at the poles. However, problems with astronomical observations kept them in Ecuador several more years. Bouguer returned first from the expedition, going overland to the Caribbean and then to France. La Condamine, along with Maldonado, returned by way of the Amazon River. Godin took a position as professor in Lima, where he helped rebuild the city after the devastating 1746 earthquake, and returned to Europe in 1751. Bouguer, La Condamine and the Spanish officers each wrote separate accounts of the expedition, which opened up European eyes to the exotic landscapes, flora and fauna of South America and led directly to the great naturalist expeditions by Alexander von Humboldt and others. La Condamine tried in vain to promote the length of the seconds pendulum measured at the Equator as a universal measure. He was more successful with his proposal to adopt the geodetic standard used in Peru as the official standard of the toise of Paris. The toise of Peru became the royal standard of the toise in 1766 under the name Toise de l'Acad√©mie. Inscription on the marble plaque at Quito; Charles- Marie de La Condamine, Journal du Voyage fait par Ordre du Roi √† l‚Äô√âquateur, Paris, Imprimerie Royale, 1751  Observations during the mission  * Ulloa and Juan visited the architectural Inca complex in San Agustin de Callo and subsequently wrote a descriptive document of what they observed at the ruins. Ulloa made a drawing of the ruins. * The scientists witnessed two eruptions of the Cotopaxi volcano in 1743 and 1744. * Expedition members, through talking to local inhabitants, became the first Europeans to discover and scientifically document rubber tapping (and thus rubber), and identify the correct type of cinchona tree that produces the active form of quinine (an important anti-malarial agent). * Charles Marie de La Condamine developed the concept of the metre as a universal unit of measure based on the dimensions of the Earth (rather than local standards that differed and hindered trade).  Subsequent mission  In the late 19th century, the Academy of Sciences sent another mission to Ecuador at the behest of the International Association of Geodesy to confirm the results of the First Geodesic Mission and commemorate the relationship between the two republics. This second mission was led by Captain E. Maurain and several other military personnel during its tenure in Ecuador from 1901‚Äì1906. The only two members of the French mission to spend the entire time in Ecuador were Lieutenant (later General) Georges Perrier and medical officer Paul Rivet, later an important anthropologist and founder of the Mus√©e de l'Homme in Paris.  Monument  A reproduction of the pyramids that marked the baseline for measurement at Yaruqui (which was destroyed by Quito authorities in the 1740s) was erected in 1836, the centennial of the expedition, by the Rocafuerte administration of the nascent republic of Ecuador. This monument fell into disrepair over the next century but was rebuilt in 1936, minus its original French inscription, for the bicentennial of the first geodesic expedition, along with a second pyramid at San Antonio de Pichincha on the Equator. These monuments still exist today. The new Quito International Airport opened in the Yaruqui Valley. Though talks of having a mural celebrating the Geodesic Mission took place during planning stages, no acknowledgement of the scientific importance of this site currently exists. In 1936, the French American Committee of Ecuador sponsored the idea of the Ecuadoran geographer Dr. Luis Tufi√±o and raised a monument commemorating the bicentennial of the arrival of the First Geodesic Mission. They raised a 10-meter-high monument at Ciudad Mitad del Mundo in San Antonio de Pichincha, in Pichincha Province of Ecuador. However, there is no record that the Mission ever visited the area. There is a project to build a new pyramid exactly on the Equator, to be designed by famed architect Rafael Vi√±oly.

Retrieved on July 11, 2014. On the most basic level, the book tells the story of the family's second youngest and favored daughter, Lia Lee, who was diagnosed with a severe form of epilepsy named Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and the culture conflict that obstructs her treatment. Through miscommunications about medical dosages and parental refusal to give certain medicines due to mistrust, misunderstandings, and behavioral side effects, and the inability of the doctors to develop more empathy with the traditional Hmong lifestyle or try to learn more about the Hmong culture, Lia's condition worsens. The dichotomy between the Hmong's perceived spiritual factors and the Americans' perceived scientific factors comprises the overall theme of the book. The book is written in a distinctive style, with every other chapter returning to Lia's story and the chapters in-between discussing broader themes of Hmong culture, customs, and history; American involvement in and responsibility for the war in Laos; and the many problems of immigration, especially assimilation and discrimination. While particularly sympathetic to the Hmong, Fadiman presents the situation from the perspectives of both the doctors and the family. An example of medical anthropology, the book has been cited by medical journals and lecturers as an argument for greater cultural competence, and often assigned to medical, pharmaceutic, and anthropological students in the US. In 1997, it won the National Book Critics Circle Award for General Nonfiction.National Book Critics Circle - past awards Major characters Lia Lee (Romanized Popular Alphabet: Liab Lis,Fadiman, Anne. \\"Note on Hmong Orthography, Pronunciation, and Quotations.\\" The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down.

She had seizures due to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy. Anne Fadiman: She is an author and narrator of ‚ÄòThe Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down‚Äô. She wrote about her experience with Lia and her family. Through this experience, she learned the importance of understanding about diversity of culture between doctor, patient, and family. Neil Ernst and Peggy Philp: They are Lia‚Äôs doctors at MCMC. There is conflict between them and Lia's parents because of Hmong shamanism culture versus western medicine. This leads to great misunderstandings between each other. Foua Yang and Nao Kao Lee: They are Lia‚Äôs parents, and they love Lia very much. They only believe in their traditional approach to medical treatment, with a strong influence from shamanism. Jeanine Hilt: A social worker who makes Lia her personal cause.

Summary Mercy Medical Center Merced, previously the Merced Community Medical Center; this is a new building and not the previous building where Lia Lee was taken Lia experienced her first seizure at three months of age, but a resident at Merced Community Medical Center misdiagnosed her condition, and the hospital was unable to communicate with her parents since the hospital had no Hmong interpreters. Anne Fadiman wrote that Lia's parents did not give her medication as it was prescribed because they believed that Lia Lee's state showed a sense of spiritual giftedness, and they did not want to take that away. The American doctors did not understand the Hmong traditional remedies that the Lee family used. The doctors treating Lia Lee, Neil and Peggy Ernst, had her removed from her home when she was almost three years of age, and placed into foster care for one year, causing friction with her parents. By age 4¬Ω Lia Lee had been admitted to hospital care 17 times and had made over 100 outpatient visits.Fox, Margalit. \\"Lia Lee Dies; Life Went On Around Her, Redefining Care.\\" The New York Times.

He talked to Lia's parents about transferring her to Fresno, California because Lia would need further treatment that Dr. Ernst could not provide. Lia's parents \\". . . believed their daughter was transferred not because of her critical condition but because of the Ernst's vacation plans\\". Lia Lee slipped into a coma after suffering from a tonic clonic seizure in 1986, when she was four years of age. Lia Lee's doctors believed she would die, but Lia Lee remained alive but with no higher brain functions. Research Fadiman's sources for information about the history of the Hmong include Hmong: History of a People by Keith Quincy. She stated \\"Were I citing the source of each detail, Quincy's name would attach itself to nearly every sentence in the pages on the Hmong in China.\\" Fadiman's book cited the Quincy theory that the Hmong people originated from Siberia.Pfeifer, Mark E.

Entenmann wrote that because of the reliance on Quincy's book, Fadiman's book propagates the idea that Sonom was a Hmong king, a concept that Entenmann says is inaccurate.

The film was produced by Arch Hall Sr. The film was targeted towards the drive-in market, and is generally regarded as a B-movie, but has become infamous as part of a series of films made by Arch Hall Sr., which starred his son, Arch Hall Jr. Plot Bud Eagle (Arch Hall Jr.), a young singer-songwriter, arrives in Hollywood on a motorcycle. At Marge's Koffee Kup Cafe, he meets Vickie (Nancy Czar), an aspiring dancer, who quizzes him about his \\"gimmick\\" and promises to give him the \\"inside dope\\" on the music industry. He attends her performance at a television variety show later that night. When the scheduled saxophonist is unable to perform, Bud steps in with a ballad that earns him a standing ovation. Bud's performance also earns the notice of talent scout Mike McCauley (Arch Hall Sr.), who offers him a record deal. Bud accepts the McCauley's proposal. McCauley immediately installs Bud in a penthouse apartment, providing him with tailored suits, a Fender Jazzmaster, a mini tape recorder, and a new backing band ready to record his songs. Bud's music career takes off in spite of his mounting doubts about the unscrupulous McCauley, who pays high school students to promote his music at their schools. Bud attempts to leave McCauley more than once, but relents when McCauley reminds him of the money he's owed. Bud performs \\"Vickie\\" (also heard in the less contextually- appropriate Eegah) live on television, and Vickie sees the broadcast. She runs to the television studio where they joyfully reunite. They spend the night ice skating in Vickie's uncle's rink; Nancy Czar being a former figure skatersixtiescinema.com When Bud returns to his penthouse apartment, he is confronted by Don Proctor, McCauley's previous client. He warns Bud that McCauley is cheating him, and manipulating him. McCauley's henchman, Steak (Ray Dennis Steckler), arrives with a girl, Daisy, who begins to dance seductively, distracting Bud while Steak and Proctor go outside to fight. Steak throws Proctor down a staircase. As Daisy kisses Bud, Vickie walks in, and runs out again in tears. Bud chases after her but is kidnapped by a trio of comical bums from Marge's Koffee Kup Cafe. Eager to take advantage of McCauley, Bud helps the kidnappers to plan the crime, encouraging them to ask for more ransom money. They try to share the money with him, but he refuses. Steak breaks into the kidnappers' hideout, the group scatters, and Bud goes into hiding. He takes a job as a dishwasher at Marge's Koffee Kup Cafe, where he and Vickie reconcile, but are quickly apprehended by McCauley and Steak, who threaten violence if Bud does not return to them. After a climactic fist fight between Steak and Bud, Steak flees, and Bud demands that McCauley reform his dishonest business. McCauley refuses. Bud reveals that he has recorded the incriminating conversation using the mini tape recorder, and he threatens to make the recording public. McCauley relents, promising to manage Bud's career fairly from now on.

This 4-lane newly designed freeway (U.K. motorway) began its construction process in February, 2009. It will link Lugo and Santiago de Compostela (102 km). Construction started in a 53,4 km. stretch between Lugo and Palas de Rei as well as between Arz√∫a and Santiago Airport. The Spanish Ministry of Infraestructures will open a first stretch of 20 km (12 miles) between Lugo and Gunt√≠n around June 2015. Another 15 km (9 mile) stretch between Gunt√≠n and Palas de Rei will be opened later in 2015. A third stretch near Santiago (Lavacolla-Arz√∫a, 28 km (17 miles) has been delayed until 2017 by the Spanish Government. When complete, this infrastructure will allow traffic from outside Galicia to have an easy and safe access to the capital of Galicia (Santiago) and the central area of the Galician Rias. Currently, most traffic going from the central area of the province of Lugo to the Galicia Rias follows the A-6 toll-free freeway (Lugo-Coru√±a) to the junction with the AP-9 near Betanzos. From there, most vehicles use the Coru√±a-Santiago toll-freeway as a fast and safe way to reach the R√≠as. When the A-54 construction is complete, this route will not be used any longer.

History The boarding school was established in 1908 on the site of the current day school, in the then rather rural area surrounding Bagsv√¶rd S√∏; it was only later that this part of Northern Zealand was urbanized. The boarding school itself, located right next to Bagsv√¶rd Lake, was acquired in 1949 and has since been expanded, both through the construction of new buildings and the appropriation of neighbouring lots.

Due to an admittance of extra pupils at this point in the primary school, two new lines are established, whereupon all four lines are referred to as V, X, Y and Z, respectively. Earlier, the two new lines were dubbed C and D, and pupils were divided into these according to their choice of secondary foreign language - C was for those pupils who chose French, and D for those who chose German. *Gymnasium: BK offers students four different branches of tuition, in accordance with the 2005 Educational Reform.

The network broadcasts how-to, DIY and other lifestyle-oriented instructional programming 24 hours a day. History Create was first launched on WGBH-TV DTV/Comcast Cable and WLIW DTV/Cablevision digital services, WNET's sister station, in 2004. Create was launched nationally on January 9, 2006. In 2009, APT started looking for a national network underwriter, while seven stations had found local underwriters that covered their network fees. Ten stations at this time were inserting local programming. With rating data becoming available with more experience handling multicast channels and greater licensing fees, some public TV stations were changing their channel lineup. Some were dropping a network off a channel and programming it independently. A well-known station, WETA-TV, dropped Create on its .2 channel for an independent how-to channel in January 2012. The previous lack of audience data stymied efforts to find a national underwriter. In 2012, APT started planning for more original and exclusive programming. A March national pledge event, a recent new funding source for Create, with travel host Rick Steves, took in at a top 20 market about $40,000. Licensing fees were to be reinstated on July 1, 2012. Operations American Public Television (APT), WGBH-TV and WNET operate the network. APT handles affiliate relations, distribution, marketing and underwriting, and producer and viewer relations. A joint team creates the schedule with all working together on strategic and business planning. WNET produces promos and spots for the network and provides master control services. It is distributed through digital subchannel affiliations with public television stations that are members of or subscribe to APT Exchange, NETA and PBS Plus. Stations' licensing fees fall into one of five price tiers based on budget, market and station size. Shop Create webstore also generates income for the network. Programming The network's programming is scheduled in two 12-hour blocks; local affiliates may insert local programming up to two hours per block. For example, WTTW in Chicago airs Check, Please!, a locally produced restaurant review series, while Nebraska Educational Television shows Backyard Farmer on the network. Create's program schedule relies on the library of instructional and lifestyle programs distributed by network owner American Public Television (7%), PBS Plus and the National Educational Telecommunications Association (NETA). Programmed series are arts and crafts, cooking, gardening, home improvement, travel and other lifestyle programs. The series' acquisition cost is covered by the stations' members and subscriptions. Create primarily airs cooking programs (such as Lidia's Italy, Mexico: One Plate at a Time, Sara's Weeknight Meals, and America's Test Kitchen and its spin-off Cook's Country and celebrity chef Toni Fiore's Vegan Mashup and Totally Vegetarian) which make up much of the network's morning, primetime and overnight schedules. It also carries various home improvement, gardening and arts and crafts programs (such as Hometime, Sewing with Nancy and This Old House), along with select travel-oriented series (such as Globe Trekker and Rick Steves' Europe).

History On 24 May 1946, the United States Army Air Forces, in response to dramatic postwar military budget cuts, imposed by President Harry S. Truman, allocated inactive unit designations to the National Guard Bureau for the formation of an Air Force National Guard. These unit designations were allotted and transferred to various State National Guard bureaus to provide them unit designations to re-establish them as Air National Guard units.

The Mustang was flown from 1946 until 1954. The Arizona ANG was founded by Barry Goldwater, and its origins date to the formation of the 197th Fighter Squadron at Luke Army Airfield, Glendale, receiving federal recognition on 12 December 1946. It was equipped with F-51D Mustangs and its mission was the air defense of the state. 18 September 1947, however, is considered the Arizona Air National Guard's official birth concurrent with the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate branch of the United States military under the National Security Act The Arizona ANG was integrated in 1947, two years before President Truman's Executive Order 9981 which abolished racial discrimination in the United States Armed Forces. On 2 October 1957 the 197th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 161st Fighter-Interceptor Group was allotted by the National Guard Bureau, extended federal recognition and activated. Today, the Arizona ANG performs a worldwide air refueling mission, a homeland defense training mission and tactical battlefield reconnaissance missions. Its 111th Space Operations Squadron is the first space communications unit in the United States military. After the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, elements of every Air National Guard unit in Arizona has been activated in support of the Global War on Terrorism. Flight crews, aircraft maintenance personnel, communications technicians, air controllers and air security personnel were engaged in Operation Noble Eagle air defense overflights of major United States cities.

The game is centered around a series of road races throughout the United States that the player must win to advance to higher-difficulty races, while using a combination of fisticuffs and blunt weaponry to hinder the other racers. It is the second installment in the Road Rash series and introduces a split-screen two-player mode for competing human players, nitrous oxide charges on certain bikes, and chains as offensive weapons. EA began development of Road Rash II before the end of the 1991 Christmas season, and the game was released before the end of the 1992 Christmas season. Road Rash II met with critical acclaim and commercial success, with reviewers appreciating the visuals and addition of the multiplayer mode while pointing out the lack of innovation in the fundamental gameplay. A conversion for the Game Boy Color was developed by 3d6 Games and released under the title Road Rash in 2000. The game saw additional releases on the PlayStation Portable compilation title EA Replay in 2006 and on the Sega Genesis Mini in 2019. Gameplay An example of two-player gameplay in the Genesis version of Road Rash II. The game's larger cartridge size compared to its predecessor allowed the feature to be introduced in this installment of the series. Road Rash II puts the player in control of a motorcycle racer who must finish in third-place or higher among fourteen other racers in a series of five road races to advance through the game's five levels.Road Rash II (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 3 The game's races take place in a number of locales across the United States, consisting of Hawaii, Arizona, Tennessee, Alaska, and Vermont.Road Rash II (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 17‚Äì18 During a race, the player can brake, accelerate, and attack neighboring racers. The player character will punch at the nearest racer with a default input, while holding a directional button during the input will result in either a backhand or a kick. Some opponents wield weapons such as clubs and chains, which can be taken and used by the player if the enemy racer is attacked as they are holding the weapon out to strike.Road Rash II (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 2Road Rash II (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 10‚Äì14 The player racer can be ejected from their bike if they crash into an obstacle (such as boulders, cars, deer and cows) or if they run out of stamina (shown in the bottom-left corner of the screen) due to fights with other racers. In this event, the racer will automatically run back toward their bike, though the player can alter their course and avoid incoming traffic with the directional buttons, or stand still by holding the brake input button. Opponents will likewise be ejected from their bike if their own stamina is depleted. The stamina of the nearest racer is visible within the bottom-right corner of the screen, and the color of both stamina meters change from green to red as they deplete. The player character begins the game with $1,000. When the player wins a race, a cash prize is added to the player's balance. The player can access a bike shop from the game's main menu to view bikes of differing weights, speeds and steering capabilities, and the player may potentially purchase a new bike with the money they have accumulated.Road Rash II (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 4‚Äì9Road Rash II (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 15‚Äì17 Certain bikes are equipped with a series of nitrous oxide charges, which can provide a burst of speed if the player quickly taps the acceleration input button twice. The player will receive a password at the end of a successful race, which can be entered at a password entry screen in a subsequent session to maintain the player's progress. When the player wins a race on all five of the game's tracks, they will advance to the next level. With each subsequent level, the cash prizes become higher, the courses become longer, and the opponent racers become more aggressive. The player wins the game if they win a race on each track in all five levels. The player's bike has its own \\"condition meter\\" between the player's and opponents' stamina meters, which decreases every time the player suffers a crash. If the meter fully depletes, the bike will be wrecked, the player's participation in the current race will end, and a repair bill must be paid. Motorcycle cops also make sporadic appearances throughout the game's tracks. If the player crashes within the vicinity of a cop, the cop will end their participation in the current race by apprehending them and charging them a fine. With each subsequent level, repair bills and fines become more expensive, and cops appear more frequently. If the player lacks the funds to cover either a repair bill or a fine, the game will end prematurely. Road Rash II features a two- player mode that can either be played intermittently between players or simultaneously with the use of a split-screen display. Two players can either race against each other along with other computer-controlled racers or engage in the \\"Mano a Mano\\" mode, in which the two human players are the only competing racers on the track. In this mode, the players can select a weapon to wield prior to the start of the race, and no money is won or lost, though cops still appear as an obstacle and can end the race if they apprehend one of the players. The Game Boy Color version also features a two-player mode via use of the Game Link Cable. Development and release Before the conclusion of the 1991 Christmas season, EA decided to create a sequel to Road Rash, and set a deadline for the following Christmas. Although the development team considered the deadline tight given the length of the previous game's development, the established framework given by the preceding title allowed the team to focus on enhancing the gameplay and visuals for the sequel. The development team of Road Rash II consisted of three programmers, five graphic artists, and four track builders. Returning crew members from the previous game include producer and designer Randy Breen, designer and programmer Dan Geisler, programmer Walt Stein, and artists Arthur Koch and Peggy Brennan.Road Rash II (Genesis) instruction manual, inner cover Carl Mey, the technical director of the original Road Rash, was promoted to Director of Technology at EA following the first game's development, and thus had limited involvement with the sequel. Mey's game director position was inherited by Kevin McGrath, and Mey would leave EA to work for Sega before the conclusion of Road Rash II's development. Breen expanded the sequel's setting to explore the United States outside of the Californian locales of the previous game. Breen explained that he \\"was trying to maintain a certain progression through the fantasy of the product, which was that the first Road Rash was a roots- oriented thing. It happened locally, and people would run these races surreptitiously and do them in back roads where nobody knew about them ‚Äì kind of a Fight Club thing. And they gradually expanded outward.\\" For the game's locations, some of the artists incorporated photos by reducing their colors, while others used the photos as reference and drew the locations from scratch. Road Rash II introduced the chain as an offensive weapon. To create reference material for the body mechanics of swinging a chain, Koch filmed himself performing the action. The expansion to an 8-megabit format from the original game's 5-megabits allowed the team to implement a split-screen two-player mode that they were unable to incorporate into the preceding title. The two-player split screen took Geisler approximately three months to create. Road Rash II includes cutscenes that play at the end of a race, which were conceptualized as a reward based on the player's performance. The cutscenes were roughly storyboarded and created by Koch in low resolution to fit within the console's memory. The characters in the cutscenes were ten pixels tall and informally referred to by the development team as \\"little dudes\\". The artificial intelligence of the opponent racers was improved to be less predictable and more individualistic; certain racers would be more focused on the road than on the human racer, while others would be more aggressive. The cops were also enhanced with the ability to take damage and fight back against the player, after previously being immune to player attacks and restricted to bumping against racers in the first game; Koch claimed that \\"Road Rash II was the first game in which you could beat, and get beaten, by a cop.\\" Controversy surrounded this feature due to the recent beating of Rodney King, which made the development team uncertain on its incorporation. Some potential new features that were omitted due to hardware limitations include weather conditions and a Harley-Davidson-style bike. The game's audio was created by Rob Hubbard, Don Veca and Tony Berkeley. The game's character banter and instruction booklet were written by Jamie Poolos. The yellow Yamaha FZR1000 featured on the cover was Breen's own bike, and would later be featured in the full-motion videos of the 32-bit versions of Road Rash. Road Rash II was released in North America and Europe in December 1992. Versions for the Master System and Game Gear were announced in December 1994, but were not released. The Game Boy Color version was developed by 3d6 Games, with graphics created by Stoo Cambridge. This version is simply titled Road Rash despite being a conversion of the second title. The game was announced in October 2000, released in December, and features rumble support built into its cartridge. The Genesis version of Road Rash II, along with the original Road Rash and Road Rash 3, was included in the PlayStation Portable compilation title EA Replay in 2006. On June 4, 2019, Road Rash II was announced for inclusion on the Sega Genesis Mini console, which was released on September 19, 2019. Reception Road Rash II met with critical acclaim upon release. Skid and Brody of Diehard GameFan praised the general improvements to the gameplay, particularly the addition of the two-player mode. Richard Leadbetter and Radion Automatic of Mean Machines Sega commended the two-player mode, additional bikes, fast visuals and varied backgrounds, but felt that the fundamental gameplay was barely changed from the previous title, and they considered the music to be inferior to that of the original game. Gideon of GamePro was grateful for the inclusion of the split-screen two-player mode, the lack of which he felt \\"kept the first Road Rash from achieving 'instant classic' status\\", and deemed the sequel to be \\"a noteworthy improvement on an already excellent game.\\" He additionally described the graphics as \\"sharp\\", \\"smooth and believable\\", and the musical themes as \\"hip\\". Anthony Mansour of Mega Zone approved of the addition of nitro charges and the ability to beat cops. Brian Costelloe of the same publication attributed the game's addictive quality to the increased challenge, and welcomed the additions of the chain and two-player mode, but found difficulty in recommending the title to those who already own the first game. Paul Wooding and Adrian Pitt of Sega Force warned readers of the game's similarity to its predecessor, but praised the multiplayer modes as \\"magic\\" and the sense of speed and graphic effects as \\"amazing\\". The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly considered the gameplay to still be solid and fun, but saw little difference in that factor from its predecessor, and were disappointed in the lack of detail in the two- player mode's graphics compared to the single-player campaign, though the audio was said to \\"really pop\\". Sales of Road Rash II exceeded those of its predecessor. In its debut month, Road Rash II was the sixth highest-selling Genesis title at Babbage's, and stayed within the top-ten chart for the next six months. Road Rash II first charted on Blockbuster Video's highest-renting Genesis titles at #7, and charted within the top ten on five subsequent months. Mega placed the game at #19 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time,Mega magazine issue 26, page 74, Maverick Magazines, November 1994 and the game has been included in \\"greatest games of all time\\" lists by Stuff and FHM. Shawn Smith of Electronic Gaming Monthly wrote positively of the Game Boy Color version; he praised the \\"awesome\\" scaling effect on the tracks as the game's most impressive feature, and commended its \\"surprisingly solid\\" controls and level of challenge. However, he pointed out that the tracks were largely similar to each other, which led to eventual boredom.

Stickam users created their own privacy settings. In July 2010 Stickam Worldwide Chairwoman Pamela Day recorded a video addressing the problem of online bullies and predators, discussing the safety measures Stickam took after an incident involving an 11-year-old called Jessi Slaughter who received death threats after making controversial postings laden with profanity and talk of violence, and noting that Stickam ultimately banned the minor from their service due to her underage status.Stickam Board of Directors Pamela Day Re: Jessi Slaughter Stickam subsequently adopted a \\"zero tolerance\\" policy that bans for life \\"any member who attempts to share nudity, cyber bully and harass other users, or is identified as an online predator.\\" Ownership Stickam is owned by Stickam Worldwide, Inc. The company was launched as a division of Advanced Video Communications (AVC), a company founded in 2004 and specializing in internet video streaming technologies. Stickam was launched by AVC in February 2005. In addition to Stickam, AVC's products and services include a video conferencing service and LiveLine, a low-cost home surveillance system based on IP camera technology. Advanced Video Communications is a privately held company owned and managed by Japanese entrepreneur Wataru Takahashi. In 2007 and 2008, the New York Times reported that in addition to AVC, Takahashi was also owner of DTI Services, an amalgam of adult websites aimed at the Japanese market. DTI adult websites include DXLive, EXshot, and JGirl Paradise and contain content ranging from adult manga to sexually-explicit webcam shows to uncensored Japanese adult video. The 2007 article also reports that the sites were based in the US due to Japanese laws restricting certain types of nudity. According to Alex Becker, who was a vice-president at Stickam for four months in 2007 before leaving the company, Stickam shares office space, employees, and computer systems with the DTI adult websites. Becker was critical of the practice of sharing employees between Stickam and the adult sites and states that he left because he thought the company was not doing enough to protect teenage users of the site from sexual predators and other dangers. A spokesman for Stickam denied Becker's allegations that Stickam was negligent about protecting its users, and also stated that Becker's claims were \\"retaliatory\\", motivated by a disagreement over a contract with the company, and the stating that after leaving AVC, Becker was working on a site that would be in competition with Stickam. As a follow-up to the 2007 story in the New York Times, Bloomberg Business Week in 2012 published an article by the same reporter, Brad Stone, reporting how Stone had been tricked into writing the first story by a disgruntled former contractor who had falsely claimed to be an employee and who provided a lot of false information. The former contractor has also since served jail time in France and stands accused of forgery and murder and other crimes unrelated to his time at the company.businessweek.com References Category:American social networking websites Category:Video hosting Category:Privately held companies based in California Category:Videotelephony Category:Internet properties established in 2005 Category:Internet properties disestablished in 2013 Category:Streaming software ","title":"Stickam"},{"id":"8120662","text":"Graham Matthew Jay (10 October 1978 ‚Äì 25 September 2003) was an English singer-songwriter. Signed to EMI imprint Food Records in 1999, Jay released his debut album, Draw, in 2001. He died in the early hours of 25 September 2003 from a fall from his seventh floor flat in Willesden, London. A posthumous album Further Than Tomorrow was released in 2008. Career Jay was born in Plymouth, England, the son of two folk musicians, his mother Hilary from Newcastle upon Tyne and his father Tony from Wolverhampton. The family moved to Abergavenny, South Wales when he was ten due to his civil engineering father's work. Jay played bass in his parents folk band with his brother Eddy, and began song writing his own material at the age of 15. At the time his primary influences included The Beatles, Queen, David Bowie and The Beach Boys. Commenting on the music scene in Abergavenny, Jay commented that \\"I was into whatever I could buy at Woolworth's. They never had anything, you always had to order it. You have to remember that Abergavenny is a place where the music scene amounts to one room with sawdust on the floor, where they play 'Wonderwall' at the end of every night\\". In August 1998, after submitting his demos to several record companies and managers Jay met Martyn Watson. Watson had been in several bands in the past including Pookah Makes Three and Twelfth Night, and was currently half of the ambient electronic duo International Peoples Gang (IPG) with Ric Peet as well as working as an A&R; agent. Watson stated that \\"the demo was easily the most original thing that had landed on my desk. I called him, expecting him to be thirty five because it sounded so mature. When I found out he was nineteen, a light went on in my head\\". He then moved to Nottingham where Watson was based, initially recording material by himself, and signed to EMI subsidiary Food Records a year later. Jay worked in studios in Nottingham that were primarily used by DJs with International Peoples Gang and Tony Global co-producing, which brought an electronic influence to some of the songs he was working on. He then first enlisted local Nottingham rhythm section drummer Matt Klose and bassist Garf to work with in the studio. He later recruited former Six by Seven guitarist Sam Hempton, who features on album track Remember This Feeling, and keyboardist Olli Cunningham for live work. In 2000, Jay released the critically acclaimed EPs Four Songs and Friendly Fire. In April 2001, Jay released his debut album Draw, from which three singles were taken: \\"Let Your Shoulder Fall\\", \\"Please Don't Send Me Away\\" and \\"Call My Name Out\\". Press soon drew comparisons between Jay and such musicians as Nick Drake, Elliott Smith, Jeff Buckley and David Gray. Whilst touring the album, Jay supported Doves, Starsailor, Lowgold, Stereophonics and Dido. Towards the end of the album touring cycle, Jay and his band debuted a new song, \\"Stars On The Floor\\". Other new songs that Jay had been working on and recorded with his band in December 2001 included \\"Bad Thing\\" and \\"All This Time\\". When commenting on new material, Jay stated that \\" I've got a band now and I want to be a bit more punk, a bit more Stonesy. You can't shut people up with an acoustic guitar\\". Later in 2002, the band debuted further new songs including \\"Closing the Factory Down\\", \\"The World Knows\\" and \\"Casual User\\". Jay only performed one gig in 2002, with members of his backing band engaging in their own projects. Drummer Matt Klose and bassist Garf toured with their own band Mova, whilst keyboardist Olli Cunningham toured with Lee Hazlewood. Two other planned appearances that year were cancelled at the last minute, due to \\"unforeseen circumstances\\". In August 2002, Jay parted ways with EMI and subsequently with his manager Martyn Watson and backing band. Suggesting there were problems with the label earlier, a couple of months after the release of Draw Jay warned on stage prior to playing his then-upcoming single Please Don't Send Me Away that \\"you've got to make this go Top 75 at least, or else I'll get dropped\\". It charted at 83 and dropped out of the charts the next week. The label rejected the initial work done for his second album, which was recorded with his backing band, and decided he needed to work with outside collaborators. During this time he worked with a number of established songwriters on songs which remain unreleased, including Guy Chambers on the song Waiting For The Weekend, Tim Hawes and Pete Kirtley on She's At It Again and Naked and Busted songwriting team Steve Robson, John McLaughlin, Charlie Simpson and James Bourne on She Knows. This work was also ultimately rejected and EMI didn't renew his contract. Commenting on the split from EMI, Jay's by then-former manager Watson stated that \\"I think that it's a real shame how things have turned out... we were onto a winner but somehow the project lost its way. I hope that Matthew gets a new deal, makes the music that we all know he is capable of and finds true happiness\\". Jay's album and single releases were the last to be issued via Food, before the label was wound down and subsumed into Parlophone after EMI took full control. Shortly after parting ways with EMI, Jay returned to his parents home in Abergavenny having seemingly decided to abandon the music industry. His father stated that he \\"had recently spent a few months living with us during an interruption to his chosen career. He had recently decided to return to his career and was reportedly writing well and preparing for a new album\\". Jay then moved to London to study for a Masters in Audio Production at the University of Westminster, and continued working on material for his second album. However, the work was not completed. Death Matthew Jay died in the early hours of 25 September 2003 in an unexplained fall from his seventh floor flat on St Pauls Avenue in Willesden, North London. His parents travelled through the night to be with their son after the fall, but he died before they were able to reach him. Jay's death was initially assumed to be suicide, with a statement from EMI claiming that \\"his act would appear to have been an impulsive gesture following a professionally difficult year and perhaps, a difficult day\\". Jay's family released a statement which claimed that \\"it is understood that there was nobody with him in the room at the time and no note was left\\". The statement also incorrectly stated that he had died in the late hours of the 24th, and not the early hours of the 25th. It was later revealed that two other people were present in the flat on the evening of Jay's death, and one of these people were still being sought by police to obtain a statement. In 2005, his parents issued an appeal for Mahmoud Rahman, an acquaintance of Jay's who visited the flat on the night, believed to be the last person to speak to him to contact them or the police. Jay was not known to have been depressed, and he had spoken cheerfully to his family earlier the same evening. An inquest into his death returned an open verdict. Posthumous works In August 2004, Jay's parents set up their own record label Jays Music and released the non-album track collection Matthew Jay: Too Soon, with backing from EMI. The collection brought together early EP tracks and B-sides. On 24 September 2006, What Would Love Do Now?, reportedly the last song he had written prior to his death, was released digitally as a single. In June 2007, EMI transferred the rights to the promotional videos for all three of Jay's single releases to Jay's family who made the videos available for download. All profits from the sale of the video downloads went to the UNICEF Born Free from HIV campaign, as UNICEF was a charity that their son had supported. On 30 June 2008, Further Than Tomorrow a collection of the songs that Jay had been working on prior to his death was released. The CD which was sold exclusively for sale via Amazon.co.uk sold out in one day. Jay's family had originally tried to complete the album several years earlier, but plans were stalled due to lack of funds when it was estimated that it would cost around ¬£50,000 to complete. However, they were later contacted by KPM, which was at the time a division of EMI which provided soundtracks worldwide for film, TV and advertising who wanted to complete Jay's unfinished work. The tracks were completed by producer Vasco and musicians including Jay's brother Eddy, who overdubbed over Jay's original home demos. Vasco commented that \\"having done my best to arrange the songs in the manner suggested by what had been left behind, I stood poised with the rest of the band, guitar in hand ready to record as the count-in came over the headphones. Fortunately, Matthew had recorded his voice really well, so we were able to build the album around it. What followed was one of the most enjoyable recording sessions I have ever been involved in\\". The works met similar critical acclaim to Jay's earlier releases, securing airplay on key radio stations, and a high ranking in respected music publications, including Q, who made \\"She Didn't Understand\\" their track of the Day. Jay's mother Hilary admitted that whilst the album \\"would not be exactly as he would have done it but I think they have done an excellent job and I‚Äôm very grateful to all of them\\". The tracks had previously been released digitally in 2007 by KPM, under the title Independent Mind with the additional track \\"Break-Up At The Seaside\\", and some of the original song titles intact which Jay's family changed prior to commercial release (for instance \\"Chaos\\" was originally titled \\"Thoughts Of My Own Demise\\" and \\"Nothing Seems Good Enough\\" originally \\"Casual User\\"). An additional digital single \\"Our Time\\" was released the same year. The song was written by Jay when he was 18 and recorded in 2000 for EMI with the possibility of it being issued as a single prior to the release of Draw. On 10 October 2008, on what would have been Jay's 30th birthday, a tribute concert was held at Shepherd's Bush Empire, London to celebrate the music of Matthew Jay. Artists including Jay's backing band, Starsailor frontman James Walsh, Squeeze frontman Chris Difford and Passenger (Mike Rosenberg) each performed one of Jay's songs, as well as showcasing their own work. All profits were donated to Amnesty International and UNICEF. On 10 October 2011, another previously unreleased song Dear Jane was released digitally. The song was one of the last written by Jay, and had been written to a friend who had attempted suicide. On 10 October 2012, another previously unreleased song Holy Details was released digitally. Other currently unreleased songs include An Older Girl, Home Again, I Have A Shell, (I Only) Meant To Say, Jelly Bullet, Sarah, Take On and What Is The Sky Doing.

In this gauge, the scalar fields responsible for the Higgs mechanism are transformed into a basis in which their Goldstone boson components are set to zero. In other words, the unitarity gauge makes the manifest number of scalar degrees of freedom minimal. The gauge was introduced to particle physics by Steven Weinberg in the context of the electroweak theory. In electroweak theory, the degrees of freedom in a unitarity gauge are the massive spin-1 W+, W‚àí and Z bosons with three polarizations each, the photon with two polarizations, and the scalar Higgs boson. The unitarity gauge is usually used in tree-level calculations.

It was released on March 21, 2006 by Lakeshore Records. The soundtrack features the original score for the film composed by Nathan Johnson, lead of The Cinematic Underground as well as music by The Velvet Underground, Bunny Berigan, Anton Karas and Kay Armen and a song from the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta The Mikado recited by Nora Zehetner that was featured in the film.  Scoring process  This innovative score was composed by Nathan Johnson with additional support and music from The Cinematic Underground. The score harks back to the style, feel and overall texture of noir films. It features traditional instruments such as the piano, trumpet, and violin, but it also contains unique and invented instrument such as the wine-o-phone, metallophone, tack pianos, filing cabinets, and kitchen utensils, all recorded with one microphone on a battered PowerBook.

The wave breaks off the rock- strewn shoreline known as Pescadero Point. On rare winter days with the proper westerly angle, waves are focused by the deep Carmel Canyon to rear up as much as 60 feet in height. Formerly known as Pesky's, Ghost Trees is considered one of the most dangerous waves in the world due to its slab shape, massive boils, strong current, bull kelp, and the underwater labyrinth of natural rock pillars in the impact zone. It is also frequented by white sharks. Background Don Curry at Ghost Trees Ghost Trees gets its name from the white and gnarly Monterey Cypress trees in the area which call to mind ghosts. One of the earliest known surfers of Ghost Trees was Fred Van Dyke, who bodysurfed the wave alone in the early 1960s. In the ensuing decades, a number of locals and visitors to the area paddled out and successfully surfed Ghost Trees, but the consensus was that the wave heaved in too fast and broke too close to the rocks. In the 2000s, Ghost Trees enjoyed international big wave notoriety as surf professionals and locals accessed the wave by towing into it behind jet skis. During this era of tow-surfing, Carmel surfer Don Curry named the wave Ghost Trees after the bleached trunks of dead cypress at the end of 17-Mile Drive, which passed Pescadero Point. Exposure in the form of surf industry advertisements and magazines created conflict between the professional surfers flocking to Ghost Trees on the rare days that conditions allowed it to be surfed and locals who wanted to keep the region's waves secret to minimize crowds. Peter Davi, one of the area's most beloved watermen, died at Ghost Trees on December 4, 2007. He was found floating in the water unconscious by fellow surfers. Starting in mid-March 2009, motorized personal watercraft, or JetSkis, were banned at Ghost Tree due to the fact that the wave fell within the boundaries of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.

The amora of the second generation Rav Adda bar Ahavah was a Jewish Talmudist who lived in Babylonia, known as an amora of the second generation (third and fourth centuries), frequently quoted in both the Jerusalem Talmud and the Babylonian Talmud. He is said to have been born on the day that Rabbi Judah haNasi died.Babylonian Talmud Kiddushin 72a,b; Genesis Rabbah 63:2 He was a disciple of Rav, at whose funeral he rent his garments twice in mourning for the great scholar.Jerusalem Talmud Bava Metzia 3a; Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 42b-43a In Pumbedita, Rav Adda gathered about him many pupils, whom he taught sometimes in the public thoroughfares.Babylonian Talmud Yevamot 110b He lived to an old age, and when interrogated on the merits that entitled him to be so favored, he listed his merits as follows: :\\"No one has ever preceded me to the synagogue, nor has any one ever remained in the synagogue after my departure. I never walked as much as four cubits without meditating on the Law, and never thought of its contents at places not scrupulously clean. Nor did I prepare a bed for myself to enjoy regular sleep, nor did I disturb my colleagues by walking to my seat at college among them. I never nicknamed my neighbor nor rejoiced at his fall. Anger against my neighbor never went to bed with me, and I never passed the street near where my debtor lived; and while at home I never betrayed impatience, in order to observe what is said: 'I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.'\\"Jerusalem Talmud Taanit 67a; compare Babylonian Talmud Taanit 20b In another talmudic tale, Rav Adda observed on the street a woman named Matun (patience) dressed in a manner unbecoming a modest Jewish woman, he ripped off her clothing. Unfortunately for him, the woman was a Samaritan, and thus not subject to Rabbinic jurisdiction, and for the attack on her he was condemned to pay a fine of 400 zuz, and thereupon he exclaimed, \\"Matun, matun [patience, patience] you were worth 400 zuz to me!\\"Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 20a The following is attributed to Rav Adda: \\"The man who is conscious of sin and confesses it, but does not turn away from it, is like the man who holds a defiling reptile in his hand; were he to bathe in all the waters of the world, the bath would not restore him to cleanness. Only when he drops it from his hand, and bathes in but forty seahs (about 100 gallons) of water he is clean.\\"Babylonian Talmud Taanit 16a; compare Tosefta Taanit 1:8 Legends as to his sanctity In talmudic legend, Rav Adda's piety was purportedly so highly valued by heaven that no favor asked by him was ever refused. In times of drought, for example, when he pulled off just one shoe (preparatory to offering prayer), an abundance of rain descended; but if he pulled off the other, the world was flooded.Jerusalem Talmud Taanit 67a Even his teacher, Rav, realized Adda's protective influence. On one occasion when he and Samuel of Nehardea, accompanied by Adda, came to a tottering ruin, and Samuel proposed to avoid it by taking a circuitous route, Rav observed that just then there was no occasion for fear, since Rav Adda, whose merits were very great, was with them; consequently no accident would befall them. Samuel's great colleague Rav Huna also believed in and availed himself of Rav Adda's supposed miraculous influence with heaven. Rav Huna had a lot of wine stored in a building that threatened to collapse. He was anxious to save his property, but there was danger of accident to the laborers. Therefore, he invited Rav Adda into the building, and there engaged him in legal discussions until the task of removing its contents was safely accomplished; hardly had the rabbis vacated the premises when the tottering walls fell.Babylonian Talmud Taanit 20b The disciple of Rava A second Rav Adda bar Ahavah was also a Jewish Talmudist, a disciple of Rava, addressed by Rava as \\"my son.\\" In a discussion the elder rabbi once rebuked him as devoid of understanding.Babylonian Talmud Taanit 8a; Yevamot 61b; Sanhedrin 81a-b Subsequently, he studied under Rav Papa and waited on Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak.Babylonian Talmud Bava Batra 22a References * Category:Talmud rabbis of Babylonia ","title":"Adda bar Ahavah"},{"id":"8120729","text":"Antal R√≥ka (June 25, 1927 - September 16, 1970) was a Hungarian athlete who competed mainly in the 50 kilometre walk.

This is an article that describes the history of Australian cricket from its known beginnings until the eve of the first-ever Test matches between Australia and England, which took place in the 1876‚Äì77 season. Origins Cricket was already established in England at the time Australia was first settled by Europeans in the late 18th century. Cricket soon arrived in Australia and the first definite Australian references to the sport are found in 1804, when the January edition of The Sydney Gazette recorded that recent weather had been favourable to cricketers. Cricket soon became a very popular sport in Australia, especially in the south-eastern colonies. In Sydney, the Military Cricket Club played games in the 1830s against the Australian Cricket Club, including one at Hyde Park in 1833 and the Racecourse in 1834, as well as against an Australian civilian XI in 1834. In rural New South Wales, the Queanbeyan District Cricket Club was officially formed in 1863 having played games against teams from local towns through the 1850s. first-class status was achieved as early as the 1850s. Commencement of first-class cricket In March 1850, the Melbourne Cricket Club issued a challenge to the Launceston Cricket Club for a match that was eventually played in the 1850‚Äì51 season. On 11 & 12 February 1851, Tasmania v Victoria at Launceston Racecourse was the inaugural first-class match played in Australia. Tasmania Tasmania was still called Van Diemen's Land until 1856; their opponents actually represented the southern part of New South Wales that became Victoria. In cricketing terms, the two sides are always referred to as Tasmania and Victoria, this match being their collective debuts in first-class cricket. won by 3 wickets. Development of inter-colonial cricket Tasmania and Victoria played each other three times up to 1855 and then the New South Wales team made its debut in 1855‚Äì56 when it defeated Victoria by 3 wickets in the inaugural first-class match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The 1857‚Äì58 season was a milestone as it featured three first-class matches involving all of New South Wales, Tasmania and Victoria. Victoria played in all three matches and won them. They defeated New South Wales by 171 runs at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and then defeated Tasmania twice: at Launceston by an innings and 20 runs; and at Hobart by 69 runs. Although it was impossible due to travel constraints to arrange first-class matches between the colonies in every season, there was a steady rate of growth, especially at club level. The sport received a considerable boost when English teams began arriving in the colonies in 1861‚Äì62 and especially when the legendary WG Grace himself toured Australia in 1873‚Äì74. By 1876, standards in Australia had become very high indeed especially with the emergence of a world-class bowler like Fred Spofforth. Australia was then ready to oppose England on level terms. For detailed information about early domestic cricket in Australia, see : Intercolonial cricket in Australia and List of Australian intercolonial cricket matches International tours 1861‚Äì62 The inaugural English tour of Australia was organised by Messrs Spiers & Pond. Led by HH Stephenson, the English team was a great success that inspired later tours. 1863‚Äì64 The Melbourne Cricket Club organised a tour by an English team under the captaincy of George Parr, which also visited New Zealand. No first-class matches were played. The English team was unbeaten and its overall record was 16 played, 10 wins and six draws. 1873‚Äì74 The Melbourne Cricket Club organised a tour by an English team under the captaincy of WG Grace, which played 15 matches in all but none were first-class.

Both of these books of the Bible are credited to Luke. They also describe the narrative of those who continued to spread Christianity, ministry of Jesus and the subsequent ministry of the apostles and the Apostolic Age.  Authorship  Both the books of Luke and Acts are narratives written to a man named Theophilus. The book of Acts starts out with: \\"The former treatise have I made\\", probably referring to the Gospel of Luke., Authorised Version Scholars believe that they were written by the same person. Luke‚ÄìActs has sometimes been presented as a single book in published Bibles or New Testaments, for example, in The Original New Testament (1985)Hugh J. Schonfield, ed., The Original New Testament (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1985). . and The Books of the Bible (2007). Luke is the longest of the four gospels and the longest book in the New Testament; together with Acts of the Apostles it makes up a two-volume work from the same author, called Luke‚ÄìActs. The cornerstone of Luke‚ÄìActs' theology is \\"salvation history\\", the author's understanding that God's purpose is seen in the way he has acted, and will continue to act, in history.  Composition and setting  It divides the history of first-century Christianity into three stages, with the gospel making up the first two of these ‚Äì the arrival among men of Jesus the Messiah, from his birth to the beginning of his earthly mission in the meeting with John the Baptist followed by his earthly ministry, Passion, death, and resurrection (concluding the gospel story per se). The gospel's sources are thought to be the Gospel of Mark (for the narrative of Christ's earthly life), the hypothetical sayings collection called the Q source (for his teachings), and a collection of material called the L (for Luke) source, which is found only in this gospel. The work is Hellenized and written for a gentile audience possibly, in part, to counter a gnostic understanding of history.. Marcion, a famous 2nd-century heretic, who used a modified form of Luke known as the Gospel of Marcion, did not use Acts, perhaps because he was unaware of it or intentionally excluded it from his biblical canon; Irenaeus, a proto-orthodox apologist, is the first to use and mention Acts, specifically against Marcionism. Some scholars note that there are two versions of Luke‚ÄìActs with the longer version 10‚Äì20 percent longer than the shorter version. Scholars disagree on which came first.Carrier, Richard (2014) On the Historicity of Jesus Sheffield Phoenix Press p. 271   See also  * The Lost Chapter of the Acts of the Apostles References Bibliography  Joseph B.

The Dobson spectrometer was invented in 1924 by Gordon Dobson.Dobson's original ozone spectrometer, 1926. - - Science Museum A history of the development of the instrument is here G. M. B. Dobson - March 1968 / Vol. 7, No. 3 / APPLIED OPTICS (pps. 387 - 405). http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ozwv/dobson/papers/Applied_Optics_v7_1968.pdf and an example of one of Dobson's own instruments remains on display in the University of Oxford Department of Physics.History University of Oxford Department of Physics Operation Dobson spectrophotometers can be used to measure both total column ozone and profiles of ozone in the atmosphere.A discussion of the instrument can be found here: ftp://ftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/dobson/Papers/dobson%20ozone%20spectrophotometer%20overview2.ppsx A copy of the instrument handbook is available from the WMO: http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/arep/gaw/documents/GAW183-Dobson-WEB.pdf Ozone is tri-atomic oxygen, O3; ozone molecules absorb harmful UV light in the atmosphere before it reaches the surface of the earth. No UVC radiation penetrates to the ground as it is absorbed in the ozone-oxygen cycle. However some longer-wave and less harmful UVB and most of the UVA is not absorbed as ozone is less opaque to these frequencies, so they penetrate to the ground level of Earth in higher quantities. The sources of light used may vary. Beside the direct sun light, the light from the clear sky, moon or stars may be used. The Dobson Spectrometer measures the total ozone by measuring the relative intensity of the UVB radiation that reaches the Earth and comparing it to that of UVA radiation at ground level. If all of the ozone were removed from the atmosphere, the amount of UVB radiation would equal the amount of UVA radiation on the ground. As ozone does exist in the atmosphere, the Dobson Spectrometer can use the ratio between UVA and UVB radiation on the ground to determine how much ozone is present in the upper atmosphere to absorb the UVC radiation. The ratio is determined by turning the R-dial, which can be rotated a full 300¬∞, on the instrument. The spectrometer compares two different wavelength intensities, UVB (305 nm) and UVA (325 nm), in order to calculate the amount of ozone. When turned, the R-dial filters and blocks out the light of the UVC wavelength until the intensity of the two wavelengths of light are equal. The ratio of the two wavelengths at incidence can be calculated once the filtered intensities are the same. The results are measured in Dobson Units, equal to 10 ¬µm thickness of ozone compressed to Standard conditions for temperature and pressure (STP) in the column. If all of the ozone in the atmospheric column one was measuring were compressed to STP, the thickness of the compressed atmosphere in mm would equal an answer in Dobson Units divided by 100. The vertical distribution of ozone is derived using the Umkehr method. This method relies on the intensities of reflected, rather than direct, UV light. Ozone distribution is derived from the change in the ratio of the same UV-pair frequencies with time as the sun sets. An \\"Umkehr\\" measurement takes about three hours, and provides data up to an altitude of 48 km, with the most accurate information for altitudes above 30 km. The Dobson method has its drawbacks. It is strongly affected by aerosols and pollutants in the atmosphere, because they also absorb some of the light at the same wavelength. Measurements are made over a small area in the direction of the sun. Today this method is often used to calibrate data obtained by other methods, including satellites. Instruments and manufacturers Some modernized versions of Dobson spectrophotometer exist and continue to provide data. About 120 Dobsonmeters have been made, mostly by R&J; Beck of London, of which about 50 remain in use today. The most famous ones are probably Nos. 31 and 51 with which Joe Farman of the British Antarctic Survey discovered the Ozone Hole in 1984. The \\"World Standard Dobson\\", No. 83, is owned and operated by the US Dept of Commerce's, NOAA, as is the secondary standard, No. 65. The oldest instrument still in use is No.8 located at the roof of the Norwegian Polar Institute at Ny √Ölesund, Svalbard. This instrument has the last reported data for 1997.

The axino has been predicted to be the lightest supersymmetric particle in such a model. In part due to this property, it is considered a candidate for the composition of dark matter. The supermultiplet containing an axion and axino has been suggested as the origin of supersymmetry breaking, where the supermultiplet gains an F-term expectation value.

Death of Eric Bristow  On 5 April 2018, after attending a Premier League Darts event, darts legend Eric Bristow collapsed in front of the venue due to a heart attack and later died. Transportation links Direct public transport to the M&S; Bank Arena is by bus. James Street railway station is a short walk away and is served by the Merseyrail Wirral Line. The station is two stops away from mainline station. The arena is situated opposite the portal of the now disused Wapping Tunnel which runs from Edge Hill in the east of the city. There have been calls to reuse the tunnel with a station serving the arena and immediate docks on the site of the demolished Park Lane station which was at the end of the tunnel.

The second live album by the band, it was released in December 1980 as a followup to their hit film released that year, The Blues Brothers. To support the film, the band embarked on a 22 dates tour in North America, culminating with seven dates at the Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles. Keyboardist and musical director Paul Shaffer, sax player Tom Scott and drummer Steve Jordan, who were absent in the film and the soundtrack due to scheduling conflicts, reprised their roles as full-fledged band members. Drummer Willie Hall was let go but the band decided to retain Murphy Dunne, who had replaced Shaffer in the film, as additional keyboards player. Session man Jeff Mironov was brought in to provide additional guitar for the record. Like the Blues Brothers previous albums, Made in America showcases a selection of blues and rhythm and blues standards. \\"Joliet\\" Jake Blues (John Belushi) was particularly keen on singing Randy Newman‚Äôs \\"Guilty\\", a song who had a deep biographical meaning to him. In the album \\"Guilty\\" leads into a rendition of the theme from the TV series Perry Mason and Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller's \\"Riot in Cell Block No. 9\\", establishing a narrative of guilt, trial and sentence. \\"Green Onions\\" marked the first occasion two of the band members (Steve Cropper and Duck Dunn) performed their own material, the song being a standard by Booker T. & the M.G.'s. Released in December 1980, Made in America was the Blues Brothers' third consecutive album to enter the Billboard top 50, peaking at No. 49. \\"Who's Making Love\\", released as a single, cracked the Top 40 at No. 39. A second single, \\"Going Back to Miami\\", would peak at No. 108. Made in America was the band's last album in its original incarnation. Following Belushi's death in 1982, the group disbanded for a few years until reforming in 1988 with Leon Pendarvis replacing Shaffer and Danny Gottlieb replacing Jordan. (Scott had left the band at the end of the tour following a salary dispute).

Life and education Brody was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, his parents had immigrated to the United States. Working his way through Harvard University, he received his bachelor's degree in 1952, a master's degree in 1953 and Ph.D. in 1958. He married Susan Schapiro in 1955. The couple have two daughters and a son. As Brody explains, he did not intend to become a labor historian: Research focus Brody's research focuses on the American labor movement and American history. Along with David Montgomery and Herbert Gutman, he is credited with founding the field of \\"new labor history\\" in North America, which examined working-class culture rather than simply workers' organizations as a source of history. Brody's most coherent statement of the \\"new labor history\\" can be found in his article titled \\"The Old Labor History and the New: In Search of an American Working Class\\" (Labor History, 20[1979]: 111‚Äì26). Brody rose to prominence following the 1960 publication of his pioneering history of early steelworker unions, The Steelworkers in America: The Nonunion Era, a book based on his doctoral dissertation. He has written numerous articles and book-length treatments of the ethical, organizational and social construction of work and employment. In recent years, Brody has focused on the origins and transformation of American labor law, labor law reform and weaknesses in the structure and interpretation of the National Labor Relations Act. Brody is Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Davis, where he taught for many years. He is affiliated with the Institute of Industrial Relations (IIR) at the University of California, Berkeley. Memberships and awards Brody is a member of the Society of American Historians and the American Historical Association. He served as president of the Pacific Coast branch of the American Historical Association from 1991 to 1992. He is also a member of the Organization of American Historians, and served on the group's executive board from 1976 to 1979. Brody was a senior fellow for the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1978. He won a Guggenheim Memorial Foundation fellowship in 1983, and was appointed as a senior professor in the Fulbright Program in 1975. In 2008 he won the Sol Stetin Award for Labor History from the Sidney Hillman Foundation and a Distinguished Service to Labor and Working-Class History Award from the Labor and Working-Class History Association.

The municipality of Benissa has 4 km of coastline linking the towns of Moraira and Calp. The scenery of the area includes cliff tops, rocky coves, sandy beaches and tiny bays along the Benissa Costa. The territory of Benissa also contains terraced vineyards, mountains and palm trees. Spanish village houses, with doorsteps directly onto the street, internal courtyards and deceptively spacious inside. Old finques (a farm or country estate) sit on large plots amongst vineyards with panoramic views to the sea. Nearby towns along the Costa Blanca are La Fustera, Cala dels Pinets, Cala de La Llobella, Cala l'Advocat, Baladrar and Cap Blanc before reaching Moraira. History The toponym of Benissa comes from the Arabic tribal name Beni-Hisa or Beni-Eyce.(sons of Christ) After the Christian reconquest (1248) by the troops of James II of Aragon, the town was settled by people from the Pyrenees, Catalonia and Aragon along with the former inhabitants, although the majority of the population remained Muslim for centuries. The last Muslim citizens were expelled in 1609. Benissa, together with Altea, Calp and Teulada, formed a lordship, whose rulers included the Sicilian admiral Roger of Lauria. In the 15th and 16th centuries it suffered numerous attacks by African pirates. Main sights The medieval town centre has been largely preserved with its town square, narrow streets, churches. Ironwork balconies and heraldic shields decorate the historic buildings. The Palace of Torres-Ordu√±a is open to the public as a cultural centre and library. Benissa also has a strong Catholic tradition with a Franciscan seminary that has educated many Franciscans followers throughout Spain and a large Neo-Gothic church, the \\"Catedral de la Marina\\". Transportation Travel to Benissa is easily made from Alicante or Valencia, through the highway A-7 or the N332. The closest airport is the Alicante airport, located 70 km to the south-west. The closest RENFE (Spanish mainline) railway station is in Alicante. There is an Alicante TRAM station in Benissa, connected to the network via Benidorm, though the service has been suspended since 2016 and is currently replaced by buses.

History Birth of the club In 1943 a group of idealistic young men drawn mostly from the famed hurling nursery of North Mon. laid the foundations of Cumann Iomana & Peile Na Piarsaigh. These young schoolboys, influenced by their education at North Mon., had a great love for Irish national culture and games. They felt that existing clubs, and indeed the GAA itself, were not aspiring to the founding ideals of the Association. They set about seeking change and an informal meeting was held under a lamppost outside No. 3 (St. Ita's), Redemption Road. Amongst the attendance were Derry Terry, Christy Twomey, Liam Connery, Pat Leary, Rev. McCabe, Romey Sullivan, Bertie Dorgan, Theo Dorgan, Se√°n McAuliffe (MacAmhlaoibh), Paddy Sutton, Jimmy Keating, Paudie Collins, Joe Murphy, Bernie Murphy, and Se√°n Corkery. In an effort to become properly organised the first formal meeting was held in the presbytery of the North Cathedral. Meanwhile, the youthful members in an effort to achieve higher status and greater influence called upon one of their teachers, Donnacha √ì Murch√∫, for guidance and assistance. This led to him becoming the first Uachtar√°n [president] of the club, with Derry Terry serving as Runa√≠ [secretary] and Paddy Sutton as Cisteoir [treasurer]. In choosing a name for the club the members sought one which would reflect their aims and ideals. Padraig Pearse, it was felt, because of his underlying love of Ireland and all things Irish, reflected those ideals admirably. Thus the name \\"Na Piarsaigh\\" [\\"The Pearses\\"] was adopted. A set of playing-gear colours (black and amber) was acquired. Later in 1951 the symbolic red hand of Ulster with severed thumb was selected as the club crest after careful consideration. The red hand represents the island that is Ireland, the severed thumb the six north-eastern counties still under foreign rule. The legend is that when Ireland is reunited the thumb will again rejoin the fingers to create a strong and useful hand. The newly formed club, as part of its policy, decided to conduct its affairs as far as possible through the medium of Irish. Indeed, the policy extended to the field of play where the players addressed one another in the native tongue. So novel was this approach to GAA affairs that it led to a certain amount of resentment amongst other clubs. The national outlook was then in such a state during what is termed the \\"Emergency\\" [the Second World War] that any willingness to promote Irish language culture generally met with strong opposition. The opposition to club activities by the local clergy, in fact, caused Na Piarsaigh to lose the use of St. Mary's Hall. In relation to this the then Uactar√°n, Donnacha √ì Murch√∫. recalled the words of a prominent local clergyman of the day, \\"We don't want any of that oul' stuff going on here\\". This, however, did not unduly upset the youthful members who strove all the more to achieve their aims and ideals. By 1946 the membership had grown from thirty to seventy, but as yet the club had failed to win a title in either hurling or football. However, in the same year the City Division Junior Hurling Championship was won, no mean achievement in three years of existence. During this period also, minor teams were fielded but without much success. Training for matches was a problem without a club ground. Training took place in such diverse locations as the Lee Fields, Rivers Town, the Fair Field, and Brown's Field, which was located near the present-day Church of the Ascension in Gurranabraher. NaPiarsaigh.com/history Acquisition of Club Grounds As the club grew and expanded in the late 1940s, the need for a playing field was keenly felt and expressed by the then Secretary Donncha O Griofa in his annual report of 1951 when he wrote: \\"The lack of a playing field of our own is greatly impeding the advancement of our teams. As members are unable to get sufficient training for matches, they ultimately wander to other codes\\". This appeal by the Secretary was to bear fruit six years later when after hard years of fund-raising the club purchased a field at The Commons, Fair Hill. In this eventful year of 1951 the need for a properly organised minor section was strongly mooted. Again, Donncha O Griofa, in his address, referred to this when he wrote: \\"Films and books cannot teach the game. Give young boys hurleys and footballs and they will do the rest. Encourage them to think they are the coming champions. The success of our club must ultimately rest in the generation to follow\\". Success on the Playing Fields In 1946 the Club won its first title at Junior level, annexing the City title. However this group of dedicated workers and followers had to wait until 1953 to achieve their finest hour, when the County Junior Hurling title was added. Three Minor Hurling County titles were added in 1961, 62 and 63, in what should have laid the foundations for success at Senior level. However disappointment was to follow with heartbreaking defeats in the mid-1960s. In football success at Junior level came with victory in the County final in 1964, followed quickly by County success at Intermediate level the following year. Thus the Club had gone from Junior level to Senior in the shortest possible period. However it was to be the 1970s in which much of the groundwork for today's success at Senior level was laid with a succession of brilliant hurling teams at under age level.

Formation PALIPEHUTU was founded in 1980 in refugee camps in Tanzania, where Hutus had fled following persecution by the Tutsi-led government.Burundi Conflict Database, Uppsala University PALIPEHUTU advocated armed struggle and established its armed wing, the FNL, in 1985. The National Liberation Front (FROLINA) split from PALIPEHUTU in 1990, and the armed wing PALIPEHUTU-FNL, led by Cossan Kabura split from the political wing of PALIPEHUTU in 1991. The political wing of PALIPEHUTU was renamed the Party for the Liberation of People-Agakiza and is led by Etienne Karatasi. In 2002 PALIPEHUTU-FNL split into two factions, one led by Kabura and one by Agathon Rwasa. Generally, PALIPEHUTU's support comes more from the central region of Muramvya and Lake Tanganyika, whereas the main Hutu political party CNDD derives its support from the southern Bururi region.PALIPEHUTU & FNL, Global Security Civil war During the civil war, PALIPEHUTU-FNL was linked to the killing of Monsignor Michael Courtney,Assassination of Apostolic Nuncio blamed on FNL/Palipehutu, Relief Web, 2003-12-30 the Catholic Church's chief representative in Burundi, the Titanic Express massacre and the Gatumba massacre in which over 150 Banyamulenge Congolese refugees were killed. PALIPEHUTU also fought in the Second Congo War alongside the Congolese army, the Army for the Liberation of Rwanda and the Mai-Mai against the Burundian army. Following the Gatumba massacre, the Great Lakes Peace Initiative declared PALIPEHUTU-FNL to be a terrorist organisation, and the South African President, Thabo Mbeki called on the International Criminal Court to prosecute.Young lions of the African Century , African National Congress, 2004-08-26 PALIPEHUTU-FNL was the last Hutu rebel group to sign an agreement with the Burundi government, which it did in September 2006At last Burundi, Palipehutu-FNL sign ceasefire, IPP Media, 2006-09-08 Further agreements led to a final agreement in December 2008, according to which it also changed its name to remove \\"PALIPEHUTU\\" to leave only \\"FNL\\" as its name (as Burundian political parties may not refer to ethnicities in their names).Irinnews.org On May 15, 2009, UNICEF reported that 136 ex-FNL child soldiers returned to their communities in Burundi. Party emblem The party's emblem a bent bow and an arrow placed between a hoe and a hammer. The party's flag is red with the centre inscribed with the emblem of the party in black. Red symbolizes the suffering endured by the people of Burundi. The bent bow and the arrow symbolize the struggle for the fundamental rights and liberties.

It turns out that the 8 real SUSY generators are pseudoreal, and after complexification, correspond to the tensor product of a four-dimensional Dirac spinor with the fundamental representation of SU(2)R. The quotient space SU(2)_R/U(1)_R \\\\approx S^2 \\\\simeq \\\\mathbb{CP}^1, which is a 2-sphere/Riemann sphere. Harmonic superspace describes N=2 D=4, N=1 D=5, and N=(1,0) D=6 SUSY in a manifestly covariant manner. There are many possible coordinate systems over S2,Needless to say, other coordinate systems are also possible, and nothing physical is dependent upon the choice of coordinates, but the u coordinates have the advantage of being simple and convenient to use. but the one chosen not only involves redundant coordinates, but also happen to be a coordinatization of SU(2)_R \\\\approx S^3. We only get S2 after a projection over U(1)_R \\\\approx S^1. This is of course the Hopf fibration. Consider the left action of SU(2)R upon itself. We can then extend this to the space of complex valued smooth functions over SU(2)R. In particular, we have the subspace of functions which transform as the fundamental representation under SU(2)R. The fundamental representation (up to isomorphism, of course) is a two-dimensional complex vector space. Let us denote the indices of this representation by i,j,k,...=1,2. The subspace of interest consists of two copies of the fundamental representation. Under the right action by U(1)R \\\\-- which commutes with any left action‚Äîone copy has a \\"charge\\" of +1, and the other of -1. Let us label the basis functions u^{\\\\pm i}. :\\\\left(u^{+i}\\\\right)^* = u^-_i. The redundancy in the coordinates is given by :u^{+i}u^-_i = 1. Everything can be interpreted in terms of algebraic geometry. The projection is given by the \\"gauge transformation\\" u^{\\\\pm i} \\\\to e^{\\\\pm i \\\\phi} u^{\\\\pm i} where œÜ is any real number. Think of S3 as a U(1)R-principal bundle over S2 with a nonzero first Chern class. Then, \\"fields\\" over S2 are characterized by an integral U(1)R charge given by the right action of U(1)R. For instance, u+ has a charge of +1, and u‚àí of -1. By convention, fields with a charge of +r are denoted by a superscript with r +'s, and ditto for fields with a charge of -r. R-charges are additive under the multiplication of fields. The SUSY charges are Q^{i\\\\alpha}, and the corresponding fermionic coordinates are \\\\theta^{i\\\\alpha}. Harmonic superspace is given by the product of ordinary extended superspace (with 8 real fermionic coordinatates) with S2 with the nontrivial U(1)R bundle over it. The product is somewhat twisted in that the fermionic coordinates are also charged under U(1)R. This charge is given by :\\\\theta^{\\\\pm \\\\alpha}= u^{\\\\pm}_i \\\\theta^{i\\\\alpha}. We can define the covariant derivatives D^{\\\\pm}_{\\\\alpha} with the property that they supercommute with the SUSY transformations, and D^{\\\\pm}_{\\\\alpha}f(u)=0 where f is any function of the harmonic variables. Similarly, define :D^{++} \\\\equiv u^{+i}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial u^{-i}} and :D^{--} \\\\equiv u^{-i}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial u^{+i}}. A chiral superfield q with an R-charge of r satisfies D^+_{\\\\alpha}q=0. A scalar hypermultiplet is given by a chiral superfield q^+. We have the additional constraint :D^{++}q^+ = J^{+++}(q^+,\\\\, u). According to the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, the solution space to the previous constraint is a two-dimensional complex manifold.  Relation to quaternions  The group SU(2)_R can be identified with the Lie group of quaternions with unit norm under multiplication. SU(2)_R, and hence the quaternions act upon the tangent space of extended superspace. The bosonic spacetime dimensions transform trivially under SU(2)_R while the fermionic dimensions transform according to the fundamental representation.In 10D \\\\mathcal{N}=(1,0) SUSY with four spatial dimensions compactified over a hyperk√§hler manifold, half of the SUSY generators are broken, and the remaining generators can be expressed using harmonic superspace. The four compactified spatial dimensions transforms as a fundamental representation under SU(2)_R. The left multiplication by quaternions is linear. Now consider the subspace of unit quaternions with no real component, which is isomorphic to S2. Each element of this subspace can act as the imaginary number i in a complex subalgebra of the quaternions. So, for each element of S2, we can use the corresponding imaginary unit to define a complex-real structure over the extended superspace with 8 real SUSY generators. The totality of all CR structures for each point in S2 is harmonic superspace.

By the age of seventeen, she had begun her studies at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome with Edwige Chibaudo, and later with Rinolfi and Pedreni. Due to her wide vocal range, she was initially thought to be a soprano. She made her debut in Cagliari as Santuzza in Cavalleria rusticana in 1934. Within a year, she joined the Teatro alla Scala in Milan as Meg Page in Verdi's Falstaff. Soon she was given the part of Azucena in Il trovatore, which quickly became her signature role and was her debut role at the Metropolitan Opera in 1947. Other roles there included Santuzza, Ulrica in Un ballo in maschera, Mrs Quickly in Falstaff‚Äîthe latter she recorded in 1950, opposite Giuseppe Valdengo‚Äîand Herva Nelli, with Arturo Toscanini conducting. She sang Wagnerian roles in Italian, as was the custom during this time period, including Brangaene at La Scala to the Isolde of Giuseppina Cobelli. She made a notable recording (singing in Italian) of Brangaene's watch from Act 2. She also made recordings (also in Italian) of lieder by Brahms and Strauss. She returned to Italy, and sang at La Scala until 1954 when she abandoned her stage career. She accepted a teaching position in Ankara, where she remained until her death in 1962. She was known for her warm and natural voice, with its ample lower-register and full high- notes, as well as for her great temperament and passion.

LeBeau was first elected to the State Senate in 1996. He retired after 18 years in office. Biography Born and raised in Easthampton, Massachusetts, Senator LeBeau was educated in public schools and graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst with a master's degree in Education, a Sixth-Year Degree from the University of Connecticut, and Elementary Education Certification from Central Connecticut State University. A former public school teacher for 36 years, Senator LeBeau is now retired. He lives in East Hartford with his wife Joanne, their three children Kara, Matthew and Christopher, and their chocolate Labrador Retriever ‚ÄúHershey.‚Äù Legislative experience LeBeau was first elected to the Connecticut General Assembly in 1990 as a state representative from the town of East Hartford. While in the state House, he served on the Finance Committee and as vice- chairman of the Commerce Committee. He was first elected to the state Senate in 1996, where he represents the 3rd Senatorial District towns of East Hartford, South Windsor, East Windsor and Ellington. In his time in the Senate, LeBeau has advocated for a state commitment to the Groton-area submarine base which helped save it from the federal budget axe; tax credits for job creation; major investments in biotechnology, stem cell research and alternative energies such as fuel cells; linking the research departments of various state institutions of higher learning with start-up, high-technology firms; contracting reform; Goodwin College; and the Rentschler Field complex. Senator LeBeau has also championed a transportation study of the Buckland shopping mall area and a legislative Task Force on Fatherhood. In 2011, Senator LeBeau voted for HB 6599,http://cga.ct.gov/2011/VOTE/S/2011SV-00377-R00HB06599-SV.htm a measure which would add gender identity and gender expression to existing anti- discrimination statutes. He also voted for HB 6650, which is intended to clarify and limit the classes of prisoners made eligible for early release by an earlier bill. Some Republicans in the Senate said that the bill didn't limit the early release program enough, allowing some violent fleons to gain early release. Other public service Senator LeBeau has been a member of the East Hartford Lions Club for 25 years and has held all major offices in the club. He served on the East Hartford Town Council and is currently a member of the Blessed Sacrament/Our Lady of Peace linked parishes, the East Hartford Historical Society, and the League of Women Voters. LeBeau has supported children's dental health by initiating the distribution of over 500 oral healthcare kits to children in East Hartford.http://www.senatedems.state.ct.us/pr/lebeau-100930.htmlhttp://mykoolsmiles.com/media/news His professional experience includes founding the Synergy School for at-risk students and working as the coordinator for Drop Out Prevention and Drug-Free Schools Program for the East Hartford schools and serving on the ERASE Board of Directors, The Capital Region Growth Council Board of Directors, the Liquor Control Task Force Against Underage Drinking, the CT Economic Conference Board, the International Trade Council, the Cultural Heritage Committee, and the East Hartford Child Plan. 2010 Connecticut gubernatorial election On July 28, 2009 LeBeau announced the formation of an exploratory committee for the 2010 Connecticut gubernatorial election. LeBeau told the media in attendance that his first order of business would be to garner the support of Connecticut Democrats and he would start by visiting Democratic Town Committees around the state to hear their concerns about the future of Connecticut. LeBeau said he would make a decision whether or not to officially enter the statewide race by early 2010.

In 1787 he published an important hymnal, A Selection of Hymns from the Best Authors, Intended to Be an Appendix to Dr. Watts‚Äô Psalms and Hymns, commonly known as Rippon's Selection, which was very successful, and was reprinted 27 times in over 200,000 copies. Many hymns originally published in Rippon's Selection are preserved in the Sacred Harp. Life At the age of 17, Rippon attended Bristol Baptist College in Bristol, England. After the death of John Gill, he assumed Gill's pastorate, the Baptist meeting-house in Carter Lane, Tooley Street, Southwark, from 1773 at the age of 20 until his death, a period of 63 years. During these times, the church experienced great growth and became one of the largest congregations in the country. The congregation moved to New Park Street from Carter Lane in 1833. The New Park Street Chapel could seat 1,200 people. Rippon's church was later pastored by Charles Haddon Spurgeon before moving to the Metropolitan Tabernacle at Elephant and Castle. Rippon also edited the Baptist Annual Register for 12 years. He was considered the foremost authority on the hymns of Isaac Watts. Rippon's Selection of hymns were used by the congregation until 1866 when Spurgeon produced an update called \\"Our Own Hymn Book\\" which borrowed much from Rippon and Watts. Like John Gill, he looked for a large scale conversion of the Jews at the end of the age. At the time of his death, he was working on a book commemorating those buried in London's Dissenter cemetery, Bunhill Fields, where he himself was buried.Francis, J.C.

It saw its decline later during the next decade as its practices involved heavy drinking and unconventional sexual activities toward the end of its existence, which subsequently led to the conviction of 60 of its followers.  History  The grounds for the Korpela movement were laid in 1928 when Toivo Korpela, a self-proclaimed Laestadian preacher who had been rejected from his congregation in western Finland, started to travel around the Torne Valley to preach. The mainstream of the Laestadian movement were troubled by his activities and in 1931, it was openly suggested that Korpela could have \\"succumbed to vice\\" and that \\"the authority of the word of god was endangered\\" unless he changed his view on important matters of faith. When Korpela stopped preaching in 1934 due to his conflicting views with the Swedish Laestadian church, the movement survived without his leadership and new leaders emerged from inside the community. One of the new leaders of the cult was Sigurd Siikavaara, who officially started the movement following Korpela's exile (thus the alternative name of the movement). More unorthodox elements such as apocalyptic beliefs and ecstatic rituals were introduced following the change of leadership. These beliefs and practices were later denounced by Korpela himself in an interview given in 1935. Following the involvement of Swedish authorities, Siikavaara was institutionalised in an asylum for 67 days, and upon his release the practices of the movement took a turn towards sexual rituals, which would ultimately lead to its demise. Following the radical change in practices, the Swedish government involved itself further, previously being tolerant toward religion, now targeting the sexual rituals, especially with concern for the involvement of minors. In 1939, police arrested 60 people, leading to the end of the movement, which at its peak had gained an estimated total of 600 followers.  Beliefs and practices  The spiritual beliefs of the movement were initially similar to those of Laestadianism, although apparently not accepted by the Laestadian community as a whole, hence Korpela's initial reaction from central Finland. Following the exile of Korpela, his two closest preachers, Sigurd Siikavaara and Arthur Niemi began to introduce the belief that a flying ark would bring 666 true believers to Palestine and that the last 1,335 days of the world had begun, one date set for the arrival of the ark that was reported by newspapers at the time was March 14, 1935. It was later taught that the ark would not be an actual physical ark, but the spirit of Christ, granted to the followers of the Korpela movement. All claims and beliefs were more or less loosely based on interpretations of an old version of the Bible, as the new translation of the Bible at the time was preached as an abomination. Following Siikavaara and Niemi's brief confinement to mental asylums the beliefs and practices changed focus; Siikavaara claimed to have been invested with the spirit of the prophets and Christ, essentially proclaiming divine status, and gave the followers of the movement forgiveness for their sins, thus enabling them to engage in swearing, drinking, gambling and hitherto-prohibited sexual rituals. Upon his arrest in 1939, Siikavaara was an alcoholic and had allegedly engaged in sexual intercourse with 30 women other than his wife. These facts have been questioned by relatives of Siikavaara who say that there actually were not any sexual rituals. Said rituals were merely rumours created by Laestadians, imagining the worst possible sins.

The freeware software can be downloaded now from: http://www.2aida.org and http://www.2aida.net as well as from numerous freeware software repositories as a non-commercial contribution to continuing diabetes education. The program, which is still being updated, has gone through a number of revisions and developments in the 16+ years since its original internet launch. During this time over 2.5 million visits have been logged at the AIDA Websites and more than 400,000 copies of the program have been downloaded, gratis (see: http://www.2aida.org/logstats). Further copies of the simulator have been made available, in the past, on diskette by the system developers and from the British Diabetic Association (BDA) ‚Äî now called 'Diabetes UK' ‚Äî London, England,Lehmann ED, Deutsch T, Broad D: AIDA: an educational simulator for insulin dosage and dietary adjustment in diabetes.

More than 1,075,000 diabetes simulations have been run via a web-based version of the AIDA diabetes simulator ‚Äî called AIDA on-line ‚Äî accessible directly at: http://www.2aida.net. The AIDA software is intended to serve as an educational support tool and can be used by anyone ‚Äî person with diabetes, relative of a patient, health care professional (doctor, nurse, clinical diabetes educator, dietician, pharmacist, etc.), or student ‚Äî even if they may have minimal knowledge of the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus.

This would send the simulated virtual person with diabetes ('Joy Wilson' [pseudonym]) markedly hyperglycemic in the afternoon (with a predicted blood glucose level of 18.8 mmol/l [338 mg/dl] at 2:30pm) ‚Äî and leave her at significant risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis.

The missed usual insulin injection is shown highlighted in yellow. Sources = http://www.2aida.org & http://www.2aida.net (Reproduced with full permission). Overview of AIDA physiological model AIDA has been described in detail in the medical / scientific / computing / diabetes literature. It incorporates a compartmental model that describes glucose-insulin interaction in people completely lacking endogenous insulin secretion ‚Äî i.e. insulin-dependent patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The AIDA model contains a single extra-cellular glucose compartment into which glucose enters via both absorption from the intestine and glucose production from the liver. The model also contains separate compartments for plasma and 'active' insulin, the latter being responsible for glycemic control while insulin is removed from the former by liver degradation. Full details of the AIDA model are accessible from within the AIDA software package, and can be viewed and printed separately via the AIDA website. Schematic summarising the anatomical basis and physiological functions of the AIDA model. Different glucose fluxes corresponding to the numbers (1 to 4) in this figure are shown. (1) glucose absorption from the gut; (2) insulin-independent glucose utilisation in the brain (central nervous system) and red blood cells; and insulin-dependent glucose utilisation in muscle and adipose tissue; (3) net hepatic glucose balance (production or utilisation of glucose by the liver); (4) renal excretion of glucose.

Sources = http://www.2aida.org & http://www.2aida.net (Reproduced with full permission). Limitations of model It is important to note that AIDA, like other model-based approaches, is not sufficiently accurate to be used for individual patient simulation or glycemic prediction. Therefore, as the program makes clear, it is not intended for insulin therapy planning and can only be used for teaching, self-learning, demonstration, or research purposes. While the AIDA software can simulate a wide variety of insulin dosage and diet (nutrition) adjustments, it should be stressed that the purpose of AIDA is to create a learning environment for communicating and training intuitive thinking when dealing with such adjustments. In this respect AIDA appears most of use for recreating clinical situations in diabetes care ‚Äî rather than trying to predict best outcome. Downloadable & on-line versions The AIDA diabetes simulator comes in two forms. (1) A downloadable (PC) version ‚Äî latest release AIDA v4.3b ‚Äî which also works on Apple Macintosh computers running PC emulation software (see http://www.2aida.org/applemac). The program is available to download for free from http://www.2aida.org/download. (2) A web-based version ‚Äî called AIDA on- line ‚Äî no download required ‚Äî available to use via a standard web browser for free at http://www.2aida.net. Use as an educational tool The AIDA software comes with forty educational case scenarios as standard, each of which represents a 'snapshot' of the metabolic status of a typical person with respect to insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes mellitus. It is easy for users to add or create further case scenarios, as required. Examples of the application of AIDA as an educational tool can be found in various published journal articles, and a full demonstration can be viewed on line at ‚Äî or downloaded without charge from ‚Äî the AIDA websites. A video which overviews a demonstration of what AIDA has to offer is freely available on YouTube, from: https://www.youtube.com/aidadiabetessoftware Example use In the example ‚Äî freely accessible at http://www.2aida.org/aida/fast-track.htm ‚Äî a woman is on three injections of short and / or intermediate acting insulin each day, with a split-evening dose. She wants to start a family, but consistently has had quite high blood glucose levels in the early afternoon, despite numerous attempts to normalise her control in anticipation of becoming pregnant. Clearly she could decrease the amount that she eats, but this would not be ideal during pregnancy. See if you can adjust her insulin doses to improve her glycemic control. For example, you could try increasing the dose of the morning insulin injection(s) because of the high blood glucose level in the afternoon, or try increasing the dose of the evening insulin injection(s) because of the relatively high blood glucose level overnight. However, you will need to be careful because you do not want to send this woman low (hypoglycemic) overnight. Simulating glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels are widely regarded as a marker of medium- term blood glucose control and are extensively applied clinically as an indicator of a person's average or integrated glycemic control over the preceding 2‚Äì3 months. Diabetologists, endocrinologists, diabetes specialist nurses and diabetes educators use assessments of HbA1c levels to confirm overall blood glucose control; this test having the advantage of not being dependent on patient self-reported blood glucose data. Since the year 2000, an estimate or simulation of HbA1c levels has been incorporated within the AIDA program. This offers people with diabetes, their relatives, students, health- care professionals and other users an indication of what the HbA1c level might be if the simulated blood glucose profile was maintained for 2‚Äì3 months. The AIDA developers stress that such HbA1c level estimations, like AIDA's main blood glucose simulations, are only intended for educational / teaching, self- learning or demonstration purposes, and not meant for individual patient prediction or therapy planning. Teaching using simulator User comments about AIDA have highlighted some of the many ways in which people have applied the simulations in their own particular situations. A great deal of attention has focused, understandably, on use by individuals with diabetes and their relatives, as well as by health-care professionals such as diabetologists / endocrinologists and diabetes educators. However, an important group of health-carers involved in the provision of day-today care for many people with diabetes are primary care physicians (general practitioners [GPs]). A workshop was held in September 2000 in Italy ‚Äî by an independent diabetologist / endocrinologist unconnected with the AIDA simulator's development ‚Äî to gain experience with application of the AIDA diabetes simulation approach as a teaching tool for general practitioners (GPs). Feedback obtained from participants attending the workshop was very positive, with GPs reporting the simulation approach to be both of interest and use. Another important group of health-carers involved in the provision of day-to-day care for many people with diabetes are nurses. A separate workshop was held in June 2001 in Italy ‚Äî by the same independent diabetologist / endocrinologist ‚Äî to gain experience with application of the AIDA diabetes simulation approach as a teaching tool for student nurses. Feedback obtained from participants attending the workshop was generally very positive, with the student nurses also reporting the simulation approach to be both of interest and of use. High-school student teaching with AIDA on-line The lifetime risk of developing diabetes for students born since the year 2000 in the United States is estimated to be 27% to 52%. Many students need to learn about diabetes for their personal care, or for the care of relatives, or desire to learn about diabetes to develop a career in healthcare. Most teenagers are adept at learning through web-based computer tools. Against this background, 21 students entering the 8th and 9th grades (aged 12 to 14 years old) enrolled in a Biotechnology Summer Camp in June 2006 ‚Äî organized independently by the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia (USA) ‚Äî focusing on diabetes mellitus. Lectures on pathophysiology and clinical aspects of diabetes were followed by simulated cases using the AIDA on-line diabetes software simulator accessed via the internet at http://www.2aida.net. Two cases demonstrated glycemic effects and pharmacokinetics of insulin administration, diet, and exercise in insulin- dependent type 1 diabetes mellitus and non-insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus. Students filled out standardized evaluations at the end of the session to assess receptiveness to this type of learning; opinions on the utility, information, and ease of use; and perceived risks of using the on- line simulator to understand diabetes. All students were receptive to this simulator-based educational approach. The majority found AIDA on-line useful (17/21 [81%]), educational (21/21 [100%]), worthy of wider distribution (20/21 [95%]), and would recommend the program to others with diabetes or wanting to learn about diabetes (18/21 [86%]). A minority (2/21 [9.5%]) found the program 'risky' regarding the information given to the students. Positive comments included the ability to visualize concepts being taught in earlier lectures, and recognized the rigors required to manage diabetes. Fewer negative comments reflected frustration with the web-based user interface, the course materials, or difficulty in achieving good simulated glycemic control. The study authors concluded that: \\"Teaching pathophysiology of diabetes and pharmacology of insulin to middle school students is enhanced with the AIDA on-line diabetes simulator. Future versions of this program, and development of similar programs, could be useful in teaching adolescents who have diabetes, and might help stimulate interested students to learn more about the care of people with diabetes\\". Randomised controlled trial (RCT) The AIDA diabetes simulator has been tested out in a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT). The protocol used for the RCT was described a priori in the medical / diabetes literature. The study sought to assess whether diabetes educational teaching sessions using the AIDA simulator led to better outcomes than similar diabetes educational teaching sessions without a computer. The study was run at the Ospedale di Marino, near Rome, in Italy by an independent diabetologist / endocrinologist ‚Äì unconnected with the simulator's development. Twenty-four volunteers (12 male and 12 female) with type 1 diabetes of more than 6-years duration, aged 19‚Äì48 years, who gave written informed consent, were randomly assigned to one of two study groups, each receiving different teaching interventions. Group A was exposed to the AIDA diabetes simulator, while Group B (the control group) received conventional lessons with slides and transparencies. Six lessons were held for each group (one per week). At the beginning and end of the study all subjects had their glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measured. The subjects also carefully documented the incidence of any symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes ('hypos'), whether mild (sweating, dizziness), moderate (nausea, vomiting), or severe (requiring assistance). The results seem encouraging. HbA1c levels in Group A dropped significantly from 7.2% to 6.4% after lessons with the diabetes simulator (p = 0.01). No significant changes in HbA1c were observed in the control group (Group B) between baseline (7.1%) and the end of the control lessons (7.0%). The number of 'hypos' decreased significantly from 31 to 14 in Group A (p = 0.03) after AIDA lessons, but did not change significantly in Group B from baseline (n = 20) to after the control lessons (n = 22). Full details of the study and the results can be found in the medical / diabetes literature. The study authors concluded that \\"larger trials involving more patients in more centres are clearly needed, but this proof-of-concept (pilot) study does demonstrate the feasibility of using a prospective randomised controlled trial approach for the evaluation of educational diabetes simulation software such as AIDA\\". Diabetes / Insulin Tutorial There is an abundance of textual / static graphical information about insulin and diabetes on the web. However an AIDA- based Diabetes / Insulin Tutorial has been developed that can be accessed for free at http://www.2aida.info. The tutorial is unusual in that ‚Äî in addition to offering textual / static graphical information about insulin and diabetes ‚Äî it is also integrated with the AIDA on-line web-based diabetes simulator at http://www.2aida.net. In this way, visitors can not only read about insulin dosage adjustment in diabetes, but also interactively simulate examples of what they are learning about. The tutorial is currently arranged in four sections: (1) Insulin-dosage adjustment, (2) Choosing the insulin dose, (3) Timing of meals & diet planning, and (4) Glucose & the kidney. Guidelines for health-carers planning to teach with AIDA An independent diabetologist / endocrinologist ‚Äî unconnected with AIDA's development ‚Äî has teamed up with one of the AIDA developers to highlight ways in which health-carer professionals may improve the outcome of lessons that make use of the simulator. Among the most important points highlighted seem to be the preparation of the teacher, consideration of how to impart preliminary information to help people understand the pathophysiology of diabetes, the optimum selection of topics to be covered, the arrangement of the lessons, how to involve each of the participants, and how to deal with questions. Other important issues include how to spot and deal with some of the difficulties that may be encountered by participants who apparently seem uninterested, obtaining feedback from the lessons, and practical ideas about how to lead a class. Guidelines for health- care professionals planning to teach with AIDA have been published in the diabetes literature. The same authors have also put together some recommended training requirements for health-carers planning to teach using the AIDA interactive educational diabetes simulator. The researchers have set out to answer possible questions from teachers using the program, highlight some minimum recommended training requirements for the software, suggest some \\"hints and tips\\" for teaching ideas, explain the importance of performing more studies / trials with the program, overview randomised controlled trial usage of the software, and highlight the importance of obtaining feedback from lesson participants. The recommendations seem to be straightforward and should help in formalising training with the program, as well as in the development of a network of teachers \\"accredited\\" to give lessons using the software. User reviews Independent user reviews of the AIDA software can be found on the Web at http://www.mendosa.com/aida.htm and http://www.2aida.net/aida/review.htm as well as in the medical / diabetes / computing literature.Tatti P (2006). \\"AIDA: Un nuovo strumento educativo per il paziente con diabete\\". In: 1st National Congress of Progetto Diabete, Genova, Italy, p.31 . The AIDA diabetes simulator has been independently selected for inclusion in the United Kingdom National Health Service National Library for Health Diabetes Specialist Library list of Web resources. Non- insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus The current releases of the downloadable AIDA software, and AIDA on-line, do not incorporate functions to model endogenous insulin secretion ‚Äî which takes place in people with non- insulin dependent diabetes mellitus type 2, and healthy subjects without diabetes. Nevertheless, a wide number of people with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes mellitus have reported finding the AIDA diabetes simulator of use for learning about balancing insulin and diet in diabetes. This is because many of the principles of insulin dosage adjustment are remarkably similar in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and even without an endogenous insulin secretion model function, AIDA still can offer realistic simulations (from an educational perspective) for people with non-insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus. The AIDA developers have published a research paper in 2011 which includes reference to the incorporation of a dedicated function for pancreatic insulin secretion ‚Äî to be added to a future release of the simulator. Further developments Given the widespread usage of the AIDA diabetes simulation software, there has been considerable interest worldwide in updates to the program. Work has been reported in the scientific literature into the incorporation of lispro (Humalog)-like rapidly acting insulin analogues, and the glargine (Lantus) very long-acting insulin analogue, into the freeware diabetes simulator. Further information can be found in the medical / scientific literature. A beta release of AIDA [v4.5c (beta)] incorporating lispro, regular, NPH and glargine insulins is available for download from the AIDA website at http://www.2aida.org/download. AIDA v4.5c (beta) is still undergoing testing / further development but has been available without charge from the AIDA website since 2012. Research use Separate from its utility as an educational, self-learning, or teaching tool for people with diabetes and their relatives / carers, students and health- care professionals ‚Äî various research groups around the world have found the freeware AIDA diabetes simulator of use as a way of generating large quantities of realistic blood glucose data for developing and testing out their own diabetes computing prototypes (e.g. for training artificial neural networks, or other decision support research prototypes). Various published examples of this research approach can be found at http://www.2aida.org/research2 or in the scientific literature. Staying informed The AIDA diabetes software simulator developers have set up a very low volume announcement list so that users can be kept informed about new developments with the software. Users can register by sending a blank email to subscribe {at} 2aida {dot} org or by visiting http://www.2aida.org/register. More recently a new Facebook page has been set up ‚Äî at https://www.facebook.com/www.2aida.org ‚Äî to communicate information about the latest releases of AIDA. Also it is possible to follow the AIDA diabetes simulator on Twitter ‚Äî at https://www.twitter.com/aida_diabetes ‚Äî or @aida_diabetes Appendix: Download surveys / evaluations The AIDA developers have undertaken a range of surveys and evaluations of usage of the AIDA diabetes simulator ‚Äî to better understand who is downloading the program, and why. One initial study analysed data from 1,360 downloads of the AIDA software. The intended goals of the survey were: (i) to establish the feasibility of using the Internet for auditing and surveying diabetes software users; (ii) to identify the proportion of people with diabetes and their relatives who are actually making use of the program; and (iii) to establish certain technical details about downloaders' computer setups to facilitate the distribution of upgrades to the software. 1,360 responses were received over an 8-month period (from November 1999 to July 2000). During the corresponding period 3,821 actual downloads of the software were independently logged at the Website ‚Äî giving a response rate to this survey of 35.6%. Responses were received from participants in 67 countries ‚Äî although over half of these (n=730, 54%) originated from the USA and UK. 762 responses (56%) were received from people with diabetes and 184 (13.5%) from relatives of patients, with lesser numbers from doctors, students, diabetes educators, nurses, pharmacists, and other end users. Useful technical information about computers and operating systems being used were also obtained. The initial study established the feasibility of using the Internet to survey, at no real cost, a large number of medical software downloaders / users. In addition it yielded interesting data in terms of who are the main downloaders of the AIDA program, and has also provided technical (computer) information which aided the release of a freeware upgrade to the software. A second study audited 2,437 separate downloads of the AIDA program. The Internet-based survey methodology was confirmed to be robust and reliable. Over a 7.5-month period (from mid-July 2000 to early March 2001) 2,437 responses were received. During the corresponding period 4,100 actual downloads of the software were independently logged via the same route at the AIDA Website ‚Äî giving a response rate to this audit of 59.4%. Responses were received from participants in 61 countries ‚Äî although over half of these (n 5 1,533; 62.9%) originated from the United States and United Kingdom. Of these responses 1,361 (55.8%) were received from people with diabetes and 303 (12.4%) from relatives of patients, with fewer responses from doctors, diabetes educators, students, nurses, pharmacists, and other end users. This study has confirmed the feasibility of using the Internet to survey, at no real cost, a large number of medical software downloaders / users. In addition, it yielded up-to-date and interesting data about who are the main downloaders of the AIDA program. A third study surveyed downloaders of a more recent release of the program (AIDA v4.3a). Over a 1-year period (from March 2001 to February 2002) in total 3,864 responses were received. During the corresponding period some 8,578 actual downloads of the software were independently logged via the same route at the AIDA Website, giving a response rate for this survey of 45%. Responses were received from participants in 66 countries ‚Äî over half of these (n=2,137; 55.3%) were from the United States and the United Kingdom. There were 2,318 responses (60.0%) received from people with diabetes and 443 (11.5%) from relatives of patients, with fewer responses from doctors, students, diabetes educators, nurses, pharmacists, and other end users. The authors concluded that the study highlighted \\"considerable interest amongst patients and their relatives to learn more about balancing insulin and diet in diabetes, as well as possibly to get more involved in self-management of insulin dosages. More computer applications that can cater for this interest in diabetes patient self-care need to be developed and made available. The Internet provides an ideal medium for the distribution of such educational tools\\".

The defensive force rose from those villages and gathered at the fortress, some preparing an ambush halfway up the hill. Gam≈ç and Tsutsui launched their assault at night, pressing up the hill and meeting fierce resistance before being pushed back entirely by the ambush. The defenders threw rocks and even trees, and fired muskets from the castle. Several nights later, the garrison launched a secret attack of their own on the enemy camp at Nagaokayama. Approaching from three directions, they lit torches upon a signal and closed in. Tsutsui's forces were alarmed and confused, and began firing arrows in every direction. Shortly, however, the torches were blown out by a fierce wind, and the battle was plunged into darkness. The garrison's warriors allegedly used passwords to help them determine friend from foe, while their foes killed many of their own in the confusion. Despite this assault, the fortress was still under siege, badly outnumbered, and running out of food. When Gam≈ç and Tsutsui attacked the fortress once more, they found the weather to be perfect for setting the entire complex ablaze.

It was a milestone in electrical engineering and in the formation of the United States of America. It served as the only method of near-instantaneous communication between the east and west coasts during the 1860s. In 1841, it had taken 110 days for the news of the death of President William Henry Harrison to reach Los Angeles. Background After the development of efficient telegraph systems in the 1830s, their use saw almost explosive growth in the 1840s. Samuel Morse's first experimental line between Washington, D.C. and Baltimore‚Äîthe Baltimore-Washington telegraph line‚Äîwas demonstrated on May 24, 1844. By 1850 there were lines covering most of the eastern states, and a separate network of lines was soon constructed in the booming economy of California. California was admitted to the United States in 1850, the first state on the Pacific coast. Major efforts ensued to integrate California with the other states, including sea, overland mail pioneered by George Chorpenning, the Pony Express, and passenger services such as Butterfield Overland Mail. Proposals for the subsidy of a telegraph line to California were made in Congress throughout the 1850s, and in 1860 the U.S. Post Office was authorized to spend $40,000 per year to build and maintain an overland line. The year before, the California State Legislature had authorized a similar subsidy of $6,000 per year. Construction Construction of the first transcontinental telegraph was the work of Western Union, which Hiram Sibley and Ezra Cornell had established in 1856 by merging companies operating east of the Mississippi River. A second significant step was the passing of the Telegraph Act by the Congress in 1860, which authorized the government to open bids for the construction of a telegraph line between Missouri and California and regulated the service to be provided. Eventually, the only bidder would be Sibley, because all competitors‚ÄîTheodore Adams, Benjamin Ficklin and John Harmon‚Äîwithdrew at the last minute. Later they joined Sibley in his effort. Similar to the First Transcontinental Railroad, elimination of the gap in the telegraph service between Fort Kearny in Nebraska and Fort Churchill in Nevada was planned to be divided between teams that would be advancing the construction in opposite directions. The Pacific Telegraph Company would build west from Nebraska and the Overland Telegraph Company would build east from Nevada's connection to the California system. James Gamble, an experienced telegraph builder in California, was put in charge of the western crew, and Edward Creighton was responsible for the eastern crew. From Salt Lake City, a crew in charge of James Street advanced westward, and W.H. Stebbins's grew eastward toward Fort Kearny. Creighton's crew erected its first pole on 4 July 1861. When the project was completed in October 1861, they had planted 27,500 poles holding of single-strand iron wire over a terrain that was not always inviting. California Chief Justice Stephen Field sent one of the first messages from San Francisco to Abraham Lincoln, using the occasion to assure the president of California's allegiance to the Union. Note that the construction took place while Civil War fighting was taking place to the southeast. The entire cost of the system was half a million dollars. Route of the first transcontinental telegraph Operation Difficulties did not stop with the completion of the project. Keeping it in operation faced multiple problems: (a) inclement weather in the form of lightning bolts, strong winds, and heavy snow damaged both poles and the wire; (b) rubbing on the poles by bison from time to time sent down sections of the telegraph, eventually contributing to their demise; (c) the system had to be rerouted through Chicago to avoid Confederate attempts to cut the line in Missouri to disrupt communications among Union forces; (d) Native Americans soon started to do the same farther west as part of their hostilities with the Army. Financially, the First Transcontinental Telegraph was a big success from the beginning. The charge during the first week of operation was a dollar a word, which was higher than the 30 cents specified by the Telegraph Act of 1860. The telegraph line immediately made the Pony Express obsolete, which officially ceased operations two days later. The overland telegraph line was operated until 1869, when it was replaced by a multi-line telegraph that had been constructed alongside the route of the First Transcontinental Railroad.

In September 2008 Hall for Cornwall produced a production of The Jew of Malta by Christopher Marlowe: Barabas, which featured a Cornish, national and international cast. With Barabas, Hall for Cornwall returned to the theme of working with a Renaissance text, and followed on from the successful production of Responses in 2007. The Hall for Cornwall is one of a number of organisations involved with Cornwall Council's proposed National Theatre of Cornwall, and it registered the name as a trademark in September 2011. Since June 2018 the Hall for Cornwall is currently closed for refurbishment. The project involves creating a larger auditorium with 1,354 seats. There will also be a new digital creative business hub funded by the European Development Fund and Cornwall & Isles of Scilly Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP). Reopening is scheduled for 2020. History The hall was built in 1846 from Carn Brea granite and originally housed the town hall, magistrates and stannary courts, police offices, cells and the fire brigade. In 1909 plans were drawn up to change the building into a public hall. This culminated in it being leased for a skating rink and occasional picture house. In 1914 a fire gutted most of the building and in 1925 remodelling took place to accommodate a stage \\"suitable for the presentation of plays\\". It was used in the 1970s and early 1980s as a venue for Truro's 'flea market'. By the mid 1980s, Carrick District Council considered selling City Hall for redevelopment. Ben Luxon, Chris Warner and some Carrick councillors met to discuss the hall's future. Carrick offered a 125-year lease on the hall at ¬£1 a year and ¬£500,000. The group accepted the offer and the campaign for a new City Hall began. Five years after taking over, contractors moved in. Work on the high tech venue took just over 18 months and the inaugural performance took place on 15 November 1997. Simon Harvey directed the Christmas show for Hall for Cornwall in 2015 and 2016.

He is also the author of the 2009 book Obstacles Welcome: How to Turn Adversity to Advantage in Business and Life. Ralph de la Vega retired December 31, 2016, after a 42-year career with AT&T.; Early life and education Ralph de la Vega was born in Cuba, and emigrated to the United States in 1962, at the age of ten. In an effort to flee the Castro dictatorship in that country, his family attempted to board a plane to Miami; however the border official stated that only Ralph's papers were in order. He was sent to the US alone, where he stayed with the friend of an aunt. It took four years for his parents to join him. Once his parents arrived, de la Vega took an after-school job sweeping the floors of a garment factory to help support the family. He was then promoted, and started making money selling the clothing made by the company. De la Vega eventually enrolled in a pre-engineering curriculum at Miami Dade College, and worked part-time as a draftsman at an engineering firm. He then received his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Florida Atlantic University. He later received an MBA from Northern Illinois University. He also completed the Executive Program at the University of Virginia and received an honorary doctorate from Florida Atlantic. BellSouth De la Vega started his career in 1974 with BellSouth (then Southern Bell) as a management assistant. Over the years he held positions in Network Planning, Consumer Services, Engineering, and DSL and Operations. In 1985 he became a director at the Bell's Communications Research Technical Education Center (Bellcore TEC). He was later made responsible for all BellSouth Telecommunications Network Operations in Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. Afterwards he became the president of BellSouth Broadband Internet Services. De la Vega eventually became the president of BellSouth Latin America, a role he held from 2002 to 2003. In this job he was in charge of the wireless subsidiaries in eleven countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The CEOs of each company reported to de la Vega, who restructured the decision-making infrastructure of the group in order to create cooperative strategies and policies between the different firms. At the end of his first year as president, BellSouth Latin America turned a profit for the first time. AT&T; De la Vega served as the chief operating officer of Cingular Wireless, starting in 2004. In 2007 Cingular was acquired by SBC (itself later renamed AT&T;), and he was named CEO of AT&T; Mobility. De la Vega was one of the leaders of the merger. At AT&T; de la Vega formed relationships between the company's mobile unit and automobile manufacturers, including General Motors, in order to grow the company's market for car connectivity. He also pushed for promotions intended to draw subscribers away from AT&T;'s competitors. He also brought the iPhone to the company. De la Vega was the CEO of AT&T; Mobility until 2014, when he was promoted to president and CEO of AT&T;'s combined Mobile & Business Solutions group. One of the main goals of de la Vega in this position is to develop AT&T;'s role in the Internet of Things and to deliver integrated services to business customers. In 2016 he became the Vice Chairman of AT&T; Inc. and CEO of AT&T; Business Solutions and AT&T; International. Ralph De la Vega retired from this position on 31 December 2016. Obstacles Welcome In 2009 de la Vega coauthored the book Obstacles Welcome: How to Turn Adversity to Advantage in Business and Life, with Paul Brown. De la Vega decided to write the work due to the response he was receiving after the speeches he delivered at speaking engagements. The goal of the book was to provide career and life advice to youth and young professionals.http://www.leadersmag.com/issues/2010.2_Apr/PDFs/delaVega.pdf The book contains \\"four pillars of success\\" and \\"six pivotal points\\" in which he uses his personal story to structure his advice.

He is a professor of mind/body medicine at Harvard Medical School and director emeritus of the Benson-Henry Institute (BHI) at MGH. He is a founding trustee of The American Institute of Stress. He has contributed more than 190 scientific publications and 12 books. More than five million copies of his books have been printed in different languages. Started in 1998, Benson became the leader of the so-called \\"Great Prayer Experiment,\\" or technically the \\"Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer (STEP).\\" The result published in 2006 concluded that intercessory prayer has no beneficial effect on patients with coronary artery bypass graft surgery. He, however, still believes that prayer has positive health benefits. Benson coined relaxation response (and wrote a book by the same title) as a scientific term for meditation, and he used it to describe the ability of the body to stimulate relaxation of muscle and organs.  Biography  Benson was born in Yonkers, New York. He graduated with B.A. in biology from Wesleyan University in 1957. He entered a medical course at Harvard Medical School and earned his MD degree in 1961. He continued postdoctoral programs at King County Hospital, Seattle; University Hospital, University of Washington, Seattle; National Heart Institute, Bethesda; University of Puerto Rico; and Thorndike Memorial Laboratory, Boston City Hospital. In 1969 he was appointed instructor in physiology and later instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School. He was promoted to assistant professor of medicine the next year. From 1972 he became associate professor. He was appointed associate professor at the Beth Israel Hospital in 1977, the post he held until 1987. Then he returned to the medical faculty at Harvard. With the establishment of Mind/Body Medical Institute at Harvard in 1992, he became associate professor, and is now full professor. He is a practicing physician at Beth Israel Hospital since 1974. Between 1990 and 1997 he was lecturer in medicine and religion at Andover Newton Theological School, Newton Centre. Benson became founding president of the Mind/Body Medical Institute of Harvard Medical School in 1988. He founded the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine of the Massachusetts General Hospital in 2006, where he became its director.  Notable projects   Mind body medicine  In the 1960s at Harvard Medical School,Massachusetts General Hospital, Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine, https://www.bensonhenryinstitute.org/about/mission-and-history Benson has pioneered mind-body research, focusing on stress and the relaxation response in medicine. In his research, the mind and body are one system, in which meditation can play a significant role in reducing stress responses. He continues to pioneer medical research into bodymind questions. He introduced the term relaxation response as a scientific alternative for meditation. According to him, relaxation response is the ability of the body to induce decreased activity of muscle and organs. It is an opposite reaction to the fight-or-flight response. With Robert Keith Wallace, he observed that relaxation response reduced metabolism, rate of breathing, heart rate, and brain activity.  Intercessory prayer  In 1998, Benson started a research project on the efficacy of prayer among patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The project, funded by the John Templeton Foundation, was explicit that its objective was not to prove or disprove the existence of God. This \\"Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer (STEP)\\" became popularly known as the \\"Great Prayer Experiment\\" and was described as \\"the most intense investigation ever undertaken of whether prayer can help to heal illness.\\" The trial attempted to differentiate among outcomes in three groups of patients: (1) those uncertain of whether they were being prayed for, who were; (2) those uncertain of whether they were being prayed for, who were not; and (3) those being prayed for who were certain of it. The conclusion, published in 2006, was that intercessory prayer has no beneficial effect on CABG patients. Indeed, certainty of receiving intercessory prayer was actually associated with a higher incidence of complications.  Personal life  Benson married Marilyn Benson, and they have two children, Jennifer and Gregory.

Common names include vine-like moonlight cactus and spiny moon cereus. Its specific name, spinulosus, means \\"with small spines\\" in Latin. History This was the third species of Selenicereus to be discovered. It was originally collected by Thomas Coulter in 1827, in Mexico, but no locality is known. Pyramus de Candolle received the plant in Paris and described it without knowing its flowers. He later sent cuttings to Berlin where it flowered the first time in 1842. Range and habitat This species is found in eastern Mexico from Tamaulipas to Chiapas. Plants were collected from the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas in the United States, but this population may have been extirpated as it has not been seen outside of cultivation in some time. Systematics Selenicereus spinulosus is a very variable species, especially in flower size, which vary from 7‚Äì15 cm long. It is most closely related to Selenicereus atropilosus and Selenicereus vagans. Description Stems scandent, clambering or sprawling, branching, producing aerial roots, stiff, to 1-2(-5) m long, 2‚Äì3 cm thick; ribs 4-6 or more, later terete, acute; areoles 1,5‚Äì2 mm on √ò, reddish brown at first, later greyish brown, internodes 1,5-2,5 cm; spines 6-8, 1 mm long, acicular, white or yellowish, later blackish, radial spines 5-6 central spines 1-2, basally 0,25 mm in √ò above the swollen bases, apically attenuate-conical, circular in cross section, the bulbous bases 0,5 mm in √ò, hairlike spines none; epidermis light green, somewhat shining. Flowers produced from areoles near tip, 8‚Äì14 cm long, 7-8,5 cm in √ò, nocturnal but stays open for 2 2‚Äì3 days (John Ellis, UK), tepals rotate; pericarpel covered with spines, but no hairs, bracteoles small, triangular, reddish; receptacle ca 5 cm long, green, with clusters of 7-12 spines, 4‚Äì5 mm long, brownish, but no hairs; outer tepals 5,5‚Äì6 cm, narrowly oblong, acute, brownish; inner tepals 7,5 cm, 11 mm wide, narrowly oblong, acute, white, sometimes with pink base or pinkish throughout; stamens white, much shorter than inner tepals; style yellow, stigma lobes 9-11. Fruit globular, yellow, covered densely with yellowish spines. Cultivation Plants ca 1 m long are capable of flowering. Give half-shade or full sun, and grow in a compost containing plenty of peat. During the growing period this plant needs ample water and regular doses of fertilizer. Fast growing and free flowering. Can be kept at 5 ¬∞C (41 ¬∞F) during winter, if kept dry. It is the easiest species to bring to flower in cultivation. Hybrids *'Pimiento' (Raised by Sherman E.

Motivation The American Mathematical Society sponsored a 1974 meeting to evaluate the resolution and consequences of the 23 problems Hilbert proposed in 1900. An outcome of that meeting was a new list of mathematical problems, the first of which, due to Manin (1976, p. 36), questioned whether classical set theory was an adequate paradigm for treating collections of indistinguishable elementary particles in quantum mechanics. He suggested that such collections cannot be sets in the usual sense, and that the study of such collections required a \\"new language\\". The use of the term quasi-set follows a suggestion in da Costa's 1980 monograph Ensaio sobre os Fundamentos da L√≥gica (see da Costa and Krause 1994), in which he explored possible semantics for what he called \\"Schr√∂dinger Logics\\". In these logics, the concept of identity is restricted to some objects of the domain, and has motivation in Schr√∂dinger's claim that the concept of identity does not make sense for elementary particles (Schr√∂dinger 1952). Thus in order to provide a semantics that fits the logic, da Costa submitted that \\"a theory of quasi-sets should be developed\\", encompassing \\"standard sets\\" as particular cases, yet da Costa did not develop this theory in any concrete way. To the same end and independently of da Costa, Dalla Chiara and di Francia (1993) proposed a theory of quasets to enable a semantic treatment of the language of microphysics. The first quasi-set theory was proposed by D. Krause in his PhD thesis, in 1990 (see Krause 1992). A related physics theory, based on the logic of adding fundamental indistinguishability to equality and inequality, was developed and elaborated independently in the book The Theory of Indistinguishables by A. F. Parker-Rhodes.A. F. Parker-Rhodes, The Theory of Indistinguishables: A Search for Explanatory Principles below the level of Physics, Reidel (Springer), Dordecht (1981). On the use of quasi-sets in philosophical discussions of quantum identity and individuality, see French (2006) and French and Krause (2006). On Schr√∂dinger logics, see da Costa and Krause (1994, 1997), and French and Krause (2006). Outline of the theory We now expound Krause's (1992) axiomatic theory \\\\mathfrak{Q}, the first quasi- set theory; other formulations and improvements have since appeared. For an updated paper on the subject, see French and Krause (2010). Krause builds on the set theory ZFU, consisting of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with an ontology extended to include two kinds of urelements: *m-atoms, whose intended interpretation is elementary quantum particles; *M-atoms, macroscopic objects to which classical logic is assumed to apply. Quasi-sets (q-sets) are collections resulting from applying axioms, very similar to those for ZFU, to a basic domain composed of m-atoms, M-atoms, and aggregates of these. The axioms of \\\\mathfrak{Q} include equivalents of extensionality, but in a weaker form, termed \\"weak extensionality axiom\\"; axioms asserting the existence of the empty set, unordered pair, union set, and power set; Separation; the image of a q-set under a q-function is also a q-set; q-set equivalents of Infinity, Regularity, and Choice. Q-set theories based on other set-theoretical frameworks are, of course, possible. \\\\mathfrak{Q} has a primitive concept of quasi-cardinal, governed by eight additional axioms, intuitively standing for the quantity of objects in a collection. The quasi-cardinal of a quasi-set is not defined in the usual sense (by means of ordinals) because the m-atoms are assumed (absolutely) indistinguishable. Furthermore, it is possible to define a translation from the language of ZFU into the language of \\\\mathfrak{Q} in such a way so that there is a 'copy' of ZFU in \\\\mathfrak{Q}. In this copy, all the usual mathematical concepts can be defined, and the 'sets' (in reality, the '\\\\mathfrak{Q}-sets') turn out to be those q-sets whose transitive closure contains no m-atoms. In \\\\mathfrak{Q} there may exist q-sets, called \\"pure\\" q-sets, whose elements are all m-atoms, and the axiomatics of \\\\mathfrak{Q} provides the grounds for saying that nothing in \\\\mathfrak{Q} distinguishes the elements of a pure q-set from one another, for certain pure q-sets. Within the theory, the idea that there is more than one entity in x is expressed by an axiom which states that the quasi-cardinal of the power quasi-set of x has quasi-cardinal 2qc(x), where qc(x) is the quasi-cardinal of x (which is a cardinal obtained in the 'copy' of ZFU just mentioned). What exactly does this mean? Consider the level 2p of a sodium atom, in which there are six indiscernible electrons. Even so, physicists reason as if there are in fact six entities in that level, and not only one. In this way, by saying that the quasi-cardinal of the power quasi-set of x is 2qc(x) (suppose that qc(x) = 6 to follow the example), we are not excluding the hypothesis that there can exist six subquasi-sets of x which are 'singletons', although we cannot distinguish among them. Whether there are or not six elements in x is something which cannot be ascribed by the theory (although the notion is compatible with the theory). If the theory could answer this question, the elements of x would be individualized and hence counted, contradicting the basic assumption that they cannot be distinguished. In other words, we may consistently (within the axiomatics of \\\\mathfrak{Q}) reason as if there are six entities in x, but x must be regarded as a collection whose elements cannot be discerned as individuals. Using quasi-set theory, we can express some facts of quantum physics without introducing symmetry conditions (Krause et al. 1999, 2005). As is well known, in order to express indistinguishability, the particles are deemed to be individuals, say by attaching them to coordinates or to adequate functions/vectors like |œà>. Thus, given two quantum systems labeled |œà1> and |œà2> at the outset, we need to consider a function like |œà12> = |œà1>|œà2> ¬± |œà2>|œà1> (except for certain constants), which keep the quanta indistinguishable by permutations; the probability density of the joint system independs on which is quanta #1 and which is quanta #2.

It lies on Inis M√≥r, at the edge of a cliff. A popular tourist attraction, D√∫n Aonghasa is an important archaeological site. History It is not known exactly when D√∫n Aonghasa was built, though it is now thought that most of the structures date from the Bronze Age and Iron Age.New Oxford History of Ireland T. F. O'Rahilly surmised in what is known as O'Rahilly's historical model that it was built in the 2nd century BC by the Builg following the Laginian conquest of Connacht. Excavations at the site indicate that the first construction goes back to 1100 BC, when the first enclosure was erected by piling rubble against large upright stones. Around 500 BC, the triple wall defences were probably built along the western side of the fort.http://heritagecouncil.ie/unpublished_excavations/section11.html The 19th-century artist George Petrie called \\"D√∫n Aonghasa\\" \\"the most magnificent barbaric monument in Europe\\".George Petrie Its name, meaning \\"Fort of Aonghas\\", may refer to the pre-Christian god of the same name described in Irish mythology, or the mythical king, Aonghus mac √ömh√≥r. It has thus traditionally been associated with the Fir Bolg. Form and function The fort consists of a series of four concentric walls of dry stone construction, built on a high cliff some one hundred metres above the sea. At the time of its construction sea levels were considerably lower and a recent Radio Telefis Eireann documentary estimates that originally it was 1000 metres from the sea. Surviving stonework is four metres wide at some points. The original shape was presumably oval or D-shaped but parts of the cliff and fort have since collapsed into the sea. Outside the third ring of walls lies a defensive system of stone slabs, known as a cheval de frise, planted in an upright position in the ground and still largely well-preserved. These ruins also feature a huge rectangular stone slab, the function of which is unknown. Impressively large among prehistoric ruins, the outermost wall of D√∫n Aonghasa encloses an area of approximately 6 hectares (14 acres). Today The walls of D√∫n Aonghasa have been rebuilt to a height of 6m and have wall walks, chambers, and flights of stairs. The restoration is easily distinguished from the original construction by the use of mortar. There is a small museum illustrating the history of the fort and its possible functions. Also in the vicinity is a Neolithic tomb and a small heritage park featuring examples of a traditional thatched cottage and an illegal poteen distillery. Nearby sites D√∫n D√∫chathair (\\"Black Stone Ringfort\\"), D√∫n Eoghanachta (\\"Fort of the E√≥ganachta\\"), and D√∫n Eochla are similar prehistoric sites on Inis M√≥r.

He was also a Holocaust denier. Military service At the start of World War II he joined the British Army. As a sergeant in the Gloucestershire Regiment, he was captured in the Battle of Dunkirk in 1940, later being awarded the Military Medal for bravery during this campaign.London Gazette 25 September 1947 During his four years as a prisoner of war, he made no fewer than ten escape attempts. He was able to escape from a German POW camp in Silesia and stealthily made his way to Hungary. After being captured there, he made another daring escape, this time making his way to Romania. There he was imprisoned once again, but when Romania capitulated in 1944, he was freed and returned to Britain, serving in combat with British forces in northwest Europe during the war's final months.Ex-columnist Doug Collins dead at 81, North Shore News, 3 Oct 2001 The exact nature of his exploits while a POW have not been without controversy, however, with some questioning the veracity of his numerous escapes from Nazi-controlled prisons.Explain War Exploits, North Shore News, 12 May 1997 From 1946-1950, Collins worked as a political intelligence officer with the British Control Commission's de- nazification department in Germany. Journalist Collins emigrated to Canada in 1952 and worked for several decades as a reporter or columnist for several Western Canadian newspapers including the Calgary Herald, Vancouver Sun and Vancouver Province.Robert Fulford column, National Post, 3 November 2001 In November, 1953, Collins, while working for the Calgary Herald, exposed George Dupre's claims of being a war-time spy as a hoax.The Man Who Talked, Time magazine, 23 Nov. 1953 The disclosure came soon after publication of The Man Who Wouldn't Talk, a book about Dupre by American journalist, Quentin Reynolds.Mitgang, H.; Quiet Hero; The Man Who Wouldn't Talk; New York Times, 1 Nov. 1953 The following spring, in 1954, Collins testified on behalf of Westbrook Pegler in the case of Reynolds v. Pegler, a defamation case arising from comments written in 1949 by Pegler against Reynolds. Collins gave evidence as to Reynolds reputation as a writer, arising from Reynold's book about Dupre. Reynold's counsel, Louis Nizer, attacked Collins's credibility during cross examination for his failure to give credit to other sources of evidence that exposed Dupre. Another witness from Calgary felt compelled to testify on behalf of Reynolds to counter Collins testimony.Nizer, L., My Life in Court, New York, Doubleday & Co., 1961, pp. 104 - 110 In 1960 eight trade unions sued Collins for libel when he was the Vancouver Sun's labour reporter. The same year, the newspaper's managing editor, Erwin Swangard, fired Collins for doing outside freelance work. Collins successfully sued for wrongful dismissal. He was reinstated and returned to work after four months. He collected his back pay, walked into the editor's office and quit and then went to personnel to demand holiday pay. In 1963, he sued Reader's Digest for libel and won. Collins returned to the Sun in the 1970s. He quit for the last time when then-publisher Clark Davey tried to restrict his freelancing.Boyd, D., Doug Collins' hide up for grabs again, so what else is new? Vancouver Sun, 27 May 1992, pg.

(Coupland, D. 2005, \\"Terry\\") Since last leaving The Sun, Collins also worked for the Vancouver Courier, the Columbian (a newspaper formerly published in New Westminster, B.C.), and CKVU-TV. Between 1983 and 1997, Collins wrote a column for the North Shore News, a small weekly community paper in North Vancouver, B.C. Awards Collins was the recipient of two awards for journalism. He received the National Newspaper Award (1953) for his report on Dupre. He received the MacMillan Bloedel Award (1975) for reports on alleged corruption at UBC. In 1993 he was awarded the 125th Anniversary of the Confederation of Canada Medal, given to approximately 42,000 Canadians \\"who have made a significant contribution to their fellow citizens, their community, or to Canada.\\" Politics Collins was acclaimed on 18 October 1988, as the Reform Party of Canada's candidate for the Capilano‚ÄîHowe Sound riding in the 1988 federal election. The party leader, Preston Manning, had vowed not to sign Collins' nomination papers unless he first agreed to sign a pledge that he supported the party's position against racism. Collins refused to sign the pledge.Bellett, G., Collins nomination defies Reform Party leader, Vancouver Sun, 19 Oct 1988. pg.

A1 Accusations of racism and antisemitism During his 14-year association with the North Shore News, Collins, who was also a naturalized Canadian who had come to Canada as an immigrant, wrote regular columns against immigration and ethnic minorities in Canada. His writings became increasingly controversial and led to accusations of racism and antisemitism. In 1997, a complaint against him was brought before the British Columbia Human Rights Commission for a column in which Collins questioned the Holocaust and denounced Schindler's List, which he derided as \\"Swindler's List,\\" as propaganda. The case was dismissed. A further complaint was laid in 1999 citing four of his columns, including the column raised in the previous complaint. This one was upheld, and Collins and his publisher were ordered to pay $2,000 in damages.Abrams v.

Early life  Nils Oliveto grew up on the South Shore of Montreal. He was actively involved in theatre and improvisation, but his passion was into sports, where he played volleyball and soccer at Royal George High School in Greenfield Park. At 16, he began training seriously as a track and field athlete, and started getting national attention in both the discus and the hammer throw. After graduating from Royal George as the co-president of the Student Council and winning the Athlete of the Year award, he attended Champlain College Saint-Lambert under the tutor of former Czechoslovakian weight-lifting Olympic coach Dr. Emil Muller. In 1993, he earned a spot on the Canadian Jr. National Track and Field Team as a hammer thrower. After completing a degree in Pure and Applied Science in 1995 from Champlain College, Oliveto was offered a track scholarship at the University of Oklahoma. From 1995 to 2000, Oliveto traveled all over North-America, Europe, and Africa, competing in major championships like the Canada Games, the Jeux de la Francophonie, and the Olympic Trials. He graduated with both a Bachelor of Science degree (Health and Sports Science, 1998) and a Master of Science degree (Exercise Physiology and Human Performance, 2000) with a thesis research in performance periodization from OU. He was the University of Oklahoma record holder in the hammer throw, and is still the current all-time powerlifting record holder at Champlain College.  Acting / Filmmaking  The acting bug hit Nils when he was encouraged by a former drama high school teacher to pursue acting professionally. While in Oklahoma, he started studying acting and screenwriting with the OU Film Department, and later began working on local TV projects in Oklahoma City and Tulsa. In 2000, Nils moved to Los Angeles, where he jumped into the big leagues. He continued studying his craft in Burbank, California with top TV and film actors. Nils is first and foremost a keen observer of human nature. Involved in several projects such as scientific articles dealing with periodization in exercise physiology, physical education teaching, applied kinesiology in clinical osteopathy, and stress management / visualization / autogenic training for high performance, this artist-scientist brings an unconventional and thoughtful light to the actor‚Äôs job. These thoughts are therefore reflected in his approach to the stage, which is always rich and consistent. Through his production company HAMMERMAN FILMS, Nils produced, wrote, directed and starred in \\"The Cedar's Tears\\" (2010), a mystery thriller shot in Lebanon, Europe and Canada. The film was screened in North America, Europe, South Africa and Asia, with awards/nominations in Los Angeles, Ireland and Mexico film festivals. Nils Oliveto's second feature film, Duplicando premiered in Los Angeles at the Action on Film International Film Festival (AOF) in August 2012. Exploring a \\"full narrative storytelling spectrum\\"; this drama genre gradually spins into an out-of-control absurd comedy flick. Nils received a nomination for best editing at the AOF 2012. The feature-film \\"For the Love of Poe\\" premiered in Montreal at the Festival des Films du Monde (Montreal World Film Festival) in August 2014. This project, with two separate original versions (English and French), tells the story of an ex-convict and a beloved fan of Edgar Allan Poe who is commissioned by a world-class smuggler to find three artifacts with supposedly supernatural powers dating back from Francisco Pizarro's conquest of the Incas in the 1500s. It was produced, written, directed by Nils Oliveto. He also played the lead character. In August 2017, Nils premiered Objects in Mirror are Closer than they Appear at Cinema Imperial in Montreal. It tells the story of a man attempts to free himself from a fragile emotional state after being dumped at the altar by his fianc√©e on his wedding day. Inspired by the long takes of legendary European director Chantal Akerman as well as the tatami shot of Japanese master Yasujiro Ozu, Oliveto's minimalist experimental contemplative cinema style seeks to explore the human emotion on an alienated character through unorthodox cinematic means. Nils Oliveto presented his first documentary feature in Montreal on September 2018. Icelander tells the story of a son looking for his father 20 years after his unexplained disappearance. It won 2nd prize in the Documentary of the World competition at the Montreal World Film Festival (FFM).  TV/Radio broadcasting  Nils Oliveto joined Radio- Canada Sport (French CBC) in 2017 as an Olympic sports analyst in track & field and winter sliding events (bobsleigh, luge, skeleton). He covered the 2017 World Bobsleigh Championships (K√∂nigssee, Germany), the 2017 World Championships of Athletics (London, U.K.), the 2018 Winter Olympic Games (Pyeongchang, Korea) and the 2019 World Championships of Athletics (Doha, Qatar). He also periodically does radio shows discussing human performance and sports.

The film's screenplay, based upon the life of magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, is by Philip Yordan, based on the book Houdini by Harold Kellock. The film's music score was by Roy Webb and the cinematography by Ernest Laszlo. The art direction was by Albert Nozaki and Hal Pereira and the costume design by Edith Head. The film's storyline is a fictionalized account of Houdini's life. It details his beginnings as a carnival performer, worker in a safe factory, up through his international success as a world-renowned escape artist and stage magician. Following the death of his mother, he exposes various fraudulent mediums in the spiritualist movement, while always hoping to make contact with her. The film also follows his love for his wife Bess Houdini and his most dangerous stunts and stage illusions. Plot In the 1890s, young Harry Houdini (Tony Curtis) is performing with a Coney Island carnival as Bruto, the Wild Man, when Bess (Janet Leigh), a naive onlooker, tries to protect him from the blows of Schultz (Sig Ruman), his \\"trainer.\\" Harry then appears as magician The Great Houdini and, spotting Bess in the audience, invites her on stage. Harry flirts with the unsuspecting Bess during his act, but she flees from him in a panic. When Bess shows up to watch Harry perform two more times, however, he corners her. Bess admits her attraction, and soon after, the two appear at Harry's mother's house, newly married. Bess becomes Harry's onstage partner, touring the country with him, but soon grows tired of the low pay and grueling schedule. After Bess convinces Harry to take a job in a locksmith factory, Harry works as a lock tester while fantasizing about escaping from one of the factory's large safes. On Halloween, Harry and Bess attend a special magicians' dinner at the Hotel Astor, during which magician Fante offers a prize to anyone who can free himself from a straitjacket. Harry accepts the challenge and, through intense concentration, extricates himself from the jacket, greatly impressing Fante. Afterward, however, Fante advises Harry to \\"drop it,\\" noting that Johann Von Schweger, a German magician, retired at the height of his career after performing a similar feat, fearful of his own talents. Bess then persuades Harry to give her his prize, a single, round-trip boat ticket to Europe, so that she can cash it in for a down payment on a house. Later, at the factory, Harry locks himself inside one of the big safes, determined to make an escape. Before he can get out, however, the foreman orders the safe blown open, then fires Harry. That night, in front of his mother (Angela Clarke), Harry and Bess argue about their future, and frustrated by Bess's insistence that he quit magic, Harry walks out. Soon, a contrite Bess finds Harry performing with a carnival and presents him with two one-way tickets to Europe. Sometime later, at a London theater, Harry and Bess are concluding their magic act when a reporter named Dooley (Michael Pate) challenges Harry to break out of one of Scotland Yard's notoriously secure jail cells. Harry, who hired Dooley to issue the challenge, accepts the challenge, unaware that the jail's cells do not have locks in the door, but on the outside wall. Despite the added difficulty, the dexterous, determined Houdini picks the cell lock and appears on time for his next performance. Now billed as the \\"man who escaped from Scotland Yard,\\" Harry begins a successful tour of Europe with Bess. In Berlin, Harry is joined by his mother and begins searching for the reclusive Von Schweger. While performing an impromptu levitation trick with Bess at a restaurant, Harry is arrested for fraud. During his trial, Harry denies that he ever made claims to supernatural powers, insisting that all his tricks are accomplished through physical means. To prove his point, Harry locks himself in a safe in the courtroom and breaks out a few minutes later, after which Bess explains to Harry's mother that safe locks are designed to keep thieves out, not in. Vindicated, Harry then goes to see Von Schweger, who finally has responded to his queries, but learns from Von Schweger's assistant, Otto (Torin Thatcher), that the magician died two days earlier. Otto reveals that Von Schweger summoned Harry to ask him the secret of \\"dematerialization,\\" a feat he accomplished once but could not repeat. Although Harry demurs, Otto insists on becoming Harry's new assistant and travels with him to New York City. There, Harry finds he is virtually unknown, so for publicity, hangs upside down on a skyscraper flagpole, constrained by a straitjacket. Harry executes the escape and soon makes a name for himself in America. To prepare to be submerged in a box in the chilly Detroit River, Harry bathes in an ice-filled bathtub. During the trick, which takes place on Halloween, the chain holding the box breaks, and the box drops upside down into an opening in the ice-covered river. Although Harry manages to escape from the box, the current drags him downstream, and he struggles to find air pockets under the ice and swim back to the opening. Above, Bess and the horrified audience assume Harry has drowned and proclaim his demise. To Bess's relief, Harry shows up later at their hotel, saying that he heard his mother's voice, directing him toward the opening. Just then, Harry receives word that his mother died at the exact time that he heard her voice. Two years later in New York, Harry, who has not performed since his mother's death, reveals to Simms (Douglas Spencer), a reporter, that he has been trying to contact his mother's spirit, without success. Harry invites Simms to attend a seance with him, and after the medium appears to have communicated with his mother, Harry and Otto expose her as a fake. After a public crusade against phony mediums, Harry decides to return to the stage and builds a watery torture cell for the occasion. Terrified, Bess threatens to leave Harry unless he drops the dangerous trick, and he agrees not to perform it. Before the show, Harry admits to Otto that his appendix is tender, but goes on, despite the pain. When the audience noisily demands that he perform the advertised \\"water torture\\" trick, Harry succumbs and is immersed, upside down, in a tank of water. Weak, Harry cannot execute the escape and loses consciousness. Otto breaks the tank's glass, and after reviving, the now-dying Harry vows to a weeping Bess that, if possible, he will come back.

Originally known as Zygaena lewini, its genus name was later changed to its current name. The Greek word sphyrna translates into \\"hammer\\" in English, referring to the shape of this shark's head. The most distinguishing characteristic of this shark, as in all hammerheads, is the 'hammer' on its head. The shark's eyes and nostrils are at the tips of the extensions. It is a fairly large hammerhead, but is still smaller than both the great and smooth hammerheads. This shark is also known as the bronze, kidney-headed, or southern hammerhead. It primarily lives in warm, temperate, and tropical coastal waters all around the globe between latitudes 46¬∞N and 36¬∞S, down to a depth of . It is the most common of all hammerheads. Taxonomy The scalloped hammerhead was first named Zygaena lewini and then renamed Sphyrna lewini by Edward Griffith and Hamilton Smith in 1834. It has also been named Cestracion leeuwenii by Day in 1865, Zygaena erythraea by Klunzinger in 1871, Cestracion oceanica by Garman in 1913, and Sphyrna diplana by Springer in 1941. Sphyrna comes from the Greek and translates into hammer. It is a sister species to Sphyrna gilberti, differing by the number of vertebrae. Though once considered a distinct species, McEachran and Serret synonymized Sphyrna couardi with Sphyrna lewini in 1986.Martin, R. Aidan. (February 24, 1998). Recent Changes in Hammerhead Taxonomy.

(2011) The Sharks of North America. Oxford University Press. These sharks have a very high metabolic rate, governing behavior in acquiring food. These sharks occupy tertiary trophic levels. The scalloped hammerhead shark, like many other species, uses the shore as a breeding ground. Due to high metabolic rates, young scalloped hammerhead sharks need a lot of food, or they will starve. Sphyrna lewini upper teeth.jpg|Upper teeth Sphyrna lewini lower teeth.jpg|Lower teeth Sphyrna lewini juvenile.jpg|Juvenile Sphyrna lewini young.jpg|Juvenile Distribution and habitat (video) Scalloped hammerhead swimming The scalloped hammerhead is a coastal pelagic species; it occurs over continental and insular shelves and in nearby deeper water. It is found in warm temperate and tropical waters, worldwide from 46¬∞N to 36¬∞S. It can be found down to depths over , but is most often found above . During the day, they are more often found close to shore, and at night, they hunt further offshore. Adults are found alone, in pairs, or in small schools, while young sharks occur in larger schools. Juveniles and pups thrive in shallow coastal waters, such as bays and mangroves, which provide shelter from predators and waters high in nutrients from deposited sediments. Research carried out by the non-government organisation Misi√≥n Tibur√≥n, using conventional and acoustic shark tagging methods, found that adult scalloped hammerheads migrate from the pelagic waters surrounding Cocos Island to the mangroves in the tropical fjord of Golfo Dulce - a tropical fjord on the pacific coast of Costa Rica.http://misiontiburon.org/en/hammerhead-shark/ Here, female sharks give birth to live young: juveniles remain in the shallow root system of the mangroves for around three years. After this time they leave Golfo Dulce and migrate back to Cocos Island, to feed in pelagic waters. Behavior Schooling School of scalloped hammerheads. These sharks are often seen during the night, day, and morning in big schools, sometimes numbering hundreds, most likely because large groups can obtain food easier than singles or small groups, especially larger and trickier prey, as commonly seen. The younger the sharks, the closer to the surface they tend to be, while the adults are found much deeper in the ocean. They are not considered dangerous and are normally not aggressive towards humans. Sexual dimorphism The female scalloped hammerheads undergo migration offshore at a smaller size than males because the larger classes of the hammerhead, such as those from 100 to 140 cm long, travel deeper down. Males and females differ in that males are observed to stay deeper than female sharks in general. Sexual maturity generally occurs once the scalloped hammerhead attains 240 cm in total or longer. Physically, the mature females have considerably wider uteri than their maturing counterparts. A lack of mating scars has been found on mature females. Unlike females, males reach sexual maturity at a much smaller size. The male-to-female ratio of the scalloped hammerhead is 1:1.29. Females probably are capable of giving birth annually. usually in the summer. Navigating behavior Scalloped hammerhead sharks have a homing behavior to navigate in the ocean. They move in the night and use the environment as a map, similar to a human reading a topographical map. By experimentation in tagging these sharks, one could test for any guidance in a shark's movement. These sharks use a point-to-point type of school swimming, and do not favor going too deep, where temperature changes hitchhike with current speed and directional change. The scalloped hammerhead uses deep water to survive as safety and feeding. Although they have high metabolic rates, they have a tendency to be sedentary and allow currents to carry them as they swim. As a result, this causes the scalloped hammerhead to be selective where they swim and the depth at which they tend to stay. They also make use of earths magnetic field.  Predation  upright=1.2 The scalloped hammerhead has a lot of advantages to capture its prey. The shape of its head allows it to bury into the seafloor and pin stingrays down. The wide head and special sensory cells allows the scalloped hammerhead to successfully detect fishes. Reproduction The gestation period is reported to be around 12 months. Compared to other species, the scalloped hammerhead produces large litters, and this is most likely due to high infant mortality. Like most sharks, parental care is not seen. Nursery grounds for this species are predictable and repeated over the years, and they are faithful to their natal sites. Their natal sites still cause high infant mortality; a lack of resources prevents all the young from surviving. As a result, only the fittest grow to maturity. Also, should a population get depleted, it recovers through reproduction and not immigration. This species does not seem to attack each other even in periods of starvation. In addition, scalloped hammerheads have migratory behaviors. As a result, deprivation results from migration and young growth. While the Taiwan scalloped hammerhead seems to have an earlier maturity rate, it is still reported to be slow to mature. Diet This shark feeds primarily on fish such as sardines, mackerel, and herring, and occasionally they feed on cephalopods such as squid and octopus. Larger specimens may also feed on smaller species of shark such as the blacktip reef shark, Carcharhinus melanopterus. Human interaction As of 2008, the scalloped hammerhead is on the \\"globally endangered\\" species list. In parts of the Atlantic Ocean, their populations have declined by over 95% in the past 30 years. Among the reasons for this drop off are overfishing and the rise in demand for shark fins. Researchers attribute this growth in demand to the increase in shark fins as an expensive delicacy (such as in shark fin soup) and are calling for a ban on shark finning, a practice in which the shark's fins are cut off and the rest of the animal is thrown back in the water to die. Hammerheads are among the most commonly caught sharks for finning. \\"This species tendency to aggregate in large groups making capture in large numbers on long lines, bottom nets and trawls even easier\\". They aren't considered to be dangerous to humans and if they do harm a human it is because they live in estuaries and attack out of surprise.  Trade  Hammerhead sharks are over fished all around the world for their fins and liver oil. It is estimated that 1.3 to 2.7 million fins are collected each year from smooth and scalloped hammerhead sharks for the shark fin trade.

She then returned to work in 1965‚Äì66 with Frederick Hecht in pediatrics and medical genetics at the University of Oregon Medical School, now called the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), in Portland where Dr. Magenis subsequently completed her residency training in Pediatrics and then did a postdoctoral fellowship in Medical Genetics. Magenis's first major research project involved a heritable fragile site on the long (q) arm of chromosome 16. She traced this 16q fragile site through a multigenerational family and, together with Hecht and Everett Lovrien, she linked the 16q fragile site to the gene for haptoglobin. The mapping of haptoglobin to 16q was the second instance in which a human gene was mapped to a specific autosome (non-sex chromosome), presaging the Human Genome Project.

As in nonbiological examples of ultrafiltration, pressure (in this case blood pressure) and concentration gradients lead to a separation through a semipermeable membrane (provided by the podocytes). The Bowman's capsule contains a dense capillary network called the glomerulus. Blood flows into these capillaries through the afferent arterioles and leaves through the efferent arterioles. The high hydrostatic pressure forces small molecules in the tubular fluid such as water, glucose, amino acids, sodium chloride and urea through the filter, from the blood in the glomerular capsule across the basement membrane of the Bowman's capsule and into the renal tubules. This process is called ultrafiltration; the resulting fluid, virtually free of large proteins and blood cells, is referred to as glomerular filtrate, or ultrafiltrate. Further modification of ultrafiltrate, by reabsorption and secretion, transforms it into urine. Glomerular pressure is about 75 millimeters of mercury (10 kPa). It is opposed by osmotic pressure (30 mmHg, 4.0 kPa) and hydrostatic pressure (20 mmHg, 2.7 kPa) of solutes present in capsular space. This difference in pressure is called effective pressure (25 mmHg, 3.3 kPa). In hemodialysis centers, ultrafiltration takes place in a hemofilter on the hemodialysis machines, when the blood pressure is greater than the dializate pressure (difference = transmembrane pressure (TMP)). This removes fluid from the blood while keeping its blood cells intact. Selectivity The structures of the layers of the glomerulus determine their permeability-selectivity (permselectivity). For instance, small ions such as sodium and potassium pass freely, while larger plasma proteins, such as hemoglobin tetramers, haptoglobin bound hemoglobin and albumin have practically no permeability at all. Also, negatively charged molecules will pass through far less frequently than positively charged ones.  Slow continuous ultrafiltration  Slow Continuous Ultrafiltration (SCUF) is an artificial method which approximately mimics the ultrafiltration function of the kidneys. SCUF is a continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) generally used to remove fluid from fluid overloaded patients suffering acute kidney failure. During SCUF blood is continuously removed from the body, passed through an extracorporeal circuit through a hemofilter, and send back to the body. A predetermined percentage of plasma water is removed in the hemofilter based upon a prescription. Typically, no more than 2 liters an hour of fluid is removed. Unlike hemodialysis, hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration, no dialysate or replacement fluids are used in SCUF.

History The school is named after Lord William Howard (1563‚Äì1640), who was the third son of Thomas, Duke of Norfolk. He married Elizabeth, the daughter and co-heiress of William, Lord Dacre, from whom the Naworth Castle branch of the Howard Family is descended. A Grade II monument of William Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle, is positioned on one of the highest hills to one side of the town of Brampton, known as the Mote. The school used to be known as the Irthing Valley Secondary Modern School, and was built between 1949 and 1953. It merged with another school in Brampton called the White House Grammar School situated on Main Street, in 1980 when comprehensive education replaced the selective education system. The ex-BBC newsreader Anna Ford was a head girl of White House Grammar School in 1961. More recently, the school had to be expanded after the closure of Lochinvar school in Longtown in 2008. A new Performing Arts block was built in 2010, allowing the old Drama suite to be extensively refurbished to become the new 6th form centre, which was officially opened by Radio 1 DJ Greg James on 10 May 2011. The school used to have an outdoor swimming pool, but the block which is currently the 6th form centre was built on the site of the pool in the 1990s. William Howard School was awarded Specialist Science status in 2004, Leading Edge status in 2005EduBase: Quality Indicators and the International School Award in 2007. The school converted to become an academy in August 2011. It retained its own sixth form centre after some argument over a proposed merger with a larger Carlisle Sixth Form Centre. In October 2014 it was announced that William Howard School will become the sponsor of the new Workington Academy in Workington in September 2015.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england- cumbria-29473722 The resulting multi-academy trust was called the Cumbrian Education Trust; it accepted responsibility for Whitehaven Academy and six primary schools. The school today Currently, the school has approximately 1600 pupils. The school has science laboratories, computer rooms, and a learning resources centre. It has a gym and a full size floodlit all-weather pitch. The school has a partner school in Tanzania. After school hours the school acts as a centre for adult education, theatrical and music performances, clubs and community meetings. The large open foyer frequently serves as a gallery space for local artists. Tanzanian Link Founded in 1989, the William Howard School - Uru Secondary School link has been, and continues to be, a great asset to both the Uru and Brampton communities. The rural village of Uru is located in the Moshi district of Kilimanjaro in northern Tanzania. About 8 miles from Moshi, the village itself is on the lower slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro. The Uru Secondary School is a co-ed church school with about 400 students in Forms 1 to 4. The Link was formed in 1987 when the coordinator, Phil Furneaux, met the Chair of Uru School Governors at an Energy Conference in Cumbria. At first WHS sent textbooks and other gifts to Uru. The first exchange took place in 1989 when a group of 13 students from WHS went to Uru. Since then there has been an exchange visit each way every other year except in 2002 when the visit was postponed due to a terrorist threat. A few Uru students come to study in the sixth form at WHS on long term visits, and a number of WHS students go to teach English at Uru School during their gap years. Sport The school regularly competes at local level within Cumbria and has a history of schoolboy level FA Cup runs. Facilities include a fitness suite and also an astroturf pitch. On the astroturf is run Carlisle and Brampton Six a Side League. There are currently 39 teams playing in 5 divisions. Fixtures are generally played on astroturf on Tuesdays and Friday nights. In the 3 Tuesday leagues the two lowest placed teams are relegated to the division below. The two highest placed teams are promoted. Teams play each other 3 times in a season. theReview theReview is a Sixth Form Student newspaper that was relaunched after a 2-year hiatus, in September 2012. The publication is completely and independently managed by students, all aged 16 to 17. Young Enterprise The school has been a strong supporter of the Young Enterprise charity. It teaches young people about business through practical methods. Students have to set up their own company, create a product, and sell it. They also have to write a detailed report on the company, as well as set up two trade stands in Carlisle, and present their findings to a panel of judges.

Furthermore, it is the foundation of many other MAC protocols used in wireless sensor networks (WSN). The IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS mechanism is adopted from this protocol. It uses RTS-CTS-DS-DATA-ACK frame sequence for transferring data, sometimes preceded by an RTS-RRTS frame sequence, in view to provide solution to the hidden node problem. Although protocols based on MACAW, such as S-MAC, use carrier sense in addition to the RTS/CTS mechanism, MACAW does not make use of carrier sense.  Principles of operation  An example to illustrate the principle of MACAW. It is assumed that only adjacent nodes are in transmission range of each other. Assume that node A has data to transfer to node B. Node A initiates the process by sending a Request to Send frame (RTS) to node B. The destination node (node B) replies with a Clear To Send frame (CTS). After receiving CTS, node A sends data. After successful reception, node B replies with an acknowledgement frame (ACK). If node A has to send more than one data fragment, it has to wait a random time after each successful data transfer and compete with adjacent nodes for the medium using the RTS/CTS mechanism. Any node overhearing an RTS frame (for example node F or node E in the illustration) refrains from sending anything until a CTS is received, or after waiting a certain time. If the captured RTS is not followed by a CTS, the maximum waiting time is the RTS propagation time and the destination node turnaround time. Any node (node C and node E) overhearing a CTS frame refrains from sending anything for the time until the data frame and ACK should have been received (solving the hidden terminal problem), plus a random time. Both the RTS and CTS frames contain information about the length of the DATA frame. Hence a node uses that information to estimate the time for the data transmission completion. Before sending a long DATA frame, node A sends a short Data-Sending frame (DS), which provides information about the length of the DATA frame. Every station that overhears this frame knows that the RTS/CTS exchange was successful. An overhearing station (node F), which might have received RTS and DS but not CTS, defers its transmissions until after the ACK frame should have been received plus a random time. To sum up, a successful data transfer (A to B) consists of the following sequence of frames: # ‚ÄúRequest To Send‚Äù frame (RTS) from A to B # ‚ÄúClear To Send‚Äù frame (CTS) from B to A # ‚ÄúData Sending‚Äù frame (DS) from A to B # DATA fragment frame from A to B, and # Acknowledgement frame (ACK) from B to A. MACAW is a non-persistent slotted protocol, meaning that after the medium has been busy, for example after a CTS message, the station waits a random time after the start of a time slot before sending an RTS. This results in fair access to the medium. If for example nodes A, B and C have data fragments to send after a busy period, they will have the same chance to access the medium since they are in transmission range of each other.  RRTS  Node D is unaware of the ongoing data transfer between node A and node B. Node D has data to send to node C, which is in the transmission range of node B. D initiates the process by sending an RTS frame to node C. Node C has already deferred its transmission until the completion of the current data transfer between node A and node B (to avoid co-channel interference at node B). Hence, even though it receives RTS from node D, it does not reply back with CTS. Node D assumes that its RTS was not successful because of collision and hence proceeds to back off (using an exponential backoff algorithm). If A has multiple data fragments to send, the only instant when node D successfully can initiate a data transfer is during small gaps in between that node A has completed data transfer and completion of node B next CTS (for node A next data transfer request). However, due to the node D backoff time period the probability to capture the medium during this small time interval is not high. To increase the per-node fairness, MACAW introduces a new control message called \\"Request for Request to Send\\" (RRTS). Now, when node C, which cannot reply earlier due to ongoing transmission between node A and node B, sends an RRTS message to node D during next contention period, the recipient of the RRTS (node D) immediately responds with an RTS and the normal message exchange is commenced. Other nodes overhearing an RRTS defer for two time slots, long enough to hear if a successful RTS‚ÄìCTS exchange occurs. To summarize, a transfer may in this case consist of the following sequence of frames between node D and C: # ‚ÄúRequest To Send‚Äù frame (RTS) from D to C # ‚ÄúRequest for Request to send‚Äù frame (RRTS) from C to D (after a short delay) # ‚ÄúRequest To Send‚Äù frame (RTS) from D to C # ‚ÄúClear To Send‚Äù frame (CTS) from C to D # ‚ÄúData Sending‚Äù frame (DS) from D to C # DATA fragment frame from D to C, # Acknowledgement frame (ACK) from C to D Ongoing research Additional back-off algorithms have been developed and researched to improve performance.P.

J. Communication Networks and Distributed Systems, Vol.1, No.1, pp 52-70, 2008 The basic principle is based on the use of sequencing techniques where each node in the wireless network maintains a counter which limits the number attempts to less than or equal to the sequence number or use wireless channel states to control the access probabilities so that a node with a good channel state has a higher probability of contention success. This reduces the number of collisions.  Unsolved problems  MACAW does not generally solve the exposed terminal problem. Assume that node G has data to send to node F in our example. Node G has no information about the ongoing data transfer from A to B. It initiates the process by sending an RTS signal to node F. Node F is in the transmission range of node A and cannot hear the RTS from node G, since it is exposed to co-channel interference. Node G assumes that its RTS was not successful because of collision and hence backs off before it tries again. In this case, the solution provided by the RRTS mechanism will not improve the situation much since the DATA frames sent from B are rather long compared to the other frames. The probability that F is exposed to transmission from A is rather high. Node F has no idea about any node interested in initiating data transfer to it, until G happens to transmit an RTS in between transmissions from A. Furthermore, MACAW might not behave normally in multicasting.

The book was a Left Book Club selection in 1940. The novel is inspired by Adolf Hitler's claim that Nazism would create a \\"Thousand Year Reich\\". The novel was forgotten for many years, until it was republished in the 1980s. Literary historian Andy Croft has described it as \\"the most original of all the many anti-fascist dystopias of the late 1930s\\". Plot synopsis Swastika Night takes place in a world where the Nazis and Empire of Japan defeated their enemies and conquered the world (from a modern perspective, the novel is an alternate history in which the Nazis won World War II, though at the time of its writing the war had not broken out and it was a work of speculative future fiction.) It follows the protagonist Alfred, an Englishman in his 30s who works as a ground mechanic for the German Empire in the Salisbury Aerodrome. Alfred comes to Germany on a holy pilgrimage to see the holy sites of Hitlerism, the religion in this Nazi-dominated world. These sites include the holy forest and the sacred aeroplane in Munich with which Hitler won the war by personally flying to Moscow, it is said. In this world Hitler is seen as a seven foot tall, long blonde-haired, blue-eyed man who was ‚Äúexploded‚Äù from the head of God the Thunderer and was a god in his own right. He is preached about by \\"Knights\\" (a cross between the traditional, feudal knight and a priest) who pass this job down from father to son. When Alfred arrives at his Nazi friend Hermann's village, he meets the Knight there, an old man by the name of Friedrich von Hess; Hermann works on this Knight's land. The Knight reveals to Alfred about how history was distorted by a man who even when confronted by the truth proclaimed Hitler a god. The writing of this man's book caused the Nazis to burn everything that contradicted the fact ‚Äì even the book itself ‚Äì and also anything that revealed life before the empire or during Hitler's life. An ancestor of von Hess wrote about the truth and entrusted the secret to his descendants as he also obtained and preserved a picture of Hitler and a young blonde woman that Alfred originally mistakes for Hitler. This convinces the already sceptical Alfred that Hitler was not a god when he sees that Hitler was a small, brown-haired man with a paunch. Alfred then vows to return women to how they should be as in the novel they have become ugly things, with shaved heads and no self-respect, used solely for reproduction and kept in a place called the women's quarters from where they cannot escape and are seen as little more than animals. He also vows that he shall teach what is in his book to his fellow Englishmen and others so that eventually they can cause the shattering of the German Empire as the belief that holds it together falls apart. He presses that it must be an ideological, spiritual rebellion as a violent rebellion would be crushed by the occupation armies of the Germans. The reader may also realise that a violent rebellion would also only adhere to the Hitlerian beliefs of violence and strength. Towards the end of the novel Alfred returns to Britain with the book, where he starts teaching his son from it. A few weeks after finishing the book Alfred, his son and Hermann (who followed Alfred to Britain) are almost caught by Nazi soldiers. While Fred (Alfred's son) escapes with the book, Hermann and Alfred are discovered, whereupon Hermann charges the soldiers and is killed. After this happens the soldiers try to discover the reason behind Hermann and Alfred being there, but are unsuccessful. A soldier then kicks Hermann's corpse, causing Alfred to fly into a rage and get beaten into unconsciousness; the beating is so bad that Alfred wakes up in hospital two days later and gets to talk to Fred one last time about continuing his work just before he dies of his injuries. Reception John Clute described Swastika Night as \\"a scathing feminist anatomy of war, sexism and power\\" and lists the novel as one of the \\"classic titles\\" of inter-war science fiction. Adam Roberts stated \\"Burdekin's pre-war story reads as horribly prescient and its feminist emphasis ... provides a very valid critique of fascism\\".Roberts, Adam. The History of Science Fiction. Palgrave Macmillan. (p.171).

He was a cobbler like his father until the latter died and he became a violent-tempered soldier who was quick to challenge to a duel those who offended him or the causes he believed in. But one duel went too far and he almost killed his opponent; he fled to the Franciscans in Palermo where he experienced a radical conversion and repentance for his previous life. He became severe with himself and inflicted harsh penances on himself such as flagellation. The process for his sainthood opened on 18 December 1725 under Pope Benedict XIII and he became titled as a Servant of God while with the confirmation of his life of heroic virtue Pope Clement XIII named him as Venerable on 2 February 1762. The confirmation of two miraculous healings attributed to his intercession allowed for Clement XIII to preside over the beatification on 15 May 1768. Latini received canonization from Pope John Paul II centuries later on 10 June 2001 after the confirmation of one more miracle. Life Filippo Latini was born in 1605 in Corleone as the third of six children to Leonardo and Francesca Latini; he was baptized just hours after his birth. His brothers and sisters were pious; one brother became a priest. Filippo had no formal schooling. His father was a shoemaker and Latini learned the trade from him. Leonardo was so compassionate that he opened his home to the poor to wash and to be fed. The death of his father in March 1620 prompted Filippo to continue on in his profession for a while to support his mother, but he soon left to become a soldier on 1 May 1618. He took up fencing and became quite skilled. But he possessed a boiling temper and was quick to challenge men to a duel. His single fault - according to two witnesses during the beatification trials - was that \\"he was quick to draw his sword at the slightest provocation\\". His life was not noted for its moral content and he had quite a formidable reputation for that reason. Latini was not that devout but he would defend old people and other helpless and defenseless persons against violence. He made frequent visits to a local crucifix and ensured that a lamp be kept burning before it; he was a devotee of Francis of Assisi. In the summer of 1624 he became involved in a duel which cost his opponent, the professional assassin Vito Canino, his arm.\\"Saint Bernard Latini of Corleone\\", Capuchin Franciscan Friars Australia This incident was something that a large number of people witnessed and it caused an uproar which saw him nicknamed as \\"the finest blade in Sicily\\". To escape from the man's avengers he sought refuge with the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin for this duel had shaken him to the core. He later begged forgiveness to his opponent who befriended him after their differences were resolved. During his time with the friars, he began to reflect on his life and to repent his life of anger and violence. He appealed for admission to the order as a religious and on 13 December 1632 entered their novitiate at Caltanissetta where he received the habit and the name \\"Bernardo da Corleone\\". His devotion became severe: he scourged himself seven times a week. His sleep was limited to three hours a night on a narrow board with a block of wood under his head to act as a pillow. He fasted for the most part on bread and water. He would wear the most worn habits available and slept in the most uncomfortable cell in the house. One result of this was that he suffered from rheumatism for much of his later life. He worked long hours and had a special concern for the sick; he ended up growing into a man known for his gentleness and compassion. He lived a simple life, moving from one friary to another in the province. Latini was stationed in Corleone (1635‚Äì36) before being transferred to Bovina (1636‚Äì37) and Castronovo (1637-38). In Castronovo he used to go through the streets with a large pot on his shoulders to give minestrone to the poor. He was then transferred to Castelvetrano (1638‚Äì39) and Sambuca (1639-40) which lasted just over a decade. He then moved to Bisaquino (1640‚Äì41) and to Ciminna (1641‚Äì42) before being moved to Chiusa (1642‚Äì43) and then to Castronovo (1643‚Äì44) once again. Latini was then sent to Agrigento (1644‚Äì46) and then returned to Castronovo (1646‚Äì47) before setting off for Caltabellotta (1647‚Äì48) and then to Burgio (1648‚Äì50) before going back to Chiusa (1650‚Äì51). He was then sent to Partinico (1651‚Äì52). He spent the last fifteen years of his life in Palermo. In the meantime he met his former opponent and now-friend Vito Canino in 1654 and then twice more in 1659 and 1663. He possessed a strong devotion to the Madonna and encouraged others in this devotion. His biographers claim that the Blessed Mother appeared to him and placed Jesus Christ - as an infant - in his arms. It is also claimed that she gave him knowledge of the date of his death four months in advance. In the friaries he served as either a cook or assistant cook but towards the end of his life dealt with washing and managing the clothes of his compatriots. He died in Palermo on 12 January 1667 at 2:00 pm after having been moved to the convent's hospital wing on 7 January; his funeral procession was extensive due to the fame he had acquired during his life. On his deathbed he kept repeating: \\"Let's go\\" in anticipation of his 'dies natalis' (birth into heaven). Numerous miracles reported to have occurred at his grave were recorded. Veneration The beatification process opened in Palermo in an informative process that began in 1673 and concluded sometime later before an apostolic process was opened in 1681 and closed at the end of the decade on 16 December 1689. The formal introduction to the cause came under Pope Benedict XIII on 18 December 1725 and Latini became titled as a Servant of God as a result of this. The confirmation of his heroic virtue allowed for Pope Clement XIII to title him as Venerable on 2 February 1762 while the same pope beatified him later on 15 May 1768 at Saint Peter's Basilica.\\"St. Bernard of Corleone, OFM Cap.\\", Capuchin Franciscans, Western American Province One final miracle was needed for him to be canonized as a saint and one such was investigated in its diocese of origin; the Congregation for the Causes of Saints reviewed it and validated the process on 22 May 1998. The medical panel of experts approved this miracle on 12 May 1999 as did the theologians on 24 September 1999 and the C.C.S. on 21 March 2000. Pope John Paul II approved this miracle on 1 July 2000 and formalized the date for sainthood in a consistory on 13 March 2001.

History The Name Elmsdale started when the Great Western Road and Dock Road were formed. The surveying of the farms along the Dock Rd. began in 1841. When it crossed the Great Western Road creating a crossroads, James Reid owned the land where the Nazarene Church parking lot is today. The community that quickly formed at this crossroads was called Reid's Corner. In 1865, John Adams and his family moved and settled on the same corner. Reid died in 1866. Until 1872, the community was called Adams' Corner, but sometimes people still referred to it as Reid's Corner. When the railway was surveyed through Lot 4, the community was referred to as Reid's or Adams' Corner. Since the station was near the Dock Road intersection, it was called the Dock Road Station between 1872 and 1875. The residents were not satisfied with that name and met to change it. The name Elmsdale was first used in 1868, but did not become the only one until 1875. Industrialization For many years, Elmsdale was a small settlement wedged between Campbellton and Alberton. As \\"The Corner\\" grew into an industrial center, people built home close to their place of work, and churches to worship in. They were the Presbyterian and the Salvation Army (later the Church of the Nazarene). Elmsdale West and Brockton Up the Dock Road two other communities were formed, Elmsdale West and Brockton. Elmsdale West has always been, and continues to be, an agricultural settlement. Brockton was formed at the intersection of the Trainor Road and the Dock Road, and was first called Dock Road Settlement. St. Bernadette's Roman Catholic Church was built in 1929 in Brockton. As Elmsdale expanded, more roads were built, creating a spider's web of routes. Roads include the Butcher Road, the Wells Road, the Warren Road, the Murray Road, the Old Tom Road, the O'Brien Road, and others.  Agriculture   PEI Grain Elevators Corporation  Elmsdale is home to the PEI grain elevator #3, it was built in 1978 and is made out of steel and concrete. It has 24 different bins that range from 12 to 12000 tonnes. The total facility is capable of storing 9200 metric tonnes. This grain elevator is capable of handling barley, oats, soybean, wheat and corn.  W.P. Griffin Inc.  W.P. Griffin Inc. is a potato farming business located in Elmsdale. The business was founded in 1928. W.P. Griffin Inc. packages many different types of potatoes including Russets, Yellow-fleshed, Reds and Round Whites. This company offers many different specialty products such as BBQ ready, microwave ready and restaurant style potatoes. W.P. Griffin Inc. is also the initial branding partner for Dole Potatoes in Canada. Politics Elmsdale falls within the provincial district 26 (Alberton-Roseville division) and is currently represented by Pat Murphy. There is a polling station at the Elmsdale Community School.

Rapid development ensued as the surface center began to migrate back into a closed 500 hPa-level (14.75 inHg) (around 6,000 m/20,000 ft above sea level) cyclone, and the cyclone bombed while moving north through Washington D.C. the next morning. The former occluded front to its northwest became a warm front which moved back to the west around the strengthening, and now dominant, southern low pressure center. By the evening of November 25, the cyclone retrograded, or moved northwestward, into Ohio due to a blocking ridge up across eastern Canada. It was at this time that the pressure gradient was its most intense across southern New England and eastern New York. A wide area of +4 standard deviation 850mb winds occurred. The cyclone moved west over Lake Erie to the north of the upper cyclone before looping over Ohio as the low-level and mid- level cyclone centers coupled. Significant convection within its comma head led to the development of a warm seclusion, or a pocket of low level warm air, near its center which aided in further development due to the increased lapse rates a warmer low level environment affords under a cold low. After the system became stacked with height, the storm slowly spun down as it drifted north and northeast into eastern Canada over the succeeding few days.Clarence D.

Rather than abstracting all articles from a list of analytical journals, Analytical Abstracts has a very focussed scope. Articles are selected from a list of over 100 source journals, covering not only analytical chemistry, but also food and environmental chemistry subject areas (amongst others). The principal criteria for selecting an article is that it must deal with the practical measurement of one or more chemical species and must involve the use of a novel protocol. Classification of articles is performed on the basis of three aspects of the article: the analyte, matrix and concept. While it is not necessary for an article to describe all three aspects, at least one of them must be identifiable for inclusion in Analytical Abstracts.

He is currently the president of the National Council for Combating Discrimination, Romania's anti-discrimination and equality body. He speaks Romanian, Hungarian and English. Education Asztalos completed high school in Baia Mare, at the Hungarian-language section of Mihai Eminescu High School, where he specialised in philology. Between 1993 and 1997, he studied law at the University of Oradea. Later, he undertook post-graduate studies at the David Oligvy National School of Political and Administrative in Bucharest, and in 2003 was a doctoral candidate in international law at the University of Bucharest. In 2002, he was appointed to the National Council for Combating Discrimination, and became president of the institution in 2005.  Political activity  On November 21, 2006 CNDC (National Council for Discrimination Combating) accepted the petition submitted by Emil Moise on exposing the religious symbols in the public schools. The CNDC‚Äôs ruling, then called the Emil Moise vs Ministry of Education case, has provided the following: ‚ÄúThe Ministry of Education has to develop and implement within the reasonable terms an internal regulation that would regulate the presence of the religious symbols in the public educational institutions. This internal regulation should be based on the following principales: * Should ensure the right to education and access to culture, based on the egality principal; * Should respect the rights of the parents to ensure the children education based on their religious and philosophical beliefs; * Should respect the laic statute and the religion autonomy; * Should ensure the liberty of the religion, consciousness and beliefs of all the children, based on the egality principal; * The religious symbols should be exposed within the religious education hours and in the areas designated exclusively to the religious education. The Head of the CNCD, Csaba Ferenc Asztalos said, \\"[By this ruling], we have recognized the relationship between the state and religions in Romania, we have not touched upon the historical recognition of Christian contributions to the formation of the Romanian people. Now, we make an appeal to the state, through the Ministry of Education, to take responsibility for what is happening in schools in this regard. \\"On June 11, 2008, the High Court of Cassation and Justice decided that the presence of icons in schools is legal, basically canceling the CNCD's decision. Asztalos expressed his opinion on the religious classes taught in Romanian schools, deplored the Church's relationship with the State, which would violate the students' right and freedom of conscience. According to him, \\"if it were recognized (as legitimate) that religion can only be optional, religion teachers would no longer be permanently employed in schools, but only through temporary contracts per one school year\\" and \\" the pupils' enrollment from the office to the religion classes ‚Äì that is, by the state ‚Äì violates the freedom of conscience, the right of parents or the legal guardian to ensure that their child is educated according to their own beliefs [because] no person in Romania is obliged to answer a question about to his belonging to a cult.\\"Raluca Pantazi, Inscrierea din oficiu a elevilor la ora de religie incalca dreptul la libertatea constiintei - Csaba Asztalos, presedintele Consiliului National pentru Combaterea Discriminarii, HotNews, February 21, 2013, Retrieved December 2, 2013 In June 2013, following the attempt carried out by the Parliamentary Commission to amend the new Constitution to make legal marriage just \\"between a man and a woman\\" (changing the current form: \\"between spouses\\"), basically prohibiting same-sex marriages, failed, The Commission also resumed the vote on the proposed day-earlier amendment providing for protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation, which was rejected. Csaba Asztalos together with other members of civil society reacted, publicly condemning the commission of political interests and discrimination against sexual minorities.

In the House, it is the rejection slip given to tax and spending bills sent to it by the Senate that did not originate in the House in the first place, per the House's interpretation of the Origination Clause. In the Senate, it is the slip on which the Senators from the state of residence of a federal judicial nominee gives an opinion on the nominee. House of Representatives The Origination Clause of the United States Constitution (Article I, Section 7, Clause 1) provides that the House of Representatives has exclusive authority to introduce bills raising revenue: \\"All bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.\\" As such, the House considers itself to be the only proper venue to originate any bills appropriating revenue. When, in the opinion of the House of Representatives, a Senate- introduced bill that raises revenue or appropriates money is passed by the Senate and sent to the House for its consideration, the House places a blue slip on the legislation that notes the House's constitutional prerogative and immediately returns it to the Senate without taking further action. This blue- slipping procedure, done by an order of the House, is routinely completed to enforce its interpretation that the House is the sole body to introduce revenue or appropriations legislation. The failure of the House to consider the legislation means it cannot become a law. This tactic is historically of great use to the House and, as a practical matter, the Senate does not introduce tax or revenue measures to avoid a blue slip. The Senate can circumvent this requirement by substituting the text of any bill previously passed by the House with the text of a revenue bill. Senate In the Senate, a blue slip is an opinion written by a Senator from the state where a federal judicial nominee resides. Both senators from a nominee's state are sent a blue slip in which they may submit a favorable or unfavorable opinion of a nominee. They may also choose not to return a blue slip. The Senate Judiciary Committee takes blue slips into consideration when deciding whether or not to recommend that the Senate confirm a nominee. A report issued by the Congressional Research Service in 2003 defines six periods in the use of the blue slip by the Senate: > *\\"From 1917 through 1955: The blue-slip policy allowed home-state Senators > to state their objections but committee action to move forward on a > nomination. If a Senator objected to his/her home-state nominee, the > committee would report the nominee adversely to the Senate, where the > contesting Senator would have the option of stating his/her objections to > the nominee before the Senate would vote on confirmation. *\\"From 1956 > through 1978: A single home-state Senator could stop all committee action on > a judicial nominee by either returning a negative blue slip or failing to > return a blue slip to the committee. *\\"From 1979 to mid-1989: A home-state > Senator‚Äôs failure to return a blue slip would not necessarily prevent > committee action on a nominee. *\\"From mid-1989 through June 5, 2001: In a > public letter (1989) on the committee‚Äôs blue-slip policy, the chairman wrote > that one negative blue slip would be ‚Äúa significant factor to be weighed‚Äù > but would ‚Äúnot preclude consideration‚Äù of a nominee ‚Äúunless the > Administration has not consulted with both home state Senators.‚Äù The > committee would take no action, regardless of presidential consultation, if > both home-state Senators returned negative blue slips. *\\"From June 6, 2001, > to 2003: The chairman‚Äôs blue-slip policy allowed movement on a judicial > nominee only if both home-state Senators returned positive blue slips to the > committee. If one home-state Senator returned a negative blue slip, no > further action would be taken on the nominee. Since 2003, blue slip policy has changed several more times, as follows: > *\\"2003-2007: A return of a negative blue slip by one or both home-state > Senators does not prevent the committee from moving forward with the > nomination ‚Äî provided that the Administration has engaged in pre-nomination > consultation with both of the home-state Senators.\\" *From 2007 to January 3, > 2018: The chairman‚Äôs blue-slip policy allowed movement on a judicial nominee > only if both home-state Senators returned positive blue slips to the > committee. If one home-state Senator returned a negative blue slip, no > further action would be taken on the nominee. *January 3, 2018 - present: > \\"The lack of two positive blue slips will not necessarily preclude a > circuit-court nominee from receiving a hearing unless the White House failed > to consult with home-state senators. Hearings are unlikely for district > court nominees without two positive blue slips.\\" In October 2017, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that he believed blue slips should not prevent committee action on a nominee. In November 2017, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley, announced that the committee would hold hearings for David Stras and Kyle Duncan. Stras' hearing was held up by Senator Al Franken's refusal to return the blue slip, while Duncan's hearing was held up by Senator John Neely Kennedy's indecision on his blue slip. Kennedy, however, consented to Duncan receiving a hearing. In February 2019, attorney Eric Miller was confirmed to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, despite the fact that neither of his two home-state senators (Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, both of Washington) had returned blue slips for him. He was the first federal judicial nominee to be so confirmed without support from either of his home-state senators, although other nominees were similarly confirmed to the Courts of Appeals without blue slips later in 2019, including Paul Matey (Third Circuit, New Jersey), Joseph F. Bianco and Michael H. Park (both Second Circuit, New York), and Kenneth K. Lee, Daniel P. Collins, and Daniel Aaron Bress (all Ninth Circuit, California).

It is a teaching hospital for the Donald & Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, offering residency programs, postgraduate training programs and clinical fellowships. It is located in Manhasset, New York. A level I trauma center, North Shore University Hospital has 738 beds and a staff of approximately 4,000 specialty and subspecialty physicians. It offers care in all medical and surgical specialties, including cardiovascular services, cancer care, orthopedics, maternal-fetal medicine and women's health services. The hospital offers neuroscience capabilities, including the Harvey Cushing Institutes of Neuroscience. These include the Chiari Institute, Movement Disorders Institute, Brain Tumor Institute, Brain Aneurysm Center, Headache Center and Spine Center as well as a state-designated stroke center. The campus is home to the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research. History The hospital North Shore Hospital was built on of land donated by John Hay Whitney in 1949; another five acres were donated in 1955. The ceremony was held on May 6, 1951 and televised live by NBC. The hospital opened on July 27, 1953, with 169 beds, 253 doctors, 108 nurses, and volunteers. The addition of the Payson-Whitney Pavilion in 1963 increased the inpatient capacity to 286 beds. Changes from 1969 to 1976 included creation of the Cohen Pavilion and the Levitt Ambulatory Care Clinic. The Payson-Whitney Pavilion also was expanded to ten stories and named the Payson-Whitney Tower (now just Tower Pavilion). This increased the hospital's inpatient capacity to 512 beds. In 1992, construction of the Don Monti Memorial Pavilion increased inpatient capacity to 731 beds. In 2006, North Shore University Hospital named its campus in honor for contributor and trustee, Sandra Atlas Bass. The health system In the 1990s, North Shore University Hospital started acquiring and merging with hospitals in the New York area, starting in 1990 with the Community Hospital at Glen Cove, now Glen Cove Hospital - The Mildred and Frank Feinberg Campus. The two hospitals formed the North Shore Regional Health Services Corporation, soon renamed the North Shore Health System. The North Shore Health System continued to expand to other communities on Long Island over the next several years. By 1995, it developed sponsorship agreements with Franklin Hospital in Valley Stream and Huntington Hospital, and acquired Syosset Hospital, Plainview Hospital, and LaGuardia Hospital (later renamed Forest Hills Hospital) from the HIP of Greater New York as Syosset Community Hospital, Franklin Hospital Medical Center (now Franklin Hospital), Central General Hospital (now Plainview Hospital) and LaGuardia Hospital (now Forest Hills Hospital). In 1997, the two largest medical centers on Long Island, North Shore Health System and Long Island Jewish Medical Center, merged, creating the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, which is known today as Northwell Health. In 2008 Northwell was the third- largest non-profit secular healthcare system in the United States, based on number of beds. Research In 1991, Anthony Cerami left Rockefeller University and founded the Picower Institute for Medical Research on the grounds of North Shore University Hospital; the institute was funded by Jeffry Picower. The Institute for Medical Research at North Shore-Long Island Jewish was founded in 1999 and in 2002 it acquired the Picower Institute. In 2005 board member Leonard Feinstein, the co-founder of Bed Bath & Beyond, made a multimillion-dollar gift to the institute, which led to its being renamed The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research. Academics In 1969, North Shore Hospital affiliated with Cornell University Medical College (now Weill Medical College of Cornell University), changing its name to North Shore University Hospital. The hospital established an affiliation with NYU School of Medicine in 1994 and with the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University upon merging with Long Island Jewish Medical Center. After the merger of North Shore Health System and Long Island Jewish Medical Center, the health system moved to gradually merge its academics, culminating in 2012 with the merger of North Shore and Long Island Jewish internal medicine residency programs. In October 2007, Hofstra University announced that it would open a new medical school, in partnership with Northwell Health. The Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell opened in 2011. As of 2019, the Zucker School of Medicine ranks 72 in best medical schools nationwide for research. In addition to undergraduate medical education, Northwell Health provides graduate medical education to over 1200 residents and fellows through its 90 residency and fellowship training programs.

It has been suggested that in the 10th and 11th century as the giudicati of Sardinia became independent, the archbishop of Cagliari became the de facto theocratic ruler of the island through the Corona de Logu. In 1075, Pope Gregory VII reproached the Archbishop James for wearing a beard, a fashion which had been introduced into Sardinia at an earlier date; the pope asked the Judge Torchitorio I to oblige the clergy to abandon this custom. The same bishop and his colleagues were blamed by Pope Victor III (1087) for neglect of their churches. Under this pope, the Archbishop of Cagliari became known as the Primate of Sardinia. In the 12th century, however, the prominence of Cagliari was reduced vis-√†-vis the Archdiocese of Torres in the north of the island. In 1158, the title of Primate of Sardinia and Corsica was given to the Archbishop of Pisa, but in 1409 it was reassumed by the Archbishop of Cagliari, whence arose a controversy between those sees, which dragged on into the 20th century. Pope Paul VI became the first Pope to visit Sardinia in 1,650 years when he made his visit to Cagliari Cathedral, which is a minor basilica. Pope John Paul II paid a visit later. Pope Benedict XVI visited in September 2008 while Pope Francis visited in 2013.

It appeared on navigational charts until as late as the early twentieth century. It was supposedly located at approximately 2¬∞S 8¬∞W, and was alleged to have been discovered by the Portuguese on St. Matthew's Day 1516. It was shown and named on several maps going back to the beginning of the sixteenth century, and it was supposedly visited by Garc√≠a Jofre de Loa√≠sa on 20 October 1525 while on a voyage to the Moluccas. It appeared on early Portuguese charts and world maps, and appears on Ortelius' 1570 map of the African continent Africae Tabula Nova. It thereafter regularly featured on charts and maps, and though it began to disappear from standard charts starting in the early nineteenth century, it was not completely removed from charts until the early twentieth century. Peter Mundy refers in 1656 to St Matthew Island when writing about Ascension, with some words changed to be more understandable in brackets: Captain James Cook tried but failed to find St. Matthew in 1775 during his second voyage. Both Peter Leonard (1833) and H.C. Adams (1883) suggest that the error may have arisen from a confusion with Annob√≥n Island, which lies at the same latitude but at 5¬∞38‚Ä≤E longitude.

With four major tributary branches that converge west of the city of Westfield, it flows (measured from the source of its North Branch) before its confluence with the Connecticut River at Agawam, across from the city of Springfield's Metro Center district.National Wild & Scenic Westfield River [Map & Segment Descriptions]. Westfieldriverwildscenic.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-15.U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed April 1, 2011 Known for its whitewater rapids and scenic beauty, the Westfield River provides over of whitewater canoeing and kayaking, in addition to one of the largest roadless wilderness areas remaining in the Commonwealth. The Westfield River is the Connecticut River's longest tributary in Massachusetts, although the Chicopee River's basin is much larger, and contributes more water to the Connecticut. The Connecticut's northern tributary, the Deerfield River, is nearly as long as the Westfield‚Äîonly shorter than the Westfield. During the mid-20th century, the Westfield River was so polluted that it would change color based on the nature of the contaminant. Today, the river is clean enough for swimming. It is a state and locally managed river featuring native trout fishing and rugged mountain scenery in the context of a historical mill town settlement (at Westfield).  History  On its initial discovery by Massachusetts Bay Colony explorers John Cable and John Woodcock in 1635, the area stretching from the Westfield River's confluence with the Connecticut River to Westfield itself‚Äîwhich, the next year, would all be encompassed in the settlement that came to be known as Springfield‚Äîwas named the \\"Agawam River\\", after the name of the Native American people then occupying the area. Historical literature often refers to Springfield as sitting at the confluence of the Connecticut River with the western Agawam River and eastern Chicopee River. This \\"Agawam River\\" is now known as the Westfield River, and should not be confused with the Agawam River in southeastern Massachusetts, which was named in tribute to Springfield's tribe of Native Americans..  Branches of the Westfield River  The Westfield River runs for a total of . Rising in the Berkshire Hills region of Massachusetts, it flows southeastwardly to join the Connecticut River at Agawam‚Äîdirectly across from Springfield's Metro Center (downtown). The Westfield River has a drainage area that includes three named branches, which join in Huntington to form the Westfield River's main stem, which flows through Russell into Westfield. The branches are the North Branch (sometimes called the East Branch), which rises in the town of Savoy and flows southeast through Windsor, Cummington, and Chesterfield; the Middle Branch, which rises in the town of Peru and flows southeast through Worthington, Middlefield, and Chester; and the West Branch, which has its origins in Washington and Becket, then flows east through Chester. The three branches converge in the town of Huntington: the Middle and North Branch (or \\"East Branch\\") merge near the hamlet of Goss Heights, north of their junction with the West Branch (designated a National Wild and Scenic river) at Huntington village. From Huntington, the main stem of the Westfield River flows through Russell and Westfield, then forms the boundary between West Springfield and Agawam before ending at the Connecticut River. Every April, the Westfield River in Huntington is the home of the Westfield River Whitewater Races, the oldest continuously run whitewater race in the United States. Portions of the river's watershed have been designated the Westfield Creek Wild and Scenic River, and form part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.

He was raised in the north end of Boston and received his high school education at Boston Latin High School before entering Tufts University in 1964. Following his graduation he was employed by the United States Public Health Service. He received a master's degree from Tufts University in 1972. He graduated with a doctoral degree in Environmental Health Sciences from the Harvard School of Public Health in 1976. He was appointed director of the Air Quality Program for the Department of Environmental Protection from 1976‚Äì1978. He became Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1979 and continued in that position until 1984, through the terms of Governors Michael Dukakis and Edward J. King. The 1970s were a time of awakening for environmental protection and during his tenure the first acid rain regulations were developed, serving as a model for New England and eastern Canada. In 1984 he became the Director of the Center for Environmental Management at Tufts University, and in 1989 he was named the dean of a newly created Environmental Program at the same University. During his tenure this program established the first program in environmental literacy, a partnership between the university and industry. The most novel feature of this program was the incorporation of environmental literacy into the curricula of a broad spectrum of academic programs. Tufts University received the only Presidential Citation for development of this program in 1990. In 1993 Dr. Cortese, Senator John Kerry, and Teresa Heinz established Second Nature , a non-profit organization focused on making environmental sustainability a foundation of all learning and practice, i.e. teaching a balance between production and consumption in a way that preserves the delicate balance of nature. This organization has become an advocate for teaching sustainability at all institutions of higher learning through its incorporation into the curriculum. An important contribution Dr. Cortese made was the establishment of the American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment, an organization of more than 600 colleges and universities in every state and the District of Columbia who have committed to take action on climate and prepare students through research and education to solve the climate challenges of the 21st century . He served as President of Second Nature from its establishment in March 1993 through August 2012‚Äîa period of almost 20 years. In 2012 he became a principal of Sustainable Visions, LLC, a frequent consultant to higher education, industry and non-profit organizations on establishment of sustainability principles and programs. He is the co-coordinator of the Intentional Endowments Network that supports colleges, universities, and other mission-driven tax-exempt organizations in aligning their endowment investment practices with their mission, values, and sustainability goals. Dr. Cortese also joined the Board of Trustees of Green Mountain College in Poultney, Vermont, in 2008, a college focused on development of environmental sustainability, and in 2018 was named Chairman of the Board of Trustees . In addition, he is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He served as a trustee of Tufts University and was a founding member of the board of directors of The Natural Step US and of the Environmental Business Council of New England.

Formed in mid-1940, the brigade was assigned to the 7th Division initially, but later transferred to the 9th Division. It was primarily recruited from Victoria and South Australia. After training in Australia, in late 1940, the brigade deployed to the Middle East and subsequently took part in the Siege of Tobruk, defending the vital port town between April and October 1941. After being relieved, the brigade undertook garrison duties in Syria in the first half of 1942, before taking part in the First and Second Battles of El Alamein between July and November 1942. After returning to Australia in early 1943, the brigade fought against the Japanese in New Guinea in 1943 and 1944, including the capture of Lae and the Huon Peninsula campaign, and then took part in the fighting on Tarakan in 1945. It was disbanded in early 1946. History Formation and service in the Middle East The 26th Brigade was raised on 22 July 1940 and formed part of the all volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force that was raised for overseas service during World War II. Under the command of Brigadier Raymond Tovell, the brigade consisted of three infantry battalions: the 2/23rd, 2/24th and 2/48th. The first two of these were recruited from the state of Victoria, while the third came from South Australia. Training for the Victorian units was undertaken around Albury, New South Wales, and Bonegilla, Victoria, while the South Australians trained around Woodside, South Australia. In November, the brigade embarked for the Middle East, with the Victorians embarking from Melbourne aboard the transport Strathmore, while the South Australians embarked upon Stratheden from Outer Harbor. The two ships then rendezvoused at sea for the voyage to Egypt, via Ceylon. The brigade reached the Middle East in December 1940 and began training around Dimra Camp, in Palestine. Initially, it was assigned to the 7th Division, but in February 1941 it was transferred to the 9th Division with which it served throughout the war. In March 1941, the brigade was committed to the Western Desert campaign, following up the successes of the 6th Division against the Italians, occupying positions around Baracca. After the German offensive in Cyrenaica began, the brigade withdrew towards Tobruk, which fell under siege. Between April and October, the brigade formed part of the Allied garrison holding the vital port after it was surrounded. During this time, they held the western side of the defences, before taking part in fighting around an area that became known as The Salient in May. The 2/24th Battalion was heavily engaged during the fighting around Bianca, being reduced to half strength before the rest of the 26th Brigade, with reinforcements from the 18th Brigade restored the situation. Later, the brigade rotated around the perimeter, manning defensive positions throughout the siege. As British and Polish reinforcements arrived by sea, the 26th Brigade was withdrawn by the Royal Navy in late October. alt=Soldiers wearing helmets sit in a sandbagged position near a machine gun Arriving in Palestine via Alexandria, the brigade was established at Julis for reorganisation, rest and training. In early 1942, the 9th Division was sent to Syria to relieve the 7th Division, which had been ordered to return to Australia following Japan's entry into the war. The 26th Brigade subsequently undertook occupation duties around Tripoli and Majlaya. Renewed fighting in the Western Desert resulted in the brigade being hastily redeployed to Egypt in July 1942. As the German offensive threatened Alexandria, the 26th Brigade initially occupied defensive positions around Amiriya before being sent forward. Throughout July and August, they took part in the First Battle of El Alamein, during which they fought several defensive actions around Tel el Eisa. In September, the brigade prepared for a coming offensive, during which time Brigadier David Whitehead assumed command of the brigade. Throughout October and early November, the brigade took part in the Allied offensive during the Second Battle of El Alamein, during which it undertook several attacks, pushing towards the coast as the Australians were assigned the task of achieving the initial break-in for other Allied forces to exploit. After a period of consolidation, the 9th Division was withdrawn to Palestine, establishing camp at Beit Jirja. In late January 1943, it was subsequently moved to Egypt in preparation for embarkation to return to Australia. Fighting in New Guinea and on Tarakan Embarking from Port Tewfik aboard the Nieuw Amsterdam, the brigade reached Melbourne in late February. A period of leave followed, after which the brigade concentrated at Kairi, Queensland, where the 9th Division was converted to the jungle division establishment and undertook training to prepare it for combat in New Guinea. This included amphibious warfare training around Cairns and then Milne Bay in July and August. In early September 1943, the brigade took part in operations to capture Lae. The brigade was in reserve for the initial amphibious assault, except for the 2/23rd Battalion which landed after the first wave from the 20th Brigade; the remainder of the 26th arrived as follow-on elements and then joined the advance along the coast towards Lae. The advance was slow, hampered by numerous river crossings and by 15 September Lae fell to the 7th Division, which had advanced from Nadzab. After a period of rest, the brigade joined operations on the Huon Peninsula. As the Australians advanced inland from Finschhafen the brigade fought significant actions at Sattelberg and Wareo, before playing a supporting role during the drive on Sio. After being relieved by Militia troops from the 5th Division, the brigade returned to Australia for rest in January ‚Äì February 1944. Troops from the 2/24th fighting on Tarakan, 1945 In May 1944, the brigade concentrated at Ravenshoe, Queensland, on the Atherton Tablelands after a period of leave. A period of uncertainty followed regarding the future employment of the Australian Army in the Pacific as US troops took the lead in the theatre around this time. Large numbers of personnel were discharged from the brigade's constituent units as part of a partial demobilisation to return soldiers to civilian industry; other personnel who had seen considerable active service were discharged due to medical reasons. They were replaced by largely inexperienced personnel and so a period of intense training was undertaken. Eventually, in the final stages of the war, the brigade was assigned to the Borneo campaign. Within this campaign, the 26th Brigade was tasked with capturing Tarakan to secure an airfield for future operations in the area. In March 1945, the brigade moved to Morotai Island as part of a preliminary move ahead of the attack. On 1 May, the 2/23rd and 2/48th Battalions landed at Lingkas and the Australians began advancing inland. The 2/24th Battalion and the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion consolidated positions around the beachhead while the 2/23rd secured the oilfield around Parmusian. Japanese resistance grew after the initial landing and fighting in bunkers and tunnels took place for several days before the high ground around the beachhead was secured on 4 May. The heavily damaged airfield was captured the following day, but the fighting in the hinterland continued for another six weeks, with minor actions continuing until the end of the war in mid-August. Following the conclusion of hostilities, the 26th Brigade remained on Tarakan for several months undertaking garrison duties while personnel awaited repatriation to Australia for demobilisation. Initially there was a shortage of shipping available, which delayed the process. In October, around 300 personnel from the brigade volunteered for service with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan, forming part of the 66th Infantry Battalion. This unit later became part of the Royal Australian Regiment in the post war period. Throughout November and December 1945, drafts of personnel from the brigade embarked for Australia as ships became available. Finally, the 26th Brigade was disbanded in Brisbane on 25 January 1946. Around 9,447 personnel served in the brigade's three infantry battalions. Casualties amongst these men were high, with 764 being killed in action, 2,301 wounded and 415 captured. Another 244 died of their wounds, or from accidents or other causes. Five soldiers assigned to the brigade received the Victoria Cross during the war. Four of these ‚Äì Stan Gurney, Bill Kibby, Percy Gratwick and Tom Derrick ‚Äì served with the 2/48th Battalion, while the other, Jack Mackey, served with the 2/3rd Pioneers, which was temporarily assigned to the brigade during its final campaign of the war.

He was a descendant of the Rehoboth Carpenter family. His father was Stephen Carpenter and mother Jane Thurston of Rehoboth, Massachusetts. Benajah Carpenter was an apprenticed Rhode Island chairmaker until 1771. Carpenter is sometimes described as a \\"mariner.\\" Although unsubstantiated, this may have been historically accurate. Private mariners of the period were those who possessed knowledge of cannon and artillery, a necessary part of early American shipping and seaborne trade.discussed in Gallagher, The Battle of Brooklyn, 1776, p. 56 Carpenter may have been a merchant of the same wares he manufactured. The coast of Rhode Island was a center of such activity. Early Rhode Island newspapers contain notices of Carpenter's own difficulties with a chairmaker apprentice in 1774. The activities of Benajah Carpenter abruptly changed with the coming of the American Revolution. He became a captain-lieutenant of artillery under Colonel Henry Knox and certainly participated in the Siege of Boston. As the struggle moved to New York, Carpenter was ordered by General George Washington to serve with General William Alexander of Pennsylvania (\\"Lord Stirling\\") and his Maryland contingent prior to the fateful morning of August 27. Henry Johnston in his Campaign of 1776, describes Carpenter as commanding the two-gun battery that opposed the British under Grant. Johnston surmises that it was Carpenter's battery that caused British light troops to retire to their main line. This was the first instance, Johnston tells us, where the newly minted American army met the British \\"in the open field\\" in classic military formation. We are told they \\"proved themselves the best of soldiers.\\" During the subsequent long hours of battle Benajah Carpenter was among the day's casualties. Carpenter's military cap is extant and can be seen at the Rhode Island Varnum House Museum and Varnum Memorial Armory.

A costume designer is a person who designs costumes for a film, stage production or television show. The role of the costume designer is to create the characters' outfits/costumes and balance the scenes with texture and colour, etc. The costume designer works alongside the director, scenic, lighting designer, sound designer, and other creative personnel. The costume designer may also collaborate with hair stylist, wig master, or makeup artist. In European theatre, the role is different, as the theatre designer usually designs both costume and scenic elements. Designers typically seek to enhance a character's personality, and to create an evolving plot of color, changing social status, or period through the visual design of garments and accessories. They may distort or enhance the body‚Äîwithin the boundaries of the director's vision. The designer must ensure that the designs let the actor move as the role requires. The actor must execute the director's blocking of the production without damaging the garments. Garments must be durable and washable, especially for plays with extended runs or films with near-real time pacing (meaning that most costumes will not change between scenes) but whose principal photography phase may stretch across several weeks. The designer must consult not only with the director, but the set and lighting designers to ensure that all elements of the overall production design work together. The designer must possess strong artistic capabilities and a thorough knowledge of pattern development, draping, drafting, textiles and fashion history. The designer must understand historical costuming, and the movement style and poise that period dress may require. History During the late-19th century, company managers in the US usually selected costumes for a show. Many were pulled from a rental house; few were designed. Though designers in other theatrical disciplines were recognized, few who specialized in costumes were. The few that were included Caroline Siedle, C. Wilhelm, Percy Anderson, and Mrs. John Alexander. They sometimes even received credit on the title page of a playbill rather than in the back.King, Kimball. Western Drama through the Ages: A Student Reference Guide. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2007. 534. Print. In the 20th century, film costume designers like Edith Head and Adrian became well known. Later, those working in television like Nolan Miller (Dynasty), Janie Bryant (Mad Men), and Patricia Field (Sex and the City) became more prominent, some becoming authors and having their own clothing and jewelry lines. Types of costume designers Professional costume designers generally fall into three types: freelance, residential, and academic. *Freelance designers are hired for a specific production by a film, theatre, dance or opera company. A freelancer is traditionally paid in three instalments: Upon hire, on delivery of final renderings, and opening night of the production. Freelancers are not obligated to any exclusivity in what projects they work on, and may design for several productions hired by a specific theatre, dance or opera company for an extended series of productions. This can be as short as a summer stock contract, or may be for many years. A residential designer's contract may limit the amounts of freelance work they are allowed to accept. Unlike the freelancer, a residential designer is consistently \\"on location\\" at the theater‚Äîat hand to work with costume studio and other collaborators. Residential designers tend to be more established than strict freelancers, but this is not always the case. *An academic designer is one who holds professorship at a school. The designer is primarily an instructor, but may also act as a residential designer to varying degrees. They are often free to freelance, as their schedule allows. In the past, professors of costume design were mostly experienced professionals that may or may not have had formal post-graduate education, but it has now become increasingly common to require a professor to have at least a Master of Fine Arts in order to teach. Both residential and academic designers are generally also required to act as Shop Master or Mistress of an onsite costume shop, in addition to designing productions. In a resident theatre, there is almost always a shop staff of stitchers , drapers, cutters and craft artisans. In an academic environment the shop \\"staff\\" is generally students, who are learning about costume design and construction. Most universities require costume design students to work a specified number of hours in the shop as part of their course work. Unions There are two unions that costume designers can belong to: Costume Designers Guild, Local 892 is one union that represents Costume Designers, as well as International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and United Scenic Artists.Local 829 usa829.com Many costumers belong to the Motion Picture Costumers Union, Local 705 and represent every position within the costume department (except the costume designer). Local 705 represents Costume Supervisors, Key Costumers, Costumers, Tailor/Seamstress, Ager/Dyer, Cutter/Fitters, Costume House Employees and Commercial Costumers.Local 705 motionpicturecostumers.org See also *Costume design *Filmmaking *List of film formats *List of motion picture-related topics References  External links  * Costume Designers Guild Category:Designers Category:Fashion occupations Category:Filmmaking occupations Category:Mass media occupations Category:Costume designers ","title":"Costume designer"},{"id":"8122602","text":"Logo of the organization Based in San Francisco, California, the Harvey Milk Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer Democratic Club is a chapter of the Stonewall Democrats, named after LGBT politician and activist Harvey Milk. Believing that the existing Alice B. Toklas LGBT Democratic Club would never support him in his political aspirations, Milk co-founded the club under the name \\"San Francisco Gay Democratic Club\\" in the wake of his unsuccessful 1976 campaign for the California State Assembly. Joining Milk in forming the club were a number of the city's activists, including Harry Britt, Dick Pabich, Jim Rivaldo, and first club president Chris Perry.Shilts (1982), p. 150 The club set forth the following as its organizing statement: > No decisions which affect our lives should be made without the gay voice > being heard. We want our fair share of city services. We want openly gay > people appointed and elected to city offices‚Äîpeople who reflect the > diversity of our community. We want the schools of San Francisco to provide > full exposure to and positive appreciation of gay lifestyles. We are asking > no more than we deserve: We will not settle for less. History One of the club's early actions was to demonstrate at a speech given by Vice President Walter Mondale in Golden Gate Park on June 17, 1977. When Mondale began speaking about human rights in Latin America, demonstrators held up signs demanding a statement on human rights in the United States. When a demonstrator verbally challenged Mondale to say something about gay rights, Mondale angrily left the stage.Shilts (1982), p. 161 Following the assassination of Harvey Milk in 1978, the club changed its name to the Harvey Milk Democratic Club in his memory. The club bills itself as one of the largest Democratic clubs in San Francisco. The club was an inadvertent catalyst of a journalistic scandal for CBS. CBS News producers George Crile and Grace Diekhaus manipulated footage of an appearance by Dianne Feinstein and included it in the 1980 documentary Gay Power, Gay Politics. The National News Council found that this manipulation was a breach of journalistic ethics.Rutledge, p. 152 With the onset of the AIDS epidemic, the Milk Club was an early advocate of closing down the city's gay bathhouses. The club also created some of the earliest safe sex education materials in the country.Shilts (1987), p. 280 SFPD Apology Shortly before San Francisco's annual Pride parade in 2019, a year that marked the 40th anniversary of the White Night riots, the Milk Club's Executive Board penned an open letter calling on the San Francisco Police Department to apologize for historic acts of violence against the city's LGBTQ community, including the ACT UP Castro Sweep in 1989, the White Night Riot in 1979, and the Compton's Cafeteria riot in 1966. During San Francisco's 2019 Pride parade, the SFPD engaged in a violent confrontation with a group of LGBTQ protesters who blocked the parade, calling for an end to corporate sponsorships of Pride. The Milk Club released another letter shortly after, condemning the SFPD's actions at Pride. ‚ÄúThe irony of SFPD committing acts of brutality against peaceful protesters of the Resistance Contingent at the San Francisco Pride Parade on the 50th Anniversary of Stonewall is not lost on us,‚Äù the Milk Club wrote. ‚ÄúIt warrants outrage and swift recourse.‚Äù On August 26, 2019, SFPD leadership held a community meeting during which Chief William Scott said, \\"we the members of the San Francisco Police Department are here to reflect and apologize for our past actions against the LGBTQ community. We want to listen to you and want to truly hear you, we will atone for our past.‚Äù While Scott's apology was met with \\"exuberant applause from the room,\\" some attendees at the meeting expressed their concern about the ways in which the SFPD currently discriminates against LGBTQ people. Anubis Daugherty, a young LGBTQ community member who was homeless for six years, told Scott that LGBTQ people are disproportionately caught up in sweeps of homeless communities in The City. ‚ÄúI was born here, I was raised here,‚Äù Daugherty said. ‚ÄúIf you want to truly apologize for something you have to stop what you‚Äôre doing.‚Äù Notes See also *Alice B.

He is also leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) since 1979. Barzani was born in Mahabad, Imperial State of Iran in the self-declared Republic of Mahabad and succeeded his father Mustafa Barzani as leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party in 1979. Working closely with his brother Idris Barzani until Idris's death, Barzani and various other Kurdish groups fought the forces of the Iraqi government in Baghdad during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Barzani has been a key leader in the historic Kurdish transition from a rebellious and repressed minority in an isolated highly traditional part of Iraq, to a prosperous and widely recognized autonomous region following the 2003 collapse of the Ba'ath regime. Michael R. Fischbach, ed. Biographical encyclopedia of the modern Middle East and North Africa (Gale Group, 2008) pp 158-161. President of Kurdistan Region A young Massoud Barzani with Iraqi Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim A major result of Saddam Hussein's defeat in the Gulf War (1991) and Operation Provide Comfort was the ultimate establishment of Kurdish control over their traditional homeland in northern Iraq, known as Iraqi Kurdistan and \\"South Kurdistan\\". Just a few months after the creation of the autonomous zone, free elections (a first in Iraq) were held in 1992. The two main Kurdish parties, namely Barzani's KDP and the Jalal Talabani-led Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), split the vote, and subsequently split the government ministries evenly. In May 1994, however, fighting broke out between the Peshmerga of the PUK and of the KDP. On August 31, 1996 Barzani called on the assistance of Saddam Hussein's regime to help him combat the PUK, which was receiving Iranian assistance. With the aid of the Iraqi army, the KDP drove the PUK from Iraqi Kurdistan's major cities. The PUK eventually regrouped and retook Suleimani and parts of Hawler province. An end to the civil war was brokered in 1998 in the Washington Peace Accords, leaving the Kurdish zone divided between the KDP in the Northwest and PUK in the Southeast.Iraqi Kurdistan: Political Development and Emergent Democracy, Routledge/Curzon, 2003 After the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the KDP and PUK gradually established a unified regional government. Barzani became a member of the Iraqi Governing Council and was the president of the council in April 2004. He was elected as the President of Iraqi Kurdistan by the Parliament of Iraqi Kurdistan in June 2005.President George W. Bush talks to reporters as he welcomes Masoud Barzani to the Oval Office at the White House, Tuesday, 25 October 2005 As President of the Kurdistan Region, Barzani has made official visits to several countries and met dignitaries of the likes of US President George W. Bush,, UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Pope at the Vatican, the Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in Rome and King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia in Riyadh. In July 2009, in the first direct elections for the presidency of the autonomous Kurdistan Region, Masoud Barzani was reelected as president by a popular ballot, receiving 69.6% of the votes. The elections were closely monitored by international observers and the Iraqi Electoral Commission. In August 2013, after the expiration of his 8-year term, the parliament extended his presidency for another two years, and he continued in the role even beyond this extension. Masoud Barzani was one of the eight candidates shortlisted in the Time magazine's 2014 Person of the Year, for his efforts to push for Kurdish independence with the ongoing fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. 2017 independence referendum Baranzi meets with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in January 2019 On 7 June 2017, Barzani had announced that Kurdistan Region would hold an independence referendum on 25 September 2017. On the day following the referendum, 26 September 2017, he announced that the referendum had been a success in seeking independence, and called on neighboring countries to be open to future dialogue. The Iraqi government rejected the results of the referendum. On 15 October, units of the Iraqi security forces and Popular Mobilization Forces entered the Kurdish-held city of Kirkuk, forcing a withdrawal of the Peshmerga and prompting similar withdrawals across other contested cities of northern Iraq.Martin Chulov. \\"Kurdish forces abandon long-held lands to Iraqi army and Shia fighters\\". The Guardian, 17 October 2017. Following the failure of the referendum and the Peshmerga's territorial losses, Barzani announced on 29 October that he would step down as the President of Kurdistan Region. He is still the president of the KDP and receives Ambassadors. Criticism Members of the Barzani family allegedly control a large number of commercial enterprises in Iraqi Kurdistan, with a gross value of several billion dollars, although no evidence of such ownership by Masoud Barzani himself exists. While accusations of corruption against both the KDP-Barzanis and the PUK-Talabanis are often levied by both Kurdish sources and international observers like Michael Rubin, President Barzani on several occasions has denied involvement in any commercial enterprises. Insufficient financial transparency in the region serves to both exacerbate the accusations and hamper efforts to find any evidence of malfeasance. In July 2010 the opposition paper Rozhnama accused the Barzani- led KDP of pocketing large sums from illegal oil-smuggling. In December 2005, Kamal Qadir, a Kurdish legal scholar with Austrian citizenship, was arrested in Iraqi Kurdistan for a series of articles criticizing Barzani's government and family. He was charged with defamation and sentenced to thirty years' imprisonment. He was released in 2006 following international pressure from Amnesty International, Reporters Without Borders, and the government of Austria. In May 2010 the journalist Sardasht Osman was killed after criticising the Barzani family. Barzani's detractors say he is tribal, conservative, and unworldly, often playing traditional tribal roles. However his administration in Arbil successfully built modern transportation infrastructures, attracted foreign business investment, and prioritized education.Fischbach, ed.

In the 24th-century science fiction universe of Star Trek, the crew of the must contend with identity thieves in the Delta Quadrant.  Director  This episode was directed by Levar Burton, who directed several other episodes in this television series. Burton played Geordi La Forge, first appearing in the series Star Trek: The Next Generation and reprising that role in the episode Timeless (Star Trek: Voyager). Plot Two people beam down to a mining colony. They introduce themselves as Captain Janeway and Tuvok, but they are not. The miners, unaware of any deception, agree to a trade: \\"Janeway\\" promises to beam down a supply of dilithium in exchange for a load of bolomite. She and \\"Tuvok\\" are well-practiced in their roles and knowledgeable about their characters; the miners trust them and are impressed with their generosity: \\"Janeway\\" says she plans to use the bolomite to help a colony of orphans. Back aboard their ship, \\"Janeway\\" and crew receive their shipment and speed away without delivering any dilithium. The scam was a success. Meanwhile, on Voyager the genuine crew is having problems. A faulty component in Neelix's galley has disrupted systems all over the ship. It seems he picked up the component as a trade, in exchange for a load of supplies that he sent to a shelter for orphans, and failed to test it before installing it. In the middle of the mess the ship gets a call from Orek, the head of mining operations at a nearby planet. He is angry that Janeway has run off without dropping off the dilithium she had promised him. Naturally, she has no idea what he's talking about. Orek shows her a recording of \\"Janeway\\" making the agreement with the miners. At the mention of orphans, an annoyed Janeway starts putting the pieces together. She sits Neelix down and listens as he explains where he got his kitchen component. He and Paris encountered a nun called Dala a few weeks back, and got to know her and her companion Mobar (a pair who look suspiciously like \\"Janeway\\" and \\"Tuvok\\"). They brought the two on board the Delta Flyer to negotiate a trade, giving them an opportunity to surreptitiously download information about Voyager. They then used what they had learned to pose as Janeway and Tuvok. Orek agrees to let Janeway hunt down the impostors, who happen to be right in the middle of cheating someone else. The newest victim realizes he is being tricked, and seizes Dala's ship. Assuming Voyager is in on the scam, he fires at that ship as well. Janeway attempts to turn the tables and seize both ships so she can explain, but is fired on again. Dala's ship gets away, but the real Janeway beams her impostor aboard first, and Voyager also gets away. Neelix meets the prisoner in the brig, trying to find a spark of honesty in her. Just as he appears to be making friends with her, she grabs his phaser and runs. Already familiar with the layout of the ship and the workings of the Delta Flyer, she escapes, steals the Flyer, and returns to her co-conspirators. But this was actually Janeway's plan: Paris and the Doctor are hiding on board the Flyer. Preparing to flee the area, the thieves return to the caves where they have stashed all the booty stolen from their numerous victims. Dala then surprises her cohorts by turning on them. She subdues them with a weapon and then contacts Voyager, which is waiting for her call. When her fellow thieves demand an explanation, she adjusts her mobile emitter -- she is really the Doctor in disguise. The real Tuvok arrives and takes the thieves captive; the real Dala awakens on the Delta Flyer, where Paris is holding her at bay. Voyager returns all the stolen goods to their rightful owners.

Males can weigh from 11.5 kg up to almost 14 kg (25 to 31 lbs), while the females range between about 8 to 10.6 kg (17.6 to 23 lbs). They are very agile and are able to leap 9 metres (30 ft) down to another branch and have been known to drop as far as 18 metres (59 ft) to the ground without injury.Cronin (2000). Habitat This very elusive (or \\"cryptic\\") tree-kangaroo is found in both mountain and lowland tropical rain forests south of Cooktown, Queensland to just north of the Daintree River; an area of only about 70 km by 50 km (44 miles by 31 miles). It is also occasionally found in sclerophyll woodlands. It lives almost completely on the leaves of a wide range rainforest trees, notably Schefflera actinophylla (the umbrella tree), vines, ferns and various wild fruits.Martin (2005). Diet The Bennett's tree-kangaroo is a herbivore. It mostly eats leaves off 33 different plant species. Now that it is rarely hunted by Aborigines, its main predators are pythons and the dingo. It is thought to be the closest tree-kangaroo to the ancestral form.Martin et al. (1996), pp. 94‚Äì95. Physical description Bennett's tree-kangaroo mother and baby Like other tree-kangaroos it has longer forelimbs and shorter hindlimbs than terrestrial kangaroos and a long bushy tail. It is mostly dark brown above and lighter fawn on chin, throat and lower abdomen. The forehead and muzzle are greyish. The feet and hands are black. The tail has a black patch at the base and a light patch on the upper part. The ears are short and rounded Conservation status Although the IUCN still rates the status of Bennett's tree-kangaroo as \\"near threatened\\", its numbers seem to be increasing and its range expanding. Sightings have become far more common in recent years. In 2006 a dead specimen was found along Amos Bay Road, just south of Cooktown. The increases in numbers and range are likely because most of its range is now protected under World Heritage legislation, and it is no longer hunted by Aboriginal people. Both Roger Martin and Lewis Roberts, two of the world's top experts on this species, agree that it should now be classified as \\"secure.\\" Footnotes References * Cronin, Leonard (2000).

It was eventually absorbed by the New York Central. Background Like other growing towns and cities, Batavia needed access to affordable and reliable commercial transportation resources. The Erie Canal had appeared to be the solution but it did not reach Batavia. Instead, canal designers selected Eighteen Mile Creek as the area to scale the formidable Niagara Escarpment. The Tonawanda's two wood-burning locomotives were delivered to the area by canal boat five years after the company was chartered. Genesis The Tonawanda Railroad was chartered on 24 April 1832 for the purpose of building a rail line from Rochester to Attica and eventually Buffalo. Initially, the route was to have included Scottsville, Mumford, Caledonia, and Le Roy. A more direct route to Batavia was adopted which left out these towns. They were later served by construction of the Scottsville & LeRoy Railroad. This was the second railroad to be built in New York State, following the Mohawk and Hudson, the Albany-to-Schenectady road, which began 17 April 1827. This railroad was named after Tonawanda Creek, which flows through Batavia. Historian Edward Dunn questions the derivation of the naming, as the eleven miles of line constructed up the valley of the Tonawanda Creek to Attica was an afterthought.Edward T Dunn, A History of Railroads in Western New York, 2000, p.4 This part was constructed in 1841, well after the company was founded and named. Dunn noted that developers intended simply to build a connection with the Attica and Buffalo Railroad. With the completion in 1853 of the shorter and more direct Buffalo and Rochester Railroad, the Attica and Buffalo was sold to the Erie Railroad. Construction The line reached South Byron by 1836, and service with horse cars began. The first primary section, 31¬Ω miles from Rochester southwest to Batavia, opened 5 May 1837; the rest of the line followed the valley of the Tonawanda Creek to Attica by 1842, opening on 8 January 1843. The chief engineer for the project was Elisha Johnson. Operation In 1888, the Batavia newspaper wrote: > \\"The Tonawanda railroad was intended to run from Rochester to Buffalo, via > of Batavia. In 1836 the road was completed to South Byron, about eight miles > Northeast of Batavia, and cars were run as far as that point, horses > furnishing the motive power.

On 7 December 1850, the Tonawanda Railroad and the Attica and Buffalo Railroad merged to form the Buffalo and Rochester Railroad.The name has been seen as both Buffalo and Rochester Railroad and Rochester and Buffalo Railroad. That railroad was one of ten that merged on 17 May 1853 to form the New York Central Railroad. This Tonawanda was not related to the similarly named Tonawanda Valley Railroad, the Tonawanda Valley Extension Railroad, or the Tonawanda Valley and Cuba Railroad, all three of which were merged into the new Tonawanda Valley and Cuba Railroad in 1881. It went bankrupt three years later, after having built sections of its route over unstable quicksand.

The entire line became part of the New York Central Railroad and Conrail through leases, mergers, and takeovers, and was assigned to CSX Transportation in the 1999 breakup of Conrail. In the 1850s, New York Central Railroad took over the line in an effort to build new direct routes. The railroad built signal bridges along the line to increase safety and capacity.

It is designed as an alternative to the conventional A-Level route, which takes two years to complete. Course structure The UFP was conceived as an alternative to A-Level courses for international students wishing to gain entry into British universities. Although the structure of A-Levels has been changed in recent years to adopt a more holistic, coursework-based approach, the University Foundation Programme offers still less emphasis on end-of-year exam performance and as such is considered more manageable for students whose first language is not English. The course runs for 32 weeks and is divided into three Phases. Phase I and II are each 12 weeks long, and Phase III is eight weeks long. Students study six modules in total, spread over the duration of the course to provide an even workload. Three of these are core Minor modules (English, Mathematics, and Information Technology) while the remaining three are Major modules, relevant to the student's future degree programme. The Major Academic modules will vary from one course provider to another, but students can expect to study modules in any of the following areas: accounting, sociology, psychology, economics, law, further mathematics, physics, business studies etc. The course is assessed on the basis of credit points, and has been carefully designed so that Minor and Major modules each carry a number of points for both coursework and examinations in each of the three Phases of the University Foundation Programme. The overall allocation of points for the course is divided on a ratio of 40:60, for coursework and examinations respectively. However, the allocation varies for individual modules and Phases depending on the nature of the subject and most suitable method of assessment. Students who maintain a steady workload throughout each of the three Phases of the University Foundation Programme and who acknowledge the importance of both coursework and examinations will therefore benefit; as such, the course is considered more aligned to study and testing habits on most modern university degree courses. The course runs for up to one academic year. A student starting the course in September of a given year will usually be able to start university in October the following year. Some institutions offer a faster-track course; students on these programmes enrol in January, graduate in August and commence University in October. Such fast-track courses are referred to as advanced or intensive programmes which are much more demanding in terms of work load. Some providers of the University Foundation course or Programme will have different entry points throughout the year, offering students greater flexibility. The total duration of such courses will still add up to 9 months of full-time study. Where the course leads Students graduating the University Foundation Programme are eligible for entry into many British universities. They are not eligible for entry into Oxford or Cambridge, as these institutions usually receive excessive numbers of applicants through the conventional A-Level route.

But what above all contributed to his extraordinary success throughout southern Spain was the 'inspired' character of his preaching. His 'natural' ignorance ‚Äì which was perhaps exaggerated by those who extolled him ‚Äì signified that each of his sermons seemed to be altogether the work of the Holy Spirit. This began in M√°laga in 1773.\\" He was beatified by the Catholic Church in 1894. Life Early life Jos√© Francisco L√≥pez-Caama√±o y Garc√≠a P√©rez was born in C√°diz in 1743.‚ÄúBlessed Diego‚Äù. New Catholic Dictionary. CatholicSaints.Info. 22 October 2012 His lineage dated from the Visigoth kings. His mother died when he was 9 years old. Later his father moved the family to the city of Grazalema, where he entered the local school run by the Dominican Order. Though of noble ancestry, as a youth Joseph could make no progress at school, receiving the nickname of the \\"dunce of Cadiz\\". Later a classmate, a Dominican friar named Antonio Querero, testified how difficult study had been for him. Initially rejected by the Observant Franciscan friars due to this perceived limitation of intellect, L√≥pez-Caama√±o was later accepted by the Capuchin friars and, at the age of 15, entered their novitiate in Seville, at which time he was given the name Didacus Joseph. He was professed as a member of the Order on 31 March 1759. He was ordained to the priesthood in Carmona in 1766, for which he prepared himself by an extremely ascetic life. Capuchin preacher In 1771, after further training in homiletics, he was assigned to one of the teams of friars who would preach parish missions to residents of isolated, rural villages, which was a major focus of the Capuchins of that era. His biographers stated that the congregations marveled at the tender love he displayed to the crucifix he would hold while preaching, and the singular power of his words, which swayed his audiences and left an impression on their lives. He wandered throughout the entire peninsula on foot, preaching in this way to the various communities he encountered on the road. Spain was undergoing changes in its intellectual climate, as the influence of the Enlightenment began to spread in the upper classes of the country. Didacus became a major force in promoting the traditional devotions and beliefs of Catholicism as part of the identity of the nation, and is seen as an early integrist in the development of Spanish culture, opposing Liberal Catholicism. He also was a strong critic of the policy of consumerism, being promoted in the universities and some government circles. For this teaching, he was denounced to the Spanish Inquisition for attacking royal prerogatives. In turn, he accused the proponents of new economic policies and the secularization of Spanish society of heresy. He preached at the Royal Court in 1783, but found that he had no effect on the nobility. Leaving Madrid in disappointment, he later wrote: \\"I do not want the royal couple to remember me\\". Didacus was appointed an official of the Inquisition, the synodal examiner for almost all Spanish dioceses and an honorary canon. The University of Granada conferred upon him the honorary degrees of Master of Arts and doctorates in Theology and canon law. A collection of his sermons numbers 3,000. Death and veneration Didacus died in 1801, apparently as a result of yellow fever, at the age of 58, in Ronda, M√°laga. His remains are kept for veneration in an urn in the small, simple chapel of Our Lady of Peace () in Ronda where he died, on the square now named in the friar's honor. He was beatified by Pope Leo XIII in 1894. Hagiography The Chapel of Blessed Didacus, located on the site of his birthplace and family home in Cadiz This unlearned man became a celebrated preacher in Spain. During his sermon one day, a child shouted aloud in the church: \\"Mother, mother, see the dove resting on the shoulder of Father Didacus! I could preach like that too if a dove told me all that I should say!\\" Didacus prayed devotedly before his sermons, even scourging himself to the point of blood, in order to draw down God's mercy upon the people. Once when his superior chided him because of the austerity of his life, Didacus Joseph replied: \\"Ah, Father, my sins and the sins of the people compel me to do it. Those who have been charged with the conversion of sinners must remember that the Lord has imposed upon them the sins of all their clients. By means of our penances we should atone for the sins of our fellowmen and thus preserve ourselves and them from eternal death. It would hardly be too much if we shed the last drop of our blood for their conversion.\\" Three miraculous events are recorded of his life, all having taken place in the main square of Cadiz. In one, he was able to save the life of a builder who had fallen off a roof, stopping his fall with one hand. On another occasion, a priest passed him while en route to administer the Last Sacraments to a dying person. When the acolyte accompanying the priest pointed out to the friar that he had not removed his hood (the customary form of reverence to the Blessed Sacrament which the priest would be carrying), Didacus told him, \\"Tell the priest that the ciborium is empty\\". This turned out to be the case. On yet another occasion, a heavy rainstorm hit the city. The square, where Didacus happened to be preaching at the time, was the only spot on which no rain fell.

They formed the Holy Alliance. They were dated 1 March 1814, although the actual signings took place on 9 or 19 March. The treaty was intended to draw the powers of the Sixth Coalition into a closer alliance in the event that France rejected the peace terms they had recently offered. Each agreed to put 150,000 soldiers in the field against France and to guarantee the European peace (once obtained) against French aggression for twenty years.John A. Cannon, \\"Chaumont, Treaty of\\", in A Dictionary of British History, 1st rev. ed. (Oxford UP, 2009). Following discussions in late February 1814, representatives of Austria, Prussia, Russia, and Great Britain reconvened a meeting at Chaumont, Haute-Marne on 1 March 1814. The resulting Treaty of Chaumont was signed on 9 or 19 March 1814, (although dated 1 March), by Emperor Alexander I, Emperor Francis II (with Metternich), King Frederick William III, and British Foreign Secretary Viscount Castlereagh. The treaty called for Napoleon to give up all conquests, thus reverting France to itay pre-revolutionary borders, in exchange for a cease-fire. If Napoleon rejected the treaty, the Allies pledged to continue the war. The following day, Napoleon rejected the treaty, ending his last chance of a negotiated settlement.Paul W. Schroeder, The Transformation of European Politics 1763-1848 (1994) pp 501-4 The decisions were again ratified and put into effect by the Congress of Vienna of 1814‚Äì1815. The terms were largely written by Lord Castlereagh, the British foreign minister, who offered cash subsidies to keep the other armies in the field against Napoleon. Key terms included the establishment of a confederated Germany, the division into independent states, the restoration of the Bourbon kings of Spain, and the enlargement of the Netherlands to include what in 1830 became modern Belgium. The treaty became the cornerstone of the European Alliance which formed the balance of power for decades.

Krupska was born in Fall River, Massachusetts in August 1921. She originally trained for the ballet and began her professional career in the 1930s in such companies as the Philadelphia Ballet.Grace Roberts, The Borzoi Book of Ballets (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1946), 282. She made her Broadway debut in the original cast of Agnes de Mille's Oklahoma! (1943), later taking over the role of Dream Laurey (which she also performed on tour). She quickly became one of de Mille's regular assistant choreographers, working on Allegro (1947), Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1949), Out of This World (1950), and The Girl in Pink Tights (1954). Krupska also assisted de Mille on the ballet Fall River Legend (1948); de Mille's insistence that Krupska be allowed to dance one performance as Lizzie Borden led to an explosive quarrel with Alicia Alonso, unbeknownst to Krupska herself.Paula Durbin, \\"Alicia Alonso: Habanera Assoluta,\\" A Woman's Gaze: Essays on Latin American Artists, ed. Marjorie Agosin (Fredonia, NY: White Pine Press, 1998), 251-52. Before switching to choreography full-time, Krupska also appeared on Broadway in The King and I and the original Can-Can (1953). Krupska's best-known work as a choreographer is The Most Happy Fella (1956), for which she received her first Tony nomination. (She also staged the 1959 revival.) None of her other Broadway shows were hits, although she earned another Tony nomination for The Happiest Girl in the World (1961). Krupska also choreographed Shoestring Revue (1955), off-Broadway shows, and the jazz ballet Points on Jazz (staged by American Ballet Theatre in 1961).

Mass mobilization is defined as a process that engages and motivates a wide range of partners and allies at national and local levels to raise awareness of and demand for a particular development objective through face-to-face dialogue. Members of institutions, community networks, civic and religious groups and others work in a coordinated way to reach specific groups of people for dialogue with planned messages. In other words, social mobilization seeks to facilitate change through a range of players engaged in interrelated and complementary efforts. The process usually takes the form of large public gatherings such as mass meetings, marches, parades, processions and demonstrations. Those gatherings usually are part of a protest action. Mass mobilization is often used by grassroots-based social movements, including revolutionary movements, but can also become a tool of elites and the state itself. In a study of over 200 violent revolutions and over 100 non-violent campaigns, Erica Chenoweth has shown that civil disobedience is the by far most powerful way of affecting public policy. She identified that the active participation of around 3.5% of a population will ensure serious political change.The '3.5% rule': How a small minority can change the world, BBC by David Robson, 14 May 2019If 3.5% of the US Gets on Board With Climate Protesting, Change Will Happen, Vice.com, by Geoff Dembicki, 8 October 2019  Mass mobilization for social movements  Social movements are groups that protest against social or political issues. Different social movements try to make the public and politicians aware of different social problems. For social movements it is important to solve collective action problems. When social movements protest for something in the interest of the whole society, it is easier for the individual to not protest. The individual will benefit the outcome, but will not risk anything by participating in the protest. This is also known as the free-rider problem. Social movements must convince people to join the movement to solve this problem. Examples Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War. During the Vietnam war, supporters and opponents of the war mobilized for protests. Social movements against the war were groups of students or veterans. These groups did not believe the war was justified and that the United States had to pull out the troops stationed there. To counter these protests, president Richard Nixon addressed the 'silent majority' , the people who did support the war, to organize counter protests supporting the war. Yellow vests movement is a social movement originated in Paris. The protests started when president Emmanuel Macron announced a fuel tax increase. Protesters saw this as a tax on the working class, the people in the countryside who have to drive to work. At first, the movement was successful. A lot of people joined and a majority of the population supported it. After the first weeks, the movement fell apart and some factions became violent. The number of protesters and support of the population decreased.  Government mass mobilization  Governments can promote mass mobilization to support the causes they promote. Many governments attempt to mobilize the population to participate in elections and other voting events. In particular, it is important for political parties in any country to be able to mobilize voters in order to gain support for their party, which affects voter turnout in general. Examples Nazi Germany applied mass mobilization techniques to win support for their policies. The Nazi Party mobilized the population with mass meetings, parades, and other gatherings. These events appealed to the people's emotions. North Korea frequently employs mass mobilization to convene its people to publicly express loyalty around important events and holidays. Mobilization is also used to acquire workforce for tasks such as construction, farm work, keeping public places clean, and urgent disaster relief. Mass mobilization is also used to acquire hard currency. Participating in mobilization campaigns is mandatory and failure to appear may result in penalties. However, for some, it is possible to bribe themselves out of the duty. Mass mobilization in social media The effect of social media on mass mobilization can both be negative and positive. Cyberoptimists believe social media make protests easier to organize. Political ideas spread quickly on social media and everyone can participate in online political actions. Ruijgruk identified four mechanisms the internet helps mobilizing people in authoritarian regimes. * It reduces the risks of the opposition. To be politically active online is less risky than to be active on the streets. The opposition can meet online and organize protests without having to meet in a physical place. * It can change the attitude of the citizens. When news independent from the government can spread online, people will get a more honest image of their government. On the long term, even people who are satisfied with their life can become politically active and be mobilized to protest against the regime. * It reduces uncertainty for individuals. When people see a lot of people will be attending the protests, people are more inclined to join. The risk of getting punished is lower when there are a lot of people at te protests. * Dramatic videos and pictures will reach more people if they are shared online. People who get to see those images are more inclined to join the protests. Cyberpessimists point to the effect these online actions have. By liking or sharing a political post, someone might think they are politically active, but they are not really doing anything effective. This useless activism, or slactivism does not contribute to the overall goal of the social movement. Is also increases the collective action problem. Someone might think they already contributed to the cause, so they are less likely to go to a physical protest. Social media is also used by states in order to check society. Authoritarian states use social media to track and punish activists and political opponents. There are several ways to do this. State led internet providers can use a monopoly position to provide information about internet behaviour to secret services. These providers can also shut down the internet if the government faces mass mobilization, what happened in the Arab Spring. To organise out of sight of authorities, people use encrypted online messaging services such as WhatsApp or Telegram. Virtual private networks may also be used. Examples DARPA Network Challenge Tag Challenge Arab Spring The Arab Spring was a revolutionary wave of demonstrations and protests occurring in the Arab world that began on 18 December 2010. Rulers were forced from power in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen; civil uprisings erupted in Bahrain and Syria; major protests broke out in Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, and Oman; with minor protests in Lebanon, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Western Sahara. Clashes at the borders of Israel in May 2011, as well as protests by Arab minority in Iranian Khuzestan, were also inspired by the regional Arab Spring. The protests shared techniques of mostly civil resistance in sustained campaigns involving strikes, demonstrations, marches, rallies, as well as the use of social media to organise, communicate, and raise awareness in the face of state attempts at repression and Internet censorship. Nonviolence vs violent tactics According to Donatella della Porta and Sidney Tarrow, the mechanism that produces violence in the declining phase of the collective action cycle is a result of the competition that arises among different sectors of the social movement. Together they formed a theory stating that as mass mobilisation winds down, political violence rises in magnitude and intensity. Examples Italy In his study of the wave of mass protests that took place in Italy between 1965 and 1975, Sidney Tarrow stated that ‚Äú[i]n the final stages of the cycle, there was an increase in the deliberate use of violence against others. But this increase was a function of the decline of mass protest, not of its extension. Indeed, deliberate targeted violence did not become common until 1972-3, when all the other forms of collective action had declined.‚Äù All of which leads him to forcefully conclude that ‚Äúorganized violence was the product of demobilization.‚Äù Donatella della Porta, in her comparative analysis of political violence and cycles of protest in Italy and Germany between 1960 and 1990, maintains that ‚Äúwhen mass mobilization declined, the movements went back to more institutional forms of collective action, whereas small groups resorted to more organized forms of violence.‚Äù USSR Mark R. Beissinger, in his study on cycles of protest and nationalist violence in the Soviet Union between 1987 and 1992, also detects this pattern, but in this case violence takes the form of ethnic communal conflict rather than terrorism. As he says, ‚Äúthe rise of violence in the USSR in significant part was associated with the decline of nonviolent mobilization contesting interrepublican borders.‚Äù Russia During the 1870s, the ‚Äúpopulists‚Äù or ‚Äúnihilists‚Äù, the proponents of a Russian variant of anarchism, organized the so-called ‚Äúpilgrimages to the people‚Äù, which involved small groups of members of the urban, petit bourgeois intelligentsia going into small villages to persuade peasants of the necessity of revolution. However, their efforts had little effect on the peasantry, and it was after this bitter experience that they made the momentous decision to adopt terrorist tactics.

His reign began in 1001 CE and ended in or about 1010. He was the son of Jayapala, whose kingdom used to stretch from Laghman to Kashmir and Sirhind to Multan, with Peshawar being in the center, but had lost most of his territories to Sabuktagin and his son Mahmud. Anandapala and his confederacy was defeated by Mahmud of Ghazni when his elephant suddenly took flight and turned the tide of the battle. Career Prince Anandapala who ascended his father's throne in about March/April AD 1002 already proved an able warrior and general in leading many battles prior to his ascension. According to 'Ad√°b al-Harb' (pp. 307‚Äì10) in about 990 CE, it is written, \\"the arrogant but ambitious Raja of Lahore Bharat, having put his father in confinement, marched on the country of Jayap√°la with the intention of conquering the districts of Nandana, Jailum (Jehlum) and T√°keshar\\" (in an attempt to take advantage of Jayapala's concentrated effort with defence against the armies of Ghazni). \\"Jayapala instructed Prince Anandapala to repel the opportunist Raja Bharat. Anandapala defeated Bharat and took him prisoner in the battle of Takeshar and marched on Lahore and captured the city and extended his father's kingdom yet further.\\" However, during his reign as emperor many losses were inflicted on his kingdom by the Ghaznavids. During the battle of Chach between Mahmud and Anandapala, it is stated that \\"a body of 30,000 Gakhars fought alongside as soldiers for the Shahi Emperor and incurred huge losses for the Ghaznavids\\". However, despite the heavy losses of the enemy, he lost the battle and suffered much financial and territorial loss. This was Anandapala's last stand against Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni. He eventually signed a treaty with the Ghaznavid Empire in 1010 and shortly a year later died as a result of a natural death. R. C. Majumdar compared him ironically to his dynastic ancient famous ancestor \\"King Porus, who defeated Alexander.R.C Majumdar (D.V.

Prynne which today is acknowledged as an important center of innovative poetry in the United Kingdom. Riley was an editor and major contributor to The English Intelligencer. He is the author of ten books of poetry, and many small-press booklets. He is also the current poetry editor of the Fortnightly Review and a recipient of the Cholmondeley Award in 2012 for \\"achievement and distinction in poetry\\". Early life He was born in Stockport, near Manchester, and raised in an environment of working people, Riley \\"entered higher education through Britain's post-war socialistic educational policies\\".Author Page at British Electronic Poetry Centre He read English at Pembroke College, Cambridge, and has since lived and worked in the UK and abroad in teaching at several levels and other occupations. A Cambridge resident since 1985, and ran a mail-order poetry book business for almost twenty years. Career He has written studies of Jack Spicer, T. F. Powys, improvised music, poetry, lead mines, burial mounds, village carols and Transylvanian string bands, and has published two books of translations from the French poet Lorand Gaspar. He has been an advocate for neglected British poets from the 1930s and 1940s, in particular Nicholas Moore (1918‚Äì1986), and he has edited several posthumous books of Moore's. Riley was the co-editor (with Andrew Crozier and others) of the important poetry/poetics journal The English Intelligencer (1965‚Äì1968), and editor of the later Collection (1968‚Äì1970). From the 1980s to the 2000s he ran the imprint Poetical Histories, which focussed on brief (4-12pp) pamphlets published on fine paper. Notable publications included J.H. Prynne's Marzipan and his sole poem in Chinese, Jie ban mi Shi Hu; R. F. Langley's Man Jack; and late work by the older poets Se√°n Rafferty and Dorian Cooke. In the 1970s Riley was an important early promoter of and advocate for British free improvisation, and the noted guitarist Derek Bailey was a lifelong friend; two of Bailey's late solo albums, Takes Fakes & Dead She Dances and Poetry and Playing, contain tracks of Bailey playing guitar while reading aloud from Riley's poetry. Several books of Riley's from this period are responses to free jazz and free improvisation: The Musicians The Instruments (poetry, The Many Press, 1978) and Company Week (prose, Compatible Recording and Publishing, 1994) in response to Bailey's 1977 Company Week event, and The Whole Band (Sesheta, 1972), in response to performances by John Tchicai's Cadentia Nova Danica. This habit of responding to music in his poetry has continued in more recent work, such as the Reader/Author/Lecture series (with poems for or after Syd Barrett, Arnold Schoenberg, John Sheppard and others) and his more recent books concerning music encountered on his travels in Eastern Europe. Riley was the subject of an essay collection, The Poetry of Peter Riley (The Gig, 1999/2000) and a poetry festschrift, April Eye (Infernal Methods, 2000). Excavations & Riley's poetics Distant Points is a series of prose poems arising from the author's meditations on 19th century excavation reports of prehistoric burial mounds in the north of England.

They are usually flavoured with peppermint and striped in two different colours (often black and white). Humbugs may be cylinders with rounded ends wrapped in a twist of cellophane, or more traditionally tetrahedral formed from pinched cylinders with a 90-degree turn between one end and the other (shaped like a pyramid with rounded edges) loose in a bag. Records of humbugs exist from as early as the 1820s, and they are referred to in the 1863 book Sylvia's Lovers as being a food from the North. The name of the sweet is not related to the phrase \\"Bah, humbug\\" from Charles Dickens' novel A Christmas Carol. That expression implies a general dissatisfaction with the Christmas season, connected to the use of 'humbug' as a joke, or especially a fake. However, offering humbugs around Christmas time is now seen by some as humorous or ironic, and was featured in an episode of Blackadder in this manner. While awaiting the appearance of a villain in \\"The Adventure of the Six Napoleons\\" episode of The Return of Sherlock Holmes series, Jeremy Brett as Holmes admonishes Edward Hardwicke's Dr. Watson for offering Colin Jeavons' Inspector Lestrade one of these sweets saying, \\"Watson, this is no time for humbugs!\\" Manufacture A mixture of sugar, glycerine, colour, and flavouring is heated to . This mixture is then poured out, and stretched and folded many times. The stripes originate from a smaller piece of coloured mixture which is folded into the main mixture.

A similar sweet is \\"bulls-eye\\" which has black and white stripes like a humbug, but is spherical like an aniseed ball. These are peppermint flavoured and are also known as bullets in the UK as they are similar in size to smoothbore musket balls. Everton mints Another popular mint in the UK is the Everton mint, which is also striped black and white with a toffee centre.

She was used by imperial Russia as a combination passenger, cargo and mail carrier on North Pacific routes. History The Ryazan was captured southeast of the Korean peninsula by the German light cruiser on 4 August 1914 as the first prize of World War I from the Russian empire.Van der Vat, Gentlemen of War, p. 36 She was taken to Tsingtao in the German colony Kiautschou, where she was converted to an armed merchant raider. The new Cormoran replaced the original SMS Cormoran, a small shallow draft cruiser that had a long Imperial Navy career in the Pacific, having taken part in the events that brought Kiautschou into the German colonial empire in 1897‚Äì98. The old Cormoran was laid up at Tsingtao with serious maintenance issues and unable to go to sea, and her armaments were transferred to the captured merchant ship. On 10 August 1914, the new Cormoran (or Cormoran II) left Tsingtao harbor and sailed through the South Pacific region. After Japan declared war on the German Empire, her warships discovered and pursued the Cormoran, forcing her to seek refuge in Apra Harbor, in the U.S. Territory of Guam, on 14 December. Having expended most of her fuel raiding commerce, her crew burned much of her woodwork in the boilers in order to make port. With only of coal remaining in her bunkers, her captain requested provisions and of coal in order to reach German ports in East Africa. Due to strained diplomatic relations between the United States and Germany, plus the limited amount of coal stored at Guam, Governor William John Maxwell refused to supply Cormoran with more than a token amount of coal. He ordered the ship to leave within 24 hours or submit to detention. This created a standoff between the German crew and the Americans that lasted nearly two years, until Governor Maxwell was involuntarily placed on the sick list and replaced by his subordinate, William P. Cronan, who decided the German crew should be treated as guests of the United States. The Cormoran was not allowed to leave the harbor, but the crew were treated as friends, achieving a minor celebrity status on the island. When the U.S. Congress declared war on Germany on 7 April 1917, Captain Adalbert Zuckschwerdt scuttled his ship rather than surrender her. This resulted in the \\"first shot\\" of the war between the U.S. and Imperial Germany. Sailors at Guam saw the German crew preparing to scuttle the ship and fired a shot across their bow in an effort to stop them. However, the German sailors continued to scuttle the vessel, and nine crew members perished (probably in the explosion that sank her). They were buried with full military honors in the naval cemetery at Agana. After the American sailors rescued and made prisoners the surviving Germans, Governor Cronan congratulated Captain Zuckschwerdt for the bravery of his men. The U.S. Navy later conducted a limited salvage operation and the ship's bell was recovered. It is exhibited at the U.S. Naval Academy Museum at Annapolis, Maryland. Other artifacts have been removed by divers over the years. The German crew was initially imprisoned in Fort Douglas, Utah. In April 1918, all remaining prisoners of war from Cormoran and were transferred from Fort Douglas to Fort McPherson, Georgia. All returned home on 7 October 1919, almost a year after the war's end. The wreck of the Cormoran II rests below the surface on her starboard side. A Japanese cargo ship, the Tokai Maru, sunk by the submarine USS Snapper, leans against her screw. The wreck is one of the few places where divers can explore a World War I shipwreck next to a ship from World War II. In 1975, the wreck was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. She was listed because of her association with World War I. On 11 September 2011 a headstone was found in Westview cemetery in Atlanta Georgia bearing the name Kurt Moraht. The headstone, written completely in German, identifies the resting place of Oberleutnant Kurt Moraht of SMS Cormoran (See photo below). It lists his birth date as 28 April 1886 and his death as 24 December 1918, and identifies the place of death as Fort MacPherson, Georgia. Another source revealed that during the prisoner transfer from Utah to Atlanta 7 crew members attempted escape and that some were killed in the attempt but it is not known how many were killed and how many were recaptured. Moraht reportedly died of pneumonia while still in prison at Fort McPherson. Some records indicate all prisoners of the SMS Cormoran were returned home at the end of the war but Moraht was certainly not among them.

He is not to be confused with Lieutenant Commander Harry Ross Hubbard (1886-1975), who was the father of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the Church of Scientology. Biography Early career Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Hubbard graduated from the United States Naval Academy in June 1925, served 3 years on the battleship , then qualified in submarines at New London, Connecticut. Following duty in submarine S-34, he completed Naval Academy postgraduate work, then served on the submarine tender , and, was an executive officer of the destroyer . He served at the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island then commanded the destroyer from 1939 to 1940, before assignment as staff gunnery officer for destroyers in the Atlantic. The latter duty terminated 1 March 1942 when Hubbard took command of the Gleaves-class destroyer . USS Meredith In command of Meredith, Hubbard helped screen carrier off Japan for the famed Doolittle bombing raids on Tokyo 18 April 1942. Thereafter he conned his destroyer on-arduous patrol and escort from Hawaii to the Samoan, Fiji, and the Solomon Islands. His destroyer helped cover transports landing reinforcements on bitterly contested Guadalcanal 18 September 1942. During the Solomon Islands Campaign, Hubbard commanded Meredith in maintaining the lifeline of supplies to fighting men holding their ground on Guadalcanal. On 15 October 1942, he fought his ship against Japanese carrier-based scouting planes, then fought off 18 Japanese dive bombers and 12 torpedo planes launched by Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku. His gunners shot down five of the attackers, all the destroyermen following the example of Hubbard who carried on the fight though blinded by burns about his face. When his men had cleared the bridge, he abandoned the sinking Meredith scant moments before she made her final plunge. He perished on a life raft at sea on the morning of 16 October 1942.

The Hee Haw EP was released in 1979 by the independent label, Missing Link Records. Background By 1978-9 The Boys Next Door were making efforts to distinguish themselves from Melbourne‚Äôs punk and post-punk bands. The core members ‚Äì Nick Cave, Mick Harvey, Phill Calvert and Tracy Pew ‚Äì had been joined by Rowland S. Howard on guitar in 1978. The Boys Next Door released an album (Door, Door) on the Mushroom label in 1979 (recorded in separate sessions in mid-1978 and early 1979). After the release of Door Door, The Boys Next Door transferred to the independent label, Missing Link Records, and took on label owner Keith Glass as their manager.‚ÄòBoys Next Door / Birthday Party‚Äô (article) ‚ÄòHowlspace‚Äô web-site. Cave said, \\"We played [Hee Haw] to Michael Gudinski of Mushroom Records and he wasn't really interested.\\" The tracks for the Hee Haw EP were recorded during July and August 1979 at Richmond Recorders in Melbourne, engineered by Tony Cohen. The five-track EP was released in December 1979. The artwork on the cover and insert sheet was done by Marcus Bergner. Music The Hee Haw EP represents a musical departure from the relatively conventional punk/pop songs on Door Door. The EP introduces a more abrasive, rhythmic and exploratory sound that was further developed when the band re-located to the UK (and changed their name to The Birthday Party). Two of the songs on the EP, \\"The Red Clock\\" and \\"The Hair Shirt,\\" the former sung by Rowland S. Howard and the latter by Nick Cave, were included on the Boys Next Door's second album entitled \\"The Birthday Party\\" in 1980.

Trawick spent his entire 12-year career as an offensive lineman and defensive guard with the Montreal Alouettes. College career & military service Trawick attended Kentucky State University and graduated with a degree in Physical education. He was a three time All- American in football, from 1940 to 1942. After school he enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II. Professional career Lew Hayman and Leo Dandurand were managing the new Montreal Alouettes franchise in 1946, and they did not fail to notice how popular and well received the first black baseball player in the pros, Jackie Robinson (when he played minor league ball with the Montreal Royals), was. They were determined to have a black player on their team. Trawick was not their first choice, but he was the best. Surprisingly quick for 5 foot 10 inches and 230 pounds, he would go on to play 12 seasons (from 1946 to 1957) with the Larks, 147 regular season games in all, and be voted an Interprovincial Rugby Football Union All Star seven times. When he retired in 1957, Trawick was the only \\"original\\" Alouette remaining with the team. He also played in 4 Grey Cup games, scoring a touchdown on a fumble recovery in the Als 1949 Grey Cup championship win against the Calgary Stampeders. Trawick played in the three-game Grey Cup set against the Edmonton Eskimos from 1954 to 1956, and had a touchdown on a fumble return called back in the classic 42nd Grey Cup game. Though he was welcomed in Montreal and made it his home, things were not perfect. Though university educated, he could only find work as a doorman. He became a Canadian citizen in 1953. He was noted for his generous community charity work. Awards and honours Much loved by his fans, Trawick's jersey #56 is one of seven retired by the Alouettes. Trawick was elected to the Canadian Football Hall of Fame and the Kentucky State University Athletics Hall of Fame in 1975. Trawick died on September 16, 1985 in his adopted home town of Montreal. On July 16, 1997, a park was named in his honour by the City of Montreal. Parc Herb-Trawick is situated southwest of the intersection of Lionel-Groulx Avenue and Richmond Street. In 2006, Trawick was voted to the Honour Roll of the Canadian Football League's Top 50 players of the sport's modern era by Canadian sports network TSN.

Rock Island's train numbers 7 and 8 ran between Chicago's LaSalle Street Station and Denver's Union Station and Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Rocky Mountain Rocket ran from 1939 to 1966; the train was discontinued prior to the creation of Amtrak in 1971.  History  The Rock Island was one of several railroads competing in the Chicago‚ÄìDenver passenger market. The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad started the streamliner era in the United States in 1934 when its Pioneer Zephyr made its special \\"Dawn-to-Dusk\\" run from Denver to Chicago in 13 hours 5 minutes. By 1936 both the Burlington's Denver Zephyr and the Union Pacific Railroad's City of Denver were locked in head-to-head competition, each with new equipment and a 16-hour schedule. The Rock Island's offering was the Rocky Mountain Limited, operating traditional heavyweight cars on a 27-hour schedule. Although mired in bankruptcy, the Rock Island introduced six new streamlined trainsets, known as \\"Rockets\\", in 1936. Pleased with the results, the Rock Island bought two new sets of streamlined equipment for Chicago‚ÄìDenver train. The new train, christened, the Rocky Mountain Rocket, entered service on November 12, 1939. In contrast to the Rocky Mountain Limited, the Rocket required only twenty hours. A separate section, diverging at Limon, Colorado, served Colorado Springs, Colorado. At the time the Rocket was the only train to provide Chicago‚ÄìColorado Springs service without changing trains. The new train was profitable, despite the slower running time compared to the Burlington and UP streamliners. Further competition arrived in 1942, when the Missouri Pacific Railroad and Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad introduced the Colorado Eagle between St. Louis, Missouri, and Denver. Facing steep competition from airlines and improved highways, the Rocky Mountain Rocket lost its sleeping and dining cars in July 1965. Snack cars were added to replace the diners and remained in service until the train was discontinued 15 months later. The last train ran on October 16, 1966. Among its final passengers was the railfan and photographer Otto Perry. Unnamed train numbers 7 and 8 continued to operate between Chicago and Omaha, but the name was gone, along with all Rock Island passenger service west of Omaha.  Route  In 1942 the Rocky Mountain Rocket ran on a 19.5 hour schedule from Denver to Chicago. An extra quarter-hour was required for the Colorado Springs Section. At Limon, Colorado, the Rocket was split on its westbound run. The bulk of the train went northwest to Denver on the Union Pacific's main line (ex-Kansas Pacific) to Denver, while the rest of the train continued on Rock Island tracks southwest to Colorado Springs. Eastbound, the train was combined at Limon and split in Belleville, Kansas, with one section continuing to Union Station, Kansas City, Missouri, while the other section went to Chicago.  Equipment  Rock Island AB6 No. 751 in commuter service in 1966 Both Budd and Pullman-Standard contributed cars to the inaugural equipment sets used by the Rocky Mountain Rocket. Each of the two equipment sets comprised a baggage car, 44-seat post office-coach, 52-seat coach, diner- lounge, two sleeping cars, and a sleeper-observation car. Budd built the baggage cars, coaches, and dining cars. The diner-lounge could seat 32 patrons in the main dining, plus 14 in a cocktail lounge. The car included a kitchen and pantry. Pullman-Standard built the sleeping cars and sleeper-observation car. The first sleeping car contained eight sections, two compartments, and two double bedrooms. The second contained ten sections and four roomettes. The sleeper-observation contained five bedrooms toward the front of the car, followed by a small lounge and round-end observation area. The motive power for the Rocket was unusual. The Rock Island assigned an EMC E6 and EMC AB6 to haul the train. The AB6s, unique to the Rock Island and this route, were flat- fronted, similar to a B unit, but with a cab and capable of independent operation. It could operate behind an A unit without ruining the streamlined profile of the train, but then pull the Colorado Springs section after the separation in Limon.

Cap. (22 December 181821 April 1894), was a German Franciscan lay brother. He served for over 40 years in the post of porter of the Capuchin friary in Alt√∂tting, through which work he gained a widespread reputation for his wisdom and holiness. He has been declared a saint by the Catholic Church. Life Early life Born 22 December 1818, he was baptized with the name of John, the son of Bartholom√§us Birndorfer and Gertrude Niedermayer, and was born on the family farm in Parzham, now a part of the town of Bad Griesbach, then in the Kingdom of Bavaria, now part of Germany.\\"Saint Conrad of Parzham\\", Franciscan Media Baptized Johann Evangelist, he was the second youngest of 12 children, five of whom died in infancy.Cargnoni, O.F.M.Cap., Costanzo. The Capuchin Way: Lives of Capuchins, v. 1, pt. 2, North American Capuchin Conference, 1996, pp. 180-206 At the age of six, he started elementary school in nearby Weng. Young Hansel's devotion was noticeable especially when he prayed in church, the distant location of which was no hindrance to his visiting it frequently even in inclement weather. He had a great devotion to the Blessed Virgin, and each day fervently recited the Rosary. On feast days he frequently made a journey to some remote shrine of the Blessed Mother. During such pilgrimages, always made on foot, he was engaged in prayer, and when he returned in the evening, he was usually still fasting. John spent his early years on the family farm. His mother died when he was 14; his father two years later. After attending a parish mission in 1838, he decided to enter the religious life. The following year, at the age of 31, and after distributing his inheritance, he was admitted as a lay brother among the Capuchin Franciscan friars. Brother Porter Immediately after his profession he was sent to the Friary of St. Ann, in the city of Alt√∂tting.\\"St. Conrad of Parzham\\", Capuchins, Mid-America Province The friary served the Shrine of Our Lady of Alt√∂tting, the national shrine of Bavaria to the Blessed Mother. Conrad was given the task of assisting the porter at this shrine. In March 1851, he had to leave Alt√∂tting to go to Burghausen to care for a dying priest. The following September, he entered the novitiate at Laufen, where he was given the name Conrad in honor of Conrad of Piacenza. He then returned to Alt√∂tting as porter. Because it was a large and busy city, the duty of the friary porter was a very difficult one. Conrad was known to be diligent at his work, sparing in words, bountiful to the poor, eager and ready to receive and help strangers. Brother Conrad fulfilled the task of porter for more than 40 years, assisting the inhabitants of the town in their needs of body and soul. Conrad loved silence in a special way. His spare moments during the day were spent in a nook near the door where it was possible for him to see and adore the Blessed Sacrament. During the night he would deprive himself of several hours of sleep to devote the time to prayer either in the oratory of the friars or in the church. It was generally believed that he never took any rest, but continually occupied himself in work and exercises of devotion. On the 21 April 1894, Conrad died in the friary where he had served for 41 years.  Canonization  During his lifetime, Brother Conrad was reputed to have been able to read the hearts of those he met, and he was attributed with the gift of prophecy. His heroic virtues and the miracles he performed won for him the distinction to be ranked among the Blessed by Pope Pius XI in 1930. Four years later, the same pope, approving additional miracles which had been performed, solemnly inscribed his name in the list of saints. He is the patron saint of the Mid-America Province of Capuchin Friars.

She attended John Muir High School (Pasadena, California)Melendez, Miguel (April 10, 2009) Track & Field: Muir‚Äôs Cooper shoots for the stars. Pasadena Star News and California State University, Northridge. 1980 Olympics Brown qualified for the 1980 U.S. Olympic track and field team but did not compete due to the U.S. Olympic Committee's boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, USSR. She was one of 461 athletes to receive a Congressional Gold Medal instead. 1984 Olympics Noted for her fast start, she was the 1st leg runner in two US Olympic 4√ó100 Relay teams 1984‚Äì88, both teams winning the gold. At the 1984 Summer Olympics, in the individual 100 metres, Brown and American teammate Jeanette Bolden charged out to the lead, only to be overtaken by world record holder Evelyn Ashford, with Brown clearly taking the silver medal. Later, the U.S. relay team won the gold medal beating Canada by over a second, the greatest winning margin in the event's history. This was due to a very strong team which included all three U.S sprinters that made the 100 m final and Brown's superb start. The US were clear favourites as the GDR and USSR teams who would have provided stiff competition were absent due to the Eastern Bloc boycott. The team was never seriously challenged, leading from gun to tape and triumphing with a time of 41.65 seconds, one of the fastest times in history. 1987 World Championship In 1987 Alice won 4√ó100 relay Gold at the World Championships Rome, Italy. A very strong and well-drilled team consisting of Diane Williams (2nd Leg), Florence Griffith-Joyner (3rd Leg) and Pam Marshall (anchor) were favorite. They won their semi-final with a time over a second faster than the usually dominant GDR team. They went on to win the final from the GDR team (Silver), clocking a time of 41.58 CR, which was a U.S record at the time, and still ranks as one of the fastest times in history. 1988 Olympics In the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games all nations were present for the first time since the Montr√©al games in 1976. In the final of the Women's 4√ó100 Relay all the strongest nations were present except for the Jamaicans who were non starters. Alice Brown once again led the United States challenge running the first leg. In a superb piece of relay running, she left the field trailing in her wake. By the time she handed over to Sheila Echols (2nd Leg), she had caught and was passing the Bulgarian athlete in the next lane. Florence Griffith-Joyner (3rd Leg) took over and ran solidly, handed over to Evelyn Ashford (anchor), who in very impressive fashion made up three metres on Marlies G√∂hr and led the US team to victory by a clear metre. The winning time was down (41.98 seconds) on the U.S record due to sloppy baton exchanges. It was superior basic speed and sheer talent that won the U.S their second consecutive gold in this event.

Murders happen on both the Navajo reservation and the Tano Pueblo. One happens during a Tano ceremonial, with the koshares (sacred clowns) and kachinas performing. Leaphorn is in charge of a new investigation unit, with Chee as his sole staff support. Plot Shop teacher Eric Dorsey is murdered at the mission school in Thoreau, for no obvious reason. Delmar Kanitewa slips out of his boarding school in Crownpoint, and his grandmother pushes the Navajo Tribal Police to find the boy. Lt. Joe Leaphorn heads up a new unit for investigations, with Jim Chee as his staff. Chee and Bureau of Indian Affairs officer Sgt. Harold Blizzard learn the boy came home to his mother the day the teacher was killed. Delmar had a package with him, for his uncle, to do with religion. Delmar said he must see his uncle a second time and left. Janet Pete, Cowboy Dashee and Ashton Davis meet up at the Tano ceremonial of kachinas and koshares, where Chee spots Delmar. He slips away before they can tell him to call his grandmother. The ceremonial includes Delmar‚Äôs uncle, Francis Sayesva, who is a koshare. In a break of the ceremonial, Francis is found murdered, not 40 yards from where Chee is standing. A hit and run driver leaves his victim to die on the road, making a homicide of Victor Todachene‚Äôs death. The chief of the NTP really wants the driver found. Leaphorn asks Chee to find this driver. The driver speaks anonymously over the local radio apologizing for what he did. He will send money to the family. The radio station staff notice enough about the man for Chee to find Clement Hoski. Chee trails him home, seeing grandson Ernie get off the school bus. After talking with Ernie, a special needs child, Chee puts off arresting his grandfather. The murders of two valuable men, Dorsey and Sayesva a few days apart, done the same way, has Leaphorn looking for connections. He finds one when a second search of Dorsey‚Äôs workshop and a visit with Sayesva‚Äôs brother reveal the story of the Lincoln cane possessed by the Tano Pueblo since 1863. Dorsey made a replica of it, based on the ebony wood shavings and silver mold found. The Lincoln cane is kept by the governor of the pueblo, currently Bert Penitewa, who has the original safe in his office. The boy Delmar visited Dorsey to get something for a friend, and seeing the cane, explained its story to Dorsey, who is shocked and angry at how he has been used. Delmar left with the replica cane, under instructions from Dorsey to give it to his people, the Tano. As Delmar leaves, a man enters, and that is the one who kills Dorsey. Delmar gives the replica cane to his uncle, who uses it in the ceremonial, as he worries that the governor might sell the original. Then he is killed, and the replica cane disappears. Chee is distracted completely by the change in his relationship with Janet Pete, local lawyer and long time friend. He is in love, but now he must learn if the Navajo incest taboo in any way prevents them from being more than friends. He takes off for two days to consult with his uncle Frank Sam Nakai and another hataalii. He leaves without explaining a cassette tape that he plays in the tape player in Leaphorn‚Äôs office. The tape is of a phone call between Navajo Councilman Jimmy Chester and Ed Zeck, lawyer for the firm seeking to use an old open mine for a toxic waste dump site. They discuss money, leaving an appearance of pay-off. The tape is also played over the local radio station in the public time. The next day, while Chee is with his uncle, Leaphorn is suspended in response to the furious Councilman demanding an investigation. The suspension forces Leaphorn to cancel his trip to China, planned with Prof. Bourbonette. He wants to visit Mongolia, while she has colleagues to see there. Leaphorn finds that this is the second replica that Dorsey made. Chee returns to work, explains the tape. That ends the suspension for Leaphorn. The two search Dorsey‚Äôs office one more time, noticing that the sketch for the first replica cane is written on the blank side of a flyer from two years earlier, prepared by an environmental group led by Roger Applebee. Dorsey has no connection with this group. Applebee needed someone reliable to get the first cane sold privately two years earlier, and that must be his friend Ashton Davis, a trusted dealer in Indian artifacts. Chee presents his ethical dilemma with the Hoski case to Janet Pete. She meets young Ernie, and watches Chee give him a new bumper sticker to put on his grandfather‚Äôs truck, with a message to take the old one off, or the police might stop him. The Navajo approach to Hoski‚Äôs problem is to help him get back in the blessing way. The law will arrest Hoski, taking him away from his grandson. Leaphorn feels the arrest will earn Chee promotion to sergeant, which Chee ignores. Janet Pete is pleased with Chee‚Äôs actions, and they become lovers. Delmar recognizes Applebee‚Äôs face in the newspaper as being the man he saw. Leaphorn calls Dilly Streib, the FBI agent on the Dorsey case, to arrest Applebee. Within hours, Streib tells Leaphorn that Davis killed Applebee in front of the FBI, and then turned himself in. Davis saw the second replica cane at the Tano ceremonial, and knows he has no future as an honest trader. He has no part in the second one, but its existence makes his role in the first one known. Applebee made this second cane to ruin the Tano governor. Applebee played the tape of the phone call to ruin the Councilman, as he took the other side in the dispute about the toxic waste dump. The call was not about payoffs, but the cattle business that Chester and Zeck have together. Leaphorn learns that Louisa did not go on the trip without him when she appears at Saint Bonaventure Mission School, finally learning where he is.

Allusion to real places and events One of the murders takes place at Saint Bonaventure School in Thoreau, New Mexico. This is a real school, part of the Catholic mission for the eastern part of the reservation. It has been in operation over forty years. Hillerman acknowledges the school and specific people in it in the dedication of the book. The name of the town is pronounced like threw as the town was named for an engineer, not the American writer Henry David Thoreau. The Lincoln canes figure in the plot. These were ebony canes with a silver head given by President Lincoln to recognize 19 Pueblo tribes for their neutrality in the Civil War and their acknowledgment of US sovereignty following the Mexican War. The canes follow a tradition begun by the Spanish. Some photos are included in the Smithsonian collection of tribal governors posed holding their cane, indicating the significance the canes held for the Pueblo tribes. The lands of the eastern portion of the Navajo Nation, in New Mexico, are called the Checkerboard reservation. This arose from the way in which land was given to railroads in the 19th century, leaving questions of who owns land, a problem for police jurisdictions among others. Saint Bonaventure Mission is located in the Checkerboard.

He was ready to write another book sooner, but personal situations intervened: his brother died, then Tony Hillerman got cancer, both of which slowed him down. In the chronology of the novels, it is just six months after the prior novel (Leaphorn was widowed a year in Coyote Waits and 18 months in this novel). The way of life in the pueblos was the starting point for the plot. For hundreds of years, the pueblo peoples have no police with batons, no punishments. Rather the kachinas, representing the spirits, and the koshares, representing foolish humans, show the wayward recent actions in the pueblo. The koshares use laughter and public scorn as the ways to keep their people on the right path. They are very private about their culture, so Hillerman invented a pueblo for the novel; there is no Tano pueblo in real life, in contrast with the real mission school. Hillerman reports the mission school to be a success, so he honored it by including it and its people in the plot.

Reviews This novel evoked a range of responses, from \\"pallid\\" to \\"masterful\\". The stronger connection between the two detectives (Chee reports to Leaphorn) gains plaudits as does Chee's way of resolving a murder case that straddles the vantage points of his Navajo cultural view and the laws he is sworn to enforce. Verlyn Klinkenbery finds this Mr. Hillerman's \\"most pallid mystery novel\\": > But Mr. Hillerman does not allow himself satire or irreverence or even > vulgarity. He is writing across a particularly troubled ethnic divide, the > one separating Anglos from Indians, and no matter how he demurs, his novels > have the cautiousness of anthropology, the decorousness that comes when you > don't want to presume too much upon an acquaintance. In \\"Sacred Clowns,\\" we > see the clowns dancing at a fictional pueblo ceremony as if through a veil, > clowns who in reality are every bit as raucous, profane and funny as > Shakespeare's. The Gainesville Sun finds the story captivating: > But what is captivating about this story is the thrill of the chase and more > the clarity of the scenes, the reflectiveness of the characters, and most of > all, the way Chee succeeds in resolving a conflict between Navajo values and > those of the surrounding society without weighting the plot unduly or > battering the reader with invidious comparisons. Kirkus Reviews finds this intricately plotted and a masterful novel in its own right: > Navajo Detective Jim Chee, working now for Lt. Joe Leaphorn's two-man > Special Investigations Office, has followed Delmar Kanitewa, a runaway > student who may know something about the murder of shop-teacher Eric Dorsey, > to the Tano Pueblo for a ceremony of koshares, sacred clowns, only to see it > interrupted by a second murder. The boy, who's exonerated by Chee's own > eyes, has vanished again, leaving the mystery of how the two murders are > connected--and (since this is one of Hillerman's most intricately plotted > stories) of just how to interpret the eventual linkup: a copy of the Lincoln > Cane, a century-old tribal gift, that Dorsey had made. There's also time for > the reopening of an unsolved hit-and-run and for accusations that Horse Mesa > Councilman Jimmy Chester is taking bribes to legalize a toxic-waste dump > inside a reservation mine. The byplay between prickly Leaphorn and spiritual > Chee; Chee's sobering reflections on Navajo and white people's justice; > problem-strewn new romantic intrigues for both heroes--all of these make > this not only a masterful novel in its own right, but an object lesson in > how to develop an outstanding series. Dick Adler writing in the Chicago Tribune finds that Hillerman keeps up his high standards: > How long can Tony Hillerman keep it up? He has been writing his Navajo > thrillers for over 20 years, and each time I pick up a new Hillerman book I > wonder if this is the one that will disappoint, lower the standard, signal > the beginning of the end. . . . > Well, it hasn't happened yet to Hillerman. Sacred Clowns is as good as > anything he's done-as flavorful and chewy as beef jerky, so evocative of the > land around the Four Corners area of New Mexico that even if you've never > been there you'll think you have. And best of all, it's a book as full of > kindness, love and compassion as it is of murder, sadness and mystery. > That's not a balance you find very often, especially in this field. . . . > The two murders involve men who were indeed God's fools-a selfless teacher > at a mission school who used humor to overcome his shyness, and an actual > Hopi koshare-\\"sacred clown\\"-who used humor in a religious ceremony to > ridicule the sins of his people. Publishers Weekly finds the plot is resolved with gratifying inevitability: > Telling his story the Navajo way, Hillerman (Coyote Waits) fully develops > the background of the cases pursued by Navajo Tribal Policemen, Lt. Joe > Leaphorn and Officer Jim Chee, so that the resolutions--personal and > professional--ring true with gratifying inevitability. . . . Leaphorn > searches for clues while simultaneously grieving for his wife who died 18 > months earlier and considering his relationship with linguistics professor > Louisa Bourebonette. Jurisdictional conflicts with the Bureau of Indian > Affairs and the Apache County Sheriff's Office reflect the cultural > differences that obtain among tribes and clans as this first Leaphorn story > in three years, steeped in Navajo lore and traditions, draws to its > convincing conclusions.

He studied in Ivrea and Turin. In October 1769, he was appointed professor of Oriental languages at the University of Parma, where he spent the rest of his life. His inaugural lecture on the causes of the neglect of Hebrew study was published in 1769 at Turin. Scholarly writings De Rossi devoted himself to three chief lines of investigation‚Äî-typographical, bibliographical, and text-critical. Influenced by the example of Benjamin Kennicott, he determined on the collection of the variant readings of the Old Testament, and for that purpose collected a large number of manuscripts and old editions. In order to determine their bibliographical position he undertook a critical study of the annals of Hebrew typography, beginning with a special preliminary disquisition in 1776, and dealing with the presses of Ferrara (Parma, 1780), Sabbionetta (Erlangen, 1783), and, later, Cremona (Parma, 1808), as preparatory to his two great works, Annales Hebr√¶o- Typographici (Parma, 1795, sec. xv.) and Annales Hebr√¶o-Typographici ab 1501 ad 1540 (Parma, 1799). This formed the foundation of his serious study of the early history of Hebrew printing; see Incunabula. In connection with this work he drew up a Dizionario Storico degli Autori Ebrei e delle loro Opere (Parma, 1802; German translation by Hamberger, Leipzig, 1839), in which he summed up in alphabetical order the bibliographical notices contained in Wolf, and, among other things, fixed the year of Rashi's birth; he also published a catalogue of his own manuscripts (1803) and books (1812). All these studies were in a measure preparatory and subsidiary to his Vari√¶ Lectiones Veteris Testamenti (Parma, 1784‚Äì88), still the most complete collection of variants of the Hebrew text of the Old Testament. In order to compile it he visited all the chief libraries of Italy, and through its compilation he obtained the knighthood of St. George at the court of Parma and seductive offers from Pavia, Madrid, and Rome. As examples of the use of his work he issued a specimen of the Targum on Esther (Rome, 1782; 2d ed., revised, T√ºbingen, 1783). He was also interested in the polemics of Judaism and Christianity, and wrote on this subject his Della Vana Aspettazione degli Ebrei del loro Re Messia (Parma, 1773), which he defended in a pamphlet two years later; he further published a list of anti-Christian writers, Bibliotheca Judaica Antichristiana (Parma, 1800). A select Hebrew lexicon, in which he utilized Par·∏•on's work (Parma, 1805), and an introduction to Hebrew (ib. 1815) conclude the list of those of his works which are of special Jewish interest. Rossi died in Parma in 1831.

The southern terminus of the route is at U.S. Route 6 Business (US 6 Bus.) in Carbondale. The northern terminus is officially at an intersection with US 11, to the west of Interstate 81 (I-81). PA 171, at its southern end, was once part of the Providence and Carbondale Turnpike, which ran along US 6 Bus. from Dickson City to Carbondale and PA 171 from Carbondale to Forest City. The turnpike, chartered in 1851, ran from Scranton until being abandoned in 1889. In 1911, after the Sproul Road Bill was signed, a large segment of PA 171 was designated as Legislative Route 10. This was its designation for several years, and in 1928, the mass amount of state highways in Pennsylvania were designated. In the 1928 renumbering, the alignments of PA 171 were designated as Pennsylvania Route 70, Pennsylvania Route 602, and Pennsylvania Route 692, which stretched the highway from US 6/US 106 in Carbondale to the New York state line at Hallstead. In 1946, PA 692 and PA 602 were later removed from the state system and replaced by an extended PA 70. In 1961, PA 70 was renumbered as PA 171 to prevent duplication with I-70. Route description Carbondale to Herrick Center PA 171 begins at an intersection with US 6 Bus. in the eastern part of Carbondale. The route progresses northward, along Belmont Street, passing several homes for several blocks. At an intersection with Spencer Street, the highway leaves downtown Carbondale and enters Fell Township, a nearby community. There, PA 171 changes names to Main Street, passing more residential homes and local businesses, until entering the community of Simpson. At Reservoir Street, PA 171 turns northward and leaves Simpson. After an intersection with Owego Street, PA 171 leaves Fell Township and becomes parallel to the Owego Turnpike through a residential community surrounded by forests. PA 171 approaching the southern terminus at US 6 Bus. in Carbondale After about a mile, PA 171 turns away from the residential and commercial buildings and winds through the local woodlands. This scenery continues for several miles, passing by a reservoir. After an intersection with Buffalo Road, the road turns to the northeast. After the turn, PA 171 enters the community of Richmondale. In Richmondale, the highway heads eastward, the development of the scenery around the highway once again. After leaving Richmondale, the highway enters Vandling, where the highway becomes highly developed. After an intersection with Clinton Street, PA 171 leaves Vandling and crosses into Susquehanna County, where the highway enters Forest City. PA 171 continues into Forest City, where it curves along as Main Street, and enters downtown. In downtown Forest City, the highway is squeezed to two local lanes and PA 171 intersects with PA 247, which heads eastward. However, PA 247 westbound becomes concurrent with PA 171 through downtown Forest City, and the highway eventually splits off westbound, while PA 171 continues north through the northern ends of Forest City. The route bends around for a while in Forest City, where at an intersection with Cemetery Road, the route leaves the community. PA 171 and PA 247 head in the community of Forest City North of Forest City, PA 171 heads north for several miles through deep forests. After a while, PA 171 crosses over the Lackawanna River, which straddles the Wayne County border. The route, at that point, changes names to Stillwater Road, parallelling Old Logging Road 296 until approaching Stillwater Lake, where the logging road merges back into the highway. PA 171 parallels the shores of Stillwater Lake and passes the Stillwater Dam, maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. While PA 171 continues to follow the lake, it enters the community of Union Dale. PA 171 enters Union Dale, leaving forests that it was following. The route intersects and parallels Mausoleum Road, which heads through a cemetery in southern Union Dale. After an intersection with Asley Drive, Stillwater Lake ends, and the community enters the center of Union Dale. The center consists of an intersection with Skyline Drive, and PA 171 leaves. The highway continues out of Union Dale, winding its way to the north. PA 171 continues running as Stillwater Road into the deep forests which break up soon after. A short distance later, PA 171 becomes slightly developed, entering the small community of Herrick Center. There, the highway intersects with the eastern terminus of PA 374 and the western terminus of PA 371, also known as the Great Bend Turnpike. The route leaves Herrick Center and heads northward through rural parts of Susquehanna County. Thompson to Oakland After leaving Herrick Center and PA 371/PA 374, PA 171 progresses through Susquehanna County, leaving Stillwater Road. The route continues through the rural parts of Susquehanna County. After a break in a patch of trees, PA 171 intersects with Township Road 592, beginning a wind along the Wayne County border. The township road parallels for sometime, and the highways eventually enters the small community of Burnwood, where the highway becomes slightly developed. North of Burnwood, the route continues northward, entering the community of East Ararat, where PA 370's western terminus is located. PA 171 seen from the former Erie Railroad Susquehanna shops in Susquehanna Depot The route passes through East Ararat, leaving soon after. After that, PA 171 begins to progress through the rural areas once again, paralleling a short distance of PA 370. After an intersection with Borden Hollow Road, the highway progresses through a deep area of forests. The route passes Dunn Pond, where it bends to the northwest, entering Ararat Township. Along this stretch, PA 171 passes to the north of the community of Ararat. The route continues for several miles, and after turning to the east, the highway enters the community of Thompson. Into the community of Thompson, PA 171 becomes known as Jackson Street and heads through a moderately developed region. The route, at an intersection with Main Street, leaves Jackson and continues northward. After the intersection with Erie Avenue, PA 171 leaves Thompson. A short distance later, the highway continues northward through deep forests and rural farms before continuing into Thompson Township. After that the road starts winding its way northward, it returns to the unpopulated area and intersects with local roads. PA 171 running to the right alongside the former Erie Railroad's Susquehanna Division main line in Hickory Grove This pattern continues for several miles, with PA 171 passing a large pond and deep forests. At the intersection with Comforts Pond Road and Bethels Hill Road, the highway becomes slightly developed. This quickly reverts to the undeveloped rural farms, which follow PA 171 along its trip to the northwest. A short distance later, the highway becomes surrounded by forests once again, beginning to wind its way as the Belmont Turnpike. The forests quickly ends, and the surroundings become highly developed as the community enters Lanesboro. After entering Lanesboro, PA 171 becomes highly developed and continues as Belmont Turnpike until the intersection with Main Street, where the highway turns to the southwest. The route heads along Main Street, progressing along the developed parts of the Susquehanna River, and enters the community of Susquehanna Depot. In Susquehanna Depot, PA 171 runs along East Main Street through the eastern segment of the community. Near the dead-end Jackson Street, the highway turns to the south, intersecting with PA 92. From there, the two highways are concurrent. PA 92 and PA 171 head along Main Street, passing some local businesses and residences before crossing the Susquehanna River on the Susquehanna County Veterans Memorial Bridge. After crossing the bridge, PA 171 and PA 92 split onto State Street and River Street respectively. PA 171 continues westward, paralleling High Street, which merges in along the shores of the Susquehanna. Soon after the intersection with High Street, PA 171 progresses westward leaving Susquehanna Depot soon after. Hickory Grove to Great Bend After leaving Susquehanna Depot and Oakland Township, PA 171 heads on a westward progression along the Susquehanna River. To the south of the highway is the river, to the north of the highway is residential homes and deep forests behind those. After the intersection with Towner Road, PA 171 enters the small community of Hickory Grove, where the route and river makes a curve to the southwest, still paralleling each other. PA 171 quickly leaves Hickory Grove and enters another set of deep forests which separate the highway and the river. The highway continues on its southwest progression, with the trees surrounding dissipating. After that, both the river and the highway pass to the north of Island Plain. There, the routes curve to the northwest once again, becoming more developed and now following a railroad line in the area. The route makes a curve to the west, progressing through a short development of residential homes. After that, the highway enters Great Bend and heads to the southwest. The designation crosses at Interchange 230 along I-81 in downtown Great Bend, but continues to the intersection with US 11 in Great Bend, where the route terminates. History Pre-designation turnpikes A short segment of PA 171, from Carbondale to the community of Forest City, was part of the Providence and Carbondale Turnpike, which went from the city of Scranton, Pennsylvania, following much of US 6 and US 106 (current day US 6 Bus.) through many of the communities in the area: Dickson City, Jermyn, and Carbondale, before turning onto current day PA 171. There, the turnpike followed the alignment through Carbondale, Fell Township, Vandling and into Forest City, where it ended, from Scranton. This tolled turnpike provided the main highway through many of the communities, including the towns along PA 171, until on December 7, 1889, when local citizens tore down the abandoned tollbooths in Blakely. Originally, the turnpike was chartered by the commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1851, and remained strong until 1889, the year the tollbooths were torn down. After that the turnpike was abandoned, with control of the turnpike's alignment turned over Lackawanna County for future maintenance. In 1897, the portion of PA 171 along Main Street in Susquehanna Depot was paved. The project to pave the main highway cost $10,000 (1897 USD) with funds split equally between the borough of Susquehanna Depot, the local businesses, and the nearby Erie Railroad. Designation The original route designation that follows current-day PA 171 was a part of Legislative Route 10, which ran from an intersection with Legislative Route 9 (currently an intersection with PA 706) in New Milford Township to the New York state line, where it follows current day PA 92's alignment. When the mass state highway numbering in Pennsylvania occurred in 1928, the alignment of PA 171 was designated as Pennsylvania Route 70 from US 6 in Carbondale to Oakland at PA 92, from there to US 11 in Great Bend, it was designated as PA 692, and from US 11 to the New York state line at Hallstead, it was designated as PA 602. The alignment of PA 70 was under construction in 1929 from the Thompson Township line to Lanesboro. It was completed the next year, when the Pennsylvania Department of Highways paved the highway from Herrick Center to Thompson and Stack Road to the Harmony Township line. These three routes remained intact (in terms of alignment) for eighteen years, until 1946, when PA 692 and PA 602 were removed from the state highway system in favor of extending PA 70 to the north to Hallstead. The route, PA 70, remained intact for another seventeen years, when in April 1961, I-70 was already commissioned, and PA 70 was decommissioned. The PA 70 designation was renumbered to PA 171 to prevent duplication.

Overview The roof of a barabara was generally made from sod and grass layered over a frame of wood or whalebone, and contained a roof doorway for entry. Inside of the barabara was a main room, and a secondary room used for parental purposes. The main room had two rows for cots, less-excavated and higher than the rest of the room. The bottom of the room had one or more holes for an \\"inhouse\\". The entrance typically had a little wind envelope or \\"Arctic entry\\" to prevent cold wind, rain or snow from blowing into the main room and cooling it off. There was usually a small hole in the ceiling from which the smoke from the fire escaped.

The new facility would have been one of 14 LNG off-loading and processing facilities in the United States, and would have allowed for the importation of LNG from anywhere in the world. Once the LNG was processed into natural gas, it would have been transmitted throughout the Mid Atlantic and Northeastern United States via a number of interconnections with existing natural gas pipelines that are located near the proposed terminal.  Crown Landing calls it quits  On January 6, 2012, Crown Landing LLC's owner, Hess Energy, filed a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) surrendering the authorization to construct and operate, due to the likelihood that the terminal would not be profitable. Company president Godon Shearer cited \\"significant increases in natural gas production from North American shale resources,\\" and that impact on prices and demand, as the reason for halting the project.Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Crown Landing Docket filing withdrawing project, 2012 January 6  Lawsuit and regulatory approval  The facility would have included a long off-loading pier that technically would have entered the State of Delaware's waters, because the Delaware River within the Twelve-Mile Circle is all in Delaware, up to the mean low water mark on the New Jersey side. Delaware opposed the project and filed a lawsuit in federal court to stop the project from going forward on the basis that they control the waters in which part of the pier would be situated. Delaware lost the lawsuit in a Federal court ruling. However, the State of New Jersey pursued a lawsuit against Delaware in order to receive a clarification from the federal courts regarding projects that originate in New Jersey and enter Delaware waters. The United States Supreme Court, in a 6-2 decision released on March 31, 2008, ruled \\"while Delaware cannot block ordinary projects from going forward on the Jersey side, the proposed BP project 'goes well beyond the ordinary or usual'.\\" \\"It was within Delaware's authority to prohibit construction of the facility within its domain,\\" the majority opinion said. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the Crown Landing LNG Terminal on June 15, 2006. (The dissenting justices were the 2 members from New Jersey: Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito. Justice Stephen Breyer, who had BP stock, did not participate.) The Crown Landing LNG Terminal was the first LNG terminal to undergo a strict United States Coast Guard project review, as required by a Federal law passed in recent years to address the energy industry's numerous and often controversial proposal for new LNG terminals in the coastal waters on the United States.  Capacity and design  The proposed terminal would have stored up to 450,000 cubic meters of LNG equivalent to 9.2 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of gas, vaporized LNG into natural gas and sent it out through connecting pipelines at a baseload rate of 1.2 Bcf, enough natural gas to supply the daily needs of about five million homes. The Crown Landing LNG terminal would have brought in a new supply of natural gas, approximately 15 percent of then-current demand for natural gas in the Mid-Atlantic region. Once on-line its proponents advocated it would have had a stabilizing effect on natural gas prices in the region by providing additional natural gas more reliably than distant suppliers as far away as the Gulf of Mexico. The advent of massive domestic natural gas production proved against those assertions, resulting in the company withdrawing the project. The LNG terminal would have connected to three major natural gas pipeline systems serving the Northeastern United States. A new eleven mile (18 km) pipeline from the Crown Landing LNG Terminal, called the Logan Lateral Projects, would have connected the new LNG terminal to a regional natural gas pipeline in Brookhaven, Pennsylvania, providing natural gas to the Mid-Atlantic region. The proposed pipeline also received Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval in 2006. According to the original developer of the project BP (BP subsequently sold the project to Hess Energy), when built, Crown Landing would have been the most modern facility of its type in the United States. As of July 2008, the LNG terminal at Crown Landing was cancelled due to the U.S. Supreme Court decision earlier in the year. The backers of the Crown Landing LNG terminal looked for another site in the Delaware Valley that would have been suitable and would have gained regulatory approval. In 2009, energy company Hess LNG acquired BP's ownership interests in Crown Landing.Oil & Gas Journal  See also  * Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) Final Environmental Impact Statement on the Crown Landing LNG and Logan Lateral Projects - Issued: April 28, 2006 * BP Crown Landing Website - Official Project Website of Project Developer BP References Category:Liquefied natural gas terminals Category:Energy infrastructure in New Jersey Category:Natural gas infrastructure in the United States ","title":"Crown Landing LNG Terminal"},{"id":"8123799","text":"William Wesley Willoughby (born May 20, 1957) is a retired American professional basketball player born in Englewood, New Jersey. After graduating from Dwight Morrow High School in Englewood, he was selected by the Atlanta Hawks in the 1975 NBA draft as the first pick in the second round (19th overall), bypassing college for a chance to play professionally. For his 1975‚Äì76 NBA season, he is the sixth youngest player ever to play an NBA game; he was the second youngest at the time, behind Stan Brown. Playing career While Moses Malone (drafted into the American Basketball Association out of high school in 1974, prior to the 1976 ABA‚ÄìNBA merger) and Darryl Dawkins enjoyed more successful professional careers, Willoughby had a career that was undistinguished. Nicknamed \\"Poodle\\", he was a journeyman who played for six different NBA teams in eight years, before his career ended with the New Jersey Nets in 1984, at the age of 26. Willoughby was tremendously athletic, having a 47-inch vertical leap. He had played center throughout his high school career, and was forced to play forward in the pros. Willoughby gained some brief fame in the 1981 NBA postseason while with the Houston Rockets by becoming one of the few players ever to block Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's \\"skyhook\\" at its apex. Post playing career Though he later regretted skipping college, Willoughby eventually received his degree in communications from Fairleigh Dickinson University in 2001, at the age of 44. The NBA fully paid all of his college expenses, and, in return, Willoughby is a special advisor to the NBA who counsels high school players considering forsaking college basketball for the NBA. Willoughby currently resides in Hackensack, New Jersey.

Established in 2001, the College catered for approximately 1,500 students in 2018, from Year 7 to Year 12, of whom ten percent identified as Indigenous Australians and ten percent were from a language background other than English. The College is operated by the New South Wales Department of Education; and the College principal is Paul Gilmore.  History  Brisbane Water Secondary College is a public high school that was created in 2002 by the merging of Umina High School and Woy Woy High School. Both former high schools now constitute the two campuses of the Secondary College. The Umina Campus, located along Veron Road, Umina Beach, caters for Middle School students from Years 7 to 9 and the Woy Woy Campus, located along Edward Street, Woy Woy, caters for Senior School students from Years 10 to 12. The logo of the new school was a Griffin, a mythical hybrid of a lion and an eagle to symbolise the joining of the two schools into one college.  Facilities  The Umina Campus has a large agriculture farm used for teaching across Years 7 to 12. The Cattle Club has won many awards in agricultural shows with its Limousin steers and with students for judging and parading. The campus has an art space program which offers both experience and knowledge in astrology and further the terrain outside of the atmospheric norms. The College also is currently trialling \\"Sports Academies\\". The two academies currently being trialled are for Rugby League and Football (Soccer). The rationale for the academies to be in place is to encourage students who have athletic potential but might otherwise leave school to stay until the end of Year 12. From 2009 the senior campus refurbished its Design and Technology faculty to provide vocational courses for students. From 2011 the Umina Campus has established a dedicated selective Creative and Performing Arts class for years 7 and 8 as part of an ongoing rejuvenation of its CAPA program.

In the preface to his lexicon he mentions as his teachers, besides a certain R. Ephraim of whom nothing more is known, the two great Spanish scholars Judah ha-Levi and Abraham ibn Ezra. Ibn Par·∏•on refers also to conversations with Judah ha-Levi, mentioning, for example, his remarkable assertion regarding the inadmissibility of meter in Hebrew poetry, and tells of the sojourn of Ha-Levi and Ibn Ezra in North Africa. The Lexicon The only one of his works which has been preserved is his lexicon. In it he appears as the true pupil of Ibn Ezra, becoming, like him, the propagator of Hebrew philology and Biblical exegesis as they flourished in the Arabic language in Spain. Ibn Par·∏•on relates in his preface that when he came to Salerno he found the people there entirely ignorant of the products of Jud√¶o-Spanish literature, being acquainted only with the lexicon of Menahem ibn Saru·∏≥. He determined, therefore, to compile a lexicon to the Bible in which the substance of that literature should be made accessible in Hebrew. He completed his work on Kislew 1, 4921 (= 1160), and called it Ma·∏•beret he-'Aruk, combining the title of the dictionary of Menahem with that of Nathan's Talmudic lexicon. Except for the original matter which Ibn Par·∏•on incorporated in his work, it may be considered as an extract from the lexicon of Ibn Jana·∏•, supplemented by extracts from the works of ·∏§ayyuj, as well as from the Mustal·∏•a·∏≥ and the Luma of Ibn Jana·∏•. Ibn Par·∏•on quotes by name only a few authorities, including Rashi and Solomon ibn Gabirol. The latter's interesting short grammatical didactic poem Ana·∏≥ has been preserved, at least in part, in Ibn Par·∏•on's introduction to his lexicon. The numerous explanatory notes, which are a notable characteristic of the lexicon, make it a mine of information on historical details relating to the ritual. It contains also various scientific excursus, including some on problems of religious law. The article ◊ë◊¢◊ú contains a sermon on illicit intercourse with Jewish women, which throws light on the moral status of the Italian Jews; in another article, ◊í◊ú◊ë, he seizes the opportunity of showing the inadmissibility of the custom of not cutting the hair, a custom prevailing in Christian countries. Twice, in the articles ◊û◊†◊ó and ◊¢◊®◊ë, he attacks the practice which Jews living in Christian countries had adopted of combining the afternoon prayer with the evening prayer. Although Ibn Par·∏•on introduces a few Aramaic phrases (occurring in the Talmud) to satisfy the taste of his readers, the language of his lexicon, with its pure Hebraisms and the fluency and precision of its style, betrays the influence of his teacher Ibn Ezra. The original matter contributed by Ibn Par·∏•on includes, in addition to the notes mentioned above, many interpretations of single Biblical passages, and numerous explanations of Biblical words by means of Neo-Hebraic and Aramaic. A brief summary of Hebrew grammar, together with an excursus on Neo-Hebraic prosody, is prefixed to the lexicon, and a number of chapters based chiefly on the Luma of Ibn Jana·∏• and dealing with syntactic and stylistic peculiarities of the Bible are appended. The preface and many of the articles contain interesting data on the history of Hebrew philology. Ten years after its appearance Ibn Par·∏•on's lexicon was bitterly attacked by Judah ibn Tibbon, who translated the lexicon of Ibn Jana·∏• and unjustly criticized Ibn Par·∏•on's work as being a translation thereof. Despite this, Ibn Par·∏•on's lexicon became very popular in succeeding centuries, although subsequently it was forgotten, until resuscitated by S. G. Stern, who edited it according to a Vienna manuscript together with an introduction by S. L. Rapoport (Presburg, 1844). Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography *W.

A Bostonian, Captain Malcolm was a staunch supporter of royal authority. During the War of the Regulation, he traveled to the province of North Carolina to help put down the uprising. While working for the customs service, he pursued his duties with a zeal that made him very unpopular. The fact that he was a loyalist during the Tea Act, the three-pence tea tax detested by the patriots, did not help his reputation. In November 1773, sailors in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, tarred and feathered him. Malcolm got off relatively easy in this attack, since the tar and feathers were applied while he was still fully clothed.Young, Shoemaker, 47. As a hard-line Loyalist, Malcolm often faced abuse and provocation from Boston's Patriots, the critics of British authority. People often \\"hooted\\" at him in the streets, but Governor Thomas Hutchinson urged him not to respond. A confrontation with Patriot shoemaker George Hewes thrust Malcolm into the spotlight. On January 25, 1774, according to the account in the Massachusetts Gazette, Hewes saw Malcolm threatening to strike a boy with his cane. When Hewes intervened to stop Malcolm, the two men began arguing, with Malcolm insisting that Hewes should not interfere in the business of a gentleman. When Hewes replied that at least he (Hewes) had never been tarred and feathered, Malcolm struck Hewes hard on the forehead with the cane, knocking him unconscious.Young, Shoemaker, 48. That night, a crowd seized Malcolm in his house and dragged him into King Street in order to punish him for the attack on Hewes and the boy. Some Patriot leaders, believing that mob violence hurt their cause, tried to dissuade the crowd, arguing that Malcolm should be turned over to the justice system. Hewes, who had recovered, also protested against the attack on Malcolm. The crowd refused to relent, however, citing (among other arguments) the fact that Ebenezer Richardson, a customs official who had killed an 11 year old Bostonian named Christopher Seider, had escaped punishment by receiving a royal pardon.Young, Shoemaker, 49. Malcolm was stripped to the waist and covered with tar and feathers. The crowd then took him to the Liberty Tree and told him to apologize for his behavior and renounce his customs commission. When Malcolm refused, the crowd put a rope around his neck and threatened to hang him. This did not break him, but when they threatened to cut off his ears, Malcolm relented and was sent home. The event was reported in newspapers on both sides of the Atlantic. After these events, Malcolm moved to England, where he unsuccessfully ran for Parliament against John Wilkes, the controversial champion of colonial rights.Young, Shoemaker, 50.

Canada's socialist movement is believed to have originated in Western Canada. The Socialist Labor Party was formed in 1898 in Vancouver. The Socialist Party of British Columbia in 1901. The Socialist Party of Canada was the first Canadian-wide based Socialist party by native Canadians, founded in 1904. Later, the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 and Great Depression (1929‚Äì1939) are considered to have fuelled socialism in Canada.  History   Communism  1945 election poster for Fred Rose, the first Communist MP During the Great Depression, the Communist Party of Canada experienced a brief surge in popularity, becoming influential in various labour unions and electing a single Member of Parliament, Fred Rose. The Communist Party of Canada was created in Guelph, Ontario in 1921 by a group of Marxist activists led by William Moriarty. During the early years of their existence the party's membership faced persecution and arrest for their political activities. In 1935 the Communists gained notoriety by organizing a massive march of unemployed workers known as the On-to-Ottawa Trek and before that organized the young inmates of the relief camps into the Relief Camp Workers' Union to resist the poor conditions of the camps. The On-to-Ottawa Trek never made it to Ottawa; instead it ended with the Regina Riot of July 1, 1935. The trek and the living conditions in the government's \\"relief camps\\" helped to discredit Conservative Prime Minister R. B. Bennett, leading to his defeat at the hands of the Liberals in 1935. After the trek the communists were instrumental in organizing over 1,448 Canadians to fight in the Spanish Civil War. Joined by volunteers of other political stripes, the Canadian contingent known as the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion joined the International Brigades (a coalition of volunteers from many countries) to fight for the elected leftwing government of the Second Spanish Republic against the fascist-supported insurgency of General Francisco Franco. The \\"Mac-Paps\\" fought bravely in many battles but were forced to leave Spain in 1938 by Prime Minister Juan Negr√≠n L√≥pez along with the other foreign volunteers as it became clear that the war was lost. Of the nearly 1,500 Canadians known to have fought in Spain, 721 were verified as having lost their lives. The most famous Canadian to serve in the Mackenzie‚ÄìPapineau Battalion was Dr. Norman Bethune, a surgeon who would invent the world's first mobile medical unit. Dr. Bethune would later be killed during the Second Sino- Japanese War, while aiding the Communist Party of China. Today he is a national hero in the People's Republic of China and is remembered as being a friend of Chinese leader Mao Zedong. By the end of World War II, the Communist Party began to lose its momentum. Its only elected federal representative, Fred Rose, was accused of being a Soviet spy. Rose was expelled from parliament, arrested for four years, and then followed at every job site by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). He eventually left for Poland with the intention of returning to clear his name, but had his Canadian citizenship revoked in 1957.  Democratic socialism  CCF founding meeting in Regina, 1933 By a wide margin, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), a democratic socialist political party from the Prairies with its origins in the Christian left and the social gospel, became the most influential socialist party in Canada. The CCF gained support in the Prairies as well as from many labour unions. Led by Tommy Douglas, the CCF was elected to power during the 1944 Saskatchewan election. Douglas governed Saskatchewan until 1961. As of the 2019, his party remains an important force in the politics of the province. The CCF also emerged as the official opposition in British Columbia during the election of 1941 and in Ontario during the province's 1943 election. At the federal level, opinion polls initially indicated a dramatic surge in support for the CCF prior to the 1945 federal election. Although in the end it only translated into modest gains for the party, it is widely believed to have influenced the early steps taken by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King in introducing the welfare state. The CCF and the early democratic socialist movement is seen, by some political scientists (such as Gad Horowitz), as mainly a Christian and European Canadian movement. In 1961, the CCF joined with the Canadian Labour Congress to form the New Democratic Party (NDP). The NDP is more moderate and social-democratic than its predecessor, the CCF. The Regina Manifesto of the CCF called for abolishing capitalism while the NDP merely wants to reform capitalism. They are generally perceived as being responsible for the creation of universal healthcare, pensions, a human rights code and for the development of Canada's social safety net in general. In the past the NDP has formed provincial governments in Alberta, British Columbia, Yukon Territory, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Nova Scotia. At present only British Columbia has a New Democratic government, while the NDP is the second largest party in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and the Yukon. At the federal level the NDP has held strong influence over various minority governments, in particular a Liberal minority led by Pierre Trudeau from 1972-1974 during the 29th Canadian Parliament. During this period the NDP was successful in forcing the government to create a state-owned oil company, called Petro Canada. The NDP has also held influence over other Liberal-led minority governments during the Lester B. Pearson government (1963-1968) and the Paul Martin government (2004-2006). Their self stated goal is to one day form a federal government on their own and introduce social-democratic policies. In the province of Quebec, the NDP has been considerably less popular, but recently, in the May 2, 2011 Canadian Federal Election a record number of NDP Members of Parliament were elected, including 59 of the 75 available seats in Quebec. The party was the Official Opposition in the 41st Canadian Parliament. For most of the late 20th century, the strongest social-democratic party in Quebec has been the sovereigntist Parti Qu√©b√©cois. Like the NDP, the Parti Qu√©b√©cois is generally considered to be \\"social democratic\\".  Revolutionary socialism  Many socialists in Canada have attempted to organize outside of the framework of parliamentary politics, to pursue conceptions of socialism that are more radical than the social-democratic politics of either the CCF or the NDP. Some of the radical socialist organizations operating in Canada today include Socialist Action (Canada) the International Socialists (Canada), Socialist Alternative (Canada), Spring, the Communist League (Canada), Autonomy & Solidarity,[http://auto_sol.tao.ca Upping the Anti A Journal of Theory and Action] and the London Project for a Participatory Society,London Project for a Participatory Society among others.  Socialist parties in Canada   Current parties  * The New Democratic Party, (NDP) is a federal political party which officially adheres to social democracy while still being one of the most left-wing of Canada's mainstream parties. However a minority faction are committed to democratic socialism, including, but not restricted to, the radical Socialist Caucus. The policies of various provincial and territorial branches of the NDP have varied in the past from the left-wing to the third way. The party's youth group is known as the New Democratic Youth of Canada. The provincial branches of the NDP are: ** Yukon New Democratic Party - official opposition ** British Columbia New Democratic Party - governing party with support from the Greens. ** Alberta New Democratic Party - official opposition ** Saskatchewan New Democratic Party - official opposition ** New Democratic Party of Manitoba - official opposition ** Ontario New Democratic Party - official opposition ** New Democratic Party of Newfoundland and Labrador - third party ** Nova Scotia New Democratic Party - third party ** New Brunswick New Democratic Party - not represented in the legislature ** New Democratic Party of Prince Edward Island - not represented in the legislature * The Communist Party of Canada sees itself as being \\"Canada's party of socialism\\" and with its origins going back to 1921 the CPC is the second oldest existing political party in Canada after the Liberal Party of Canada. The Communist Party has active branches in Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia. In Quebec there was a split in 2006 between a separatist and federalist faction in the Communist Party of Quebec. The PCQ is now led by Andre Parizeau the leader of the separatist faction, while the party's federalists have regrouped into the PCC/PCQ and are tied to the federal party.Pcc/Pcq The CPC also has a youth group, known as the Young Communist League of Canada. * The Communist Party of Canada (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) was created in 1971 as a so-called Anti-Revisionist party supportive of Maoism and of Albanian leader Enver Hoxha. Today the ideology of the CPC (ML) or Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada is less doctrinaire than in the past but still considered more radical than that of the Communist Party of Canada. They support radically changing the way candidates are nominated and elected and are generally supportive of North Korea. Their members are active in the Canadian Union of Postal Workers and United Steelworkers of America. The CPC (ML) has active provincial branches in British Columbia (the People's Front), Manitoba, Ontario and in Quebec (the Parti marxiste-l√©niniste du Qu√©bec). * Revolutionary Communist Party is a communist organization advocating the overthrow of the capitalist system. It is in the organizing stage. The ideology of the organization, founded in 2000, can be regarded as anti- revisionist in character. They describe their ideology as \\"Marxism-Leninism- Maoism\\" which they consider the third phase of Marxism. The group does not take part in electoral politics, instead aiming to educate the working class about the need for a revolution in the style of the Russian and Chinese revolutions. The PRC-RCP is non-collaborationist and opposes all Canadian political parties, including ones calling themselves communist. * Qu√©bec Solidaire (\\"Solidarity Quebec\\") is Quebec's most popular left-wing party. They claim to be devoted to the causes of democratic socialism, such as environmentalism, feminism, Quebec Sovereignty and alter-globalization. They have gained support amongst left-wing sovereigntist voters who are disillusioned with the Parti Qu√©b√©cois' embrace of neoliberalism. * Socialist Party of Canada (WSM) formed in 1931 publishes a journal called Imagine and is a companion party of the World Socialist Movement. * Fightback, the Canadian section of the Trotskyist organization called the International Marxist Tendency publishes a self-titled newspaper and practices Entryism in Quebec Solidaire and the NDP  Historical parties  Parties that have held seats in the House of Commons of Canada and provincial legislatures. * Canadian Labour Party (1917-1942) * Ginger Group (1924-1932) - a group of radical members of the Progressive Party of Canada * United Farmers - farmer advocacy groups tied to the Progressive Party of Canada. In Ontario, the United Farmers of Ontario governed from 1919 to 1924 with a fairly social democratic agenda, while the United Farmers of Alberta governed Alberta from 1921 to 1930 following more conservative guidelines. * Socialist Party of Canada - names used by two political parties. The first existed from 1905 to 1925 and was created by the Socialist Party of British Columbia; it played an important role in the creation of the CCF. The second has existed since 1931 and has been very marginal in terms of support. * Labor-Progressive Party - was the name used by the Communist Party of Canada from 1941 to 1959 while it was an illegal party. The LPP followed a Marxist line and succeeded in not only electing a member of the House of Commons, but also electing representatives to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba and the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. * Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (1932-1962) - known as the CCF, it was, before the NDP, Canada's most popular left-wing party. The CCF was formed during The Great Depression by members of the centrist Progressive Party of Canada (the Ginger Group), the United Farmers, the Labour Party and a social advocacy group known as the League for Social Reconstruction. At the party's first convention in Regina, Saskatchewan, the Regina Manifesto was launched announcing that: \\"No CCF Government will rest content until it has eradicated capitalism and put into operation the full programme of socialized planning which will lead to the establishment in Canada of the Co-operative Commonwealth.\\" The radical Regina Manifesto was replaced by the more moderate Winnipeg Declaration in 1956. The CCF went on to form one of Canada's most popular and historically significant provincial governments in 1944 in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan under Tommy Douglas. In Ontario the CCF formed the official opposition in 1943 and again in 1948 until losing that position to the Liberals. In British Columbia the CCF also formed the official opposition after 1941. Federally the party never got past third place and in an attempt to broaden their support base the CCF merged with the Canadian Labour Congress to create the NDP. * Cape Breton Labour Party, the Cape Breton Labour Party was a social-democratic party from the province of Nova Scotia represented in the Nova Scotia legislature from 1981-1988 by a former NDP member Paul MacEwan. * New Democratic Party of Quebec was the Quebec wing of the NDP. The Quebec NDP failed to win any significant support or win any seats in the Quebec legislature (its parent party, the Quebec CCF won one). After years of infighting in 1989, the party broke off relations with the federal NDP and in 1994 changed its name to the Parti de la Democratie Socialiste (PDS) or \\"Socialist Democratic Party\\". The PDS adopted a program calling for Quebec's separation from Canada and had attempted to nominate a former terrorist, Paul Rose (formerly of the FLQ) as a federal candidate. The PDS contested the 1998 Quebec election without any success. In 2002 the PDS joined the Communist Party of Quebec and other far left, sovereigntist parties in an alliance known as the Union des forces progressistes (UFP). In 2006 the UFP became Quebec solidaire.

Early career He was drafted by Essendon with the second selection in the 2006 AFL Draft. Prior to the Draft, Gumbleton was widely seen as one of the top key position players for his age group, and was expected to be Essendon's first pick in the number 2 spot. As a natural centre half- forward player, Gumbleton's imposing figure places him in the immediate spotlight, with North Melbourne recruiting manager Neville Stibbard already talking of an upcoming rivalry between Gumbleton and the third draft pick of the same year, Lachlan Hansen, who has been described as a natural centre half-back. AFL career Gumbleton's 2007, 2008 and 2009 seasons were all plagued by injury and he played only five AFL games in first three seasons, all of which were in 2007. However, the 2010 season saw much improvement for Gumbleton, having a full pre-season, playing 17 of the first 18 games and being re-signed by Essendon, after showing much improvement.Ralph, John.

Retrieved 7 August 2010. Scott's 2011 season was again plagued by injury and he failed to play any games at AFL level. At the end of 2011 Scott had back surgery to repair a disk. It was hoped the surgery would fix his chronic hamstring issues. In 2012 Scott played his first senior game in nearly two years when he returned against Port Adelaide in round 16, booting three goals. He finished the 2012 season having played six games kicking 11 goals. Despite having long-term offers from rival clubs at the end of 2012 Gumbleton showed his loyalty to Essendon agreeing to a new one-year deal to remain at the club until at least the end of 2013. In October 2013, Gumbleton was recruited by Fremantle, who traded the 55th selection in the 2013 AFL Draft to Essendon.Gumbleton becomes a Freo Docker After failing to play a senior game in his one season at Fremantle, Gumbleton announced his retirement in September 2014.Fremantle Dockers Forward Scott Gumbleton Retires, Triple M Melbourne, 1 September 2014 He returned to Melbourne to play for the Banyule Football Club in the Northern Football League from 2015. Gumbleton, along with 33 other Essendon players, was found guilty of using a banned performance-enhancing substance, thymosin beta-4, as part of Essendon's sports supplements program during the 2012 season. He and his team-mates were initially found not guilty in March 2015 by the AFL Anti-Doping Tribunal, but a guilty verdict was returned in January 2016 after an appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency. He was suspended for two years which, with backdating, ended in November 2016; as a result, he served approximately fourteen months of his suspension and missed the entire 2016 season with Banyule.

This is different from potted meat, an older noncommercial method of preserving meat. Various meats, such as beef, pork, chicken, turkey and organ meats are used. It is produced primarily as a source of affordable meat. Its precooked state and long shelf life make it suitable for emergency food supplies, camping and military uses. Potted meat food product contains high amounts of fat, salt and preservatives which may make it unhealthy for regular consumption. It typically has a spreadable texture, similar to p√¢t√© and is usually used for sandwiches or spread on crackers.  Reputation  Canned potted meats have a mixed reputation for their taste, texture, ingredients, preparation and nutrition. The canning process produces a product with a generally homogeneous texture and flavor. The low-cost ingredients used also affect the quality. For example, mechanically separated chicken or turkey is a paste-like product made by forcing crushed bone and tissue through a sieve to separate bone from tissue. In the United States, mechanically separated poultry has been used in poultry products since 1969, after the National Academy of Sciences found it safe for use. On November 3, 1995, the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture published a final rule in the Federal Register (see 60 FR 55962) on mechanically separated poultry, stating that it was safe to use without restrictions. However, it must be labeled as \\"mechanically separated\\" chicken or turkey in the ingredient statement. The final rule became effective on November 4, 1996.

The Talkboy was originally conceived as a cassette recorder and player prop for the 1992 film Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. At the request of writer John Hughes and distributor 20th Century Fox, Tiger designed and built the prop. The company was given permission by the movie studio to sell a retail version of the toy, and it released two cassette recorders modeled after the film prop in 1992 and 1993, respectively. The original model did not have the variable- speed voice changer of the film version and sold only moderately during the 1992 holiday shopping season. In April 1993, Tiger released the Deluxe model, which added the voice-changing feature. Following the release of Home Alone 2 on home video in July and a cross-promotion with Life cereal, interest in the toy spiked. Retailers had severely underestimated demand, and as a result the Deluxe Talkboy was one of the most highly sought-after toys during the 1993 holiday shopping season, selling out of stores across the United States. The product continued to be a best-seller in subsequent holiday shopping seasons. A pink version of the cassette recorder called Deluxe Talkgirl was released in 1995. The success of the Talkboy cassette recorders spawned a product line of electronic sound novelty toys, including a phone, walkie talkies, and a radio. For subsequent recording devices, Tiger transitioned to digital technology, using solid-state storage and adding sound effects, beginning with Talkboy/Talkgirl F/X+ pens in 1995, which sold more than a million units in 45 days. Origin as movie prop The original Talkboy model was a cassette player and recorder that was conceived as a prop for the 1992 film Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. In the film, the main character Kevin McCallister (played by Macaulay Culkin) uses the Talkboy to outsmart adults, successfully making a reservation at the Plaza Hotel by slowing his voice down with the toy's variable-speed voice changer and later recording incriminating statements by the burglars Marv and Harry. The film's writer John Hughes and the film's distributor 20th Century Fox wanted a device that was realistic yet appeared to be cutting edge. Nancy Overfield-Delmar, the vice president of marketing for 20th Century Fox licensing and merchandising, said: \\"It was important to John that Kevin not use something already out in the marketplace. Kevin has to be one step ahead of other kids.\\" To manufacture the prop, Hughes and 20th Century Fox turned to toy licensee Tiger Electronics. The studio made an introduction between Hughes and Roger Shiffman, Tiger's co-founder and executive vice president, and the two met at Shiffman's office several times to develop the prop. Hughes's original concept in the script was for Kevin \\"to have a gun\\", but Shiffman thought it was impractical since the character would need to travel with it through O'Hare International Airport in the movie. Shiffman told Hughes to let him work on the idea, and his team at Tiger subsequently built a prototype in three weeks. The ensuing design for the Talkboy featured a handle that would allow the device to slide onto a hand and a retracting microphone so it would look \\"more lifelike\\". Original retail Talkboy Following the success of the original Home Alone (1990), which grossed $285 million in North America, the third-highest amount at the time, an extensive marketing and cross-promotion campaign was undertaken for Home Alone 2. About 80 licensed products were released to tie-in with the movie, while corporate partners included Coca-Cola, Bloomingdale's, Kids \\"R\\" Us, and American Airlines. As part of the campaign, Tiger was given permission by 20th Century Fox to sell a retail version of Talkboy in stores, with Shiffman negotiating a \\"modest royalty\\" to build the brand. The original retail Talkboy model requires 4 AA batteries and uses a standard cassette tape. However, it does not feature the voice changer of the film prop. The toy was previewed at the American International Toy Fair in New York in February 1992, and was released to market for that year's holiday shopping season, coinciding with the release of Home Alone 2. Tiger spokeswoman Robin Plous said, \\"sales weren't very good because the product couldn't do everything it did in the film\\". Deluxe Talkboy and Talkgirl Reverse side of Deluxe Talkboy, showing the grip handle and variable-speed voice changer (red switch) Tiger created a second model of the cassette player and recorder, the Deluxe Talkboy, which added the variable-speed voice changer. Audio can be sped up by recording on the \\"slow\\" setting and playing it back on the normal setting, or slowed down by recording on the normal setting and playing it back on the \\"slow\\" setting. The toy was released in April 1993 for US$29.99, and was sold at 11 retailers: Caldor, FAO Schwarz, Fingerhut, Hills, Kay Bee Toys, Kmart, Musicland, Service Merchandise, Target, Toys \\"R\\" Us, and Wal-Mart. It was a sleeper hit, catching many retailers off-guard with its popularity during the 1993 holiday shopping season. Tiger spokesman Marc J. Rosenberg said that retailers at the American International Toy Fair earlier that February had not predicted such high consumer demand, placing orders that were 300 to 400 percent below what demand actually turned out to be; only Toys \\"R\\" Us had ordered enough units, according to Shiffman. Tiger did not anticipate high demand for a second- season product, and manufactured only as many units as retailers had ordered. Interest in Talkboy grew after the July 27 release of Home Alone 2 on home video, which included an advertising insert that confirmed the toy was a real product; 10 million copies of the movie sold by December. Sales of Talkboy continued to increase as the result of a cross-promotion with Life cereal that advertised the toy and the Home Alone 2 video cassette on the side panel of cereal boxes. Tiger relied on the Home Alone 2 movie tie-in and the advertising insert in home copies to promote the toy. Once demand surged, retailers tried to increase their orders, but Tiger found itself with insufficient time to produce enough units. On Black Friday, one store sold out of 288 Talkboys within half a day. Ultimately, Tiger was forced to pull all television commercials for the toy after Thanksgiving. Rosenberg said this was done \\"because [they] didn't want to deceive anyone\\" about the product's availability. Exact sales figures were not released, but Tiger spokespeople said in December that it had sold \\"hundreds of thousands\\" of Talkboys while facing demand for around 2 million units. By mid-December, the company's telephone switchboard was handling more than 500 calls per day regarding the toy. Tiger employees recounted stories of the tactics that desperate callers resorted to: one person claimed to have a terminally ill child who needed a Talkboy, while another claimed to be from NBC News; other callers tried to bribe Tiger employees or said they were willing to fly anywhere in the United States to purchase 10 Talkboys. Shiffman said, \\"There is not a story we haven't heard\\". Target reportedly ceased issuing rain checks for Talkboys after receiving more than 20,000 requests from customers. By mid-December, the retailer had been out of stock of the toy for a \\"couple of weeks\\" and confirmed any additional shipments would not go onto store shelves due to their commitment to fulfill rain checks. Eighteen days before Christmas, one Toys \\"R\\" Us store in Clinton Township, Michigan, had a waiting list of more than 500 people for the Talkboy. Rosenberg said that special security agents were required to meet each of Tiger's air shipments arriving from Asia for protection. The company's manufacturing plants in Hong Kong were running 24 hours a day to produce Talkboys in an attempt to keep up with demand, and daily air shipments were being delivered overnight across the United States. Only three stores ‚Äì Toys \\"R\\" Us, Kmart, and Wal-Mart ‚Äì were scheduled to receive shipments the week before Christmas. Tiger said it would continue shipping Talkboys past New Year's Day. Rosenberg blamed the frenzied demand for Talkboys on retailers shifting away from the inventory practice of stockpiling, while the St. Petersburg Times faulted the burgeoning \\"just-in- time\\" delivery model through which stores used computer-based delivery systems to handle advance ordering. In December 1993, Rosenberg said that Tiger anticipated \\"high demand for [the Deluxe Talkboy] going all the way through [1994]\\", and predicted that 20th Century Fox releasing Home Alone 2 for television broadcasts \\"would spur demand all over again\\". The Deluxe Talkboy was popular once again during the 1994 holiday shopping season, with many media outlets reporting it as one of the hottest-selling toys. Tiger said in November 1994 that it expected the Deluxe Talkboy to sell out for a second consecutive year. Kmart and Target stores reported swift sales around Thanksgiving, with one Target location in Fort Myers, Florida, selling out of the toy on Black Friday within an hour of their 7 a.m. opening. Wal-Mart indicated in mid-December that it was experiencing extended shortages of the toy. Within the last two weeks of the shopping season, Michelle Healy of Gannett News Service said the Deluxe Talkboy was \\"almost impossible to find\\". Roger Goddu of Toys \\"R\\" Us called it \\"without question the single most surprising item in our entire inventory\\". A Deluxe Talkgirl, a pink Deluxe Talkboy marketed to girls In 1995, Tiger released the Deluxe Talkgirl, a pink Deluxe Talkboy that was marketed to girls. Shiffman said, \\"We think the [Talkboy] name may have prevented us from reaching the full market\\". The Talkboy cassette recorder was popular again in 1996, with Playthings listing it as a \\"standout\\" on its survey of the year's most popular toys. It continued to sell well into the 1997 holiday shopping season, according to The Morning Call. Speaking about the Talkboy's staying power, Chris Byrne, editor of Market Focus: Toys, said that it sold \\"phenomenally well because it's a good toy\\". Talkboy F/X+ and Talkgirl F/X+ The success of the Talkboy cassette recorders spawned a product line of electronic toys. In 1995, Tiger released the Talkboy F/X+ and Talkgirl F/X+, which are writing pens with a 12-second recorder, three-speed playback, and six buttons that play sound effects. Designed by Ralph Osterhout for Tiger, the toy combined solid-state storage and a voice-recording computer chip into the form factor of a pen. Shiffman called it a \\"breakthrough product in the industry\\" for making digital recording technology available in a low-cost toy. The technology for altering voice pitch and modulation was licensed from its developer Janese Swanson. The product retailed for $20 and sold a million units in 45 days. A poll conducted by Arthur Andersen LLP found the Talkboy F/X+ pen to be one of the most popular toys among shoppers during Thanksgiving weekend in 1995. In March 1997, Tiger began a year-long promotion with Nabisco to place offers for Talkboy F/X+ toys on 30 million packages of Oreos, Chips Ahoy!, Nutter Butters, and Ritz Bits, along with a million-dollar television advertisement campaign.

Due to his involvement in the toy's creation, Rosenberg acquired the nickname \\"Talkboy\\" within the toy industry, and had a personalized license plate created reading the same. Several media outlets acknowledged the Talkboy on lists of the most popular holiday toys and past toy crazes, including Metro, Statesman Journal, Livingly.com, Rakuten, SILive.com, and CNN.com. Talkboy was ranked by Thrillist as the 38th-greatest movie prop of all time. Complex ranked it 75th on its list of the 90 best gadgets of the 1990s, while ABC News included it on a similar list of tech toys from the decade.

The firstborn son received his early education from his mother, after which he attended Pike Powers Academy in Staunton and Brown and Tebbs Academy in Albemarle County. He had an elder sister Sally E. Lacy (1837 ‚Äì 1896), as well as a younger sister Ellen G.

Initially a private, he rose to captain his company in the 3rd Virginia Cavalry. He was wounded three times, severely in the skirmishes at Kelly's Ford in 1863 and Nance's Shop in his home county in 1864. Lacy remained in the Army of Northern Virginia until it surrendered at Appomattox Court House. Career After the war, Lacy refreshed his studies, was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1866 and practiced law together with his father. In 1870, he was appointed to the county court of Charles City and New Kent Counties and remained there for three years until the General Assembly reorganized the judiciary.

Montague, who had died in office. Lacy resigned his part time legislative position upon taking the trial court bench. J. Marshall Hanger, although of the opposing party, offered a resolution praising his faithfulness and integrity as Speaker. In 1882, the Virginia General Assembly elected four members to the Supreme Court of Appeals for twelve year terms effective January 1, 1883. Lacy, Thomas T. Fauntleroy, Drury A. Hinton and Robert A.

A \\"prior of Galloway\\" by the name of \\"William\\" appeared alongside the Abbot of Holywood and his prior in a document preserved by St Andrews Cathedral Priory dated to 1173, and so it is possible that this William is the earliest recorded Prior of St Mary's Isle. The priory maintained its dependent relationship with Holyrood Abbey. In order to help maintain the canons and prior of the monastery, in 1323 King Robert I of Scotland granted to Holyrood Abbey a tithe of the revenues from royal pleas taken from the area between the rivers Nith and Cree. The declining health of the priory, related more generally to the declining fortunes of monasteries in Scotland in the 15th century, led James IV of Scotland to seek its reincorporation into Holyrood Abbey. This only led to a kinsman of the abbot of Holyrood becoming Prior of St Mary's Isle. In the 16th century control of the priory was secularized and held by a series of Commendators. The Prior of St Mary's Isle, like others, had a seat in Parliament, Robert Strivelin being the last prior.

A Captain William Robertson Lidderdale (1747-1814) near the end of his life set out to prove that there had been some legal flaw when the wadset was foreclosed. Seeking the support of James Lidderdale (1786-1878), James being a leading solicitor in Galloway, he claimed that the ‚Äòpurchase‚Äô was carried out in the absence of the owners and therefore illegal. This against the financial indifference of his deceased father, John Lidderdale (1713-1777), he having been a wealthy man by reason of the ¬£50,000 amassed trading in tobacco, had not sought to redeem the wadset, and so recover the Estate.

A native of Oregon, he grew up near Salem as part of a prominent pioneer political family that included father Daniel and brother William. A trained lawyer, he was elected to the Oregon Supreme Court and served for one term from 1880 to 1886, including as the 13th Chief Justice from 1884 to 1886. He also served one term in the Oregon House of Representatives. Waldo spent many summers in the Cascade Range fostering an appreciation for the natural environment, which led to conservation efforts to preserve the range and later to the naming of several natural features after Waldo, notably Waldo Lake. Early life Waldo was born in 1844 in Oregon to parents who immigrated to Oregon Country from Missouri via the Oregon Trail in 1843. The family settled near Salem in an area now known as the Waldo Hills in the Willamette Valley. John‚Äôs father Daniel Waldo, was also the father of William Waldo (1832‚Äì1911). Daniel Waldo was a politician in the early days of Oregon, while John‚Äôs brother William was a lawyer, judge, and state legislator, serving as President of the Oregon Senate in 1885. John B. Waldo‚Äôs education was at Willamette University in Salem, graduating in 1866. He then passed the bar in 1870 and began practicing law in Salem.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. p. 256. On October 8, 1877, he married Clara Humason of The Dalles, Oregon.John Breckenridge Waldo. Salem Pioneer Cemetery. Retrieved December 2, 2007. They would have one daughter named Edith. Political career Waldo was elected to the Oregon Supreme Court in 1880 to a six-year term. He was not re-elected in 1886. During his time on the state's highest court, he served as Chief Justice from 1884 to 1886. John Waldo was also elected and served one term in the Oregon State House in 1888, representing Marion County. Conservation Beginning in 1880, Waldo took annual horseback trips into the Cascade Mountains. Stops included Elk, Crescent, Odell, and Davis Lakes, climbing the Middle and South Sisters, Black Butte and many others before his death in 1907. His brother would often accompany him on these vacations, as would John Minto. In 1888, Waldo and four others traveled from Waldo Lake south to Mount Shasta along what is now the Pacific Crest Trail. This is believed to be the first recorded journey of this route. These trips helped foster his appreciation for the natural world and spark a campaign for conservation of the Cascades. He was consulted by William Gladstone Steel when the later was attempting to get federal protection for Crater Lake. Waldo dreamed of a larger goal of preserving the entire Cascade range. Legacy John B. Waldo died on September 2, 1907, at the age of 62. He was buried at the Salem Pioneer Cemetery where other family members such as his father, brother, and wife were also buried. Waldo Lake in the Cascades and Waldo Glacier on Mount Jefferson are named in his honor.Snowshoe Routes: Oregon, Shea Andersen, 2001, The Mountaineers Books Waldo Hall at Oregon State University was named for his wife Clara H.

Plot Ted Higgins (Bud Abbott) and Tommy Hinchcliffe (Lou Costello) work for the Speedy Service Window Washing Company. They run into a bookie named Nick Craig (Joseph Calleia), who, after mistaking them for employees of the Speedy Messenger Service, sends them to Mr. Stewart's (Ben Weldon) office to collect $50,000 owed to him. But Stewart has plans of his own: he hires two thugs to rob Ted and Tommy of the money he has just paid. Tommy flees from the robbers and takes refuge in a room with a gaggle of women who are mailing face powder samples. He hides the money in an envelope and addresses it to Craig, but it is accidentally switched with an envelope containing a powder sample. Ted and Tommy return to Craig's office and explain what happened; they assure him that the cash will arrive in the mail the next day. When face powder (instead of cash) arrives in the mail, an irate Craig gives Ted and Tommy 24 hours to return his money. The boys attempt to contact everyone on the mailing list until they finally locate the recipient, Carol (Cathy Downs), who informs them that she spent most of the money and has only about $2,000 left. The three of them go to the race track hoping to gamble the remaining cash to win enough money to pay back Craig. They encounter a strange fellow named Julius Caesar (Leon Errol), who claims to have never lost a bet. They refuse to follow his betting advice, only to see his horse win, and they are left with nothing. Ted, abandoning hope, decides that they would be safest in jail, so they run up a huge tab in a nightclub. Just as they are about to be arrested, Craig and his henchmen show up and demand the money. After Ted and Tommy reply that they do not have it, the thugs take them to a nearby construction warehouse and begin pouring cement in which to dump them. Meanwhile, Carol and Caesar have been sitting at the bar, betting large amounts on fish at the club's aquarium. Caesar loses and hands her the $50,000 that she has just won, to her amazement. It turns out Caesar is actually an eccentric millionaire named J.C. MacBride, and they all arrive at the warehouse in time to pay back Craig.

Enzymes interact with a substrate by means of strain or distortions, moving the substrate towards the transition state. Transition state analogs can be used as inhibitors in enzyme-catalyzed reactions by blocking the active site of the enzyme. Theory suggests that enzyme inhibitors which resembled the transition state structure would bind more tightly to the enzyme than the actual substrate. Examples of drugs that are transition state analog inhibitors include flu medications such as the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir and the HIV protease inhibitors saquinavir in the treatment of AIDS.  Transition state analogue  Enzyme- catalyzed reactions lower the overall activation energy of a reaction The transition state of a structure can best be described in regards to statistical mechanics where the energies of bonds breaking and forming have an equal probability of moving from the transition state backwards to the reactants or forward to the products. In enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the overall activation energy of the reaction is lowered when an enzyme stabilizes a high energy transition state intermediate. Transition state analogs mimic this high energy intermediate but do not undergo a catalyzed chemical reaction and can therefore bind much stronger to an enzyme than simple substrate or product analogs.  Designing transition state analogue  To design a transition state analogue, the pivotal step is the determination of transition state structure of substrate on the specific enzyme of interest with experimental method, for example, kinetic isotope effect. In addition, the transition state structure can also be predicted with computational approaches as a complementary to KIE. We will explain these two methods in brief. Kinetic isotope effect  Kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is a measurement of the reaction rate of isotope-labeled reactants against the more common natural substrate. Kinetic isotope effect values are a ratio of the turnover number and include all steps of the reaction. Intrinsic kinetic isotope values stem from the difference in the bond vibrational environment of an atom in the reactants at ground state to the environment of the atom's transition state. Through the kinetic isotope effect much insight can be gained as to what the transition state looks like of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction and guide the development of transition state analogs. Computational simulation Computational approaches have been regarded as a useful tool to elucidate the mechanism of action of enzymes. Molecular mechanics itself can not predict the electron transfer which is the fundamental of organic reaction but the molecular dynamics simulation provide sufficient information considering the flexibility of protein during catalytic reaction. The complementary method would be combined molecular mechanics/ quantum mechanics simulation (QM/MM)methods. With this approach, only the atoms responsible for enzymatic reaction in the catalytic region will be reared with quantum mechanics and the rest of the atoms were treated with molecular mechanics. Examples of transition state analogue design After determining the transition state structures using either KIE or computation simulations, the inhibitor can be designed according to the determined transition state structures or intermediates. The following three examples illustrate how the inhibitors mimic the transition state structure by changing functional groups correspond to the geometry and electrostatic distribution of the transition state structures. Methylthioadenosine nucleosidase inhibitor Transition state analogue example one Methylthioadenosine nucleosidase are enzymes that catalyse the hydrolytic deadenylation reaction of 5'-methylthioadenosine and S-adenosylhomocysteine. It is also regarded as an important target for antibacterial drug discovery because it is important in the metabolic system of bacteria and only produced by bacteria. Given the different distance between nitrogen atom of adenine and the ribose anomeric carbon (see in the diagram in this section), the transition state structure can be defined by early or late dissociation stage. Based on the finding of different transition state structures, Schramm and coworkers designed two transition state analogues mimicking the early and late dissociative transition state. The early and late transition state analogue shown binding affinity (Kd) of 360 and 140 pM, respectively. Thermolysin inhibitor Transitions state analogue example 2 Thermolysin is an enzyme produced by Bacillus thermoproteolyticus that catalyses the hydrolysis of peptides containing hydrophobic amino acids. Therefore, it is also a target for antibacterial agents. The enzymatic reaction mechanism starts form the small peptide molecule and replaces the zinc binding water molecule towards Glu143 of thermolysin. The water molecule is then activated by both the zinc ion and the Glu143 residue and attacks the carbonyl carbon to form a tetrahedral transition state (see figure). Holden and coworkers then mimicked that tetrahedral transition state to design a series of phosphonamidate peptide analogues. Among the synthesized analogues, R = L-Leu possesses the most potent inhibitory activity (Ki = 9.1 nM). Arginase inhibitor Transition state analogue example 3 Arginase is a binuclear manganese metalloprotein that catalyses the hydrolysis of L-arginine to L-ornithine and urea. It is also regarded as a drug target for the treatment of asthma. The mechanism of hydrolysis of L-arginine is carried out via nucleophilic attack on the guanidino group by water, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. Studies shown that a boronic acid moiety adopts a tetrahedral configuration and serves as an inhibitor. In addition, the sulfonamide functional group can also mimic the transition state structure. Evidence of boronic acid mimics as transition state analogue inhibitors of human arginase I was elucidated by x-ray crystal structures.

He came back into the side in round 12 against the and after a few games back in defence he was moved forward. He kicked three goals in the round 19 clash against Melbourne at Etihad Stadium. Hansen began the 2010 season in defence. Following a combination of poor form and injury by a couple of the North Melbourne forwards, he was switched to centre half-forward against the in round 11. He went onto kicking 23 goals, including five against and four against in consecutive weeks, in addition to kicking four against . His contested marking, a feature of his pre-draft days, was a highlight in 2010 at either end of the ground. Hansen cemented a spot in the team's 22 for the majority of the year. Despite patches of form and frustration through 2011 and 2012, Hansen was a regular in the North Melbourne line-up. An injury in the 2012 pre-season along with a suspension in the Victorian Football League (VFL) saw his return to the side delayed until the second half of the season. He played in the forward line and kicked five goals from the first four games in 2013 before missing two weeks with a medial knee injury. He came straight back into the side in round 7, however, he played in the back line. Since his move back, he polled well in the coaches votes, earning votes in four games including a stand-out performance against in round 15. He suffered a concussion in the first minutes of the round 16 game against the Brisbane Lions and was subbed off. He finished eighth in the Syd Barker Medal. He led North Melbourne in general marking and was one of the league's best in respect to intercept marks. He also used his endurance to great effect as a loose man in defence on many occasions, setting up scoring opportunities. 2014 was a mixed season for Hansen, where he was limited to 18 games due to a chronic hip injury. He finished the season third in total marks at North Melbourne despite missing seven games. Following surgery on both hips, a long rehabilitation followed, including doing no running until mid-January 2015. This meant a delayed start to the season before returning against Richmond in round 6 at Hobart in which he recorded 12 possessions and 11 marks before sitting out the last quarter. Against Essendon in round 7, he recorded 24 possessions and 14 marks with five intercept marks. Hansen spent the 2016 season evenly between the AFL and VFL, while missing some time recovering from a concussion. Hansen played five games at AFL level including the side's elimination final loss.http://www.nmfc.com.au/news/2016-09-29/2016-review-lachlan-hansen In October 2017, he was delisted by North Melbourne when they informed him he would not receive a new contract for the 2018 season.

Until the 1980s it was Belize's only radio station.  Beginnings  The BCB began as the British Honduras Broadcasting Service, modeled on the home country's British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Amandala columnist Selvin \\"Smokey Joe\\" Wade remembers the station by its original callsign, ZIK 2, with which it signed on in the 1930s. At this stage it played mainly music from abroad. With the rise of the nationalist movement efforts were made to bring the BHBS closer to Belizean identity and it assumed the name Radio Belize.  The Sefe Coleman era  Edison Denburg Clifford Coleman, better known to Belizeans as \\"Sefe\\", entered the radio business in the 1960s and completely revolutionized radio in Belize. He was very popular and funny and was Belize's foremost comedian. Coleman was a mainstay of Radio Belize through the 1980s until his death in 1994. Son Gerard Coleman has followed him into the radio business at LOVE FM and Positive Vibes. During this time Radio Belize was considered the official voice of the ruling People's United Party. Radio Belize entertained Belizeans with a variety of music. In that era television broadcasting was unavailable in Belize, so the population was dependent on the only radio station in the country for entertainment and news. Popular programs from the BBC stable included \\"Portia Faces Life\\", and Doctor Paul which were aired daily and nightly.  The Belize Radio One experiment and brand extension  With the accession of the UDP in 1984, Radio Belize began to experiment with being more of a culture-oriented station rather than simply playing music. Now known as Belize Radio One, it mixed contemporary music with chatter from local radio personalities: Debbie Tillett, Mike Nicholson, Rudy Aguilar, Andy Palacio, Paul Mahung, and in the 1990s, Silvana Woods, Clover Broderick and Brian Mossiah. But the revamped Belize Radio One, even with a new television wing, still found trouble holding its own against the all-music format of KREM Radio, established in 1989. The government first tried privatizing the BCB and then extending its brand to include an all-music station named Friends FM, but with the proliferation of radio stations in Belize and an increase in technology, the BCB was rapidly becoming obsolete. General Manager Rene Villanueva Sr. resigned in 1992 after helming the BCB for two years and working there for 23.  Limping to the finish line  As it entered its last decade the BCB seemed anachronistic compared to other local stations. While still owning some of the best equipment in Belizean radio at that time, it could not handle the introduction of competitive and new formats of radio. All that remained was to shut it down, and after one last act of service‚Äîinforming the nation of the progress of 1998's Hurricane Mitch‚ÄîDJ Neil Hall (and, according to Villanueva, himself and Patrick Jones) shut down at noon Central Standard Time (18:00 G.M.T.) on 30 November 1998. The equipment was bidded out and purchased by LOVE FM and KREM Radio, respectively. While the BCB itself is defunct, former employees are still to be found on the Belizean airwaves, working for other stations. LOVE FM is unique in this respect; former BCB manager Villanueva now owns and operates that station and Mossiah, Terry Gordon, Ruben Morales Iglesias and some other veterans work there. Mike Nicholson worked for FM 2000 and now for Positive Vibes FM. In this way, the BCB remains, as its slogan says, \\"The Voice of Belize.\\" Frequencies Radio Belize *Ladyville, Belize District: AM 834 kHz (shifted to 830 in the early 1980s), FM 91.1 MHz. *Punta Gorda, Toledo District: FM 88.3 MHz *International: shortwave radio (90 m \\"tropical band\\") 3.285 MHz Friends FM (all frequencies in MHz) *Belize City, Belize District: 91.3 *Independence, Stann Creek District: 94.7 *Ladyville, Belize District: 88.9  Reference and external links  *Article originally written by Don Moore in the January 1989 Monitoring Times with a 1996 addendum *Channel 5's G.

Standing east of the Franklin Street Bridge and southeast of the Merchandise Mart, the bridge connects the Near North Side with \\"The Loop\\". The bridge is double- decked, the lower deck carrying three lanes of traffic south over the river with sidewalks on both sides of the street. The upper deck serves as a bridge for the Chicago Transit Authority's Brown and Purple lines.

The Chicago Plan Commission and Chicago Art Commission provided design input to architect E. H. Bennett. The bridge was completely rebuilt 2012-2013 by the Chicago Department of Transportation. The two leaves (north and south) were built off-site and floated on the river to Wells Street for installation. The other half of the bridge was rebuilt in place ‚Äì the two portions closest to each river bank, containing the counterweights for the bascule bridge. The second period of the reconstruction that affects Chicago Transit Authority train service on the upper level began at 10 pm April 26, 2013 and ended before the morning rush hour Monday May 6, 2013. The north leaf of the bridge was installed in the nine-day period, again floating the section on the Chicago River from its construction site to the bridge. The bridge reopened fully on November 21, 2013, when the lower level of the bridge opened to vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians. The bridge tender houses are also part of the rehabilitation of the bridge.

The Australians won by 65 runs thanks largely to 7-24 from Shelley Nitschke, who became the first Australian woman to take more than five wickets in an ODI. First-class and List A cricket Worcestershire played one County Championship match at Kidderminster every season from 1921 until 1973, and again each year from 1987 to 2002. Chester Road was then relegated to a Second-XI ground, and the only first-class game at Kidderminster for several years was Worcestershire's 2005 game against Loughborough UCCE, which the university side won by eight wickets. In 2007, with New Road badly affected by flooding, Kidderminster hosted two Championship games, while in 2008 Loughborough UCCE again visited. First-class cricket returned to Kidderminster in June 2019 when Worcestershire transferred their game against Sussex to the ground because of the threat of flooding at New Road. In List A cricket, one Player's County League game was held here in 1969, and a further six List A matches -- three involving the Worcestershire team proper and three more contested by the recreational Worcestershire Cricket Board team -- were hosted between 2000 and 2002.

(also Luchesio, Lucchese, Lucesio, Lucio, or Luchesius of Poggibonsi) ( 1180 - 1260) is honored by tradition within the Franciscan Order as being, along with his wife, Buonadonna de' Segni, the first members of the Franciscan Order of Penance, most commonly referred to as the Third Order of St. Francis. His cultus was approved by the Holy See and he is honored as a Blessed by members of that Order. Life Modestini was a native of the region of Poggibonsi, declared an imperial city in that period by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, according to some accounts as having been born in the small village of Gaggiano, which lay on the major road between that city and Castellina in Chianti. He was born around 1180-1182, making him a contemporary of Francis of Assisi, who later helped to change his life. According to some accounts, as a young man he took up arms to serve in the Ghibelline army. Once stationed in Poggibonsi, which was experiencing a period of strong economic prosperity, he abandoned his military career and married a young woman of the city, Buona de' Segni‚Äîtraditionally called Buonadonna. He then became a merchant, serving the large crowd of pilgrims who would travel along the road on which the city lay. His biographers state that, more than most merchants, he was so entirely and solely concerned with material success that he was generally reputed to be an avaricious man. His wife was said to be of a similar disposition. At some point Modestini had a moment of conversion and realized how foolish it is to strive only for worldly goods. He began to practice works of mercy and to perform his religious obligations with fidelity. After Luchesius had put on the gray tunic or religious habit of a penitent, he rapidly advanced in holiness. He practiced ascetic austerities: often fasting on bread and water and sleeping on the hard floor; at his work he bore God constantly in his heart. With his wife joining him in following a life inspired by their faith, Modestini and Segni then had the option of separating and each entering a religious order. This was an ancient and respectable way for husbands and wives to develop their spiritual aspirations, commonly practiced by married couples who felt a deep desire to follow God. Possibly on the recommendation of Francis, they chose to remain living as a couple. In this they revived a way of sanctity for married couples. Since they had no one to care for but themselves, and Modestini feared that in conducting his business he might relapse into covetousness, he gave up his business entirely. He and his wife divided everything among the poor and retained for themselves only so much land as would suffice for their support. Modestini tilled this with his own hands and gave the bounty that was beyond their need to the hungry. About this time Francis of Assisi came to Poggibonsi, where the commune had given a church and house to his friars. After he preached a sermon on penance, many people desired to leave all and to follow his way of life. But Francis admonished them to persevere in their vocation, for he had in mind soon to give them a guide by which they could serve God perfectly even in the world, without entering into Religious life. At Poggibonsi Francis visited Modestini, with whom he had become acquainted through former business transactions. Francis greatly rejoiced to find this avaricious man so altered, and Modestini, who had already heard about the blessed activities of Francis, asked for special instructions for himself and his wife, so that they might lead a life in the world that would be pleasing to God. Francis then explained to them his plans for the establishment of an Order for lay people living in the spirit he preached; Luchesius and Buonadonna asked to be received into it at once. Thus, according to tradition, they became the first members of the Franciscan Order of Penance, which later came to be called the Third Order of St. Francis. If Luchesius and Buonadonna were really the first Tertiaries (members of a Third Order), they must have become so not long after Francis founded his First Order in 1209. The first simple rule of life, which St. Francis gave to the first tertiaries at that time, was supplanted in 1221 by one which Cardinal Ugolino prepared in legal wording. And in the same year Pope Honorius III approved this rule verbally. For this reason the year 1221 is often given as the date of the founding of the Third Order of Saint Francis. Hagiography According to legend, Modestini's generosity to the poor knew no bounds, so that one day there was not even a loaf of bread for his own household. When still another poor man came, he asked his wife to look to see if there was not something they could find for him. That vexed her and she scolded him severely; his mortifications, she said, had well nigh crazed him, he would keep giving so long that they themselves would have to suffer hunger. Modestini asked her gently to please look in the pantry, for he trusted that Christ, who had multiplied loaves to bread to feed thousands, to bring the necessaries to the sick. When he did not have enough to supply all, he begged for more from others in behalf of the distressed. Once he carried a sick cripple, whom he had found on the way, to his home on his shoulders. A frivolous young man met him, and asked him mockingly, \\"what poor devil is that you are carrying there on your back?\\" Modestini replied calmly. \\"I am carrying my Lord Jesus Christ.\\" At once the young man's face became distorted, he cried out fearfully, and was dumb. Contritely he cast himself on his knees before Modestini, who restored his speech to him by means of the Sign of the Cross. Death and veneration When Modestini lay very ill, and there was no hope for his recovery, his wife said to him, \\"Implore God, who gave us to each other as companions in life, to permit us also to die together.\\" Luchesius prayed as requested and Segni fell ill with a fever, from which she died even before her husband, after devoutly receiving the Holy Sacraments. They thus died together on April 28, 1260. At Modestini's shrine in the Franciscan church at Poggibonsi it is claimed that many miracles have occurred. His continuous veneration as a Blessed was approved by Pope Gregory X in 1274.

Early life Taft was born in 1902 in Syracuse, New York. His father died when he was still a young boy. His mother moved the family to New York City, where she took up work as a house cleaner. Living in youth hostels and traveling the country by hopping trains, he took a long series of odd and day-laborer jobs: errand boy, factory worker, stable boy, power plant worker, ore freighter coalman, farm hand, oil field worker, mule skinner and many more. Taft joined the Industrial Workers of the World and, while working in the northern Great Plains as a harvest hand, became an organizer. Later he assisted with legal defense of IWW members in New York City where he was befriended by Roger Baldwin, a founder of the American Civil Liberties Union. Education and career Taft attended night school in New York City and obtained a high school diploma in 1928. At the age of 26, he enrolled at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and graduated in 1932 with a bachelor's degree in economics. He then entered the doctoral program in economics at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. In graduate school, he took a job conducting research for one of his professors, Selig Perlman. Taft's contribution to the work was so significant that Perlman made him a co-author on volume four of \\"History of Labor in the United State\\" in 1935. In the same year he earned his doctorate. Taft worked for the Wisconsin Industrial Commission and the federal Resettlement Administration before taking a job as an associate economist at the Social Security Administration in 1936. He was appointed an assistant professor of economics at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island in 1937. He was chairman of the Economics Department from 1949 to 1953. Throughout his tenure at Brown, Taft sought to use the university's expertise to improve society. In 1950, President Harry S Truman appointed Taft to a committee of experts on the New England economy under the aegis of the President's Council of Economic Advisors. In 1952, Taft pushed Brown University to join with a newly formed Rhode Island businessmen's committee to study the economic problems of the state. In 1963, Taft won a grant from the Ford Foundation to study the financial difficulties confronting, and the economic impact of, an aging populace. Taft was appointed in 1961 to a committee on labor-management reports established by the U.S. Department of Labor, where he helped advise the department and draft rules implementing the Landrum-Griffin Act. Retirement and later life Taft retired from teaching in 1968. He maintained an office at Brown, however, and continued to conduct research. In 1975, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to study the history of the labor movement in Alabama. He became an acquaintance of AFL-CIO president George Meany, who thought highly of Taft's intelligence and ability to quickly analyze any situation. Philip Taft died in Providence on November 17, 1976 at the age of 74. Impact on the field of labor studies Taft was and remains a well-known and highly respected labor historian. His The Structure and Government of Labor Unions was the first work to rigorously detail the organizational structure and governance practices of American labor unions, and is considered a fine application of organizational theory to labor unions. His \\"The A.F. of L. in the Time of Gompers,\\" published in 1957, was for many years seen as the definitive history of the American Federation of Labor. Nearly 50 years later, it is still routinely cited by labor historians. To many in the American labor movement, Taft was a highly regarded and sympathetic scholar. Two months before Taft's death, George Meany summed up the labor movement's gratitude by writing, \\"Generations of students will continue to benefit from your scholarship and understanding of the economic, social and human aspects of the world of work.\\" In 1977, Cornell University instituted the Philip Taft Labor History Book Award prize. The highly sought-after and prestigious annual award goes to a book of original research which explores :...the history of workers (free and unfree, organized and unorganized), their institutions, and their workplaces, as well as scholarship that explores the ways in which broader historical trends have shaped working-class life, including but not limited to: immigration, slavery, community, the state, race, gender, and ethnicity. Taft's papers are maintained at the Kheel Center for Labor-Management Documentation and Archives, which is housed at the Catherwood Library at Cornell University. The records consist mainly of research notes which Taft gathered while writing manuscripts. The archives include numerous original documents found nowhere else. The records are particularly detailed in regard to labor organizations outside the United States; the AFL-CIO's foreign affairs policies; maritime unions; labor's involvement with the National Industrial Recovery Act; the National Labor Relations Board; organized crime and unions; labor and the steel industry; teacher unions; and labor's involvement in national mobilization and economic policy during the two world wars.

Whittle and family, Martinsville, Virginia, circa 1905. Son Kennon Caithness Whittle, bottom row, far right Kennon Caithness Whittle (October 12, 1891 ‚Äì November 10, 1967) was a Virginia lawyer and judge who served as president of the Virginia Bar Association and was elected to the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. Biography Whittle was born in Martinsville, Virginia, the son of Stafford G. Whittle, a lawyer who served on the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals from 1901 to 1919. Kennon Whittle attended elementary school in Martinsville and received an LL. B. from Washington and Lee University in 1914. Following his graduation Whittle was admitted to the bar and began practice in Martinsville. Whittle was president of The Virginia Bar Association for 1940-41.The Virginia Bar Association In 1944, he was appointed judge of the Seventh Judicial Circuit and, in 1951, was elected to the Supreme Court of Appeals. He served on the Supreme Court until he retired on February 1, 1965. He received an honorary LL. D. from Washington and Lee in 1950 and he was a member of Phi Delta Phi. Judge Whittle drew controversy when he oversaw the trial of the \\"Martinsville Seven,\\" a group of seven black men accused of raping a white woman in January 1949. Ruby Floyd had accused the seven men of raping her. Subsequently, all seven were arrested, and confessed both after arrest and in their trials; their guilt was never in question.http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/famous/martinsville_seven/index.html In short order, the seven men were found guilty and were sentenced to death‚Äîthe sentence under Virginia law at the time. Alerted to the case and its growing controversy, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) campaigned against the verdicts, arguing that the sentences violated the equal-protection provisions of the U.S. Constitution (no white man had ever been sentenced to death in Virginia for rape). But Judge Whittle ruled that because of the brutality of the crime and the findings of guilt that the men's sentences were appropriate. The seven were ultimately executed in 1951. In denying the appeal of one of the 'Martinsville Seven,' Justice Edward W. Hudgins of Virginia's Supreme Court of Appeals ruled that the death penalty \\"does not depend upon the race of the accused, but on the circumstances, aggravation and enormity of the crime...the law applies to all alike regardless of race or creed.\\" In the rape of Mrs. Floyd, he said, the severity of the crime demonstrated that the accused showed no mercy. \\"Francis Grayson, a man of 37 years of age, saw the four men attacking Mrs. Floyd,\\" Judge Hudgins wrote of the appellant. \\"Instead of helping her, he left the scene, informed two others of what was taking place, the three went to the scene, and each in return, ravished Mrs. Floyd. One can hardly conceive of a more atrocious, a more beastly crime.\\"'http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/famous/martinsville_seven/14.html Justice Kennon Whittle was married to the former Mary Holt Spencer, whose sister Blanche married Julian Robertson Sr. of Salisbury, North Carolina.Washington and Lee University School of Law Robertson was a prominent textile company executive, private investor and philanthropist.

Its goals are to encourage the study of and interest in Australian history. It has a membership throughout Australia and many of its activities and facilities are funded by contributions from its members and benefactors. The society is a constituent member of the Federation of Australian Historical Societies. It publishes the biannual academic journal Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society (JRAHS), which commenced as The Australian Historical Society Journal and Proceedings in 1901, which is the oldest historical journal in Australia, and a quarterly magazine called History: Magazine of the Royal Australian Historical Society.  Purpose  The goals of the society are: *to encourage the study of Australian history and the preservation of Australian heritage *to promote the compilation of authentic records relating to Australia *to acquire, either by purchase, donation or otherwise, and preserve for the use of the society books, manuscripts, newspapers, prints, pictures and all such objects and materials (in any media) as may be considered by the Council to have a bearing on Australian history, and to establish, form, furnish and maintain a library *to promote interchange of information among members of the Society by lectures, readings, discussions, exhibitions of historical significance, tours, excursions and other appropriate means *to print, publish (in any media) and circulate such journals, periodicals, books and other literary or other undertakings as may seem conducive to any of the objects of the society History A public meeting in Sydney Town Hall on 30 October 1900 resulted in a resolution that an \\"Australian Historical Society\\" would be formed, in order to collect and preserve records, prints, photographs, books and other material relating to the history of Australia. The inaugural meeting of the Australian Historical Society on 15 March 1901 was attended by about ten people. The first president was Andrew Houison, and the first patron David Scott Mitchell (founder of the Mitchell Library). Membership grew, and in 1918, the Society was granted the right to use the prefix \\"Royal\\". The society's first premises, History House, opened at 8 Young Street, Sydney, in 1941, which remained its home until the move to the new (and current) History House at 133 Macquarie Street in 1971. A. G. L. Shaw served on the Council of the RAHS during the 1950s and 1960s. Activities The society undertakes a range of activities including lectures and workshops, functions, walks, talks, and visits on a wide variety of topics in Australian history. It holds an annual conference which addresses current historical issues in local history and heritage. The society also has a research library with an extensive collection of pictorial and text resources on all aspects of the history of New South Wales. In addition it administers grant schemes on behalf of the New South Wales government for the promotion of heritage and the writing and publication of local history. Publications The Society's journal is the oldest historical journal in Australia. The Sydney Morning Herald was an active supporter of the Society, and in December 1901 urged that the Society publish a journal, so that the work of the society could reach a wider audience. However, this was not taken up until March 1906, when the Journal and Proceedings, \\"Volume 1 1901 Part 1\\", was first published in March 1906 with the standardised library title of \\"Journal and proceedings (Australian Historical Society)\\". The first issue included a paper by Alfred Lee entitled \\"The Landing of Governor Phillip in Port Jackson\\". Volume 1 consisted of 12 parts which were published quarterly. Improvements in design and the addition of illustrations were introduced in Volumes II and IV (1917), and at the same time the editors announced a shift in editorial direction. Until then the journal had been publishing papers presented at the Society in the past, but from this point it was intended to publish more about the proceedings of the Society. This eventuated in the form of reports of excursions, answers to enquiries, and discussions about past published papers. Between 1918 and 1964, after the society had adopted the \\"Royal\\" prefix, its standardised title became \\"Journal and proceedings / Royal Australian Historical Society\\". A. G. L. Shaw was editor of the journal from 1954 to 1964, the first professionally trained historian to edit it. From the March issue of Volume 51 in 1965, the journal changed radically, increasing its size to about 400 pages, issued in four parts. At the same time it changed its name to Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society (JRAHS). The journal was published quarterly until 1992, and since then has been published biannually. The peer-reviewed, biannual academic journal containing original, previously unpublished scholarly articles and book reviews and images. Past issues under their respective titles (1901‚ÄìJune 1918 and 1918‚Äì1964) are available online as scanned copies, and the Journal is available as an electronic resource via Informit since 2012. An index of all journals between 1901 and 1985 exists on microform. The JRAHS has a Green Open Access policy, meaning that authors deposit a free copy of an electronic document online in order to provide open access to it. Its ISO 4 abbreviation is J. R. Aust. Hist. Soc.. The society also publishes the quarterly magazine, History, subtitled Magazine of the Royal Australian Historical Society. This grew from the Society‚Äôs newsletter, which began in March 1962 as a monthly supplement to the Journal and Proceedings. Its magazine format and name commenced in October 1988. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, the June editions of both publications were made temporarily available to the general public online.

Miller (1846-1902), a Confederate veteran and judge for Powhatan and Cumberland Counties, and his wife Anne Harris Patteson (1857-1957). He attended public schools in Powhatan County, then Randolph Macon Academy in Bedford, graduating in 1909. Later, he attended Richmond College, Washington and Lee University and the University of Richmond School of Law, receiving his law degree in 1914. Justice Miller was the fifth generation in the direct male line of lawyers in his family, and sired the sixth generation. He married the former Eliza Ingram (1893-1967) of Richmond in December 1919. The first Virginia lawyer in the family line, Thomas M. Miller, received his license to practice from George Wythe and John Randolph in 1763, during the time of the French and Indian War. The Justice's only child, also named Thomas M. Miller, was also a lawyer and had become a member of the State Corporation Commission shortly before his father's death. Miller's brother Thomas Royall Miller (1897-1980) played professional baseball for the Boston Braves.findagrave Career After admission to the Virginia bar in 1914, Miller established a private legal practice in Richmond, where he practiced until 1935. He was reviser of the Richmond City Code in 1924. From 1925 to 1936, he was Assistant Commonwealth‚Äôs Attorney for the City of Richmond. In that position, he prosecuted all criminal cases arising on the south side of the James River. These cases were heard in the Manchester Courthouse. (As a result of the agreement by which the cities of Manchester and Richmond merged in 1910, the merged city of Richmond maintained two courthouses until 2007.) With the endorsement of the bar of the City of Richmond (where he had served as president), he was selected by the Virginia General Assembly to serve as the judge of the Law and Equity Court of Richmond, succeeding Judge Robert N. Pollard, who had been appointed to the United States District Court. He rendered some 6000 decisions as judge of that court, and was reversed in only six. In 1947, Governor William M. Tuck appointed Miller to the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia, the first Richmond lawyer or judge to serve on the state's highest court for more than 100 years. Justice Miller's retirement took effect on December 20, 1960, a few hours before his death on the same day, such that his widow would receive a pension. Justice Miller received an honorary LL. D. from the University of Richmond in 1951. Justice Miller's character had two aspects. One commentator appreciated his keen sense of humor and penetrating intellect, boundless energy, and \\"delightful drawl\\" when speaking. His supporters in the bar characterized him as a friendly and humble man who never looked down upon those who appeared before him, appreciating his surpassing integrity and an innate sense of right and wrong, and lauding his judicial work as guided by a philosophy of judicial restraint, deference to the legislature, and adherence to precedent. Courts should continue \\"to adhere to precedent whenever reasonably possible and until departure is demanded by most compelling causes\\", he told the Virginia Bar Association in a 1953 speech. \\"He wrote in a rugged and straightforward manner\\", and quickly recognized the right of a case, according to Chief Justice John Eggleston, with whom Justice Miller had served for 13 years on the Supreme Court. On the other hand, Justice Miller firmly believed in racial segregation, and despite Chief Justice Eggleston's entreaties, refused to join in the decision in Harrison v. Day, which overturned much of the Stanley Plan of Massive Resistance to the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions in Brown v. Board of Education. Instead, Justice Miller sided with his mentor, now-Congressman Tuck, and U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd, and contended that the U.S. Supreme Court had made Section 129 of the state Constitution (mandating maintenance of \\"efficient, free public schools\\") inoperative by the desegregation opinion invalidating Section 140.

He was born in Camberwell in the London Borough of Southwark, on the day King Edward VII was proclaimed King. In 1915, Turner had his first ride on a motorcycle, a Light Tourist New Imperial. Turner Special On 16 April 1925 \\"The Motor Cycle\\" published drawings by Turner of an OHC single he had designed, using a series of vertically stacked gears to drive the overhead camshaft. A subsequent redesign used bevel gears to drive a vertical camshaft, operating the valves through rockers. The only shared aspects of the two designs were the bore and stroke, , with the barrel being sunk into the crankcases. The head could be removed from either design complete with undisturbed valve gear. Turner built his first bike in 1927, using his second design, a 350 cc OHC single. The Motor Cycle published a photograph of Turner's patented engine, mounted in his motorcycle called the Turner Special. The Special was registered for road use with the London County Council as YP 9286. It used Webb forks, and a three-speed Sturmey-Archer gearbox. Ariel designer By now, living at various addresses in Peckham and East Dulwich, in the London Borough of Southwark and running Chepstow Motors, a Peckham Road motorcycle shop with a Velocette agency, Turner conceived the Square Four engine in 1928. At this time he was looking for work, showing drawings of his engine design to motorcycle manufacturers. The engine was essentially a pair of 'across frame' OHC parallel twins joined by their geared central flywheels, with a one-piece four-cylinder block (or Monobloc) and single head. The idea for the engine was rejected by BSA, but adopted by Ariel. Thus it became the Ariel Square Four, and not the BSA Square Four. Turner was then invited by Jack Sangster to join Ariel. By 1929, at Ariel, Jack Sangster had Edward Turner and Bert Hopwood working under Val Page in design. Turner, now 28, married Edith Webley. Ariel Square Four Close-up of a 1932 Ariel Square Four 4F 600 cc engine The first Ariel Square Four 4F was shown at the Olympia Motorcycle Show in 1930 in chain-driven overhead camshaft 500 cc form. This was heavier and slower than Turner's original prototype due to production changes made necessary by the Great Depression. To make up for the extra weight, Turner increased the engine capacity to 601 cc for the 1932 Model 4F6. Ariel went bankrupt in September 1932, but was bought by Sangster, who promoted Turner to chief designer. In 1936 Triumph decided to create separate motorcycle and car companies, and sell the motorcycle company. Ariel owner Jack Sangster bought it and changed the name to Triumph Engineering Company. The Ariel Square Four changed from the 4F 600 cc OHC version to the 4G OHV 995 cc version that year. Triumph general manager and chief designer Sangster made Turner, now 35, General Manager and Chief Designer. (In this new position Turner received a 5% commission on the company's net profits, and became a shareholder with 4.9% of the equity). The first thing he did was clear space on the production floor for an office and an adjoining drawing office. Val Page had left Triumph four months before and joined BSA. Bert Hopwood came to Triumph as Turner's Design Assistant. Ted Crabtree, who was also at Ariel before, became Chief Buyer, and Freddie Clarke was made Chief Development Engineer: both were motorcycle racers. Turner examined the line of 250, 350 (3H) and 500 cc Mk 5 singles, and rationalised them into three sports roadsters: the Tigers 70, 80, and 90. He added single-tube frames, enclosed valve gear, upswept exhausts, polished cases, new paint designs, and chrome petrol tanks. Triumph Speed Twin Close-up of a 1938 Triumph Speed Twin 500 cc engine In July 1937, Turner introduced the 500 cc Speed Twin, selling at ¬£75. It was smaller and weighed five pounds less than the ¬£70 Tiger 90,The History of British Motoring (2007), Abbeydale Press. . pp. 90‚Äì91. and proved very successful. The 5T Speed Twin (some say based on the engine design of Turner's Riley Nine car) became the standard by which other twins were judged, and its descendants continued in production until the 1980s. The original 27 bhp parallel-twin was capable of exceeding 90 mph (145 km/h) and weighed 361 lb (166 kg). Turner's wife Edith died in a car crash near Coventry on 8 July 1939; the same crash which killed Gillian Lynne's mother and two other friends. Turner kept in contact with Gillian Lynne thereafter.Lynne, Gillian A Dancer In Wartime: One girl's journey from the Blitz to Sadler's Wells(Chatto & Windus 2011) Turner's \\"sprung hub\\" was supposed to go into production in 1941, adding 17 lb to the weight of a bike. But the war delayed its introduction until 1948. In 1942, Turner designed a generator, using an all- alloy Triumph vertical twin engine, for the Air Ministry. After a heated disagreement with Jack Sangster, Turner quit his position at Triumph and promptly became chief designer at BSA, where he worked on a side-valve vertical twin for the War. Bert Hopwood was made Triumph's new designer and Sangster put him to work on a 500 cc side-valve twin competing for the same contract. By 1943 Bert Hopwood completed the design, but it was never produced. Triumph's prototypes were released in February, before BSA's planned launch. The design later became the post-war TRW model. In late October, Turner went back to Triumph. Hopwood had been working on a design for a 700 cc inline four-cylinder engine that could produce 50 bhp, but Turner's return to Triumph put an end to that plan. Turner was Managing Director once again by 1944. The Speed Twin, Tiger 100 and 350 cc 3T models emerged in 1945. They now had telescopic forks, originally designed by Turner, but modified by Freddie Clarke after it was found that fork oil would spew out on bottoming. Triumph T100 GP 1947 500 cc Triumph T100 GP Ernie Lyons won the first Manx Grand Prix on a Tiger 100 built by Freddie Clarke using an alloy wartime generator engine and the unreleased sprung hub in 1946. Turner, away in America, and anti-racing, was furious when he heard, but threw Lyons a victory dinner anyway, and a small batch of replica T100 were made for sale. Clarke resigned and joined AMC as Chief Development Engineer. Bert Hopwood had an argument with Turner over racing, left Triumph, and stayed away for 14 years. The Mark I sprung rear hub was introduced in late 1947. In 1948, Turner was persuaded to allow the entry of three 500 cc twins in the Senior TT, but none of them finished, so the experience only added to Turner's opposition to factory racing. Triumph Thunderbird One of the Montlhery 1949 model 6T Triumph Thunderbirds on display at the National Motor Museum in Beaulieu The 6T 650 cc Thunderbird, as designed by Turner, and further developed by Jack Wickes, was launched on 20 September 1949, when three models covered 500 miles at 90 mph (800 km at 145 km/h) in a demonstration at Montlhery. Essentially an enlarged tourer version of the Speed Twin, the 6T was designed to satisfy the substantial American export market, and was advertised as capable of a genuine 100 mph (161 km/h). The Thunderbird became a favourite of police forces worldwide. For 1950, Turner went for a \\"low-chrome\\" policy, and banned the use of chrome fuel tanks. A chrome tank did not reappear till the 1981 Bonneville T140LE Royal Wedding edition. Once in production, the first performance improvements came midway through the first year when the carburettor size was increased. This was the year Turner expressed the belief that 650 cc was the practical limit for the traditional British 360¬∞ vertical twin. It was the last year for the T100 GP model, although the T100C carried on, and the Mark 2 sprung hub was released. Turner became involved in the establishment of the US-based Triumph Corp. in Maryland, a distribution company created to serve East Coast US markets. After 1950, America became Triumph's biggest customer. In 1951 Sangster sold Triumph to BSA for ¬£2.5 million, having previously sold Ariel to BSA in 1939. As part of the sale agreement, he joined the BSA Group as a member of the board. Turner's holdings in Triumph gave him 10% of the sale. A race kit for the Tiger 100 was introduced, bikes were restyled with new paint and the first dual seat appeared. The Tiger 100 race kit was dropped, and the T100C came with the kit already installed. The T100C had twin-carburettors for this year only. Triumph Terrier and Tiger Cub unit construction singles 1955 Triumph T15 Terrier at the Coventry Transport Museum The first lightweight for Triumph since 1933, a 150 cc OHV Terrier T15, four-speed unit construction single with a sloping engine, was introduced in 1953. As a result, Triumph directors Turner, Bob Fearon and Alex Masters rode from Land's End to John O'Groat's for a 1,000-mile Terrier demonstration and publicity stunt ‚Äì the \\"Gaffers' Gallop.\\".Travelling With Mr Turner by Nigel C Winter (2011 Panther Publishing ) . By 1954 the sportier 200 cc version was available, and called the Tiger Cub. In 1952, Turner married Shirley Watts. They had two daughters and a son. Triumph T110 Tiger 1954 650 cc Triumph T110 The production 650 cc Thunderbird was a low-compression tourer, and the 500 cc Tiger 100 was the performance bike. That changed in 1954, along with the change to swing arm frames and the release of the alloy head 650 cc Tiger 110, eclipsing the 500 cc Tiger 100 as the performance model. Chief Executive of BSA Group (BSA, Ariel, Triumph, Daimler, and Carbodies) In 1956, after a boardroom struggle over power and control, Jack Sangster became Chairman of BSA Group, succeeding Sir Bernard Docker. He appointed Turner Chief Executive of the Automotive Division (comprising BSA, Ariel, Triumph, Daimler and Carbodies ‚Äì makers of London taxicabs). Triumph 3TA unit construction twin 1958 350 cc Triumph Twenty-One with faired-in rear end and higher handlebars for the USA market The first unit construction twin- cylinder motorcycle made by Triumph, the 350 cc (21 ci) 'Twenty One' 3TA, designed by Turner and Wickes, was introduced for the 21st Anniversary of Triumph Engineering Co. Ltd in 1957. Unfortunately it also had the first \\"bathtub\\" rear enclosure, which proved to be a major styling mistake, with dealers reputedly having to remove enclosures to sell bikes. Turner's new unit Triumph Speed Twin, the 5TA, introduced in 1959 was a 500 cc version of this engine and was similarly styled. The 6T Thunderbird and T110 models also acquired the bathtub rear fairing. Although quickly mimicked by competitors, eventually Turner relented on this unpopular feature, the 'bathtub' becoming more and more abbreviated until disappearing altogether on the final 1966 versions. Sportier versions of both the 5TA (the Tiger 100) and 3TA (the Tiger 90)were produced from 1960‚Äì1974 and 1963‚Äì1969, respectively. Triumph T120 Bonneville Early T120 Bonnevilles from 1959 had the headlamp-nacelle and deeply valanced mudguards used on other models but were dropped from 1960 In 1958 a twin-carburettor version of the 650 engine emerged. Triumph test rider Percy Tait hit 128 mph on a prototype Bonneville T120 at the Motor Industry Research Association (MIRA) test track. The \\"Bonnie\\" was a show stopper at the 1958 Earl's Court Motorcycle Show. Turner, wary of racing and high-performance options, thought the Bonnie was a bad design and reputedly said to Frank Baker, Triumph's experimental department manager, \\"This, my boy, will lead us straight into Carey Street (where the bankruptcy courts were).\\" Daimler V8 engines Daimler SP250 also known as the 'Dart' For 1959 Turner designed the hemi-head Daimler 2.5 & 4.5 litre V8 engines used in the Daimler SP250 sports car and Daimler Majestic Major respectively. The valve gear was more similar to the Chrysler Hemi than the Triumph motorcycle, itself based on Riley. In 1960 Turner went for a tour of the Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha plants in Japan and was shaken by the scale of production. By 1961 Turner was under pressure to retire. Bert Hopwood resigned from AMC, and accepted Turner's offer to work for Triumph as Director and General Manager. It was at this time that Hopwood conceived the idea of a three-cylinder bike and engineer Doug Hele completed the drawings. Daimler was sold to Jaguar, and Edward Turner's V-8 was put into a Jaguar Mark 2 body with an upgraded interior and trademark Daimler grille, and called the Daimler 2¬Ω litre V8. In 1962, the last year of the \\"pre-unit\\" models, Triumph used a frame with twin front downtubes, but returned to a traditional Triumph single front downtube for the unit construction models that followed. From 1963 all Triumph engines were of unit construction. 1964 Triumph TR6R Trophy with Turner's unit 650 cc engine Triumph Scooters 1965 Triumph Tina scooter (left) at Coventry Transport Museum Two Turner- designed scooters were introduced, about 1958 the high-performance Triumph Tigress (also sold as the BSA Sunbeam) and in 1963 the Tina (later called the T10), a Turner-designed 100 cc automatic transmission scooter for shopping. Retirement Turner retired as Chief Executive of the Automotive Division (which included motorcycles) in 1963, but retained his BSA Directorship. He was apparently by this time unhappy about the direction the company was taking. Bert Hopwood had hopes of being appointed Turner's successor, but the job went to BSA's Harry Sturgeon. BSA management now took over Triumph policy completely. Sturgeon decided to streamline motorcycle operations after McKinsey, an international business consultant, recommended treating the two companies as one. 1966 saw Turner working on a large-displacement, four- cylinder engine design which was not built. In 1967, Turner, at 66, retired from the BSA Board and Harry Sturgeon took his place. Unlike Turner, Sturgeon was convinced Triumph had to be involved in racing, and John Hartle won the 1967 Isle of Man TT production event on a Bonneville, just before Harry Sturgeon suddenly died, and was replaced by Lionel Jofeh. Triumph Bandit and BSA Fury In November 1970 the ailing company's last major press and trade launch was held. In the lineup was an ohc 350 cc twin with twin carburettors and five-speed transmission, designed by Turner (already retired) as his last project, and further refined by Bert Hopwood and Doug Hele. It was to be sold as both the Triumph Bandit and BSA Fury, each distinguished by minor cosmetic changes and paint schemes, with 34 bhp and capable of 110 mph. Although included in that year's brochures, financial problems forced cancellation of the model before any production. Several pre-production prototypes still exist. 1971 Bandit prototype was Turner's concept but the version intended for production was by Doug Hele and Bert Hopwood This model represented an attempt by BSA-Triumph to compete in the wider 350 cc category, being a large-selling engine-displacement at the time. In an early 1970s issue of Cycle Buyers Guide (a yearly listing of all available motorcycles) it was stated that in the year prior to that issue, Honda had sold more 350 cc motorcycles than Yamaha had sold motorcycles. BSA-Triumph marketed two versions of exhaust system on the Bandit and Fury; the Street Scrambler 'SS' version had a high-mounted matt black system with both pipes on the same side, and the other version had bright-chromed exhausts conventionally mounted low on either side. BSA-Triumph made a major media push with multi-page brochure inserts in all the major US Cycle publications, and the 350s were prominently displayed. This determined response was to challenge the Japanese by designing a competitive and aesthetically up-to-date 350. The look was very well received and many enthusiasts were looking forward to their arrival but BSA- Triumph was in a deteriorating financial condition (labour disputes, unreliable electrical systems, oil-leaking engines, and ageing styling). With limited resources, the company made a decision not to produce any 350s, but to concentrate instead on the \\"proven models\\".  Commemoration  When the Royal Mail issued six postage stamps on 19 July 2005 each featuring a classic British motorcycle, Turner was the only designer cited by name in the accompanying presentation packet notes. This was in relation to the 47 pence stamp featuring his 1938 Triumph Speed Twin. In 2008, an address where Turner lived and worked in Peckham, South-East London was awarded a Blue Plaque by Southwark London Borough Council following a popular public vote in 2007. The Blue Plaque at 8 Philip Walk, where he lived whilst working for his father's bottle-brush factory itself now at 6 Philip Walk, was unveiled by his son, Edward Turner Jr on Sunday 25 October 2009 in the presence of his siblings, Jane Meadows and Charmian Hawley.

Early and family life Staples was born at Martinsville, Virginia in 1885 to Abram Penn Staples (1858‚Äì1913), a prominent Virginia lawyer and his wife. His grandfather, Samuel Granville Staples, was the elected clerk of the Circuit Court of Patrick County, Virginia and had signed the Articles of Secession in 1861. His uncle, Waller Redd Staples sat of the Virginia Court of Appeals from 1870‚Äì1881 and for three of those years also on the faculty of the Washington and Lee University School of Law. When young Abram was a child, his family moved to Roanoke, where he attended Roanoke High School. In 1904, because of poor health (and to facilitate his children's education), Abram Staples Sr. joined the Washington and Lee University law faculty, where he became a beloved law professor until his death in a Roanoke hospital in 1913. Meanwhile, this Abram Staples studied as an undergraduate at Washington and Lee University, and received a Bachelor of Law degree in 1908. Career Entering into practice at Roanoke in 1908, Staples soon made a name for himself as an exceptional lawyer. In 1924, he was elected President of the Roanoke Bar Association and, in 1927, was elected to the Virginia Senate (a part-time position), and was re-elected in 1931. He was appointed Attorney General of Virginia in March 1934 to fill out the term of John R. Saunders (who had died in office). He won election to that office in 1937 against Republican Gerould M. Rumble. He was reelected in 1941 and 1945. In August 1947, the Virginia General Assembly elected Staples to the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia. He served on that court until he retired in January 1951, because of failing health. Staples was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Delta Phi, and Omicron Delta Kappa.

He was convicted of the 1989 murder of Cheryl Ann Commesso, a mother of three from Florida, as well as the kidnapping of his 6-year-old stepson from his elementary school in Choctaw, Oklahoma. Floyd is also considered a person of interest in the 1990 hit-and-run death of his wife Sharon Marshall. It was later discovered that before becoming his wife, Sharon had been raised by Floyd from an early age as his daughter and was herself kidnapped by Floyd as a child. Sharon's true identity remained a mystery until 2014, when she was positively identified as Suzanne Marie Sevakis, the daughter of a woman to whom Floyd was briefly married. He disappeared with Suzanne, her two sisters and infant brother while her mother was serving a 30-day jail sentence in 1975. Suzanne's brother has never been located.  Early life  Floyd was born in Barnesville, Georgia, the youngest of five children born to Thomas and Della Floyd. Shortly after Floyd's first birthday, his alcoholic father died from kidney and liver failure. His mother struggled to make a living on her own and was eventually forced to give up her children. In 1946, Floyd and his siblings were put into the care of Georgia Baptist Children's Home in Hapeville. There, Floyd was bullied by other children for being \\"feminine\\" and later reported to have been sodomized with a broomstick when he was six years old. He was also subjected to harsh punishments by the staff; as a teenager, his hand was dipped into hot water after he was caught masturbating. Floyd often got in trouble for fighting and stealing. In 1959, the Children's Home put Floyd into the custody of his sister, Dorothy, after he ran away and broke into a nearby house to steal food. After being kicked out of his sister's home, Floyd traveled to Indianapolis to search for his mother, Della, only to learn that she had become a prostitute. Floyd had Della help him forge legal documents allowing him to go to California to enlist in the U.S. Army. However, the Army discharged Floyd six months into his service after discovering that he was underage and that his papers were falsified. After being unable to find his mother again, Floyd traveled across the country as a drifter. Della eventually died on July 2, 1968, and is buried in Graceland Cemetery in Chicago, Illinois.  Early criminal history  On February 19, 1960, at age sixteen, Floyd broke into a Sears department store in Inglewood, California to steal a gun. Police quickly responded to a burglar alarm, resulting in a shootout in which Floyd was shot in the stomach. He survived following emergency surgery. After recovering, he was sent to a youth institution for a year. In 1961, he was arrested for violating his parole by going on a fishing trip in Canada with a friend. In May 1962, Floyd returned to Hapeville and found a job at Atlanta International Airport. The following month, he abducted a four-year-old from a local bowling alley and sexually assaulted her in the nearby woods. Floyd was convicted of kidnapping and child molestation and was sentenced to serve ten to twenty years at the Georgia State Prison in Reidsville. That November, he was moved to the Milledgeville State Hospital for psychiatric testing. While being taken out for a medical errand in 1963, Floyd escaped and fled to Macon, where he robbed over $6,000 from a branch of the Citizens & Southern National Bank. He was convicted of the robbery and was sentenced to the Federal Reformatory in Chillicothe, Ohio. After a second escape attempt, he was transferred to the United States Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. There, he was continuously raped by other inmates, causing him to climb a roof at the prison and threaten to commit suicide at one point. After being sent to the federal penitentiary in Marion, Illinois, Floyd was sent back to the Georgia State Prison in 1968 and befriended a fellow inmate named David Dial. In November 1972, Floyd was released from prison and sent to a halfway house. On January 27, 1973, a week after he was released from the halfway house, he approached a woman at a gas station and forced her into her car, where he attempted to grope and sexually assault her. The woman managed to escape and Floyd was arrested. Floyd convinced Dial, who had also been released from prison, to post his bond, allowing him to go on the run as a fugitive. When he failed to show up for court on June 11, 1973, a warrant was issued for his arrest.  Relationship with Sandi Chipman  In 1974, Floyd, using the alias \\"Brandon Williams,\\" met a woman named Sandi Chipman at a North Carolina truck stop. Chipman was the mother of four children from two different fathers: Suzanne (b. 1969), from her first husband, Cliff Sevakis, and Allison (b. 1971), Amy (b. 1972), and Philip (b. 1974), from her second husband, Dennis Brandenburg. Floyd and Chipman dated for a month and married, and Floyd convinced Chipman to move her family with him to Dallas, Texas. Chipman was sentenced to thirty days in jail for passing bad checks in 1975. While she served her time, she left her children in the custody of Floyd. After she was released, she arrived home to find the residence vacated and her husband and children gone. Chipman eventually found her two middle daughters, Allison and Amy, in the care of a local church-operated social services group. She never found her oldest child, Suzanne, or her youngest child, Philip; the boy's whereabouts remain unknown. Death of Tonya Hughes Yearbook photo of Tonya Hughes, under the alias \\"Sharon Marshall.\\" By 1989, Floyd, his second wife, Tonya Dawn Hughes (who also had gone by the alias \\"Sharon Marshall\\"), and her infant son, Michael Hughes, were living in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where Tonya worked as a dancer at a strip club. A fellow dancer, Karen Parsley, encouraged Tonya to leave the domineering Floyd, only for Tonya to claim that he would kill her and her child if she tried. Floyd had joined the Fraternal Order of Police, despite not being a cop, and had told Tonya that he could use his connections to track her down. However, by April 1990, Tonya had decided to run away with Kevin Brown, a college student she was having a secret relationship with, and take Michael with her. That month, three passersby found Tonya lying on the side of a highway, one hundred miles outside of Oklahoma City. She was rushed to the Presbyterian Hospital in Oklahoma City with severe bruises and a large hematoma at the base of her skull. She subsequently died. As she was found with groceries scattered around her, police surmised she had been struck from behind in a hit-and-run while walking from a convenience store to a nearby Motel 6. When Floyd arrived at the hospital the following day, he claimed he had fallen asleep at the Motel 6 after Tonya had departed to collect the groceries. Both Floyd and Tonya went by a number of aliases. At the time of her death, the couple were suspects in the 1989 disappearance of 18-year-old Cheryl Ann Commesso, a former coworker of Tonya's. Commesso had disappeared following an angry confrontation with Floyd. Floyd was considered the lead suspect in his wife's death as well. Following Tonya's death, Floyd put two- year-old Michael into foster care and left the state. Michael's foster parents told authorities the boy had limited muscle control, was non-verbal, and often experienced hysterical behavior when he first arrived at their home, but he had made remarkable progress. In 1994, they began adoption proceedings. Six months after Michael was placed in foster care, Floyd was arrested on a parole violation. As part of the adoption process, Michael's DNA was compared to Floyd's to establish paternity. It was discovered at that time that Floyd was not Michael's biological father. When Floyd was released from jail, he attempted to regain custody of Michael. On the basis of his criminal record and the discovery that he had no biological relation, his request was denied. Kidnapping Michael Anthony Hughes On September 12, 1994, Michael was in the first grade at Indian Meridian Elementary School in Choctaw, Oklahoma. Floyd walked into the school and forced Principal James Davis at gunpoint to take him to Michael's classroom. Floyd then forced Hughes and Davis into his pickup truck. Floyd forced Davis out of the truck in a wooded area, handcuffed him to a tree, and sped off with Michael. The principal survived the abduction and was rescued.Michael H. Stone & Gary Brucato. The New Evil: Understanding the Emergence of Modern Violent Crime (Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books, 2019), pp. 419-420. Two months later, Floyd was arrested in Louisville, Kentucky. Michael was not with him and has not been seen since. Authorities have received conflicting reports as to what has happened to Michael. Some witness statements detail alleged confessions by Floyd regarding Hughes' death. According to these reports, Floyd reportedly told his sister and others that he drowned the child in a motel bathtub in Georgia shortly after the kidnapping. Another person claimed he saw Floyd bury Michael's body in a cemetery. Still other sources reported that Floyd had stated that Michael was still alive and safe, although Floyd had refused to disclose the boy's exact location or who was caring for him. In a 2015 interview with the FBI, Floyd admitted to killing Michael the same day of the kidnapping by shooting him twice in the back of the head. Tonya Hughes' background The investigation into the death of Tonya and the kidnapping of Michael uncovered more unsolved mysteries. It was discovered that Floyd had raised Tonya as his daughter since her early childhood. DNA testing to determine her paternity uncovered that she was not Floyd's biological daughter. Floyd has given a number of inconsistent statements regarding how she came to be in his custody. One such story is that he \\"rescued\\" Tonya when she was abandoned by her biological parents. The earliest known record of Tonya was her elementary school registration in an Oklahoma City school in 1975. She was registered under the alias \\"Suzanne Davis.\\" Authorities suspected that Marshall was born in the late 1960s and kidnapped by Floyd sometime between 1973 and 1975. It was revealed in October 2014 that Tonya had been identified as Suzanne Marie Sevakis, the oldest daughter of Sandi Chipman who had disappeared with Floyd, her stepfather, in 1975; DNA matched Chipman to Tonya. Chipman attempted to file kidnapping charges but was told by local authorities that, as their stepfather, Floyd had a right to take the children. Suzanne, under the name Sharon Marshall, graduated from high school in Forest Park, Georgia, in 1986. She was a good student who earned a full scholarship to the Georgia Institute of Technology to study aerospace engineering. Despite this, she did not go to college and instead moved to Tampa, Florida, with Floyd, where she gave birth to her son in 1988. Marshall began working as an exotic dancer and married Floyd in 1989 in New Orleans; by then, the couple had been using the aliases Clarence Marcus Hughes and Tonya Dawn Tadlock. Cheryl Ann Commesso Cheryl Ann Commesso Commesso's 1989 disappearance remained unsolved until her skeletal remains were found in 1995 by a landscaper in an area off Interstate 275 in Pinellas County, Florida. She was listed as a Jane Doe until a year later, when the remains were identified. An archeologist determined that she died from a beating and two gunshots to the head. Floyd and Suzanne had been persons of interest in the case after coworkers witnessed an altercation between Floyd and Commesso. Floyd accused Commesso of reporting Suzanne for misstating her income, which subsequently resulted in Suzanne losing her government benefits. The argument occurred outside the club where Suzanne and Commesso worked as exotic dancers. A coworker reported that Floyd punched Commesso in the face. Floyd and Suzanne fled to Oklahoma shortly after Commesso disappeared, and their trailer was burned to the ground in what was ruled intentional arson. In March 1995, a mechanic in Kansas found a large envelope stuffed between the truck bed and the top of the gas tank of a truck he had recently purchased at an auction. He found 97 photographs in the envelope, including many photographs of a woman who was bound and severely beaten. The police traced the truck to Floyd, who had stolen the truck in Oklahoma in September 1994 but had abandoned it in Texas the following month. Investigators compared the photographs of the injured woman with Commesso, as well as evidence found with her remains, and found that the clothing in the photographs were similar. The medical examiner also compared injuries seen in the photograph to the cheekbone of Commesso's skull and found that they were consistent. Many of the pictures contained images of furniture and other belongings identified as belonging to Floyd. He was tried and convicted for Commesso's murder on the basis of the photographic evidence found in the truck. Further investigation The investigation into the kidnapping of Michael Hughes as well as the earlier kidnapping of his mother are ongoing. Other photos found in the truck show sexual abuse of Suzanne starting very early in her childhood. Authorities found photos of her in sexually explicit poses at various ages, starting around age four. In September 2014, Floyd admitted to the murder of Michael, and that he had disposed of his body on Interstate 35. A search of the area yielded no results, and police believe that wild hogs may have eaten Michael's body. In 2001, while awaiting trial for Commesso's murder, Judge Nancy Ley ruled that Floyd was incompetent to stand trial and ordered for him to undergo further mental evaluation. Floyd fought against this assessment, asserting that he was competent. Several months later, the judge reversed her previous ruling and ordered him to stand trial. He was convicted and sentenced to death.

The last Catholic of the Welf princes, he was known for the large number of wars in which he was involved and for the long-standing affair with his mistress Eva von Trott. Life He was born at Wolfenb√ºttel Castle, the son of Duke Henry IV of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, known as Henry the Elder, and his consort Catherine, a daughter of the Griffin duke Eric II of Pomerania. His father had received the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel in the course of a subdivision of the Brunswick lands in 1495. Henry V succeeded as ruling Prince of Wolfenb√ºttel when his father was killed in a 1514 battle during the Saxon feud. He soon entered into the Great Diocesan Feud with the Prince-Bishopric of Hildesheim under John IV of Saxe-Lauenburg, against whom he lost the Battle of Soltau in 1519. However, the duke profited from his support of Charles V in the succession as Holy Roman Emperor, and in 1523 the Bishopric had to cede large territories to Wolfenb√ºttel. Henry remained loyal to the Imperial authority during the German Peasants' War, and in 1528 he assisted Emperor Charles V in the War of the League of Cognac against King Francis I of France in Italy. While Henry initially leaned towards Protestantism and supported parts of the Augsburg Confession in 1530, he remained Catholic. He was involved in an ongoing conflict with the Protestant Electorate of Saxony, and strongly protested when the Calenberg branch of Brunswick-L√ºneburg switched to Protestantism. In 1541, under a pretext but actually to gain the fertile mines of Rammelsberg, Henry attacked the Protestant Imperial City of Goslar. When in 1542 Elector John Frederick I of Saxony and Landgrave Philip I of Hesse as members of the Protestant Schmalkaldic League came to the help of Goslar, they managed to occupy the complete Principality of Wolfenb√ºttel. Henry fled to the Duchy of Bavaria. In 1545, Henry recruited an army with the support of Emperor Charles and managed to take control of parts of Wolfenb√ºttel. But in October he was captured by Hessian troops and kept prisoner,Letter from Melanchthon to Medler, MBW 4050 until the Emperor finally defeated the Schmalkaldic League at the Battle of M√ºhlberg, freed Henry and reinstated him in 1547. In 1550 the mercenaries of Count Volrad of Mansfeld occupied Wolfenb√ºttel, and Henry again fled, this time to the Emperor's troops at Metz. But Mansfeld soon left, and Henry returned. In 1553, he allied himself with Elector Maurice of Saxony against Margrave Albert Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, who had attacked Wolfenb√ºttel. This conflict culminated in the bloody Battle of Sievershausen, in which Maurice as well as Henry's two eldest sons were killed. The battle, however, ended in a victory for Henry. Henry finally converted to Protestantism under the influence of his only remaining son, Julius, and died in 1568 at Wolfenb√ºttel. Family Tomb of Duke Henry, his consort Sophia, and his sons Charles Victor and Philip, St Mary's Church, Wolfenb√ºttel Henry firstly married Maria (died 1541), daughter of Henry, Count of W√ºrttemberg, former Count of Montb√©liard, in 1515. They had the following children: * Margaret (1516‚Äì1580), married John of Podƒõbrady, Duke of M√ºnsterberg and Oels, in 1561 * Andrew (c. 1517‚Äìc. 1517) * Catherine (c. 1518‚Äì1574), married Margrave John of Brandenburg-K√ºstrin, son of Elector Joachim I Nestor of Brandenburg in 1537 * Mary (c. 1521‚Äì1539), became Abbess of Gandersheim in 1532 * Charles Victor (1525‚Äì1553), killed in the Battle of Sievershausen * Philip (1527‚Äì1553), killed in the Battle of Sievershausen * Julius, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg (1528‚Äì1589), Prince of Wolfenb√ºttel from 1568 * Clara (1532‚Äì1595), succeeded her sister Mary as Abbess of Gandersheim in 1539, later married Duke Philip II of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, Prince of Grubenhagen, in 1560 In 1556 Henry secondly married Sophia Jagiellon (died 1575), daughter of King Sigismund I of Poland, in 1556. The second marriage remained childless. Henry's affair with his mistress Eva von Trott (1506‚Äì1567), a lady-in-waiting to his consort Maria of W√ºrttemberg, produced ten children [1522-1558]. When rumours about his amour spread, he pretended she had died and arranged for a feigned funeral at Gandersheim Abbey, while she hid in Liebenburg Castle. Eva and the duke continued to meet even after Maria's death. She likewise had to flee from the Brunswick lands during the Schmalkaldic War in 1543, but could return and retired to Hildesheim. The ducal affair inspired Martin Luther to write his libel Wider Hans Worst in 1541.

The trio consists of Anna Khokhlova (–ê–Ω–Ω–∞ –•–æ—Ö–ª–æ–≤–∞), Aleksey Borisovich Serov (–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–π –ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å–æ–≤–∏—á –°–µ—Ä–æ–≤) and Aleksey Olegovich Ryzhov (–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–π –û–ª–µ–≥–æ–≤–∏—á –†—ã–∂–æ–≤).

Although \\"Avaria\\" knew only moderate success in Russia during the 1990s, they are considered to be pioneers of house music in that country, as the genre only started to appear there around 2000. Following Zhukov's death in 2002, the trio slowly lost original popularity and oriented themselves into a mainstream electropop movement.  History   The origins  Towards the end of the eighties Nikolay Timofeev and Alexey Ryzhov met in high school. Both being creative minds with good sense of humor, they started creating humorous material. After being noticed at a KVN (–ö–ª—É–± –í–µ—Å—ë–ª—ã—Ö –∏ –ù–∞—Ö–æ–¥—á–∏–≤—ã—Ö, Klub Vesyolyh i Nahodchivyh, Club of Funny and Smart, is a Russian TV show, a humor contest, which indirectly spanned similar contests in schools, independent from the show), they started receiving invitations to provide entertainment at parties. Timofeev and Ryzhov's first intended musical direction was rock. At a summer camp, they created a very short lived rock band called \\"–û–≥–Ω–µ—Ç—É—à–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å\\" (Ognetushitel, \\"Fire extinguisher\\"). But both of them lacked money to buy instruments and various equipment to play rock professionally, so they had to make some money. The duo started emceeing at local clubs and liked it. During college years, the duo was involved with another short lived band called \\"Interview\\". Also, Timofeev and Ryzhov were invited to a local radio station to make their own radioshow. During that period of time, the duo started putting sketches in some songs: whenever a famous song had a part void of lyrics, they put some of their own rap into it. This was later to become their trademark in their early songs. Meanwhile, the band was asked to perform in a local club called \\"–≠–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω\\" (\\"Electron\\"). Noticing the bad state of their club, they dubbed it \\"Disaster Disco\\". After a few fixing, the rating of their club went uphill as it became more and more famous. From two to four A childhood acquaintance of Timofeev and Ryzhov, Oleg Zhukov, was amongst the biggest and most loyal fans of \\"Disco 'Crash'\\", and soon joined the duo's closest circle of friends. One night, they took him with them to a soir√©e organized by a company called \\"Kranek\\", and all Zhukov did was repeating the company's name during one song. As Timofeev recalls: \\"And during one of our song, Zhukov repeated the company's name, Kranek, with such a voice, that the audience and us fell for his charm, and since then, he joined us for good\\". This happened in 1991. Around that time, the band was invited to Moscow for a trial studio record, resulting in their first album \\"–¢–∞–Ω—Ü—É–π —Å–æ –º–Ω–æ–π\\" (Tantsuy so mnoy\\", Dance with me), but it wasn't what the band expected. Some of its songs were later reused in their first official album. Towards 1997, the trio noticed their club was losing their popularity. They found out that a rival disco opened in town, and people there were charged half as much. They discovered that disco had only one MC, young and motivated, close in style to Timofeev. They decided that it was the best to join forces with him. That's how Alexey Serov joined the band. His first contribution to the band was recording a skit where he asked to turn the music off using many expletives (used later in the song \\"–ó–∞–∫–æ–ª–µ–±–∞–ª –¢—ã!\\" but with expletives covered by radio parasite sounds), and his second contribution was recording vocals for the second and final version of the song \\"–î–≤–∏–≥–∞–π-–¥–≤–∏–≥–∞–π\\" (\\"Dvigay-dvigay\\", Move it-move it). First success In 1998, while Russia was in crisis, the band decided to record their second album (considered by many to be their first). They lacked the cash to pay for studio time, so they made a deal with the studio \\"Soyuz\\". At that time, the studio was working on a remix album for the Belorussian band Lyapis Trubetskoy called \\"Lyapis-Dance\\", and Diskoteka \\"Avariya\\" was asked to make four remixes for the album. They made three pure remixes, while the last one became a comic rap song using Lyapis Trubetskoy's chorus. The song, called \\"–¢—ã –∫–∏–Ω—É–ª–∞\\" (\\"Ty kinula\\", You dumped) became their first single and later, their first music video. The band then had enough money to record their first official album \\"–ü–µ—Å–Ω—è –ø—Ä–æ —Ç–µ–±—è –∏ –º–µ–Ω—è\\" (\\"Pesnya pro tebya i menya\\", Song about you and me). It was composed of three of the Lyapis Trubetskoy remixes (one of them was remade for this album as an instrumental track), some songs from \\"–¢–∞–Ω—Ü—É–π —Å–æ –º–Ω–æ–π\\", and some brand new material. Soon other albums were released and the band became one of the most popular Russian bands. Alexey Serov's law education has allowed the band to stay producer-free. Their single stint with a producer, Peter Volkov, was short-lived. Back to three After their album \\"–ú–∞–Ω—å—è–∫–∏\\"(\\"Manyaki\\", Maniacs) was released in 2001, Oleg Zhukov fell ill, and the band had to perform without him. On 9 February 2002, Zhukov died of brain cancer. After Zhukov's death and a period of pause, the band decided to go on as a trio. They released their first music videos without Zhukov: \\"–•–•–•–∏–†–ù–†\\" (acronym for \\"Hip-Hop, House and Rock'N'Roll\\") and \\"–ù–µ–±–æ\\" (\\"Nebo\\", Sky), the latter featuring international model Katia Elizarova. These videos featured new versions of songs from the album \\"–ú–∞–Ω—å—è–∫–∏\\", with different music, and Zhukov's lyrics either sung by Ryzhov, or dropped out. After releases of some famous singles, the band released in 2006 a new album called \\"–ß–µ—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–æ –ü–∞—Ä–Ω–µ–π\\" (\\"Chetvero Parney\\", Four guys). It featured the song of the same name (although listed in the song list as an acronym of its title) which was recorded prior to the release of \\"–ú–∞–Ω—å—è–∫–∏\\", but the band lacked time to put it in the album. This song was the last new song released to feature Oleg Zhukov's vocals.http://avariya.ru/?p=biography (in Russian, the history of the band from their official website)http://avariya.ru/?p=74 (in Russian, history of the band as seen by Alexey Serov)http://avariya.ru/?p=77 (in Russian, history of the band, as seen by Alexey Ryzhov)http://avariya.ru/?p=71 (in Russian, history of the band, as seen by Nikolay Timofeev) Changes in style and lineup In 2011, the band released a new album \\"–ù–µ–¥–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è\\" (\\"Nedetskoe vremya\\", A Time not for Kids), featuring a more electropop- sounding style, and for the first time the autotune was used. The album itself was released online for free. In July 2012, Timofeev left the band to start his own solo career. The main reason cited by both sides was a continuous strain in the relationship between Nikolay and the rest of the band. In November, the band announced on their website the arrival of a female vocalist, Anna Hohlova. The band is currently active.

The couple's only child, William James Adams, was born in 1947. Professor of economics Walter Adams joined the faculty of Michigan State College (now Michigan State University) in 1947. He became a professor in 1956, and was honored with the title Distinguished Professor just four years later. Throughout his career, Adams wrote many books and papers, including The Bigness Complex: Industry, Labor, and Government in the American Economy; The Tobacco Wars; and Adam Smith Goes to Moscow. He frequently traveled to Washington, D.C., where he served as an expert witness at Congressional budget hearings. For many years at Michigan State, Adams taught a senior-level class (known in the course catalog as Economics 444) on American enterprise and public policy. It was widely reputed to be one of the most difficult yet rewarding courses available at MSU. One veteran of the class wrote, \\"Students who signed up for Econ 444 knew that they were going for the educational adventure of their lives.\\" President of MSU Following the resignation of John A. Hannah in 1969, Adams was asked by the Board of Trustees to serve as interim president while a selection process could be undertaken. Adams accepted, and was sworn in as Michigan State's 13th President on April 1, 1969. His brief, nine-month term was marked by the same campus unrest and student protests that were occurring across the United States in 1969. Adams was, however, frequently able to defuse tense situations using a combination of self-effacing humor and a willingness to engage the students personally in open dialogue.Adams (1971), pp. 37‚Äì46. In spite of his limited administrative experience, Walter Adams carried Michigan State University through a very difficult period in student/establishment relations. The students' positive impression of him may be seen in the numerous pro-Adams editorials that were published in the student paper, The State News. His success can be measured by the fact that toward the end of his term, petitions requesting that he remain as president had collected the signatures of some 950 faculty and 20,000 students‚Äîapproximately half of the entire student body.Charles \\"Lash\\" Larrowe, introduction to Adams (1971), p. 10. However, he stuck to his original promise, and on January 1, 1970, Walter Adams returned to what he considered his true calling, economics. In 1971, Adams published a memoir of his experiences as president, titled The Test. Legacy During his career, Walter Adams wrote more than a dozen economics books and untold numbers of scholarly papers. He retired from MSU in 1992 and became the Vernon F. Taylor Distinguished Professor of Economics at Trinity University that same year, a position he held until his death. Trinity's Department of Economics established the Walter Adams Prize for Excellence in Economics in his honor, \\"to recognize a graduating economics major at Trinity who has achieved great distinction in scholarship and involvement in the life of the University community.\\" Beyond his scholarly prowess, Walter Adams is remembered at Michigan State as being the \\"ultimate Spartan fan.\\" He held season tickets to seats directly behind the visiting team's bench in Jenison Fieldhouse, where basketball games were played through the 1988‚Äì89 season. (Today, an NCAA rule prohibits this.) \\"Ears were assailed by his piercing voice as he stridently ragged the opposing coach and offered advice to our own coaches on how to defeat the enemy.\\" Coach Bobby Knight, then of Indiana, who often received the brunt of Adams's vitriol, began a pre-game gift exchange with Adams as an attempt at appeasement (to little avail). Walter Adams donated instruments to the Spartan Marching Band and was made an \\"honorary band member,\\" a rare honor. Each fall he would put on his band jacket and a green Tyrolean hat with green-and-white plume, place one of his trademark cigars between his teeth, and lead the band in its march to the stadium. He was known as the \\"Number One Band Fan.\\" Today a scholarship for a marching band member demonstrating academic excellence is endowed in Adams' name. Walter Adams died at home of pancreatic cancer on September 8, 1998. Soon after his death, the former army cadet drill field west of the Music Building, from which the Spartan Marching Band steps off to march to the stadium on football Saturdays, was renamed from Landon Field (after the nearby residence hall) to Walter Adams Field. A commemorative garden, plaque and park bench, nestled at the edge of the field midway between Cowles House and the Music Building, were later added. In 2002 a former student and prot√©g√© of Adams, MSU Trustee Randall L. Pittman, along with his wife Mary, donated USD $6 million to restore and update Marshall Hall, a former bacteriology laboratory which has long held offices of the Department of Economics. For their generosity the Pittmans were allowed to append a name to the building, and they chose to honor Walter Adams. The building is now known as Marshall‚ÄìAdams Hall.

The initial phase of the project opened on September 16, 2005. The center sits on a site in La Cantera, a master-planned resort community developed by USAA Real Estate Company. La Cantera is also home to Six Flags Fiesta Texas, La Cantera Resort & Spa and two world-class golf courses, The Palmer Course at La Cantera and the Resort Course, which was home to the PGA Valero Texas Open. Design The concept for the center was originally developed and conceived by The Rouse Company under a joint venture with USAA Real Estate Company. (The Rouse Company also developed San Antonio's North Star Mall.) General Growth Properties acquired The Rouse Company in November 2004. The Shops at La Cantera were designed by the local architectural firm Alamo Architects. The shopping center was constructed as a single-level, garden-like \\"retail village\\" with varied storefronts, shared arcades, and subtle water features. The overall architectural style of the center has a Texas Hill Country vernacular vibe that was designed to solve environmental concerns about land usage and nature conservation. The shops reflect the preservation of natural landscape and evolutions in modern-day shopping patterns. The landscape architecture style, that also reflects Hill Country, was conceived by J. Robert Anderson, FASLA of Austin. The Shops at La Cantera includes the first Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom in San Antonio and new stores from Dillard's and Foley's (now Macy's). There are also more than 150 other shops and restaurants.:Image:Dillard's Firewheel.jpg The second phase of the mall was opened in October 2008 and had 300,000 new square feet of retail space and contained an additional 40 stores (about 30 of which are new to the market), restaurants, a large bookstore, and Class A office space. Like the original mall, the second phase was designed by Alamo Architects.

It separates the Sandia Mountains to the north from the Manzano Mountains to the south. (The two ranges can also be considered parts of one larger mountain chain.) Elevations along the bottom of the canyon range from to above sea level.Tijeras Canyon on TopoQuest The canyon drains to the west, into a large dry wash known as Tijeras Arroyo, which runs through Kirtland Air Force Base, passes just south of the Albuquerque International Airport, and then joins the Rio Grande. The arroyo heads at the historically important pass (approximately ),Tijeras 'Pass' on GeoCommunicator and this pass and the entire canyon are traversed by Interstate 40, following the path of historic U.S. Route 66. (Route 66 originally passed through Santa Fe and entered Albuquerque from the North. In 1937 Governor Arthur Hannett re-routed the road away from Santa Fe and through Tijeras Canyon as revenge on politicians who he perceived had thwarted his re-election.Mike Smith, Towns of the Sandia Mountains, Arcadia Publishing, 2006, .) A railroad, the Albuquerque Eastern Railway, was proposed to run through the Canyon in 1901, connecting to the New Mexico Central at Moriarity, with a branch to the coalfields around Hagan. Some grading for the trackbed was done (still visible at places near the western mouth) but tracks were never laid in the canyon, and the project was abandoned in 1908.Myrick, David F. New Mexico's Railroads, University of New Mexico Press 1990, .

However the name Tijeras is now almost universally applied to the canyon. The original inhabitants of the canyon were Pueblo people, occupying Tijeras Pueblo near the site of the present-day town of Tijeras, but the site has long been deserted. The cement plant The largest employer in the Canyon is a cement plant which opened in the late 1950s. Its buildings and excavations dominate the portion of the canyon and surrounding hills southwest of the town of Tijeras. In 1950, the Tijeras Canyon job was the largest road project ever let in the State of New Mexico. It also carried the honor of being the first U. S. Route 66 four-lane divided highway built in New Mexico. Skousen, Isbell & Johnston Contracting Company was awarded the contract. The job reached completion in 1951. The project extended from Albuquerque's eastern city limits to roughly a mile east of Tijeras.

The series was hosted by Jack Barry and announced by Jack Clark. This show marked Barry's return to producing shows for national television after his 13-year hiatus from television after the quiz show scandals of the 1950s. Gameplay Three contestants competed in a quiz game in which the answers come from film clips. The contestants were given $250 to start, then they were given a subject after which they wagered any part of their current score. Once the bets were placed, host Barry posed a question, after which the contestants wrote down their answers. When the answers were written down, a film clip was shown to reveal the correct answer. When the clip was finished, the contestants then showed their answers. A correct answer won the contestant the amount wagered whereas an incorrect answer deducted the wager. $25 Toss-up round Four film clips were played and after each one, host Barry read three toss-up questions in which players buzz-in to answer. A correct answer added $25 to the player's score, while an incorrect incurred no penalty, but gave the other players a chance to answer. Celebrity toss-up After the fourth clip was played, a celebrity from that clip came in to ask the three toss-up questions. Correct answers were still worth $25. Grand finale In the Grand Finale one last film clip was played but without toss-ups. For this round, the bets were written in secret by the players before writing down their answers, after the final question was asked. Then the film clip was shown with the correct answer to the question. When the clip was finished, the players showed their bets & answers. All players kept their cash, but the player with the most money won the game and returned the next week to play again. Players who went broke at the end of the game still received $25. Any contestant who won three games received a new car, which nobody was able to achieve during the show's brief run. Bonus film clip round Each show ended with a bonus film clip round in which the top winner answered 6 questions worth $50 each. Episode status Copies of three episodes are known to exist: the 1970 pilot, the March 8 episode, and the Finale. All three are held by the UCLA Film and Television Archive; however, the Finale has also been found among private collectors.

Definition  For a prime number p let K be a p-adic field, i.e. [K: \\\\mathbb{Q}_p]<\\\\infty , R the valuation ring and P the maximal ideal. For z \\\\in K we denote by \\\\operatorname{ord}(z) the valuation of z, \\\\mid z \\\\mid = q^{-\\\\operatorname{ord}(z)}, and ac(z)=z \\\\pi^{-\\\\operatorname{ord}(z)} for a uniformizing parameter œÄ of R. Furthermore let \\\\phi : K^n \\\\mapsto \\\\mathbb{C} be a Schwartz‚ÄìBruhat function, i.e. a locally constant function with compact support and let \\\\chi be a character of R^\\\\times. In this situation one associates to a non-constant polynomial f(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) \\\\in K[x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n] the Igusa zeta function : Z_\\\\phi(s,\\\\chi) = \\\\int_{K^n} \\\\phi(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) \\\\chi(ac(f(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n))) |f(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n)|^s \\\\, dx where s \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}, \\\\operatorname{Re}(s)>0, and dx is Haar measure so normalized that R^n has measure 1.  Igusa's theorem  showed that Z_\\\\phi (s,\\\\chi) is a rational function in t=q^{-s}. The proof uses Heisuke Hironaka's theorem about the resolution of singularities. Later, an entirely different proof was given by Jan Denef using p-adic cell decomposition. Little is known, however, about explicit formulas. (There are some results about Igusa zeta functions of Fermat varieties.)  Congruences modulo powers of P  Henceforth we take \\\\phi to be the characteristic function of R^n and \\\\chi to be the trivial character. Let N_i denote the number of solutions of the congruence :f(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) \\\\equiv 0 \\\\mod P^i.

It is named by analogy to the process of removing a glove. Effects Typically, degloving injuries affect the extremities and limbs; in these cases, they are frequently associated with underlying fractures. Any injury which would induce degloving of the head or torso is likely to be lethal. However, controlled facial degloving is often featured in plastic surgery. Degloving injuries invariably require major surgical interventions. Treatment options include replantation or revascularization of the degloved skins, or when these are not possible, skin grafts or skin flaps. While the preservation of the extremities and limbs is normally preferred, in some cases amputations may be advised or required. Post-operative physiotherapy is of particular importance for degloving injuries involving the hand.

The Lagoon Company  The entire Lagoon Company. From left to right: Benny, Rock, Revy and Dutch. The Lagoon Company is a mercenary/pirate group that is the main focus of the series, hired by the many criminal organisations operating in and around Roanapur to locate, acquire and smuggle items by sea.  Rokuro Okajima / Rock  , also known as , is the main character in the series. In the anime version, but not in the manga, he is also the narrator of the story. He was a 25-year-old Japanese salaryman for Asahi Industries in Tokyo until he was taken hostage by the crew of the Black Lagoon during their raid on the ship he was on. He joined the Lagoon Company after his department chief Kageyama abandoned him (Kageyama declared him dead) in an attempt to cover up the smuggling operation in which Rock had been an unwitting participant. Rock is a caring and good-natured everyman despite being on the business end of guns from friend and foe alike, and often seems surprised at the dangers of the Southeast Asian crime world. He still wears his tie, dress shirt, and dress pants because although now a pirate, he still retains his business persona. He prefers to use words over weapons when interacting with others. Rock, after joining the Lagoon company, has wondered if he is experiencing Stockholm syndrome. Within the Lagoon Company, Rock is usually responsible for account management, diplomacy, negotiation, interpretation, and the occasional errand. Having once worked in the resource investigation department of Asahi Industries, Rock is also skilled in geology. He is also a natural linguist, being effectively bilingual in Japanese, his native language, and English as well as being familiar with other languages, including Spanish, Romanian, and Russian. He also has a surprisingly high tolerance for alcohol, owing to the heavy-drinking lifestyle of a ladder- climbing salaryman. Rock's charismatic personality has earned him the interest of several figures in Roanapur, including Balalaika, Mr. Chang, Rowan \\"Jackpot\\" Pigeon, Yolanda, Eda (who develops a crush on him), and young Garcia Lovelace. In many ways, Rock is the heart of the Lagoon Company, serving as a balance for his more callous teammates and as an average counterbalance in the world of darkness that is Roanapur. Dutch has stated that he believes Lagoon Company is complete with Rock not holding a gun, saying his bullets are the kind to ricochet back at them. Despite his lack of combat experience, Rock has come through every adventure, kidnapping and firefight with only a few bruises, surviving personal confrontations with most of Roanapur's most dangerous criminals at some point. Rock eventually begins to enjoy his life as a pirate and becomes even more comfortable with corruption. This comes to the fore when Mr Chang personally enlists Rock to locate Roberta before she is killed by US Special Forces, as he demonstrates a duplicitous, ruthless side of his personality clearly influenced by Revy and Roanapur. He devises a scheme to extract the US soldiers from the city to draw Roberta out, accounting even for Garcia's loyalty, Roberta's psychosis and the personal vendattas amongst the criminals, treating the entire plan like a gambling game. He is forced back towards kindness in the extra missing pages of chapter 76 after an angered Fabiola shoots him with a blank round. In \\"The Wired Red Wild Card\\" arc, he is last seen driving a car with Revy. While Rock has a family in Tokyo, he does not have connection to them due to their somewhat cold attitude towards him. It was later revealed that he did not pass his college entrance exams on his first try, leading his family to lower their expectations of him. It is known that he has a father, a mother, and an older brother who was academically capable and thus attained a job in the Japanese government. He was born in the 49th year of the Sh≈çwa period, according to the manga version, which corresponds to 1975‚Äì1976.  Revy  , sometimes referred by her real name of Revecca Lee, (not Rebecca) is the co-protagonist of the series. She does most of the fighting for the Lagoon Company. Very little is revealed about her past. Revy is a Chinese American mid to late 20s from Chinatown, Manhattan, near Mott Street, who spent most of her youth as a criminal. Flashbacks throughout the series reveal that she may have honed her skills with firearms by shooting at cans, and that her first murder may have involved shooting her abusive father, using a pillow as a silencer. Revy is very confident, grumpy, aggressive, cynical, and emotionally unstable. Unlike Rock, she is undiplomatic, believing in the use of brute force and violence to get her way. In contrast to this, she is revealed to be highly ticklish. She is also a heavy smoker and drinker. Of all the characters in the series, Revy is recognized as the most foul-mouthed character, yelling constant profanity. She is a sadistic killer without a conscience who will murder anyone at the slightest provocation, even unarmed civilians. She has a loving but bullying attitude towards Rock, the newest and most friendly crew member of the Black Lagoon; though she respects him later in the series, she is mostly threatening towards him, having nearly murdered him on two occasions and threatening him with death on several others. However, she does act to save Rock from critical situations, and later on she admits to considering Rock as family to Balalaika. It is likely that she is attracted to Rock, based on her reactions to Eda's teasing, which appear to be jealousy. Her attraction is further suggested in the last scenes of Season 2 when Eda asked her if she had gotten anywhere with Rock, instead of denying it with a short comment as usual she said she rather not say causing Eda to laugh at her hopelessness when it comes to men. Revy is also very protective of Rock. An example can be found in her anger and resolve to kill Chaka after he beats Rock. She has also lied or gone against her \\"nature\\" in order to save him; such as when he was kidnapped by Takenaka and she lied about him having the documents they required when she actually had them the whole time, or when she stood up to Balalaika when she held Rock at gunpoint after he opposed her plan to destroy the Washimine clan. She also went to Japan as his bodyguard (when Rock acted as Balalaika's interpreter), but as pointed out by Benny the only real reason she went was to look after him because she was worried about him. According to CIA agents on Basilan Island, Revy is still notorious in the NYPD (particularly at the fictional 27th Precinct). Revy is one of the deadliest fighters in the series, whose skill with firearms and ability to dodge bullets is almost superhuman and unparalleled. There are only a few other characters, such as Roberta and Ginji, that can hold their ground against her in combat. In episode 11 of the first season Revy concedes to Mr. Chang that she does not possess his level of skill but hopes to attain it eventually. Her weapons of choice are a pair of modified Beretta 92FS's; which are made out of stainless steel and had their barrels extended from 4.9\\" to 5.9\\" each (the 5.9\\" is the combat MOD barrel) and also adapted for silencers. They are engraved with the words \\"9mm Sword Cutlass\\" on both sides, the Jolly Roger of the pirate Calico Jack (which is also inlaid into the ivory grips), and a manufacture inscription in Thai. Due to her ambidextrous marksmanship skills, she is nicknamed \\"Two Hands\\" by the denizens of Roanapur, which is based on Douglas E. Winter's novel Run. Revy is also proficient in the use of other weapons, such as high-powered rifles and the M79 grenade launcher. Constantly living on the edge of life combined with the tragedies of her past, Revy has developed a rather bleak outlook on life, relying only on her own power, skills, and money.  Dutch  is the African American leader of the Lagoon Company and captain of the ex-U.S. Navy PT boat Black Lagoon. Age 40‚Äì50, he is a former Marine who fought in the Vietnam War. Shortly before the war ended (presumably in 1973), Dutch went AWOL, escaping to Thailand to work as a mercenary. Dutch first appears where he scolds Revy for taking Rock as a hostage when she had no real plan for obtaining any ransom. Because of this, Dutch apologizes and tries to take care of Rock until they find a safe place to abandon him. As Rock later proves to be incredibly useful, Dutch allows Revy to invite him into the Lagoon Company. Dutch tends to stay away from the fighting associated with Lagoon Company's activities. Instead, he gives orders and negotiates contracts with clients from the many criminal groups of Roanapur. However, Dutch is very capable in combat, skillfully wielding a Remington 870 Marine Magnum shotgun and a Smith & Wesson 629 revolver. Despite his amoral lifestyle, Dutch is polite and laid-back character, and most of the time, is very considerate. He has a close association with Balalaika of Hotel Moscow, having saved her life during one of Roanapur's gang wars. His body is heavily muscled, and he is always seen wearing a pair of sunglasses, typically dressed in camouflage pants and wearing a flak jacket. He appears to be in his 30s, but is most likely in his 40s, given his apparent military service in Vietnam given the setting of Black Lagoon in the 1990s. In the \\"Baile de los Muertos\\" saga in the manga, it is suggested that Dutch lied about his Vietnam service and could just simply be a mercenary with no past. However a U.S soldier advised Benny to be wary of Dutch, because a man like Dutch never lies without a serious reason.  Benny  is a dropout from a college in Florida where he studied until getting into trouble with the FBI and the mafia. Benny would have ended up dead if Revy had not saved him. He works as the Lagoon Company's mechanic, computer specialist, and researcher. He also functions as the Lagoon's driver and appears to be the owner of the 1969 Dodge Coronet R/T (later replaced with a 1965 Pontiac GTO) that Lagoon Company travels around Roanapur in. He is Jewish, or at least of Jewish descent as he puts it, and is often called \\"Benny-Boy\\" by Dutch. Benny joined the Lagoon Company two years before Rock after Revy rescued him. Benny has a level-headed and anxiety-free personality. He readily admits to Rock that the two of them are not gunfighters in any way, shape, or form. Unlike Rock, however, Benny is willing to turn a blind eye to Revy and Dutch's barbaric methods. Benny also tends to be possessive of his computers and will not let anyone else touch them. In the second season, he met Greenback Jane and after impressing her with his computer abilities, began an online relationship with her. Jane returns to Roanapur following the teams completion of the Lovelace Incident and Benny meets up with her. Possibly based on Jake Adelstein.  Hotel Moscow  Boris and Balalaika. Hotel Moscow is a branch of the Russian mafia based on Thai soil named after the Russian capital city of Moscow. The Bougainvillea Trade Company serves as a front for their activities. It is composed of the men who served under Balalaika in the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, who are dedicated to her. They are relatively new to Roanapur, but their brutality, discipline and prior experience make most of the gangsters wary of them.  Balalaika  is the boss of Hotel Moscow. Her real name is Sofiya Pavlovna. She was brought up by her grandfather, the military head of the USSR. Before joining the mafia, Balalaika was a captain in the Soviet Army and a Vozdushno-Desantnye Vojska paratrooper who served in the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. A fine marksman and sniper, she was nicknamed \\"balalaika\\", one of the Soviet Army's slang terms for the Dragunov sniper rifle. After being dismissed by the Soviet Military, Balalaika has an intense hatred for the corrupt Russian government and its influence over her country. It is because of this Balalaika decided to work for the Russian Mafia. Due to Balalaika's leadership during the hellish fighting in Afghanistan, her men look up to her as their superior and will do just about anything upon her orders. As a combat officer, she is a skilled strategist and well-rounded fighter, capable of taking care of herself despite the fact that all of her troopers, including Boris, often worry about her. Although she has shown herself to be rather cynical on occasion, she is also a pragmatic and professional businesswoman. She frequently employs Dutch and the Lagoon Company, as he saved her life after she was shot by Mr Chang during a gang war. She, along with Mr Chang, are one of the few people that Revy respects, and Revy would affectionately refer to her as \\"Sis\\". In turn, Balalaika also seems to hold Rock in high regard, sometimes relying on his knowledge and business skills. Balalaika can be easily identified by the burn marks which scar most of the right side of her face, neck, and chest which she suffered in Afghanistan, earning her the nickname \\"Fry-Face\\" by those who dislike her. She has long blonde hair, and usually wears a military greatcoat, thrown over a low-cut business suit. She smokes cigars, in contrast with the other characters who smoke cigarettes. Based on her service in Afghanistan and the missed opportunity to participate in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles due to the Soviet boycott, she is between 31‚Äì35 years old. In critical operations, Balalaika calls upon a personal cadre of ex-Soviet airborne troops and Spetsnaz commandos who are Afghanistan veterans. Known as the Desantniki,In the manga and English dub, they were called Vysotoniki. they act as Hotel Moscow's special ops team. She and her men share a strong fellowship and there is a great deal of mutual loyalty between them. It is implied that many of her current operatives served with her in Afghanistan. When conducting foreign operations from Thai soil, she uses the Russian cargo ship Maria Zeleska as a legal cover from the police and various law enforcement agencies. In spite of the fact that Balalaika is on the Interpol list, she uses the pseudonym Vladilena N. Vasilinov in Japan, being covered by diplomatic immunity.  Boris  is Balalaika's second-in-command. He can be easily identified by the large scar running from the right side of his forehead to his left cheek. He is a calm, broad-built man with a deep Russian accent. Like Balalaika, he also saw service in Afghanistan. She still refers to him as \\"Comrade Sergeant\\" rather than by his name, suggesting that he was her former platoon sergeant. He is very loyal and protective of Balalaika and often worries for her safety when she decides to fight in the field.  The Hong Kong Triad  The Hong Kong Triad are a branch of the Hong Kong-based Triad stationed in Roanapur. They are led by Mr. Chang, who is a proficient gun fighter in his own right. Chang is more patient than Balalaika in terms of getting into battle. Under his services are Shenhua, who is his top assassin; Sawyer, who does disposal jobs for him frequently despite not being a member of the organization, and Leigharch, who is their getaway driver until recent events prevented him from acting in this capacity.  Mr. Chang  is the boss of a Thailand branch of the Sun Yee On Triad. Like Revy, he is adept with dual-wielding pistols (Beretta 76 and AMT Hardballer) in a fashion similar to that of gun fu, the former of which are inscribed with a Chinese symbol, meaning \\"Heavenly King\\", on the grips. Chang is far more proficient in this dual-wielding gunfighting style than Revy, who, in episode 11, freely admits that she is \\"not on his level yet\\". It may be this prowess in combat that makes Chang the only male whom Revy respectfully refers to as \\"Sir\\". He has a deep respect for Balalaika (who annoys him by referring to him as \\"Babe\\"), though their beliefs are known to collide. Their relationship is almost playful in a business sort of way, which began after they survived a shootout with each other. They both recognise they would make a strong partnership in crime, but choose not to because it would make their respective lives boring. Chang is rather amused at Rock's \\"unique\\" way of handling things. Unlike most criminal bosses in the town, he advocates cooperation and joint ventures to keep the status quo in Roanapur, knowing outside interference would see all the criminals lose. A conversation with Eda just before Roberta's second rampage reveals Chang is in fact secretly backed by the CIA, being permitted to continue his criminal activities in exchange for keeping Roanapur relatively peaceful. Chang seems easily amused, and unusually-easygoing and lighthearted, especially given his position. This might be attributed to the fact that he was once a member of law enforcement, which he reveals after being called 'an inhuman scumbag' by Rock and laughing out loud in response, and he might very well be seeing his current position as an ironic twist of fate. The only time he is shown to be truly angry is when Eda (disguising her voice) taunts him about the USA's influence and the fact he has no choice but to cooperate with them. His past as law enforcer may explain his combat expertise. Chang manages to survive a shootout with Balalaika, escape from ambush of superior number of Islamic front jihadists, and disarm Fabiola easily. His expertise is often overshadowed by his easygoing character, in comparison with the ill-tempered Revy and near-psychotic Roberta. Mr. Chang is based on characters commonly played by Chow Yun-fat in films by John Woo, such as John Lee in Replacement Killers and especially Mark Gor in A Better Tomorrow, as both Chang and Mark Gor are members of the Hong Kong Triads, wield dual pistols and don similar attire.  Shenhua  is a Taiwanese assassin in the employ of Mr. Chang. She prefers to use various edged weapons in close combat, in particular a pair of Kukri knives linked together with a length of leather rope at the handles, thus using them as modified rope darts. She is also skilled in the use of throwing knives. Shenhua is a professional rival of Revy (who refers to her as \\"Chinglish\\" in the anime and \\"Yes Lady\\" in the manga; in return Shenhua calls Revy \\"Twinkie\\" in the anime (yellow on the outside (Chinese) and white on the inside), whom she has worked with and against at times. Her personal religion is Taoism. However, she tells Eda in episode 18 that she is an atheist, but this was due to a mistranslation in the English dubbed anime. One of her most notable traits is her broken speech pattern, which is always moving between Chinese and English. She is last seen being helped to walk by Lotton (who says that he will take her to a doctor, despite her having suffered what she believes to be a fatal wound) after being shot by Eda while hunting for Greenback Jane. In the El Baile de la Muerte arc, she is revealed to have survived the battle when Revy is shown calling her on the phone. She agrees to take up Revy's offer to help Garcia fight off the Colombian Cartel who is trying to kill Roberta. She showed her first glimpse of fear when in close range combat with Roberta when she managed to catch one of Shenhua's kukri in her teeth and shattered the blade to pieces. It is unknown if Shenhua has any unarmed hand-to-hand skills, although it seems likely. In the anime, she fights only with blades, and never engages anyone in true hand-to-hand combat. The only other person who does this is Sawyer the Cleaner, who frequently works with her in \\"disposal\\" jobs.  Leigharch  is an Irish getaway driver who worked with Shenhua during the incident involving the Islamic Liberation Front. A compulsive user of marijuana, he has a distressingly frequent tendency to hallucinate at inopportune times, such as in the middle of a car chase. Most of his hallucinations are actually references to Western pop culture, such as Playmates, Star Trek characters like Jean-Luc Picard and Klingons, or 1960s rock music such as Jimi Hendrix. Leigharch is said by Shenhua during the Greenback Jane incident to have suffered a massive overdose (he \\"couldn't get back from Mars\\"), inducing psychological damage severe enough to commit him to full-time medical attention. Despite his drug addiction and hallucinations, he was still considered a skilled driver before his overdose.  The Colombian Cartel  The Colombian cartel noted in this section is separate from the Manisalera Cartel which was originally responsible for Garcia Lovelace's kidnapping and was subsequently wiped out by Roberta and Balalaika who seems to have since taken over their territory. Along with the Italian Mafia, they are the most brash of the criminal organizations, much to the disgust of Balalaika and Chang. Just them barely appearing often results in needless fighting and bloodshed. They are led by Abrego, who is somewhat of a coward and usually travels with his men. Lately, they have been made a fool of in the criminal underworld because of the Lovelace Family and their two killer maids. While the Italians do it for profit, the Cartels do it as a sense of pride, which usually gets them into unwanted trouble. It is revealed that they had a hand in the assassination of Diego Lovelace.  Abrego  is a Colombian drug cartel boss operating in Roanapur. Whilst very arrogant, he has a tendency to be cowardly. He was presumed dead after the South American maid Roberta detonated a bomb in the bar he was in, although his appearance in later episodes is evidence that he somehow survived. After the explosion and the loss of many of his gunmen, Abrego's influence in Roanapur seems to have fallen, judging from the attitude he takes from Balalaika, Chang and Verrocchio. He is once again made a fool of, this time by Fabiola. Ever since the incident with Roberta, the Cartel had tried numerous times to figure out where she was hiding; fortunately for Roberta, through her connection with the Lovelace family, Roberta was protected daily by local police and military forces. Thus, the Cartel couldn't even touch her without causing an incident. Currently, he sends for many FARC soldiers to assist the cartel in finding Roberta; however, much of the FARC has been suspicious of the cartel's action and even threatened to betray them.  Gustavo  Voiced by: Paul Dobson (English) is one of Abrego's main henchmen. At first, he is seen doing simple tasks for Abrego, such as disposal jobs, early in the series. Recently, he's been assigned to track down Roberta after hearing rumors of her returning to the city by other groups, including the police, Triad, and Hotel Moscow. He, along with some men, search for Roberta throughout the city and meets up with Revy and Rock. He then explains the situation within the Cartel regarding Roberta. He then crosses paths with Fabiola, who is requesting the aid of Lagoon Company. Fabiola is threatened by him and his men, as Revy then instigates a fight between them, resulting in a comical argument between him and Bao over the use of the telephone, much to Revy's amusement. In desperation, he tries to call Abrego, who is out with a girl according to his subordinates. He calls all of them in to warn them of another maid who is as fierce as Roberta. Finally, he orders the total destruction of the Yellow Flag, much to Bao's anger as the Yellow Flag is demolished again. He is left behind by his men after Fabiola scares them off. Because of his failure, Abrego has ordered him to be killed on sight. He is later seen at Abrego's side during a meeting with the other gangs, perhaps Abrego becomes aware with heavy losses he caused.  Other Roanapur gangsters   Verrocchio  is the boss of a branch of the Italian mafia based in Thailand. He once attempted to use the child assassins, H√§nsel and Gretel, to kill the rival gang leaders, including Balalaika and Mr. Chang, in an attempt to seize complete leadership of Roanapur's criminal underworld. Verrocchio was killed when H√§nsel and Gretel turned against him on a murderous whim.  Ronny the Jaws  Ronny the Jaws is Verrocchio's replacement as the Italian Mafia's boss after his death at the hands of the twins. He wears braces; hence his name. His real name was unknown until Chapter 79. Balalaika calls him by the derogatory slang \\"Dago\\" prior to this. He seems to have a cooler head than Verrocchio but is still plenty arrogant and foolish. Balalaika and Chang seem to dislike him and his immature way of handling serious business. He doesn't hold much respect for Abrego either and treats him rudely despite being the newest amongst members of those holding the most power in Roanapur. Revy says his group is almost as vicious as Hotel Moscow and he appears to have an alliance with the Albanian Mafia.  Chen  was a Chinese crime boss whose business suffered as a result of Hotel Moscow recently muscling into Roanapur. He is quite cowardly, and Dutch had already stopped taking him seriously after he pulled out of a previous contract he had made with the Lagoon Company. After unsuccessfully trying to intimidate Dutch into ending his contracts with Hotel Moscow, he has a proxy hire Lagoon Company for a job and then sends the pirate gang of Luak to ambush them, but Revy and Dutch wipe out the entire fleet. Chen, having bragged about his plan to most of Roanapur, is then located by Hotel Moscow and murdered; they tie him to a chair in his apartment and blow it up using plastic explosives and gasoline.  Luak  is the captain of a Vietnamese pirate gang that operated in the rivers and seas of Thailand, mostly composed by former Vi·ªát C·ªông defectors. He was contracted by Chen to kill off the Lagoon Company when Dutch wouldn't accept Chen over Balalaika. Luak's gang ambushed the Black Lagoon, but the entire gang was wiped out by Revy and Dutch. Revy is seen to fire a round from an M79 grenade launcher into his boat at the end of the fight destroying it, so he is presumed dead.  The Church of Violence/The Rip-Off Church  The Church of Violence is a drugs and weapon smuggling operation located in Roanapur. The church is notorious for its double dealings. Using their front as a Christian church, their main business is illegal imports, mainly firearms. However, they are known to import other items, including drugs, which seems to offend Balalaika as it is bad for their business. So far they have consistently outsmarted Hotel Moscow in terms of imports. Dutch refers them as \\"The Rip-Off Church\\" due to the group charging heavily on goods, especially those needed for missions. Rock has been able to arrange proper business deals with the Church. The Church is always money-hungry and are known to do double-dealings, much to the disgust of Revy.  Eda  is a woman posing as a nun in the Rip-Off Church, with ties to the underground, since the convent is mainly a smuggling organization. About 30 years old, she is friends with Revy and often drinks with her in the Rip-off Church, but this does not prevent them from confronting each other, as they share the same hotheaded personality. She has taken a liking to Rock during the \\"Second Barrage\\" episodes, and makes fun of Revy by threatening to take Rock for herself. She often calls Rock \\"Romeo\\". Eda has blond hair, blue eyes, and wears angular pink sunglasses even with her nun's habit, and is often seen either chewing gum or smoking. Before she came to work for the Church, she claimed to be from Langley, Virginia. Langley, Virginia, is a metonym for the CIA as its headquarters is located there. Later on, it is revealed that Eda is an operative for the CIA and is being hosted by the Church of Violence in return for monetary payments. She is given an assignment by the CIA to track down Grey Fox, the same foe Roberta is hunting as they are a threat to her CIA division. Using a voice changer inside a mobile, Eda acts as an anonymous handler for Mr. Chang, providing him with intelligence about Grey Fox's mission to capture a major figure in the Triad's drug manufacturing operation. Chang is aggravated by the way he is being manipulated, but Eda mocks him as just a \\"two-bit thug\\" compared to the USA. Rock is perhaps the only person in Roanapur who openly suspects who Eda might be working for. Eda's preferred firearm is a Glock 17L (as seen in manga chapter 41), which she wields proficiently, despite Revy's claims that she is a \\"second-rate gunman\\". She apparently was loosely modeled after the character Thana from Ms. 45.  Yolanda  is the leader of The Rip-Off Church. She appears to be quite old and wears an eyepatch over her right eye. Despite her age and gentle appearance, she leads her organization with an iron fist. As the head of her organization, Yolanda usually never fights, leaving this job to gunmen like Eda and Rico. However, she does carry a customized golden Desert Eagle and uses it without hesitation in due course, such as in chapter 38 of the manga. She can fire the Desert Eagle one-handed and with deadly accuracy, seemingly unaffected by the gun's infamous weight and heavy recoil. Her looks could be based on Mother Angelica, a real-life Roman Catholic nun who, at one time, wore an eyepatch over her left eye. Yolanda is usually stern with Eda drinking alcohol in the church and seems to love tea. After an intelligent conversation with Rock, who convinces her to make a deal with Lagoon Company, she is impressed by his abilities and credits Dutch for finding someone as rare as him. She refers to Revy as \\"Rebecca\\" and tells her that she might learn a thing or two from Rock. She has connections with all the criminal organization in terms of intelligence, and though not officially part of the CIA, she serves as Eda's informant and confidant. She gives Eda fair warning that her opponent is no rookie and that she should be careful.  Rico  (Ricardo) is an apprentice priest in the Rip-Off Church. Like Eda and Yolanda, he is a highly skilled gunman whose choice of weapon is a M60 machine gun. He refers to Eda as \\"Big sis\\" (\\"Ane-san\\" in Japanese) instead of \\"Sister\\", much to her chagrin.  Citizens of Roanapur  The following are the inhabitants of Roanapur:  Bao  is the bartender and owner of the Yellow Flag bar, which he named in honor of the former South Vietnam flag. He is an ex-ARVN soldier who fought in the Vietnam War. He often feels harassed by Lagoon Company, especially Revy, for messing up his bar whenever they get into a fight with another party and reminds Revy to pay for the damage she has caused, which she always avoids doing. Balalaika seems to cover the repairs after Roberta destroyed it, which implies that the bar may be owned by Hotel Moscow. Seen as a great hang-out by most of the residents as it give many \\"jobs\\" to locals. After being rebuilt, he calls the Lagoon Company to tell them that Roberta is back in town. When Revy and Rock arrive along with Gustavo, they all meet up with Fabiola. After some words, Revy instigates a fight between Gustavo and Fabiola leading once again to the destruction of his bar. Bao claims that his bar has been destroyed more than 15 times, most of it done by Revy.  Flora  Madame Flora is the morbidly obese madam of the \\"Sloppy Swing\\", a brothel located on the top floor of Bao's bar. She took a liking to Rock and offered to \\"service him herself\\" (were she a bit younger).  Rowan \\"Jackpot\\" Pigeon  is the owner and manager of the GoofFest strip club on Rachiada Street in Roanapur. Of African-American descent, he has employed Revy as an S/M dancer once in the past, possibly putting her as a dominatrix. He has stated, however, that she \\"could give it and take it\\", implying that Revy could also have been the submissive. This is changed in the anime, with Rowan consistently asking Revy to join his BDSM show when she comes to his place, but with her expressing disgust at the idea. He is also a movie dealer who carries both legal and illegal genres (such as all forms of pornography and snuff films). He is extremely frightened of Hotel Moscow, especially of Balalaika.  Chief Watsup  is the chief of the Roanapur police force. He receives a regular stipend from Roanapur's criminal cartels, as well as the Lagoon Company, to stay away from their illegal activities. It is implied throughout the series that Revy tends to cause a lot of trouble in public and he usually has to bail her out much to his chagrin. He gets used to Revy's trouble making and he and Revy became sort of friends. For the most part, Watsup upholds this deal as long as his benefactors do not cause public incidents. He has dealt with Balalaika on more than one occasion, although she detests him for reasons unknown.  Bounty hunters and mercenaries  This section depicts the known bounty hunters and mercenaries that appear in this anime:  The Captain  The Captain is the rank of an unknown mercenary in the employ of the Extra Order Company, a fictional private military company similar to modern day Blackwater Worldwide and the now defunct Executive Outcomes, where the initials EO come from. An experienced ex-soldier who saw action in the Liberian civil war in the early 1990s, Captain had no qualms with killing anyone he was asked to kill. He was also something of a challenge-seeker, since he wanted to prolong his fight with the Lagoon Company, whom he saw as worthy opponents. This proved to be his undoing however, since Rock realized this and came up with a strategy to exploit Captain's attitude. While attacking the Black Lagoon head-on in a Mil Mi-24, the boat launched itself off a sunken ship and fired two torpedoes that brought down the Captain's helicopter, one hitting him in the face before detonating.  Sawyer the Cleaner  , also known as Sawyer the Cleaner, is a young girl, appearing to be in her late teens-early twenties, who specializes in body disposal, but also does occasional bounty hunter work. She is the person that the Triads turn to execute people in the most brutal ways possible, usually to serve as examples for their clientele and enemies. Her legitimate business front is, fittingly, a meat packing business named \\"U.G. Pork\\". Sawyer works in a white-tiled room, which is covered in blood from her various executions, and uses a chainsaw as her tool of trade. When on the job, she is dressed like a surgeon, but otherwise she wears gothic clothing. Few people seem to recognize her when she is not wearing her surgeon's robes. Because her throat had been cut open at some point, she speaks with an Ultravoice. Upon losing the Ultravoice, she is shown to become extremely emotionally distressed and drops into a fetal position. Like Shenhua, Sawyer is an assassin who eschews the use of firearms in combat. Instead, she utilizes a thick-bladed chainsaw over half-her-height long, the same one she uses on her victims. The size and build of the weapon allows her to deflect rapid gun-fire with horrifying ease, although this can still push her back. Much like Roberta, Sawyer is presented as an \\"unstoppable\\" attacker, much in the manner of Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, where she will cut through any obstacle in her path while stalking her prey, and the fact she enjoys her work immensely makes her even more dangerous. Her name may also be a homage to the Sawyer family of that film series and when she realized she had lost her Ultravoice in episode 18 she briefly reenacts Leatherface's \\"chainsaw dance\\" of rage. Strangely, she is one of the few bounty hunters to survive the manhunt on Jane, and is later seen doing some \\"cleanup\\" work on a Roanapur side street in the morning. She worked with Shenhua and Lotton in helping Garcia fight off the Colombian Cartel, who were trying to kill Roberta. She also seems to have replaced her hand held Ultravoice with a wraparound version of the device that can be worn around her neck. Just like Shenhua, she first showed her fear of Roberta after their first encounter when Roberta managed to stop and break the chain of Sawyer's chainsaw with her guns. She does not only do disposal jobs, but also cleaning jobs for hotel rooms. When she forgets her Ultravoice, she requests someone to translate for her and draws descriptions on a window or on a person's back to \\"speak\\". Given the chance to explain, she's extremely graphic about the details of her profession to the point those around her tell her to stop being descriptive. Despite the gruesome nature of her job, Sawyer seems to have a rather happy, yet morbid demeanor at times. In chapter 78 when she explained to Rock that he touched a mattress that had absorbed the bodily fluids of the corpses that died 14 days prior in the hotel room he, Benny, Jane and Feng Yifei were staying in, Sawyer has a blissful expression while everyone else vomits at this information.  Claude \\"Torch\\" Weaver  is a heavyset, middle-aged man with blonde hair and glasses and always sports a grin with a look of an archetypical everyman. As his nickname would suggest, he is a pyromaniac who uses a lighter shaped-and-sized flamethrower as his weapon of choice, although for heavy-duty jobs, he will also use a full-sized flamethrower. In spite of his profession and the fact he burnt his own wife to death (which he claims took five minutes), Weaver claims to be religious (which religion is unknown) and is a teetotaler. He is one of the few characters in the series that does not use foul language, preferring to speak with euphemisms (such as \\"darn\\" or \\"shucks\\") instead. He also moves fast for a man of his weight. He is blown up by Revy while hunting for Greenback Jane.  Lotton the Wizard  is a mysterious-looking man and one of the bounty hunters hired to capture \\"Greenback\\" Jane. He has silver hair, wears a black trenchcoat and shaded glasses, and speaks in a light voice. His weapon of choice is one or more Mauser C96(s) with an extended magazine, although it's unknown whether this is an actual Mauser or a foreign version of the gun. He does not drink alcohol (he claims he's allergic to it). He gets shot by Revy when he tries to make a fancy entrance. It is implied that he is not a mighty fighter, but a poser. However, he did survive a fall from atop a warehouse building after getting shot due to his Kevlar vest, so the full extent of his abilities is still in question. He worked with Sawyer and Shenhua in helping Garcia fight off the Colombian Cartel, who were trying to kill Roberta. He is also one of the few bounty hunters to survive the manhunt for Jane. After the battle takes off in the sea, he gets up and aids a gravely wounded Shenhua and Sawyer. Due to the uncommon act of kind-heartedness, Shenhua comments that he is not the type to kill and would be better as a host in a bordello, but Lotton claims that he is too clumsy for that. He is seen playing video games with Sawyer at Shenhua's residence in chapter 57 of the manga (as well as the OVA). Revy refers him as being more of a gigolo than a gunman; in addition, Revy forgets that she shot Lotton during the Greenback Jane incident (she shot him on reflex) causing Shenhua and Sawyer to mock her intelligence.  Major Shane Caxton  is an American black-ops operator hiding in Roanapur, awaiting deployment into Indochina. Like Dutch, Caxton is a Vietnam War veteran who still holds on to his moral code of conduct. Caxton's team, called \\"Gray Fox\\", under orders from a division of the NSA, orchestrated the assassination of Garcia Lovelace's father. Then were then dispatched to Roanapur in order to infiltrate the Golden Triangle and capture a key player who have tie with Khun Sa in the drug trade for trial in the US. However, he and is men are tracked by the formidable Roberta, and their conflict draws in all the major players in Roanapur, including the Triad, Hotel Moscow, and the Church of Violence. When he meets up with Lagoon Company, he automatically recognizes Dutch and mentions something to Dutch that seemed to shock him. He is held in high esteem by his colleagues, especially Gray Fox's second in command, for his integrity and honorable conduct, being the ideal symbol of America in the story. In a flashback, he executed one of his subordinates, Larkin, in retaliation for murdering innocent women and trying to rape a young girl during the Vietnam War. He also protects Garcia Lovelace as he and his team are escaping from Hotel Moscow. After escaping Roanapur and deploying to capture a drug baron in the Golden Triangle, his men are ambushed by Roberta, but he is actually shot by Garcia himself, who wants to end Roberta's rampage. It is later shown the gun was filled with blanks.  Bren the Black Death  Bren the Black Death runs a murder for hire business. According to Revy, he has an office in Roanapur but rarely does jobs there because of overlapping contracts. Roberta hires him to gather a team to attack Grey Fox to drive them out into the open. He sends in a group of hired guns knowing very well that they will be slaughtered by the trained soldiers. He then kills the one survivor himself.  Filano  Filano is a young boy who works for Bren the Black Death. He is seen observing the battle between the Grey Foxes and Roberta. He says he prefers to kill with an ordinary object or with nothing at all. He is particularly fond of pushing people downstairs or in front of trains. He considers guns to be the lowest form of killing. He does however like to play first person shooters. He also likes anime.  U-1324 Crew and Passengers  The following are the crew members and passengers of the U-1324:  Lieutenant Commander Wentzel Ahbe  was the decorated skipper of the Type IXC U-boat U-1324 and a survivor of the Battle of the Atlantic. His last order in the closing months of World War II in Europe was to take the U-1324 and its veteran crew along with two passengers from the Kriegsmarine naval base at Kiel to ostensibly return Lt. Col. Matsuda to Batavia. He succeeded in getting safely to the Indian Ocean, but ran into trouble with US Navy destroyers near the Nicobar Islands on March 25, 1945, which succeed in fatally crippling the U-1324 with depth charges, leaving it stranded on the seafloor. With only two hours of air left, he relieved his crew of their military duties and allowed them to face death however they chose. Ahbe was a patriot, but he despised the Nazi cause, expressing his bitterness to the SS Lieutenant Colonel that the Nazis had brought Germany to ruin and satisfaction that U-1324's sinking had meaning if his children would never see the Nazi flag again, leading the latter to shoot him. In their last act of loyalty to their captain, his crew avenged him. Ahbe left behind a wife and two children. His Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords is sought after by Revy after she and Rock recover The Twelve Knights Led by Brunhilda for its value on the open market. Ahbe is also shown to have received the Iron Cross 1st Class among his other decorations. He is apparently modeled after J√ºrgen Prochnow's character from Das Boot. Additionally, the U-1324 bears the famed laughing sawfish emblem of the .  Lieutenant Colonel Matsuda  Lieutenant Colonel Matsuda was an Imperial Japanese Army officer posted to Germany to study aeronautics, where he remained until the early part of 1945. Returning him to Japanese-held Batavia is the apparent final mission of the U-1324. He formed a fast friendship with Captain Ahbe and was sociable with the crew, engaging them in games of shogi during the voyage from Kiel to Batavia. When the U-1324 was fatally depth charged and runs aground on the seabed near the Nicobar Islands, he committed seppuku (ritual suicide) using his katana. He does not appear in the manga. Matsuda is based on the Imperial Japanese Navy lieutenant commander Genzo Shoji, who was posted to Germany to study aeronautics as well, and tried to return to Japan as a passenger of U-234. However, when Germany surrendered in the midst of the voyage, the captain of U-234 decided to surrender to the U.S. Navy. Consequently, Shoji committed seppuku‚Äîsuicide‚Äîto avoid capture. This episode was turned into the movie Das Letzte U-Boot in Germany in 1990.  SS Lieutenant Colonel Spielberger  SS Lieutenant Colonel (Obersturmbannf√ºhrer) was the U-1324's second passenger. A member of the SD, he was charged with the care of the painting The Twelve Knights Led by Brunhilda, which is part of a Nazi plot to prepare for the Nazis' eventual return to power following their defeat in World War II. He boarded the U-1324 the night before it sailed. Unlike Lt. Col. Matsuda, he was not as sociable, tending to keep to himself belowdecks, even when the U-boat was safely cruising on the surface in daytime. Like Captain Ahbe he also had a family, a wife and child in Stuttgart, but unlike the former, was more focused on the failure of his mission rather than on them in his final hours. Ahbe's anti- Nazi comments infuriated him, leading him to fatally shoot the captain. About to then shoot himself, he decided to take down as many of the U-1324's crewmembers as possible in his final moments when they avenged their captain's murder.  Aryan Socialist Union  The Aryan Socialist Union is a group of aspiring Neo Nazis styling themselves along the lines of the Nazi Sturmabteilung. They have a large arsenal of weapons such as MAC-10 machine pistols, MG3 machine guns, AK47 assault rifles, Luger, MP5 Sub-Machineguns, and double-action trigger-outfitted Colt 45 pistols and even TOW Anti-Tank Missiles. However, they do not realize that they have been lied to and are being set up by Sir Alfred, the head of the Neo Nazi movement, who believes they are a waste. There are more than 30 of them aboard their recovery ship, along with seemingly innocent hostages used to pilot the ship. It is unknown how many, if any, survived the conflict with the Lagoon Company.  Ratchman  is a short, fat man who leads the Aryan Socialist Union. He and his men are sent to retrieve a painting that was supposedly painted by Hitler and will reunite the Nazis and return them back to their former glory. He hopes that, by obtaining the painting, he will have proven himself and his men loyal enough to be accepted into the Neo-Nazi underworld. Though he shows loyalty on the surface, he is a coward at heart. Ratchman's lack of foresight and proper planning enables the Lagoon Company to sneak onto the ASU's recovery ship and launch a surprise attack while his men are drunk from celebrating after they recover the painting. He is murdered by Revy and Dutch.  Gruppenf√ºhrer  The is the commander of the Aryan Socialist Union's Suicide Corps. He is the only man, other than Ratchman, to get emotionally worked up over the latter's bombastic pronouncement of his mission. Feller leads his men down to the U-1324 using a special diving pod to connect with the U-boat's hatch. Getting caught up in a firefight with Revy, he is the only member of his team to set foot in the U-1324 to make it out alive, recovering the painting in the process. When Revy and Dutch assault the Aryan Socialist Union aboard their recovery ship, he attempts to arm himself with a MG42 to fight back, but is shot in the back by Revy in the ship's magazine. In the manga, he is last seen fighting Revy inside the submarine; his fate afterwards is unknown.  Fritz Stanford  is the Captain of the Nazi boat that is sent to obtain the World War II painting in the sunken U-boat. He is a physically huge man, and is filled with blind faith and overconfidence. In the end, it is this overconfidence that gets him killed when he brags about his weapon and threatens Revy (as she slowly reloads her weapon), who shoots him in the chest and then point blank in the head, mostly just to shut him up. He wields a large gold Luger chambered for the .454 Casull cartridge.  Sir Alfred  Little is known about , except he seems to be the head of the Neo-Nazi underworld. He is an elderly man, most likely in his 80s, since he was in the SS during the war, and it is implied that he is a combat veteran. Sir Alfred sets up a test of loyalty and ability for Ratchman and his Aryan Socialist Union, in which he purposely sends them to face-off with the Lagoon Company. Even though he sets them up, he already knows that Ratchman will most likely be defeated. Ratchman and the Lagoon Company are unaware that they are being set up. Sir Alfred feels that Ratchman and his men are idiots and a disgrace to call themselves Nazis, seeing their easy defeat by a group of \\"racially inferior\\" members as proof of their incompetence in his view. He even thanks Dutch and Revy for killing them off for him, and even harbours an amount of respect for Dutch, despite being a black man. Dutch later finds out that the Spaniard who hired him was in fact The Boss setting him up.  Protectors of the Islamic Front  The Protectors of the Islamic Front is a Jihadist group based in South East Asia.  Masahiro Takenaka  is a co-leader of the terrorist group \\"Protectors of the Islamic Front\\" and a patient, sociable person who rarely loses his cool. Despite being involved with an Islamic terrorist group, he himself is an atheist. Born in the Adachi ward in Tokyo, Masahiro was once an enthusiastic activist for human rights before joining the Japanese Red Army during the Cold War. Later, he was forced to evade arrest by hiding overseas after most of its members were arrested; and it was the time he traveled to Bekaa, Lebanon, that he met Ibraha. Takenaka is based on the Japanese Red Army member Kozo Okamoto.  Ibraha  is a co-leader of the \\"Protectors of the Islamic Front\\", leading one of its main cells in the Philippines. He is a Lebanese, and is resolute in his hatred of Israel, as his son was killed by Israeli soldiers in Beirut, Lebanon in 1987, after which he dedicated his life to destroying the West. Compared to Takenaka, he is the exact opposite in personality. While chasing Revy, Rock, and Shenhua towards a Basilan military base, he is shot and killed by Takenaka for refusing to pull their forces back for a retreat.  The Washimine Group  The Washimine Group were a Yakuza formerly run by . Balalaika came to Japan to work out a deal with the Washimine group to expand their influence in Japan in exchange for helping them weaken a rival Yakuza group, the Kousa Council. However, when Hotel Moscow's methods went too far, Tsugio Bando, the current head of the Washimine group, tried to stop them and was killed by Balalaika, who decided she would instead destroy both groups and take over their operations. Following his death, Ryuzo's daughter was put in charge. In the end, the entire Washimine group, and family, were wiped out along with the Kousa Council.  Yukio Washimine  is a high school senior and the only daughter of Ryuzo Washimine, who was the former kumicho (boss) of the yakuza organization \\"Washimine-gumi\\" (Washimine Group). She has a chance meeting with Rock and Revy when they come to Tokyo in the employ for Hotel Moscow. Her discussions with Rock lead him to think he might return to an ordinary life, although things soon turn dark when Rock learns that she was born into the Washimine Group. Having lived a normal life free of conflict, she learns that she is the only possible leader of her father's crime family, as the Kousa Council refused to allow anyone other than a blood relative take over. When her bodyguard and unspoken love Ginji resolves to fight \\"Hotel Moscow\\", she decides join him, assuming the mantle of leader. She falls, seemingly inevitably, into the world of the yakuza, although Rock desperately tries to persuade her to walk away. She initially claims her actions are to uphold the honour of the Washimine Group, but in reality she believes this is the only way she can be with Ginji. In her spare time, Yukio enjoyed reading a wide variety of books, particularly those concerning philosophy (she is once seen reading a book written by Martin Heidegger). She commits suicide with Ginji's sword after he is killed by Revy. Thoughtful, intelligent and talented, the misfortune of being the only heir to the Washimine group proved too much to bear.  Ginji Matsuzaki  is the acting wakagashira (underboss) of Washimine Group, and is Yukio's most loyal and humble personal body guard, and possibly love interest. He works as a street stall vendor, but was formerly an assassin nicknamed \\"Hitokiri Ginji\\" (Manslayer Ginji) due to his use of a katana in combat, serving the Washimine until the death of his leader, who was also Yukio's father. His skills with his blade are exceptional, manifesting themselves in such feats as cleaving bullets in two in midflight. Coupled with his ability to evade gunfire from multiple foes, Ginji almost completely eschews the use of firearms. He and Yukio quietly share an unspoken love, but neither choose to act upon it. Ginji had protected Yukio for a long time and hoped that she would live a normal life despite her family's criminal background. He seems to regret his past as a murderer, and is unwilling to take up arms again until his friend and former leader Tsugio Bondo is killed by Hotel Moscow. Ginji attacks the Japanese branch of the Russian Mafiya to hunt down Balailaka, though he changes targets when the Washimine enforcer Chaka goes rogue and kidnaps Yukio. He briefly allied with Revy and Rock to rescue her, massacring Chaka's henchmen before cutting off the enforcer's hands and drowning him in a pool. Ginji then assists Yukio in her efforts to avenge the slaughter of her clan, and they capture Rock so that he can lead them to Hotel Moscow's base. However, Revy catches up with them, prompting Ginji to face her in a duel. Ginji comes within inches of killing Revy, shattering her cutlass and stabbing her. However, he is distracted by Yukio's admission of love at the last moment; he only manages to put his sword through her leg as she shoots him in the throat. Revy comments that this hesitation was all that stopped Ginji killing her. Although Revy calls Ginji \\"Jumbo\\" because of his height, the name \\"Jumbo\\" may also refer to Takashi Takeda (AKA \\"Jumbo\\") from the Yotsuba&! manga series with whom he shares an uncanny resemblance.  Tsugio Bando  is the wakagashira (underboss) of the Washimine Group. Since the position of boss of the Washimine Group is left vacant by the death of the former boss Ryuzo Washimine, Yukio's father, Tsugio is the actual boss of the Washimine Group. Tsugio is very loyal to the memory of Ryuzo, who had protected him after he just arrived in Tokyo from Osaka. Due to his hate of the Kousa Council's ill-treatment of the Washimine Group, he allied with Hotel Moscow for a short time in order for his group to rise and make a name for itself. However, his plans and Hotel Moscow's completely differed in approach as Balalaika was more brutal in her methods, much to the dismay of Bando. He is killed in a desperate attempt to assassinate Balalaika and protect the Washimine Group, Balalaika easily dodging his attempt to stab her and then breaking his neck, before sending back to the Washimine the suitcase including his body.  Yoshida  is one of the enforcers working for the Washimine Group. He was very loyal to Tsugio Bando and refers to him as an older brother. Yoshida is usually seen as a bodyguard for Tsugio, and later Yukio when she inherits the leadership of the Washimine Group. During Yukio's inheritance of the Washimine Group's head position, it was Yoshida who rallied support for the young lady. He is killed by Chaka during Yukio's kidnapping.  Chaka  is one of the enforcers working for the Washimine Group who fancies himself as a \\"Wild West\\" gunman and is fluent in English. Arrogant, cruel, and sadistic, Chaka is often seen as an idiot by his peers. His earlier appearance showed that Revy's reputation as a gunman in Roanapur is such that even the yakuza in Japan have heard of her. Shortly after Yukio becomes the boss of the Group, Chaka makes his bid to take over the leadership by kidnapping her with the help of a street gang. He was determined to fight Revy in a quickdraw showdown, but she refused and lured him into fighting a duel with Ginji instead, who defeated and finished him off by letting him drown in a pool with both his hands severed. His character and appearance is likely based on Kakihara from Ichi the killer, as both of them are longing for a strong opponent equal to them and are sadistically violent. Possibly based on a presumably-existing Kudo-kai member hanging around Harajuku.  The Lovelace Family  The Lovelace Family are one of the 13 prominent South American families, and their origin is from Venezuela. However, the family has come under hard times from not only their peers due to their political beliefs, but also from the Colombian Cartel, which has been harassing employees of the family in order to take control of their land. However, because of Diego Lovelace's military and political connections, the family is constantly protected from threats. In addition, the family includes Roberta (aka Rosarita Cisneros), a former FARC terrorist who is wanted by both the Cartel and various law enforcement agencies. Because of her close relationship with the family, she is accepted as one of their own, serving as maid and, if necessary, bodyguard. Another maid, who is combat ready like Roberta, is Fabiola Igesias.  Diego Jose San Fernando Lovelace  was the former head of the Lovelace family, eleventh in succession. While it is one of the thirteen noble families of South America, the Lovelace family fell upon hard times, with only the meager income from their plantations maintaining their lifestyle. He took in Rosarita Cisneros, when she was escaping from the Colombian Cartel as a favor to his old friend, Rosarita's father. He took her in and treated her as family. Recently, he was assassinated during a speech due to the fact his political beliefs were seen as a threat by many. This event makes Roberta take up the \\"Bloodhound\\" persona once more.  Garcia Lovelace  is the only son of Diego Jose San Fernando Lovelace, was heir to the Lovelace family line, and as such, is its current head, the twelfth in succession after his father was assassinated. He was kidnapped for a short while by a Colombian cartel and was transported by the Lagoon Company as \\"goods\\". He and Roberta left Roanapur shortly afterwards, with some help from Hotel Moscow. He has apparently returned to Roanapur searching for Roberta with a new maid named Fabiola, waiting in a local hotel called the \\"Sunken Palace Hotel\\" and seemed to have matured greatly in terms of emotional strength, as commented by Rock, since his last appearance. He treats both Roberta and Fabiola as if they were his extended family and in return, both care for him equally. He requests help to find Roberta from Lagoon Company with additional help from Chang, Shenhua, Sawyer, and Lotton. However, the only person he truly trusts in Roanapur is Rock. To stop Roberta, Garcia comes up with the most drastic plan to fake Caxton's death with his own hands, thus taking away Roberta's \\"Path of Justice\\"; this causes her to hallucinate once more and shoot him. Her consequent horror finally snaps her out of her insanity. In the aftermath, Chang told Rock that the Lovelace family will still have a hard road ahead of them in future.  Roberta  is a Colombian maid who worked for four years at the Lovelace household in Venezuela. Although her domestic skills such as cleaning and cooking were poor, she developed a close friendship with the young son of the Lovelace family, Garcia. Roberta was once known as , a former FARC guerrilla trained as an assassin in Cuba and an internationally wanted criminal. Balalaika refers her as a \\"hardcore terrorist\\" to the point that Hotel Moscow had to deploy all their commandos as well as Balalaika getting involved in the situation personally should things get out of hand. Revy refers to her as \\"Fucking Four Eyes\\" or \\"That Fucking Glasses Bitch\\". She earned the moniker \\"Bloodhound of Florencia\\" for her relentless drive to achieve her objectives. Her tormented past and the smell of blood, gunpowder and muck like that of a sewer rat emanating from her was something Revy understood full well. In combat, Roberta is a truly fearsome opponent, having trained in a wide variety of martial, stealth, and weapon skills. Among the weapons she has used were a .50 caliber Barrett M82, SPAS-12 shotgun disguised as an umbrella (reinforced with Kevlar), machine gun, and semi-automatic grenade launcher hidden in a suitcase, Trench knife, and twin IMBEL Model 1911 pistols (see Colt M1911 pistols). Her strength, speed, endurance, and instincts were honed to almost superhuman levels, so much so that Rock at one point refers to her sardonically as \\"a killer robot from the future\\" (a reference to James Cameron's Terminator movies). At one point in the manga she was also described as the only person worthy of inheriting the title \\"Jackal\\" from Carlos. While Roberta is one of the most powerful warrior-women in Black Lagoon, she is also highly conscientious. She is unwaveringly devoted to her master and his son, Garcia, whom she loves deeply. Roberta and Revy fight each other, but only to beat themselves up. Rock interferes, but Roberta and Revy tell him to stay out of it. In the manga and anime, the fight ends in a draw right after they punch each other out simultaneously (though Garcia claims she won because she remained conscious). Her kindness can easily change as seen in a humorous omake in Volume 1 of the manga when Garcia slapped her butt in a playful manner, which prompted her to pinch his arm and lift him up off the ground by the skin of his arm as punishment. She admitted that she did murder children, women, or anyone in name of revolution during her FARC years. Disillusioned by the fact that she was merely a tool for the drug cartels in cahoots with FARC, she opted out and joined the Lovelace clan as a maid through her father who was a good friend of Diego Lovelace. Despite being asked by Garcia not to pick up gunfighting anymore, later events in the manga, which depicts her watching helplessly as a bomb was set killing many including Diego Lovelace. Garcia's question of why his father was a victim makes her go into battle again, seeking revenge. Roberta's anger almost pushed her to the limit; she is shown taking mouthfuls of anti-psychotics, and experiencing haunting hallucinations in the form of her past victim (Japanese engineer). She once again stalks the city of Roanapur in search of the one responsible for assassinating her master. Unfortunately, it turns out to be the US Special Forces. Roberta's quest for vengeance has put many of the residents including Hotel Moscow, the Triad, and the Colombian Cartel on high alert as it could mean the end for all of them if their new enemy is the United States. Most of the residents blame the Lagoon Company for attracting her back to Roanapur despite the fact the group was in the dark about the situation and brushed it off as if it were an Elvis sighting. Further into her quest, she begins to lose sight of her goal, almost returning to her former persona to the point she begins to lose her sanity and has trouble identifying friend and foe, thus almost harming Garcia in the process. The FARC commander even comments that she is no longer the hound they once knew, but a diseased stray wolf searching for purpose. Her oath as the \\"Bloodhound of Florencia\\" is \\"In the name of Santa Maria, a hammer blow of righteousness to all injustice.\\" In Chapter 73, Roberta is seen with an American woman, presumably Eda, passing through airport security to continue her pursuit of the Americans. She finally catches up with Grey Fox and kills 8-9 soldiers (there were 18 soldiers in three groups: Alpha, Bravo and Charlie), but Caxton himself is shot by Garcia in the hope she will give up her thirst for revenge. A still hallucinating Roberta then reflexively shoots Garcia when he turns his gun on her, but her horror at her attack at last restores her sanity. Garcia's gun is in fact loaded only with blanks, and Caxton survives; Garcia himself suffers only minor injuries. In the extra missing pages of chapter 76, she and Garcia kissed and they made up with each other and returns to the Lovelace home. However, in the fifth episode of the OVA, Roberta is severely injured and is confined to a wheelchair as she later regains the ability to walk slowly (she has lost her left arm, her right eye, has a prosthetic foot and ankle, implying her lower right leg has been amputated as well). In issue #50 of Anime Insider magazine, director Sunao Katabuchi comments that the animation staff referred Roberta as an \\"Evil Mary Poppins\\". He goes on to add that creator Rei Hiroe long thought of Roberta as a kind of \\"Death Poppins\\".  Fabiola Iglesias  is a young maid in the employ of the Lovelace family. She is one of the maids who work as Roberta's subordinates, and the only other combat-trained person among the maids apart from Roberta herself. In combat, she prefers to use two MAG-7s that were given to her by Roberta. She also carries a pump action China Lake NATIC (Mistakenly referred to as an EX 41 grenade launcher in the Manga). She also has heel blades concealed in her shoes. She is the same age with Garcia. Fabiola first appears in the same bar, The Yellow Flag, that Roberta met the Lagoon crew in, panicking everybody with her resemblance to Roberta. However, unlike Roberta, her suitcase is revealed to be filled with lollipops and a lunchbox with Scooby Doo and Ranger Smith on it. She is currently helping Garcia search for Roberta. She is something of a comic relief when compared with Roberta (whom she calls \\"head housemaid\\" with the utmost respect), as she is little, carries her grenade launcher concealed in her outfit, and is often prominent in humorous situations; such as her height, being picked up like a bratty little kid, to being made fun of her breast size. Dutch describes her as a \\"short version of the Killer Maid\\", after she destroys Bao's bar. She states that she comes from the poorest slums of Caracas, where she lived with her ten siblings until she was employed by the Lovelace Family. As noticed by Rock, she does not brawl, being a proficient practitioner of capoeira. According to her, she and Roberta are the only two maids in the Lovelace house who are proficient in firearms, with Roberta being the better of the two. She also mentions that there are three other maids in the Lovelace house: Karina, Masica and Davia (though it's unknown at this time if they're combat proficient as well). This makes Revy question her \\"Just what is the Lovelace plantation like? Full of bad-ass motherfuckers who could storm the Iranian embassy by themselves?\\". Fabiola was disgusted at Revy for being heartless and merciless against her foes, with Revy lecturing her that love and friendship do not apply in Roanapur. She and Garcia are reunited with Roberta; but the happiness is short lived when she and Roberta witness Garcia shooting Caxton with a 1911 Colt .45 filled with blanks and in retaliation Roberta shoots Garcia. She and Roberta then tend to a wounded Garcia. On their way back, they encountered Rock and Fabiola gets upset and disgusted with him and shot him with a blank round which injured Rock's ribs for \\"gambling with people's lives\\". She told Rock they will not meet again and that he shall \\"continue to dance with the walking dead in Roanapur.\\" Just like Roberta, Fabiola is very protective of Garcia. She is more brash than her mentor, but not as much as Revy. She tries to attack Chang after seeing him with Garcia, but he easily disarms her without trying. She loves to play in the pool when she's relaxing, but is embarrassed to ask Garcia for a break, despite the fact he is aware of her activities.  Other characters  The following are the other characters of this anime:  Kageyama  is one of the department chiefs of Asahi Industries, based in Tokyo. He was entrusted by its board of directors to ensure that their illegal activities were not exposed. Kageyama betrayed Rock by appointing Captain to kill him and the Lagoon Company, thus encouraging Rock to stay on with the Lagoon Company. Although Kageyama is married and has three children (consisting of one teenage son, one teenage daughter, and one pre-teen daughter), he seems to place more emphasis on his job than on his family.  H√§nsel and Gretel  H√§nsel Gretel H√§nsel and Gretel (also known as Fratele Meu (Romanian for \\"my brother\\") and Sora Mea (\\"my sister\\")) are two Romanian twin orphans. They were abandoned in a state-run orphanage as their parents' could not afford to look after them, following the overthrow of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, before being sold to black market. As a result of being repeatedly forced to participate in paedophilic snuff films in which they are either raped or forced to murder other children, and being repeatedly forced to watch the orphanage workers beat children to death, the twins eventually became deranged, sadistic killers. The horrid engrossment with their torturing and murdering for pleasure is shown during the first part of Season 2 when the twins first arrive to Roanupor and purposely wound one of Balalaika's men during a gunfight, bring him back to their temporary stay with Verrocchio's headquarters, probe his body with sharp objects as a medical experiment, and then drain his body of blood and organs for them to bathe in; afterwards they kill Verrocchio and his men out of indulgence, even though they were supposed to help them escape the city. Unknown to most people, \\"H√§nsel\\" and \\"Gretel\\" are actually two personalities alternately adopted by the two children, both of whom suffer from dissociative identity disorder, meaning they swap being \\"H√§nsel\\" and \\"Gretel\\" with each other from time to time (it is likely that these were their screen names in the films). There are slight implications that they could be incestuous, possibly due to the abuse they suffered in the state-run orphanage. It is never made clear of what gender the twins are: in one scene, \\"Gretel\\" (formerly \\"H√§nsel\\" before swapping) shows 'her' genitalia to Rock in what she presumably came to believe was a show of gratitude, causing him to flee in disgust and horror at how utterly broken ‚ÄúGretel‚Äù was, having known nothing but 'blood and darkness' their whole lives. In combat, \\"H√§nsel\\" wields a sharp battle axe while \\"Gretel\\" uses a M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle that appears to be taller than 'she' is. Both also carry additional sidearms. While they were mentally deranged, H√§nsel and Gretel were also cunning, having used two other children as decoys to distract the bounty hunters and using money to distract Eda. They were also not above using their innocent appearance to deceive their enemies. As revenge for killing Balalaika's men, H√§nsel is lured into a hunt across the city for Hotel Moscow's forces, until he locates Balalaika herself at a fountain, where he is abruptly shot dead by her snipers. Gretel manages to escape and eventually boards the Black Lagoon of her own volition. Due to Rock's kindness she takes a genuine liking to him. However, just as Gretel disembarks she is gunned down by the getaway man Dutch contacted, who was bribed by Hotel Moscow. Though initially shocked by her sudden death, Rock is glad that now she and her brother could rest in peace. The characters' names are taken from the German fairy tale, H√§nsel and Gretel. Many of the series' characters compare them to a similar pair of disturbed, sadistic twins from the American film The Shining. In the manga, the song sung by Gretel to Rock on the Black Lagoon is called \\"Midnight, the Stars and You\\", the song used in the ending credits to The Shining. In the anime, she sings \\"The World of Midnight\\", made for the anime and sung by Minako Obata.  Greenback Jane  , also known as , is a professional money counterfeiter and hacker from India. She served as the leader for her project team, which was spread around the world but was connected thanks to the internet, and is quite knowledgeable on the details of the dollar bill. Coincidentally, she falls in love with Benny after he displays his hacking skills. Janet currently seems to be having an internet romance with Benny. One of the running gags of her story arc is her clumsiness and poor luck, which usually result in her being subject to a pantyshot. After the Lovelace incident, Janet returns to Roanapur searching out Benny and the team. She, with help of her counterfeiting group, hacks a server of the \\"Rainbach AG\\" Corporation and makes a scapegoat of a PLA spy. Jane is apparently a nymphomaniac, though Benny calls it \\"a bit broad-minded as far as sex goes\\".

He is quite distinguishable, since he dresses like a cowboy: he has the trademark hat, boots with spurs, a revolver at the hip, bandolier belt, tan shirt and jeans. He is not taken serious by the other bounty hunters because he is an outsider. Even Shenhua says, \\"Cowboy, this no Florida\\", meaning that he is in over his head. However, his skills are shown to be more than everyone thought, when he is the last bounty hunter left in the hunt for Jane and he duels Eda on board the Lagoon. It is then later revealed that he and Eda have met previously in the United States, but Eda says they have never met. Shortly before killing him, she confesses to him to be from the CIA.  Vasili Laptev  is the boss of a branch of the Russian mafia that is based in Tokyo. A former KGB officer, Laptev had many difficulties operating in Japan due to his status as a gaijin (foreigner). Considered distasteful and incompetent by Balalaika, he appeared to lose his standing with his peers back in Russia and this was reflected in his arrogant personality, since he did not speak Japanese despite being based in Japan. Laptev's detachment is slaughtered single-handedly by Ginji when the fallout between Hotel Moscow and the Washimine-gumi begins.  Masami Kousa  Head of the Kousa Council. In past both Washimine and Kousa Yakuza's were allies as Yukio's father and Masami's \\"brother\\" were blood brothers. When they both died and Masami took over, any relationship the two groups had were gone and the Kousa's mistreated the Washime group badly to the point that Masami wouldn't recognize Yukio as the heir to the Washimine group and wanted someone in his group to take over. His mistreatment led the Washime group to call Hotel Moscow to weaken them. In the end of Fujiyama Gangsters arc, Masami was about to form an alliance with Hotel Moscow when Balalaika, after talking with Rock, decided to kill him and his lieutenants cited she wouldn't want to work with a group with such poor merchandise.  Maki  Maki is a female high school junior and goes to the same high school as her friend, Yukio Washimine. Maki seems to be a symbolic representative of the typical Japanese high school girl who is interested in skin-care, has a part-time job, reads light novels, and has poor school grades.

The buildings are representative of many eras, from a pre-Texas revolution cabin to an 1891 church built by German and Swiss immigrants, including the Kellum-Noble House, Houston's oldest brick dwelling, which was built by Nathaniel Kellum in 1847. Guided tours of the restored buildings are available from the Heritage Society. A Virginian who came to Houston in 1839, Kellum operated a brick kiln, a tannery and saw mill on the property. During the 1850s, Mrs. Zerviah M. Noble conducted one of Houston's first private schools in this house. Kellum-Noble is the only house in the Park on its original site. During the late 1930s and early 1940s, the Kellum-Noble House served as a public office for the City of Houston's Park Department. It is listed as a Historic American Building by the U.S. Library of Congress. The Nichols-Rice-Cherry House (which was moved from San Jacinto Street) is also located in Sam Houston Park. It is an example of Greek Revival architecture and was built about 1850 by Ebeneezer B. Nichols from New York. Between 1856 and 1873 it was owned by financier William Marsh Rice, whose estate helped create Rice Institute (now Rice University) in 1912. Other historic buildings now located in Sam Houston Park include: *The Old Place - a rustic cabin built of rough-sawn cedar planks about 1823. *Fourth Ward Cottage - moved from Freedman‚Äôs Town to the Park in 2002, it may predate 1858. *Pillot House - built in 1868, and owned by the same family until 1964, it is believed to be the first house in Houston built with an attached kitchen.

With 4,000 men killed, including the Saxon elector and two of Henry's sons, it was one of the bloodiest battles on Lower Saxon territory. Margrave Albert was defeated. Prelude Albert of Brandenburg- Kulmbach had sparked the Second Margrave War against the Franconian Prince- bishoprics in 1552, cutting a path of destruction with his plundering mercenary army on its way to Northern Germany. Arriving in the Duchy of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, he campaigned against Henry V of Wolfenb√ºttel, who gained support from Elector Maurice as well as from his L√ºneburg cousins. The Saxon elector had just signed the Peace of Passau with Emperor Charles V as a leader of insurgent Protestant princes, and the turmoil caused by his former ally turned up at the wrong time. The two sides first encountered on the Leine river near Sarstedt, though no action was taken. Margrave Albert headed for the city of Brunswick, when the enemy forces blocked his passage on the Fuhse creek near Sievershausen. Battle The battlefield today The battle took place in an open field (Feldmark) between the villages of Sievershausen and Arpke. The Saxon-Brunswick troops attacked with about 15,500 men (8,000 infantry and 7,500 cavalry), the margrave had 18,000 mercenaries (12,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry) at his command. Initially Albert managed to repel the attacking forces, however, the Saxon army turned around and positioned itself behind the defending forces. After four hours of bitter fighting, the margrave fled from the battlefield. His retreat was covered by General Joachim von R√∂bel, who became famous as a result and ended his days as a field- marshal. Among the many casualties were Saxon and Brunswick nobles and knights, including the two elder sons of Duke Henry V, Philip Magnus and Charles Victor, resulting in the succession of the throne of their younger brother Julius. Elector Maurice allegedly was killed by friendly fire, when a shot by one of his own men struck the abdomen and caused major injuries he two days later succumbed to. His mortal remains were transferred to Saxony; his armor kept in Freiberg Cathedral shows the bullet hole at waist level. Many rumours were circulating in connection with his death; he most likely died due to wound infection. Aftermath With Albert's defeat, public peace was secured and could be perpetuated in the Augsburg Settlement two years later. On the 300th anniversary of the battle in 1853, a memorial stone was erected to commemorate the death of Elector Maurice. Since 1967, the local parish church has been a meeting place of several German peace movement groups. An anti-war museum in Sievershausen opened in 1979.

It was a division of the South African government-owned defence conglomerate Armaments Corporation of South Africa (commonly known as Armscor). It was founded during 1965 to locally produce aircraft for the South African Air Force (SAAF); the company's creation was motivated by growing international pressure on South Africa, due to the government's racially discriminatory policies known as Apartheid, which led to an international arms embargo being enacted under United Nations Security Council Resolution 418. Finding it near-impossible to import military equipment, including aircraft, Atlas locally manufactured various aircraft and associated components for the nation. It license-produced various foreign- sourced designs, such as the Impala (an Italian ground attack fighter), the Oryx (a derivative of the French A√©rospatiale SA 330 Puma medium helicopter), and the Cheetah (an extensively modified model of the French Dassault Mirage III fighter). History The Atlas Aircraft Corporation was established during 1965 for the principal purpose of locally manufacturing military aircraft, along with the associated avionics and support equipment, on behalf of the South African Air Force. Furthermore, there was also a strong desire to produce these same products for the global export market. The company's creation was significantly connected to the political climate of the nation of South Africa; since 1963, the country had been subject to an international arms embargo enacted under United Nations Security Council Resolution 418 over the racially discriminatory policies known as Apartheid. Atlas considerably benefited from the political will to circumvent or otherwise minimise the impact of this embargo by turning to domestic industry to meet its military requirements wherever possible. Atlas was reorganised during 1968 shortly after the establishment of Armaments Corporation of South Africa (commonly known as Armscor), a South African government-owned defence conglomerate, being brought under Armscor's control. An Atlas Impala Mk. II of the South African Air Force During 1964, South Africa had obtained a license to produce the Aermacchi MB-326, an Italian ground attack fighter; designated locally as the Impala, production of the Mk I variant commenced in 1966.Potgieter, Herman and Willem Steenkamp. Aircraft of the South African Air Force. London: Jane's, 1981, First edition 1980. . Around 125 Impala Mk Is were locally produced for the South African Air Force (SAAF), substantially outnumbering the initial batch of 40 imported directly from Italy.The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft, Issue 1, 1981, p. 20. The Impala was suitably equipped for use as both a trainer aircraft and as an armed ground attack platform. Seven examples of the MB-326K variant were also bought from Italy for the light attack role, while a further 15 were assembled by Atlas from kits.The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft, Issue 2, 1981, p. 34. Furthermore, around 78 aircraft of this variant were locally produced, being designated by the SAAF as Impala Mk II.Jannetti 1987, Production of this improved single seat version started during 1974. The SAAF was a prolific used of the A√©rospatiale SA 330 Puma, a French medium-lift helicopter. South Africa had timed most of its Puma purchases, including spare parts, to be completed in advance of another arms embargo that was enacted during 1977.\\"South Africa Ready to Handle Global Sqeeze.\\" Toledo Blade, 1 November 1977 The type proving popular with the service, the SAAF's Puma fleet received numerous locally-developed upgrades. The most extensive of these was the Atlas Oryx, an extensively modified derivative. It was developed with assistance from Portugal, who helped supply components via secretive transactions in contravention of the embargo.Vegar, Jose. \\"Stiffed Arms Merchant Sues\\". Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, November 1997, 53(6). pp. 12‚Äì13. While the Oryx had been largely developed to fulfil local demands; the company frequently promoted the type to potential export customers. An Atlas Cheetah in flight The 1980s was a busy decade for Atlas as South Africa engaged in a protracted conflict now known as the South African Border War. The SAAF found it needed more capable fighter and strike aircraft to attain an edge over ever-more sophisticated Soviet- built aircraft, such as the MiG-23, that were being supplied to both Angolan and Cuban forces.Beckhusen, Robert. \\"The Cheetah Was South Africa‚Äôs ‚ÄòGood Enough‚Äô Fighter.\\" warisboring.com, 14 December 2017. Furthermore, the increasing cost of maintenance due to international sanctions and the increasing age of existing aircraft in the SAAF's inventory also needed to be addressed. Due to the arms embargo, the upgrading of existing aircraft became the only realistic option available; thus the Atlas Cheetah programme was launched. Under this programme, the SAAF's fleet of French-built Dassault Mirage IIIs were extensively upgraded. Reportedly, the Cheetah could carry three times as much ordinance (in terms of weight) as the Mirage III while possessing superior agility as well, the latter partly achieved via the addition of non-moving canards just aft of the engine intakes. South Africa also embarked on a ambitious development programme intended to produce an modern fighter aircraft to meet its long term requirement under the codename of Project Carver. It was organised as a joint effort between the SAAF, Atlas, and the National Research Laboratory.South Africa plans new twin-engined Fighter\\". Flight International. 6 May 1989, p. 2. By 1986, Atlas had selected a design for a lightweight single-engined aircraft, featuring a single vertical stabiliser and a mid-mounted delta wing furnished with leading-edge root extensions (LERX) set above the engine's air intakes. It became necessary to design the aircraft around the preexisting Snecma Atar 09K50 engine; however, it became clear that, even with upgrades, if the aircraft was powered by a single Atar engine, the desired range and load-carrying capacities were unachievable. Thus, the design team changed to a twin-engine layout instead, this alteration reportedly disrupted the project for a time. During 1988, the SAAF, recognising that the project could no longer meet the original schedule, approved an interim programme, known as Project Tunny, to satisfy its immediate air defence needs via an improved version of the Cheetah, the Cheetah C. FIB base in Sake 2014 Amid the Border War, the South African Defence Force recognised the need for a dedicated attack helicopter. At the service's behest, Atlas commenced development of a suitable rotorcraft during early 1984. In concept, this attack helicopter was to escort friendly helicopter troop transports, conduct strike missions upon anti-aircraft positions, and effectively counter the increasing presence of Soviet-built tanks; in the latter role, it was to be equipped with anti-tank missiles. Due to the ongoing arms embargo of South Africa, foreign combat helicopters could not realistically be imported, thus pursuing local development of such a rotorcraft became the most viable option. Designing and manufacturing a clean- design helicopter posed significant challenges, which would have unavoidably led to very high cost and a lengthy timescale being involved in the project; thus it was decided to base the attack helicopter upon an existing design. At the time, the SAAF operated two principal helicopter types ‚Äì the A√©rospatiale Alouette III and the A√©rospatiale SA 330 Puma. The Puma was substantially larger than the Alouette III and was equipped with more powerful engines, enabling additional equipment to be carried and greater growth prospects. The helicopter, later named the Rooivalk, was envisioned as an agile, highly sophisticated gunship, especially suited to the threats of the Angolan theatre and ably countering vehicles such as the T-55 tank. The prototype first flew on the 11 February 1990, by which time the Border War had already ended. During 1992, Atlas was absorbed into a new entity, the state-owned aerospace and military technology conglomerate Denel; the company formed a major portion of Denel Aviation. Various programmes that were underway at Atlas at the time of its absorption have been carried on by Denel, such as the Rooivalk. Aircraft Production aircraft Atlas built and maintained a variety of aircraft: * Impala Mk.I (the Aermacchi MB-326 two-seat military jet trainer aircraft designed in Italy and the Impala Mk.II, a single seat light-attack version.) * Atlas Cheetah (a fighter aircraft built as an upgrade of the Dassault Mirage III.) * Oryx (an upgraded version of the A√©rospatiale Puma helicopter.) * Bosbok (Italian designed light observation aircraft.) * Kudu (South African designed light utility aircraft based on the Bosbok.) * Rooivalk - The Rooivalk project began under the auspices of the Atlas Aircraft Corporation and went into production only after the company changed its name to Denel Aviation Atlas also assisted the South African Air Force to maintain its fleet of planes that had been purchased (mostly) prior to the onset of sanctions in the 1970s.

It was released on July 27, 2007 for Windows PCs and is rated for all ages. Little Busters! is Key's sixth game, along with other titles such as Kanon, Air, and Clannad. An adult version of the game titled Little Busters! Ecstasy was released on July 25, 2008 for Windows, unlike Kanon and Air, which were first released with adult content and then had later versions with such content removed. Ecstasy was later ported to the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 3, and Nintendo Switch with the adult content removed under the title Little Busters! Converted Edition. An English version for Windows was released on Steam in 2017. The story follows a group of childhood friends (Riki Naoe, Rin Natsume, Kyousuke Natsume, Masato Inohara and Kengo Miyazawa) now attending high school called the Little Busters, as they decide to form a baseball team. Riki, who is diagnosed with narcolepsy, is tasked to recruit more girls in preparation for a baseball game, and he bonds with each of them on account of their internal conflicts. Meanwhile, Rin gets mysterious letters from her cat Lennon to complete various tasks in order to learn the \\"secret to this world\\". The gameplay in Little Busters! follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the six female main characters by the player character, which increases to nine in Ecstasy. There are additional minigames added into the gameplay, such as battle sequences that resemble fighting games or baseball batting practice, which serve to give the characters experience, obtain accessories to use during battle, and improve their statistics. Both Little Busters! and Ecstasy ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of their release, and Ecstasy would go on to sell over 100,000 units. Key went on to produce an adult spin-off called Kud Wafter in June 2010, which expanded on the scenario of Kudryavka Noumi, one of the heroines from Little Busters! and Ecstasy. There have been 14 manga adaptations based on Little Busters! and Ecstasy published by ASCII Media Works, Kadokawa Shoten and Ichijinsha. Comic anthologies, light novels and art books were also published, as were several music albums. There have been two Internet radio shows hosted by the voice actors of Rin and Kyousuke Natsume and Kudryavka Noumi. J.C.Staff produced two anime television series and an original video animation series between 2012 and 2014. Gameplay Little Busters! is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Riki Naoe. Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. The text in the game is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Riki is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. When the game is completed at least once, a gallery of the viewed CGs and played background music becomes available on the game's title screen. Little Busters! follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are seven main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. When first playing the game, the scenarios for all six heroines are available. Once a scenario for any one heroine is completed, that scenario will be unavailable in the next play through because the last choice that will ultimately lead to that heroine's scenario becomes unavailable for players to choose. After the completion of these six routes, the final scenario called Refrain is made available, which serves to bring everything to a definite conclusion and answers questions brought up throughout the normal gameplay. Completing Refrain makes available all the heroine's scenarios that were previously made inaccessible during gameplay so that the player can revisit the scenarios again, along with some extra decision points that were previously unavailable.An example of the fighting mode in Little Busters! featuring Rin fighting Masato. Throughout gameplay, the player encounters various minigames, which range from simple to more complex. The first type of minigame encountered is a battle sequence that resembles a fighting game, but no interaction from the player is required to fight. These recurring battle sequences represent when the members of the Little Busters get into physical fights with either each other or with others. Each member of the fight has a set of statistics attributed to them (which includes strength, stamina, agility, reflex, concentration, judgment, and luck) along with a life bar to keep track of how many hit points a fighter has left. The maximum number of hit points is determined by the given fighter's stamina rating. Weapons may be used along with any accessories the fighter has in their possession, and these items may be exchanged with other characters. Another recurring minigame involves the player being able to play baseball batting practice with members of the Little Busters. The player, as Riki, controls his position and when to swing the bat. The Little Busters will also participate in missions to accomplish some goal, and a mission will either be completed or failed depending on the choices of the player. These missions are connected with the battle sequences and batting practice in that they serve to give the characters experience, obtain accessories to use during fights, and improve their statistics. However, these missions do not affect the main plot in any way‚Äîthe player even has the choice to turn off most of the minigames so that the player may focus on the main plot, including the battle sequences and batting practice. The first time that the game is played, Rin's statistics are weak compared to other characters. However, when the player completes several heroine's routes, Rin's and Riki's statistics will start out higher than before when the player starts a new game, allowing Rin and Riki to stand a better chance against opponents with higher statistics. The statistics of the Little Busters members are shown in a ranking system from highest to lowest in overall statistics. Despite Little Busters! having a rating for all ages, there is an ample amount of CG artwork featuring the female characters in risqu√© situations, though never to the point to be considered sexual in nature. This is in stark contrast to Key's previous titles Clannad and Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet that also have ratings for all ages, but those titles contain no such risqu√© situations or even any fan service. In Little Busters! Ecstasy, adult elements were added to the gameplay in the form of sexual CGs depicting Riki and a given heroine having sex. Ecstasy extends the story for the scenarios of the heroines in Little Busters!, as well as increasing the number of heroine routes from six to nine. These three heroine routes include scenarios for Kanata Futaki and Sasami Sasasegawa‚Äîtwo supporting characters from Little Busters!‚Äîand a new heroine named Saya Tokido who is only featured in Ecstasy. The first time the game is played, these three heroine routes are unavailable to the player until after the Refrain scenario is completed, though the player is given the option to make them immediately available. Ecstasy has several minor additions and changes to the minigames as well, including the addition of weapons available for use in the battle sequences. Also, Ecstasy features the addition of two recurring minigames related to Saya: a shooting game with pistols and navigating a labyrinth. Plot Setting and themes The main part of the story takes place at a high school in Japan. There is a \\"secret of this world\\" that Kyousuke speaks of; Kengo and Masato are also aware of this.Untranslated quote: „Åì„ÅÆ‰∏ñÁïå„Å´„ÅØÁßòÂØÜ„Åå„ÅÇ„Çã Translated quote: \\"This world has a secret.\\" The characters live in either the male or female dormitories on the school grounds which are across from each other. Beside the dorms is the main school building where classes take place, which also houses the cafeteria on the ground floor. The school is four stories and the roof is normally restricted from access. Beyond the main school building is the large schoolyard, with the pool area adjacent to the yard. On the other side of the field is the baseball field, with the gymnasium and tennis court beyond it, which are closer to the main school building. Childhood and adolescence are two important themes in Little Busters!. The opening video of the visual novel starts with two lines written in English: \\"What 'Adolescence' do you have?\\" and \\"Do you remember 'Childhood'?\\". Riki Naoe, the male protagonist, has four childhood friends with whom he grew up together through adolescence and still hangs out with when the story begins. Thus, friendship is another theme presented in the form of Riki's relationships with his friends in high school, and is thought to be irreplaceable. The opening video of the original visual novel contains a third line written in English, \\"The irreplaceable one existed there,\\" though another line was added into the opening video of Little Busters! Ecstasy: \\"This will remind you that you have to recollect 'Adolescence'.\\" Main characters The player assumes the role of Riki Naoe, the protagonist of Little Busters!. He is seen as weak due to his girlish appearance and physical build but is very straightforward and has more common sense than most of his friends. He is a member of a group of friends called the Little Busters, which originally consisted of four members, but expanded to five with Riki during his childhood. The leader of the Little Busters is Kyousuke Natsume, who is the eldest member. He often comes up with absurd ideas, but almost always follows up with a reasonable explanation along with it. Kyousuke's younger sister is Rin Natsume, the main heroine of Little Busters!, and is initially the only female member of the Little Busters. She does not communicate well with others due to her poor social skills and can be seen as inarticulate. Due to this, she is shy, and is usually seen alone. Rin loves cats and at school takes care of several strays. Riki's roommate and fellow member of the Little Busters is Masato Inohara who loves to work out and improve his muscle mass. He has a particular fondness for Riki, which he is more than willing to express out aloud. Masato's rival and fellow member of the Little Busters is Kengo Miyazawa who is skilled in the art of kendo and seemingly has a cynical personality, but his passion for the Little Busters is unmatched by any of the other members. In Little Busters!, Riki meets five other girls attending his high school who later become members of the Little Busters, in addition to three more girls in Ecstasy; all eight are heroines in the game. The first is Komari Kamikita, a childish girl who takes great interest in fairy-tales, picture books, candy, and clothing with many layers of frills. She is very clumsy, though athletic, and will often not think before she acts. Haruka Saigusa is a schoolmate of Riki's from a different class, but always finds time to hang around in Riki's classroom. She incites uproars for her own personal enjoyment, which causes her twin sister, the public morals chairman Kanata Futaki, to chase after her. Kanata generally acts cold towards her sister, though gets annoyed when Riki gets close to Haruka. Kudryavka Noumi, known as for short, is a girl who is one quarter Japanese, and three-quarters Russian. Despite having a poor handle on the English language, she was able to skip a year in school due to credits obtained through studying abroad, making her the youngest member of the Little Busters. Kudryavka appears in Key's eighth game, Kud Wafter, as the main heroine. Yuiko Kurugaya is Riki's classmate who has a self-sufficient personality, and is sometimes seen carrying a replica of a katana called Muramasa. She is seen as an older sister to everyone despite being the same age of almost the entire cast, and is fond of things or people she considers to be cute.Untranslated quote: ÂèØÊÑõ„ÅÑ„ÇÇ„ÅÆ„ÅØÂ•Ω„Åç„Å†„Çà„ÄÅÁßÅ„ÅØ Translated quote: \\"I like cute things.\\" Mio Nishizono is a calm girl who is very diligent. Due to having weak health, she is always seen with a parasol when outside. She enjoys reading, especially when the story contains boys love elements, and her room is filled with books. Sasami Sasasegawa is the captain of the girls' softball team and is Rin's rival; while Rin loves cats, Sasami is a devoted dog lover. Saya Tokido, who only appeared in Ecstasy, is a popular girl at Riki's school, though she is known to be ditzy. At night, she wanders around the school to protect a \\"treasure\\" from those she calls the , and even has to fight them for it. Story Average dialogue and narrative in Little Busters! depicting the main character Riki talking to Komari. Little Busters!' story revolves around the main protagonist Riki Naoe, a young male high school student. When Riki was a child, his parents died, leaving him hopeless and depressed. He was saved by a group‚Äîthree boys and a girl, all his age‚Äîwho referred to themselves as the Little Busters, a group dedicated to fighting evil and preserving justice. The leader of the group was Kyousuke Natsume who had a younger sister named Rin. The other two members were Masato Inohara and Kengo Miyazawa, who were friends despite being rivals. They took Riki out and played together with him during his time of need, making him the fifth Little Busters member. In time, Riki enjoyed playing with them, and his grief over his parents gradually faded away. When the story begins, Riki and his friends are seemingly in their second year of high school, except for Kyousuke who is in his third year. They still hang out together, and enjoy their school life. The story opens on Sunday May 13, 2007, and the next day at school, Kyousuke decides that the Little Busters are going to play a baseball game, except they do not have enough members to have a complete team. Kyousuke gives Riki and Rin the task of going around school to find more members to join, preferably girls so as not to leave Rin the lone girl. Riki finds five girls his age willing to help him out: Komari Kamikita, Haruka Saigusa, Kudryavka Noumi, Yuiko Kurugaya, and Mio Nishizono; three other girls Riki meets are Kanata Futaki, Sasami Sasasegawa, and Saya Tokido. Throughout the game, Riki hangs out with these girls and learns more about them. The story's main part takes place in what seems to be a normal high school, but in fact all took place in the school term previous to Little Busters!, and Riki and Rin are reliving it in an artificial world created by the other members of the Little Busters. They, and the other main characters, were involved in a bus accident during a field trip, and only the two of them will survive. Kyousuke and the others created the artificial world to make them strong enough to deal with what will happen when they awaken in the real world. This was caused by a ripple effect based on all of their desires to save Riki and Rin. The world loops, but though they forget what happens, Riki and Rin do grow stronger, and Kyousuke hopes that they will eventually be strong enough to leave the world. They do manage to survive and get away from the crash site before Riki collapses because he has narcolepsy. Riki vows to fight against his narcoleptic condition, which was the reason why he was only able to save Rin and merely get away from the explosion before collapsing. Rejecting this turn of events, Rin travels back into the artificial world again (this time created by Riki and Rin) and helps Riki overcome his weakness. Afterwards, the two of them go back to waking up at the crash site. This time, Riki and Rin work together to save everyone at the crash scene. Kyousuke, who sneaked onto the bus (as a third year he was not allowed to go), managed to block the leak hole on the gas tank to delay the explosion, despite his injuries being far greater than anyone else. Everyone in the bus recovers from their injuries, although Kyousuke's recovery takes longer due to extensive injuries. Finally, after Kyousuke returns, he rents a minibus, and the members of the Little Busters set out for a trip to the ocean. Development For the first time in Key's history, two artists were given the position of art director for the visual novel: Itaru Hinoue and Na-Ga. Hinoue has been Key's signature art director since Key's first game Kanon, and Na-Ga has been with Key since the production of Air working as one of the computer graphics artists to render background art used in Key's games. Due to having two art directors, character design was split between the two, though Na-Ga is responsible for the character design of the majority of the cast. Of the six heroines in the story, three were designed by each artist; Komari, Haruka, and Yuiko were designed by Hinoue while Rin, Kudryavka, and Mio were done by Na-Ga. For work on the scenario, Jun Maeda contributed along with composing some of the game's music. Further writers include Leo Kashida who had worked on Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life, and two new scenario writers to Key‚ÄîY≈´to Tonokawa, and Chika Shirokiri. Maeda wrote the scenarios for Rin and the entire male cast; Kashida wrote the scenario for Mio; Tonokawa wrote the scenarios for Komari and Yuiko; finally, Shirokiri wrote the scenarios for Haruka and Kudryavka. In an interview of Maeda and Tonokawa in the August 2007 issue of Push!!, it was reported that the story of Little Busters! is twice as long as Air's, but only half as long as Clannad's. However, this does not take into account the minigames in Little Busters! which serve to lengthen the game. The music in the game, not counting Maeda's, was composed by Key's signature composers Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi, in addition to Manack and members of PMMK. Togoshi left Key in October 2006 before the visual novel went on sale. Three or four months before the release of Little Busters!, it was decided that an adult version of the game would be developed titled , or Little Busters-EX for short. Na-Ga designed the heroine Saya Tokido and Maeda wrote her scenario. Tonokawa wrote Sasami Sasasegawa's scenario, and Shirokiri wrote Kanata Futaki's story. Lines from the original game were rewritten as well for Ecstasy, and the total number of lines with spoken dialogue comes to 43,347 lines. The total word count in Ecstasy exceeds that of Clannad by about 4,000 words, making it Key's longest work, and carries so much data that Ecstasy was released on two DVDs instead of one for the original release. Marketing An art exhibition of Little Busters! was held in Osaka, Japan between May 3 and May 4, 2007, and in Tokyo, Japan between May 24 and May 25, 2007. A large amount of the character and background art featured in the game was showcased, along with original art used to promote the character artwork, and other production sketches drawn when the game was still in development. Flowcharts outlining the story for the game were on display, along with the flowcharts for Clannad. Also at the exhibition was a life-size mannequin of Rin Natsume with a baseball glove in one hand, though instead of a baseball, a cat was in the glove. This mannequin was later put onto the Japanese Yahoo! Auction website in late September 2007 and sold for 764,000 yen, a far cry from the original wish of selling the figure for 5,000,000 yen. Little Busters! was the first Key title to receive coverage in an entire issue of Dengeki G's Festival!, a special edition version of Dengeki G's Magazine which is published in irregular intervals each year by ASCII Media Works; the issue in question was the ninth, published on June 30, 2007. Along with a full 80 pages of information on Little Busters!, the magazine came bundled with a double-sided hug pillowcase, a small cell phone cleaner which could also attach to a cell phone, and a B5 size jigsaw puzzle. ASCII Media Works published the third volume of another special edition version of Dengeki G's Magazine named Dengeki G's Festival! Deluxe on June 30, 2008 which had a focus on Little Busters! Ecstasy. Along with again containing about eighty pages of information pertaining to the visual novel, the magazine also comes bundled with an ergonomic mousepad, a jigsaw puzzle, and a deck of playing cards. The third volume of another magazine in the Festival! line, Dengeki G's Festival! Comic, was sold on July 26, 2008 with Rin and Dorj on the cover, and the magazine came bundled with a hug pillowcase, a notepad, and a B2 size poster. Release history On June 1, 2007, a free game demo of Little Busters! became available for download at Key's official website. In the demo, the player is introduced to the characters of the Little Busters group in the game through a short visual novel sequence. The demo does not give the player the chance to interact with the scene presented, making the demo a short kinetic novel. The game was released in Japan as a limited edition version on July 27, 2007 as a DVD playable on Windows PCs; the regular edition was released on September 28, 2007. The limited edition contained an arrange album of some of the music featured in the game, and a 128-page visual guide book titled . The book contained information and images on characters, background CGs, the art exhibition, images of the heroines published in various Japanese anime and gaming magazines, a question and answer section, information on the creators of the game, and lyrics of a couple of songs featured in the game. Little Busters! Ecstasy was released as a limited edition version on July 25, 2008 as two DVDs playable only on a Windows PC; the regular edition followed on September 26, 2008.

An updated version, 1.01, for the limited edition of Ecstasy was released by Key for free on their website on September 22, 2008; the regular edition of Ecstasy contains this update. An all ages version of Ecstasy for Windows was released by Key on July 31, 2009 in a box set containing five other Key visual novels called Key 10th Memorial Box. Prototype released a PlayStation 2 (PS2) port of Ecstasy titled Little Busters! Converted Edition on December 24, 2009, which removed the adult elements of the game. The PS2 version was available to try at Key 10th Memorial Fes, an event held in commemoration of Key's ten-year anniversary between February 28 and March 1, 2009. A PlayStation Portable (PSP) version of Little Busters! Converted Edition, also by Prototype, was released on November 25, 2010.

Along with also having full voice acting, the PS Vita version contains 1.4x larger CGs than the Windows edition, and the limited edition came bundled with a drama CD. Prototype released a PlayStation 3 (PS3) version of Converted Edition with the additional content included in the previous consumer ports on March 20, 2013. An added feature in the PS3 version is a 3D rendering of the minigame in Saya's route where the player must navigate a labyrinth. A downloadable version of the PS3 release via the PlayStation Store was released by Prototype on May 29, 2013. Key released an all ages version of Ecstasy titled on November 30, 2012 for Windows.

It is in use with the United States Army. Description The M1129 Mortar Carrier, also known as MCV-B (Mortar Carrier Vehicle version B), is based on the Stryker infantry carrier vehicle, which is itself a descendant of the Swiss Mowag Piranha III. The precursor of the M1129, the MCV-A, carried a mortar that could only be used dismounted, whereas the M1129B is only capable of firing its weapon from the mounted position within the vehicle. The M1129 is used in the US Army Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, where it is part of each Brigade's maneuver infantry battalion's and Reconnaissance, Surveillance & Target Acquisition (RSTA) squadron's Modified Table of Organization & Equipment (MTOE). The vehicles are either organically subordinated to battalion level or company level. The battalion level vehicles are armed with the RMS6L 120MM mortar system, which is the vehicle mounted version of the RMS6L 120MM mortar. Additionally, they carry the 81mm M252 mortar that can only be used in a dismounted capacity. The company level vehicles also carry a vehicle-mounted 120mm mortar, which is augmented by the 60mm M224 mortar for dismounted use. The RSTA squadron only receives the 120mm mounted mortar, there is no augmentation dismounted maneuvers. Each Stryker infantry battalion thus has a total number of 10 mortar carriers, all of which are equipped with the 120mm system. Each Stryker RSTA battalion has a total of 6 mortar carriers, all of which are also equipped with the 120mm system.\\"Pocket Artillery\\" by Ian Kemp, in Armada International, Apr 2006 The first M1129 vehicles were put into service in Spring 2005 with the 172nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team.

It got to the point they had to place me on the Lite Line because my twin brother worked up from me on the same line & the bosses were giving orders to the wrong man in their area.They had to put me on the MB utility work on the Lite Line. Mr. Hansen was the best CEO that I ever worked under. The reason I say this , he was a fair man to his employees & a kind gentleman to ALL HIS EMPLOYEES. He did a lot for all the people in the Lehigh Valley & Allentown Pa.I put 32 years at Mack Trucks, from 1969-1974 were the best years of my life , thanks to Mr. Hansen.

It is used within the brigade to provide means to receive information, analyze and transmit data, and control forces carrying out combat missions. General The CV provides an operational platform for elements of command within the Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT). The CV integrates the C4ISR equipment for the unit commanders. It has the ability to access aircraft power and antenna systems to plan missions while en route aboard aircraft. Operational capability Commanders must have the capability to see and direct the battle continuously, maintaining the Common Relevant Operating Picture (CROP) for all friendly forces within their respective areas of operation. This enhanced situational awareness and understanding will enable commanders to synchronize and employ widely dispersed and highly mobile forces at decisive points of the operation. Initial fielding of the CV will be three platforms to the brigade headquarters, two platforms to the infantry maneuver battalion HQ, and two per infantry maneuver company within each battalion. The CV is based on the Stryker Infantry carrier vehicle (ICV) platform due to the close parallels of operational requirements and battlefield capabilities between the two systems. The commonality of the platform reduces the maintenance footprint and variety of logistics support. The CV is an organic vehicle to the ICV maneuver formation.

Built between 1968 and 1986, Green Run was the first Planned Unit Development (PUD) built in the South Hampton Roads region and contains 36 neighborhoods, including 4200 single- family homes, townhouses, three condominium projects, and three apartment communities with roughly 900 apartments. According to 2005 census figures, over 15,000 residents live within Green Run. Community leadership Green Run Homes Association is run by a nine-member governing Board which serves as its legislative body. Board members are elected to staggered three-year terms, and three of the nine Board members are elected each year. The President shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors; shall see that orders and resolutions of the Board are carried out; shall sign all leases, mortgages, deeds and other written instruments and shall cosign all promissory notes. Day-to-day operations of the Association are carried out by the Community Manager who is appointed by the governing Board and acts as Chief Operating Officer. The Community Manager supervises the Association's 20 employees and serves as a principal contact for residents. In the past, the President of the governing Board took the position of Chief Executive Officer as well as Board President. This conflict of interest raised concerns among the membership. This member no longer serves on the Board or works at the association. Facilities and amenities The Association maintains a community center, four recreation centers with swimming pools and tennis courts, 14 parks and playgrounds, an athletic complex, and roughly of common area or \\"green belt\\" including of canals with of shoreline. Programs and events Green Run has a wide array of programs and events for residents of all ages. These include quarterly seniors dinners, youth sports programs, annual Easter Egg Hunt, pool parties. In 2006, the association partnered with now State Delegate Sal Iaquinto and former Attorney General, now Governor, Bob McDonnell to create \\"Safe Kids Day\\", an annual event that promotes child safety for residents. A Teen Council was started in 2006 to enable youths to participates in community volunteer activities, and Green Run has the largest Neighborhood Watch program in Virginia Beach. The annual Fall Cook-Out, begun in 2005, has quickly become a popular tradition and has an annual attendance of nearly 800 residents. The annual event give residents an opportunity to eat, listen to great local music, and connect with neighbors from across the community. Residents are also able to network with Association leaders and staff along with city, state, and federal officials. Attendees often include the Mayor, members of City Council, Fire Chief, Chief of Police, representatives from city departments, state officials, and former Congresswoman Thelma Drake. To encourage civic involvement, Green Run's Association hold periodic town hall meetings with city and state officials on topics of interest to residents, and has begun sponsoring a voter registration initiative. Volunteers Green Run's governing board no longer regularly meets with residents. In January 2011 a 48% increase in assessments led to resident unrest, and after the membership voiced their objections all scheduled monthly homeowners forums were cancelled. In 2007, volunteers planted over 50 trees throughout the community on Arbor Day. Green Run has adopted several streets and parks within the community through the city's \\"adopt-a-street\\" and \\"adopt-a-spot\\" programs. Volunteers clean these areas at least one every month, rather than once-every- six-months as required by the program. Green Run also serves as \\"Partners in Education\\" with three local elementary schools and regularly sends volunteers to assist these schools. Media coverage Green Run has received a very positive attention to its many programs, both from residents and the press. During 2006, WTKR-TV 3 ran a series of stories on Green Run, and during 2007, the Virginian-Pilot‚Äôs \\"At Home Section\\" ran a very positive profile on the neighborhood, although there is an average of at least 6 homicides or suicides annually, as well as dozens of attempts, along with hundreds of robberies, beatings, drug-trades, and other illegal activities.

FBCB2 is required for situation awareness and maneuver force communications in distributed operations and on the non-linear battlespace. A vehicular intercom system (VIS) that enables communication on each of the four combat radio nets from each crew positions is required in the MAV-FSV. The VIS permits each of the operating stations to selectively monitor the intercommunications system and any combination of four radio receivers, while selectively transmitting on any of the radio transmitters in addition to the intercommunications system. FS MAV must be capable of hosting the hand-held terminal unit and tactical radios for transmission of digital targeting and fire support data. Targeting data must be passed automatically to provide timely, error-free targeting information through digital means, to include spot reports providing updated situational awareness. Digital communications is required to all fire support assets to forward targeting data to the attack platforms without causing the platform operators to transcribe information and to allow for the automated processing of target, clearance, and firing data. The capability to communicate with all joint fire support assets allows the full utilization of the attack capabilities available.

His conquering a serious illness prompted him to consecrate his life to God and therefore entered the religious life though not as an ordained priest. Peis was better known in Sardinia for his humble demeanor coupled with his concern for those who were poor. He mingled with all people he met and was generous towards those who were ill. But he became known as a wonder worker and it was claimed that he had performed 121 miracles during his life. Peis' grave soon became a place in which miracles flourished and this was one dimension towards the opening of his cause for canonization. He was beatified on 16 June 1940 and was canonized later in 1951. His body in Cagliari is still incorrupt.The Marian Room Life Vincenzo Peis was born on 10 December 1701 in Sardinia as one of seven children to the poor peasants Mattia Peis Cadello and Anna Maria Sanna Casu. He was baptized as \\"Francesco Ignazio Vincenzo\\" since he was born out of a difficult pregnancy in which her mother invoked the intercession of Francis of Assisi. Peis worked on the fields to support his parents. He suffered a serious illness circa 1719 (aged seventeen) that made him vow that he would consecrate himself to God and join the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin if he managed to recover from it. He did so recover but put off the fulfilment of his vow after his father convinced him to wait; his father was anxious about it because he depended on Peis for support in the fields. But there seems to be some indication that his parents objected to his entering the order. In 1721 he was in danger once more when the horse he was riding panicked. He could have been thrown off but he called upon the assistance of Francis of Assisi and renewed the vow he had made during his illness. This time his parents did not raise objections to his becoming a friar and granted him their blessing. In his childhood he often called the local church his \\"home\\" and took Lawrence of Brindisi as his personal role model. He asked for admission at the convent in Cagliari but the superiors there hesitated because of his delicate health. He then called upon an influential friend who interceded for him and he was allowed to be received into the novitiate on 10 November 1721. Peis made his profession on 10 November 1722. Despite his infirmities his ardor allowed him to attend the spiritual exercises of the order and to excel in perfection of his observance of the order's Rule. From 1722 until 1737 he worked at the house's weaving shed and from 1737 onwards was an alms beggar. Peis spent his time in a number of different occupations and was later appointed as the quester of alms due to his humble and modest conduct. He had good relations with the people in Cagliari who realized that although he was begging alms he was also giving back to them in a spiritual manner. His modest demeanor was seen as a quiet sermon for all who saw him going about, which made him a noted figure. He seldom spoke; when required he spoke with exceptional kindness and great affection. He would also instruct the children and the uneducated that he came across, and went out to comfort the sick and urge sinners to be converted and to perform penance. There is a legend that he was known for his strict and total obedience to his superiors even when it required the denial of his own will. He was accustomed to go to the house of an usurer because he feared that in accepting an alms from him he would share the guilt of this man's injustices. But when the man complained and the superior commanded him, he accepted alms from the man. It was when he returned that he opened the sack that the usurer offered and blood started to flow out. To those around him the Peis said: \\"This is the blood of the poor squeezed from them by usury\\". Peis' sister had often written to him asking him to visit her so that she could get his advice in certain matters. Peis had no mind to heed her request but when his superior ordered him to do so he at once undertook the visit. But he left again as soon as he had given the required advice. Peis' brother was sent to prison and it was hoped that - in view of reputation of Peis - the latter could obtain his brother's release. His superior sent him to speak to the governor but he asked that his brother be dealt with according to justice. Despite his poor health and other infirmities, he continued in his work no matter how arduous it seemed. Even after he became blind in 1779, he continued to work on for the benefit of those around him. Peis died on 11 May 1781 at 3:00pm in Cagliari, where his remains were interred. Canonization The cause for canonization opened after his death in 1844 (local level) and there were numerous reports of miracles attributed to him occurring at his tomb. The cause commenced and investigated the life and works of the late friar (a Positio was sent to the Congregation for Rites in 1868) while the confirmation of his heroic virtue enabled Pope Pius IX - on 26 May 1869 - to title Peis as Venerable. The confirmation of two miracles attributed to him (occurring after death) enabled Pope Pius XII to preside over his beatification on 16 June 1940. The ratification of an additional two miracles (occurring after beatification) allowed for Pius XII to canonize the friar on 21 October 1951 in Saint Peter's Basilica.

Biography Early years Robert Zieger was born August 2, 1938, in Englewood, New Jersey to John and Grace (Harman) Zieger. He married Gay Pitman in 1962. They had one child, Robert, and a granddaughter Persephone Zieger. Zieger received his bachelor's degree from Montclair State College in 1960, a master's degree from the University of Wyoming in 1961, and his doctorate in history from the University of Maryland in 1965. Career Zieger obtained an appointment as an assistant professor of history at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìStevens Point in 1964, rising to associate professor by 1973. He was an associate professor of history at Kansas State University from 1973 to 1977, and a professor of history at Wayne State University from 1977 to 1986. In 1986, Zieger was appointed professor of history at the University of Florida. He was named Distinguished Professor of History in 1998. Unlike many members of the University of Florida‚Äôs History Department, Zieger‚Äôs teaching style was very student oriented. He used a very detailed website that allows people taking his class to fully understand every single day of lecture. Also, he was adamant about making sure his undergraduates come prepared to discuss the material to be covered in class. This has twofold benefit, as it not only ensures preparation, but also allows students to boost their grade with frequent quizzes covering the reading material.Robert Zieger's homepage Awards and memberships Zieger's books have twice won the Philip Taft Labor History Book Award for the best book in labor history. In 1985, Zieger's Rebuilding the Pulp and Paper Workers' Union, 1933‚Äì1941 was a Taft Prize co- winner with Paul Avrich's The Haymarket Tragedy. Zieger won the Taft Prize again in 1995 for his 1994 book, The CIO, 1935‚Äì1955. Zieger was a member of the Organization of American Historians and the Southern Historical Association. He was also a member of the Historians of American Communism, and served as the organization's president from 1989 to 1992.

Conferences are tournaments within a season, as opposed to the North American usage where a conference is a grouping of teams. If a team wins all of the conferences in a season, it is said that they have won a Grand Slam. Types of conferences As of the 2015‚Äì16 season, there is a total of 117 conferences/tournaments held by the PBA since 1975. It was further broken down into three categories: # All Filipino conferences - only players with Filipino citizenship are allowed to compete. (38 tournaments as of 2015‚Äì16 season) # Import-laden conferences - players with other citizenship/nationality are allowed to compete, with teams usually limited with one non-Filipino on their active lineup. (79 tournaments as of 2015‚Äì16 season) # Special tournaments - teams may or may not include imports but championships won don't count to the championship tally. Active tournaments # All-Filipino Cup/Philippine Cup - San Miguel Beermen # Commissioner's Cup - San Miguel Beermen # Governors' Cup - Barangay Ginebra San Miguel Inactive tournaments # All-Philippine Championship - Crispa Redmanizers (1976) # Reinforced Filipino - Crispa Redmanizers (1983) # Fiesta - Alaska Aces (2010) # Open - San Miguel Beermen (1989) # Reinforced - Coca-Cola Tigers (2003) # First Conference - Shell Rimula X (1992) # Third Conference - Swift Mighty Meaties (1992) # Invitational - Alaska Aces (2003) Special tournaments # PBA-IBA- A√±ejo Rum 65ers (1988) # Centennial - Mobiline Phone Pals (1998)  Number of conferences  There had always been three conferences in a PBA season. The exceptions are: * 1981 PBA season had two conferences due to Manila's hosting of the 1981 Southeast Asian Games. * 1998 PBA season had four conferences due to celebrate the centennial of the Philippine Declaration of Independence. * There were two conferences from 2004 to 2010 due to modification of the season format from three conferences to two, and from changing the season calendar from January or February‚ÄìDecember to October‚ÄìJuly. To do this, there was a transitional 2004 PBA Fiesta Conference.

Saxman (born October 18, 1965)Virginia General Assembly historical biography is an American politician of the Republican Party. He is a former member of the Virginia House of Delegates, representing the 20th District from 2002 to his retirement in 2010. The district includes the City of Staunton, the western part of Augusta County, the southern part of Rockingham County, and all of Highland County. Early life and education After graduating from Robert E. Lee High School, he went on to earn a B.A. in History from Washington and Lee University in 1987. He worked in New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. before returning to Staunton to teach U.S. History and Government for three years at Stuart Hall. He then became general manager of the family business, Shenandoah Valley Water Company, a bottled water and coffee distribution and delivery company. Political career State politics In November 2001, he was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates. (In the 2001 redistricting, the 20th District was moved to the Staunton area from Danville, where the seat had been held for seven terms by Democrat Whitt Clement.) Since the Spring of 2003, Delegate Saxman has served as Chairman of the House Cost Cutting Caucus, a bipartisan group that works to find cost savings in government. The Hotline listed Delegate Saxman as one of the top 20 \\"up-and-coming stars of Virginia politics\\", in November 2003. In their recent 2006 edition, The Hotline noted that \\"many consider him an up-and-coming star in the party.\\"Virginia GOP Network biography In addition to his work in the General Assembly, Delegate Saxman serves on the State Water Commission, the Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind Advisory Commission, and the Board of Trustees for the Frontier Culture Museum. An active member in the community, Saxman is a member of the St. Francis of Assisi Church and the Shenandoah Valley Kiwanis. He also serves on the Board of the Blue Ridge Area Food Bank and is serving his first term as Chairman of the Board of the International Bottled Water Association. Saxman and United States Senator John Warner were Virginia state co-chairs for John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. Potential 2008 Senate Candidacy On November 19, 2007, Saxman announced that he was mulling over a bid to run for the U.S. Senate to fill the seat of retiring Republican John Warner. Former Governor Jim Gilmore (R) announced that he was running on November 19, 2007. Saxman's announcement comes on because of Gilmore's announcement. Former Governor Mark Warner (D) - no relation to John Warner - has announced his candidacy. Most recent polling from November 5, 2007, has Warner leading Gilmore by 20+ points. On November 20, 2007 the Staunton News Leader theorized that a good portion of Chris Saxman's support for the U.S. Senate was coming from Democratic operatives supporting Mark Warner and internet provider addresses from outside the Commonwealth of Virginia. On December 1, 2007, the Associated Press reported Chris Saxman would not seek the Republican Convention nomination to replace U.S. Senator John Warner and would be a candidate for reelection to his 20th District House seat in 2009. House of Delegates Retirement Delegate Saxman shocked the political community when he announced on July 17, 2009, that he was withdrawing from his reelection bid, only days after campaigning door-to-door. He cited his desire to fight for what he calls \\"projects of my passion.\\" GOP leaders nominated Staunton City Councilor Dickie Bell as the Republican nominee. In the November general election, Bell defeated the Democratic nominee, Erik Curren, marketing director the American Shakespeare Center in Staunton.

The reality‚Äìvirtuality continuum therefore encompasses all possible variations and compositions of real and virtual objects. It has been described as a concept in new media and computer science, but in fact it could be considered a matter of anthropology. The concept was first introduced by Paul Milgram. The area between the two extremes, where both the real and the virtual are mixed, is called mixed reality. This in turn is said to consist of both augmented reality, where the virtual augments the real, and augmented virtuality, where the real augments the virtual. Overview alt=Mann's Continuum This continuum has been extended into a two-dimensional plane of virtuality and mediality.Mediated Reality with implementations for everyday life, 2002 August 6th, Presence Connect, the on line companion to the MIT Press journal PRESENCE: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments, MIT Press Taxonomy of reality, virtuality, mediality. The origin R denotes unmodified reality. A continuum across the virtuality axis, V, includes reality augmented with graphics (augmented reality), as well as graphics augmented by reality (augmented virtuality). However, the taxonomy also includes modification of reality or virtuality or any combination of these. The mediality axis denotes changes The modification is denoted by moving up the mediality axis. Further up this axis, for example, we can find mediated reality, mediated virtuality, or any combination of these. Further up and to the right, we have virtual worlds that are responsive to a severely modified version of reality. Augmented reality and mixed reality are now sometimes used as synonyms. The virtuality continuum has grown and progressed past labels such as computer science and new media. As the concept has much to do with the way in which humans continue to change how they communicate; the way in which identities form and the way in which they interact to and within the world; it is more accurately described as a subject within anthropology. Changes in attitudes towards and the increase in availability of technology and media have changed and progressed the way it is used. One to one (SMS), one to many (email), and many to many (chat rooms), have become ingrained in society. The use of such items have made once clear distinctions like online and offline obsolete, and the distinctions between reality and virtuality have become blurred as people are incorporating and relying heavily upon virtuality within their everyday personal realities. Daniel Miller and Don Slater are prominent researchers pursuing the concept of the virtuality continuum and the media and its effect on communities, especially in the Caribbean, most notably Trinidad and Jamaica. Steve Woolgar is another researcher who has established four rules of virtuality.

USS Saratoga On January 13, 1864, Secretary of the United States Navy Gideon Welles, ordered Commander Colvocoresses and USS Saratoga to proceed to Charleston, South Carolina, and report to Rear Admiral Dahlgren for duty in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron in what is known as the Union blockade. This was a massive effort by the Union Navy to prevent the passage of trade goods, supplies, and arms to and from the Confederate States. Ortega was a member of the landing parties from the ship who made several raids in August and September which resulted in the capture of many prisoners and the taking or destruction of substantial quantities of ordnance, ammunition, and supplies. A number of buildings, bridges, and salt works were destroyed during the expedition.

The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2003. Downloaded on 17 September 2015. It is a stout fleshy pale bright green, glabrous shrub, 1‚Äì2 m tall, branches lactiferous, shiny, succulent with conspicuous leaf scars. Leaves 4-12 x 1‚Äì4 cm, oblong-ovate to wedge and lance tip shaped, tapered but not sharply pointed, hairless smooth, glossy and rather succulent, somewhat clustered at tips of branches, exceeding the flowers. Leaf margin regularly toothed to finely serrate, although flower leaves may be entire. Inflorescence from the leaf axil 1-2-3 flowered. Flower stems 4-6 cm, erect bare. Sepals 4-7 mm, more or less linear, entire, blunt. Corolla 5-lobed, 10-22 mm x ca 12 mm, white with yellow markings, somewhat hairy inside the tube. It flowers usually in the winter and spring months, August to November. It is located on the central ridge above 700 m. There are patches near Cuckhold's Point, Mt Actaeon and also at High Peak and the Depot. The population fluctuates considerably as it regenerates best in disturbed open habitats. Among else it is found along path sides and also on the trunks of tree ferns. It is relatively short lived and disappears from overgrown places. Although the capsule resembles that of a Lobelia the branching and habit is unknown in that genus. In the past it was a constituent of thick, well-shaded forests. It has been suggested that it is related to the Pacific genera Sclerotheca and Apatahia. The old vernacular name 'milkwood' given to it by early settlers derives from the milky sap exuded from cut branches.Cronk, Q.C.B. (1995). The Endemic Flora of St Helena.

It is a member congregation of the Presbyterian Church in America. A short history of Third Third Presbyterian was organized on July 11, 1884. The church was an outgrowth of a \\"Sabbath\\" school established by First Presbyterian Church. After six months of operation, which included a two-week revival service under a \\"Gospel Tent,\\" the Third Presbyterian Church of Birmingham was organized. The church began with 31 charter members and was served by four supply pastors between 1884 and 1888. Bryan observes the damage of the 1901 fire. By 1889, Third had grown to over 500 members, commissioning over 50 of its own to begin churches in the nearby communities of Woodlawn, Leeds, and South Highlands. That same year, on August 4, the church's first permanent pastor was installed, James Alexander Bryan; he had been a visiting preacher at Third while a seminary student at Princeton University. He would later become known to virtually everyone in Birmingham as \\"Brother Bryan.\\" Bryan would continue to serve the church and the city for 52 years. Also in this period, the congregation undertook the task of constructing a building. The original building, located at 6th Avenue South and 22nd Street South, cost about $5300 and was dedicated in January 1891, free of debt. The building was enjoyed for a decade, until April 17, 1901, when an apparent spark from a passing streetcar ignited something in the barn adjacent to Brother Bryan's house. The fire subsequently spread to the house and church. The building completely destroyed, the congregation would continue meeting in a tent, without missing a service, until a new church building was constructed a block down the street on the corner of 7th Avenue. After Bryan's death in 1941, assistant minister James Cantrell became the full-time pastor until his retirement in May 1978. Richard C. Trucks served as pastor from 1978 to 2019; Michael Brock is the current pastor. The current building The church in the 1980s Completed in 1902, the church sanctuary and chapel remain essentially the same today. Only the corner steeple/tower is different, as the original was severely damaged by lightning in the 1930s. The tower was refitted with a less steep roof line, giving a slightly different appearance than the side tower which still maintains the original sharp-angled roof. Immediately adjacent to the church was Brother Bryan's house, which had become the \\"Sunday School Annex.\\" In 1959, the house was razed for the construction of a new addition to the church, the \\"Bryan Educational Building,\\" which was dedicated on December 11, 1960. In 1963, the corner tower was ornamented by an electric, vertical corner sign that read \\"God is Love\\" (replacing a previous, more subtle sign with the same message) and in 1972, it was capped with a large, electric cross on its apex. The sanctuary and chapel (the original structure) underwent a major renovation/restoration from 1993 to 1995. While entailing considerable structural repair, the restoration also gave a facelift to the interior as well as seeing the removal of the sign & cross on the corner tower. The cross was replaced by a smaller metal-cast cross, matching the metal apex piece of the side tower. References * Blakely, Hunter B. (1953) Religion in Shoes: Brother Bryan of Birmingham.

Virgil's powers Medieval legends attributed magical powers to the poet Virgil, but even among these legends, this tale attributes a very high level of power to him. Among his accomplishments in the tale, Virgilius is a quick thinker, using his magical powers to defeat corruption and military attacks and spirits. One of his spells was to make an army immobile, turn men to stone, or create a river out of nowhere, encircling them so they could not proceed. Although he wins many challenges, including a magician's battle, wily schemes also help his cause. Among his creations, he invents and animates a horse, rider and dogs out of copper to assert his will. Virgilius avenges the trickery of his first love for publicly humiliating him before finding true love at last, and creating the city of Naples for her. Synopsis The story begins ‚Äì > Long, long ago there was born to a Roman knight and his wife Maja a little > boy called Virgilius. While he was still quite little, his father died, and > the kinsmen, instead of being a help and protection to the child and his > mother, robbed them of their lands and money, and the widow, fearing that > they might take the boy's life also, sent him away to Spain, that he might > study in the great University of Toledo. One holiday, when walking, he came upon an evil spirit that was trapped; the spirit offered him magical books in exchange for setting him free. Virgilius demanded the books, and the knowledge how to use them, first; then he freed the spirit. It grew to an enormous size, so the quick-witted Virgilius declared he did not believe it came out of the hole, and the spirit, to prove it, went back in whereupon Virgilius quickly trapped it again. He studied magic for many days gaining a wonderful reputation for his powers (\\"he was much thought of as showing promise of great learning\\"). This was cut short when his mother sent for him because she was ill and could no longer look after their affairs. When he arrived home, his rich relatives were displeased because his presence meant they could no longer rob their kinsmen. They were, however, related to the emperor, who put off the matter of giving Virgilius his due. His enemies attacked him but Virgilius used his magic to drive them off or cast spells on them. The emperor himself went to him without effect until a magician came into camp and was hired to battle Virgilius. Virgilius had a hard time fighting the magician, but reached the emperor in secret with a proposition: he would stop the fight if he could have justice, compelling the emperor to agree. Virgilius then fell in love with a woman named Febilla. She told him that she would let him visit her by drawing him up in a basket to a tower. Once he was in the basket, she lifted it only half way, leaving him a dangling target of the crowd's ridicule. The emperor ordered his release, but the next day, no fire in Rome would light. Virgilius told them to bring Febilla to a scaffold in the market place and take fire from her. Fire started about her and she had to stand there until everyone had re-lit their fires. The emperor threw Virgilius into prison with a death sentence, but when he was brought up, thirsty Virgilius asked for water. When the guards brought him a pail of water, Virgilius jumped into it, saying he was going to Sicily and magically vanished. Andrew Lang has heavily bowdlerized his sources here; in the original Medieval tradition, the fire could only be rekindled from her vagina. The story was very popular with Renaissance artists. The Metropolitan Museum has a Venetian confittiera (ca. 1475-1500) showing Febilla standing on the square with raised skirt, a gift by J. Pierpont Morgan.Heilbrunn Timeline of Art HistoryLes cahiers d'Alain Truong Effects on Rome The fairy tale says that it is unknown how he reconciled with the emperor, but he next made statues of the gods of every country, including Rome, with bells in their hands, and the bells would ring if they intended treachery toward Rome, so the Romans would send their armies against them. A country that hated them sent men to Rome; they claimed to be diviners and to have dreamed of gold, and then, with the Senate's permission, dug up the gold they had buried the night before. The third time, they told the Senate it was under the Capitol and they would dig for them, for their generosity; they undermined the Capitol and stole away. Immediately after, the statues fell and were ruined. Much crime followed in the city. Virgilius had a copper horse and rider made and ordered all men indoors. Only the honest obeyed, and the horse trampled those it found outside. The next day, the surviving thieves tried to use ropes and grapples to stop it, and used rope ladders to escape it. Two copper dogs were added, to jump up and bite them to death. Virgilius fell in love with a foreign princess, the daughter of a sultan, and carried her away from her father. She was a guest in his house, wondering at the marvels, until she wished to return to her father. Virgilius returned her, but the sultan ordered his death. Virgilius cast a spell on him and his court and carried the princess away again. Then, thinking Rome not fine enough, he built a marvelous city for her, which was Naples. Commentary The technique of tricking spirit is a motif also found in The Spirit in the Bottle and with genies in The Fisherman and the Jinni. The legend that he had been trapped in a basket was a common medieval tale, warning of the power of love to make fools of men. There is a reference to the \\"Black Book\\" he uses as the source of his spells which in popular culture can be a book containing lists of evil deeds.

It is part of the Cherokee County School District.  History  The high school building was opened at its campus in 2000 at a cost of $22 million. Faulty construction work led to the district suing the bonding company, architects and construction company. The district received a $10 million settlement, $6 million of it for replacing brickwork and $4 million for mediation and architectural fees. In March 2007, the school board approved a plan to construct a \\"9th Grade Academy\\"; a separate building connected to the high school with a covered walkway. The new building will be used by freshman students, who numbered about 600 in the 2006-2007 school year, for classes and meals. School officials said the new building should relieve overcrowding on the campus, opened in 2001 with a designed maximum capacity of 2,000 students but with a 2006-2007 enrollment of about 2,100. The school board also approved a new stadium for the school's Twin Lakes Road campus. The new stadium would replace the William K. Brumbach stadium, known locally as \\"the Reservation\\" and located at the former Gaffney High School site on East Frederick Street that is now home to Gaffney Middle School. On the home side of the current stadium, Gaffney's teams enter through a tunnel, described by the Spartanburg Herald-Journal as \\"a revered entrance for Gaffney teams.\\" The projected minimum cost of the stadium was $7.2 million, and another $1.5 million may be spent to build a new field track, more parking and a team meeting room, if school officials are able to get the money from contingency funds or if construction costs elsewhere come in under budget, according to a consultant for the school district.

It first aired on the NBC network in the United States on November 14, 2002. Plot While changing Emma, Ross starts to sing Sir Mix- a-Lot's \\"Baby Got Back\\", which makes Emma laugh for the first time. Rachel is very jealous to find out that she missed Emma's first laugh, and is not amused to find that Ross was singing a song about \\"a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses\\" to their baby daughter, even though Ross tries to point out that the song \\"promotes a healthy...body image.\\" Rachel tries many different things to get Emma to laugh, but she realizes that only \\"Baby Got Back\\" will cause Emma to laugh. At the end of the episode, Ross and Rachel sing a duet of the song and even do some dancing along with it, unaware that the rest of the group is watching them do it. Phoebe is very concerned about meeting Mike's parents for dinner at their home. As they talk about it, Rachel talks about meeting Ross's parents for the first time during which she reveals that Judy said that Rachel was like the daughter she never had, which upsets Monica. With some fashion and conversation tips from Monica and Rachel, Phoebe arrives at the Hannigans wearing a very traditional and conservative outfit that prompts Mike to tell Phoebe that she looks like his mother. Phoebe also begins speaking in a very snobbish accent in an effort to fit in with Mike's rich parents. Mike encourages her to just be herself, but that produces disastrous results as Phoebe provides details about her life on the street (including the fact that a pimp once spat in her mouth), playfully punches Mr. Hannigan in the chest (unaware that he just had surgery), and provides Mrs. Hannigan with far too much information about Mike's sexual behavior. Phoebe is so desperate to fit in that she even tries to eat veal despite being a fervent vegetarian. While she is in the bathroom throwing up, Mike's parents drop some not-so-subtle hints about breaking up with Phoebe. Phoebe overhears Mike defending her and telling his parents that he loves Phoebe. Phoebe runs in and tells Mike that she loves him, too. Mike and Phoebe leave, but not before Phoebe tells the Hannigans that she threw up in the coat closet instead of the bathroom. When Joey asks Monica and Chandler what how he should invest his money (as opposed to his current system of taping it to the back of his toilet tank), Monica suggests investing in real estate and even tells Joey that her old boyfriend, Richard Burke, is moving out of his apartment. Chandler, who still dislikes and distrusts Richard, tags along with Joey to check out Richard's old apartment. While there, Chandler sees a videotape with Monica's name on it; he quickly (and Joey slowly) concludes that it is a sex tape. Chandler steals the tape and tries to watch it at home, but is too afraid of what might be on there and instead asks Joey to watch it. At first, it just is a football game, but it quickly switches over to a sex tape. Joey manages to tackle Chandler before he sees too much and tackles Monica when she walks into the room. An insecure Chandler tells Monica that all he can think about is her rolling around in bed with Richard while wearing cowboy boots, but Monica responds that she has never worn cowboy boots. They watch more of the tape and see that, in fact, it is not Monica, which makes Chandler relieved. However, Monica is rather miffed that Richard taped over her.

Cowles Media Co., 501 U.S. 663 (1991), was a U.S. Supreme Court case holding that the First Amendment freedom of the press does not exempt journalists from generally applicable laws.. Dan Cohen, a Republican associated with Wheelock Whitney's 1982 Minnesota gubernatorial run, provided inculpatory information on the Democratic challenger for Lieutenant Governor, Marlene Johnson, to the Minneapolis Star Tribune and St. Paul Pioneer Press in exchange for a promise that his identity as the source would not be published. Over the reporters' objections, editors of both newspapers independently decided to publish his name. Cohen consequently lost his job at an advertising agency. He sued Cowles Media Company, who owned the Minneapolis Star Tribune. In 1988, a jury of six found in Cohen's favor. The Minnesota Supreme Court reversed. The United States Supreme Court, while refusing to reinstate the damages, remanded the case to the Minnesota Supreme Court, which reinstated the jury's original verdict of $200,000. The Cowles Media Company was found liable based on a theory of promissory estoppel. Opinion of the Court The Supreme Court found, in a majority decision, that: # Against respondent's claims that it had no jurisdiction: citing Orr v. Orr (1979), whether the arguments in inferior courts were federal law arguments was irrelevant, and moreover the Minnesota Supreme Court had used federal law and respondent had relied on First Amendment protection. # Promissory estoppel being a state action, the Fourteenth Amendment applies, and hence the First Amendment is triggered, citing New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964). However, since the state principle of promissory estoppel is a generally applicable principle, there is no specific application of the First Amendment to the press, over and above that of any other citizen, citing Associated Press v. NLRB (1937). Cohen had not used the promissory estoppel argument to avoid the hurdle of a libel case, but for identifiable pecuniary losses, distinguishing the case from Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell (1988). Consequently, any restriction on reporting was \\"incidental, and constitutionally insignificant\\" result of applying a generally applicable law. # Deciding whether the claim under promissory estoppel was valid, and whether the state constitution shielded the press, was a matter for the Minnesota Supreme Court, and on that basis the request for reinstatement of damages was denied, and the case remanded to the inferior court. Dissents Justice Blackmun's dissent focussed on the proposition that applying promissory estoppel punished the publication of truth. Justice Souter's dissent was based on the balance of \\"the importance of the information to public discourse\\" to the other interests involved. In this case the potential effect of the publication of Cohen's identity on an election for public office was thought to be compelling.

One type, Zostavax, is essentially a larger-than-normal dose of the chickenpox vaccine, as both shingles and chickenpox are caused by the same virus, the varicella zoster virus (VZV). A recombinant version, Shingrix, was approved in the United States in 2017. While the recombinant version appears to prevent more cases of shingles, it has greater side effects and requires two doses.  Medical uses  Zostavax A Cochrane review concluded that \\"herpes zoster vaccine is effective in preventing herpes zoster disease and this protection can last three years\\". The duration of protection beyond four years after vaccination with the zoster vaccine is unknown. The need for re-vaccination has not been defined. Zostavax was shown to reduce the incidence of shingles by 51percent in a study of 38,000 adults aged 60 and older who received the vaccine. The vaccine also reduced by 67percent the number of cases of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and reduced the severity and duration of pain and discomfort associated with shingles, by 61percent. The FDA originally recommended it for individuals 60 years of age or older who are not severely allergic to any of its components and who meet the following requirements: * does not have a weakened immune system due to HIV/AIDS or another disease or medications (such as steroids, radiation and chemotherapy) that affect the immune system; * does not have a history of cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, such as leukemia or lymphoma; and * does not have active, untreated tuberculosis. In 2006, the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that the live vaccine be given to all adults age 60 and over, including those who have had a previous episode of shingles, and those who do not recall having had chickenpox, since more than 99percent of Americans ages 40 and older have had chickenpox.Vaccines: VPD- VAC/Shingles/Shingles (Herpes zoster) Vaccination: What You Need to Know Shingrix The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in the United States recommends Shingrix for adults over the age of 50, including those who have already received Zostavax. The Committee voted that Shingrix is preferred over Zostavax for the prevention of zoster and related complications because data showed vaccine efficacy of more than 90% against shingles across all age groups, as well as sustained efficacy over a 4-year follow-up. Unlike Zostavax, which is given as a single shot, Shingrix is given as two intramuscular doses, two to six months apart. The absolute decrease in risk of herpes zoster following immunization over three and a half years is 3.3% (3.54% down to 0.28%) while the decrease in the risk of postherpetic neuralgia is 0.3% (0.34% down to 0.06%). Side effects  Zostavax The live vaccine (Zostavax) is very safe; one to a few percent of people develop a mild form of chickenpox, often with about five or six blisters around the injection site, and without fever. The blisters are harmless and temporary. In one study 64percent of the Zostavax group and 14percent of the controls had some adverse reaction. However, the rates of serious adverse events were comparable between the Zostavax group (0.6percent) and those receiving the placebo (0.5percent). A study including children with leukaemia found that the risk of getting shingles after vaccination is much lower than the risk of getting shingles for children with natural chicken pox in their history. Data from healthy children and adults point in the same direction. Zostavax should not be used in people with compromised immune function. Shingrix Temporary side effects from the Shingrix shots are likely, and can be severe enough in one out of six people to affect normal daily activities for up to three days. Mild to moderate pain at the injection site is common, and some may have redness or swelling. Side effects include fatigue, muscle pain, headache, shivering, fever, and nausea. Symptoms usually resolve in two to three days. Side effects with Shingrix are greater than those with Zostavax and occur more frequently in individuals aged 50 to 69 years compared with those 70 years and older.  Composition  The Zostavax vaccine contains live attenuated varicella-zoster virus. It is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) in the upper arm. The live vaccine was developed using the MRC-5 line of fetal stem cells. This has raised religious and ethical concerns for some potential users, since that cell line was derived from an aborted fetus. Shingrix is a suspension for intramuscular injection consisting of a lyophilized recombinant varicella zoster virus (VZV) glycoprotein E (gE) antigen that is reconstituted at the time of use with AS01B suspension as an immunological adjuvant. The antigen is a purified truncated form of the glycoprotein, expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The AS01B adjuvant suspension is composed of 3-O-desacyl-4'- monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) from Salmonella (Minnesota strain) and a saponin molecule (QS-21) purified from Quillaja saponaria (soap bark tree) extract, combined in a liposomal formulation consisting of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and cholesterol in phosphate-buffered saline solution. Society and culture Cost effectiveness In Canada the cost of Shingrix is about for the two doses. A 2007 study found that the live vaccine is likely to be cost- effective in the U.S., projecting an annual savings of to million in healthcare costs with cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from to per quality- adjusted life year gained. In 2007, the live vaccine was officially recommended in the U.S. for healthy adults aged 60 and over. Approval  European Union  In 2006, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a marketing authorization for the zoster vaccine to Sanofi Pasteur for routine vaccination in individuals aged 60 and over. In 2007, the EMA updated the marketing authorization for routine vaccination in individuals aged 50 and over. Shingrix was approved for medical use in the European Union in March 2018, with an indication for the prevention of herpes zoster (HZ) and post- herpetic neuralgia (PHN) in adults 50 years of age or older. Text was copied from this source which is ¬© European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged.  United Kingdom  From 2013, the UK National Health Service (NHS) started offering shingles vaccination to elderly people. People aged either 70 or 79 on 1 September 2013, were offered the vaccine. People aged 71 to 78 on that date would only have an opportunity to have the shingles vaccine after reaching the age of 79. The original intention was for people aged between 70 and 79 to be vaccinated, but the NHS later said that the vaccination program was being staggered as it would be impractical to vaccinate everyone in their 70s in a single year. United States Zostavax was developed by Merck & Co. and approved and licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2006, In 2011, the FDA approved the live vaccine for use in individuals 50 to 59 years of age. Shingrix is a zoster vaccine developed by GlaxoSmithKline that was approved in the United States in October 2017. As of June 30, 2020, Merck discontinued the sale of Zostavax in the U.S. market. Existing vaccine already in the hands of practitioners, none having expiration dates later than November 2020, may still be administered up to the expiration date.https://www.merckvaccines.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2020/06/US- CIN-00033.pdf The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that healthy adults 50 years and older get two doses of Shingrix, at least two months apart. Initial clinical trials only tested a gap of less than six months between doses, but unexpected popularity and resulting shortages caused further testing to validate wider spacing of the two doses. Shingrix, which provides strong protection against shingles and PHN, is preferred over Zostavax.

Maryon sings about the need to take care of the natural beauty of the earth, in order to make sure that an earthly paradise can be constructed. Of some note was the performance, in which Maryon began dressed almost head-to-toe in a dark cloak, before removing it as the song built to its conclusion. As Monaco had not competed at the Contest for 25 years, the song was performed in the semi- final. Here, it was performed ninth, following Malta's Julie & Ludwig with \\"On Again...

New Haven High School is one of five high schools in the East Allen County Schools district, Indiana. The district has adopted a unique method called ‚Äúfive campus‚Äù, meaning a student can take a class offered at any one of the schools in the district. History The first school in New Haven was built downtown in 1885. The first true high school was built in 1923 and was officially called the Adams-Township school, although everyone referred to it as New Haven school. It accommodated kindergarten through 12th grade. In the 1940s a separate building was put up next to this school to house the elementary grades. In 1955 and 1957 additions were made to the high school to allow for the growing student population. To further aid with the growth a middle school was built across the street on the high school‚Äôs football field and track. (Goeglein) Soon enough it was time to build a new high school. The high school moved to a piece of land across the highway. The middle school moved into the old high school and the elementary moved into the middle school. The elementary is now used for offices and has a newly renovated auditorium that is used for special performances. The current New Haven High School was built in 1975 and opened in 1977. The building is located on a property ‚Äì the smallest amount of land of any school in its district. It cost approximately $7 million to build. The gym is a smaller version of the nearby Harding High School gym. The school was originally designed to accommodate 1500 students. Recently the school has had some modifications to classrooms to allow for different kinds of classes. Currently the school‚Äôs capacity is 1030. This is the first school in the district to have an elevator in it. The principal of the school when it opened was Paul Goeglein. New Haven Middle School was its own building until 2019, when grades were reconfigured, with a junior high school attached to New Haven High School.

In Spain, the 12th-century philosopher Ibn BƒÅjja (Avempace) wrote on De Partibus and De Generatione. It has been remarked that one usually finds references to the Historia in the Eastern Islamicate world, while the other two books are generally referred to in the West, and in conformity to this pattern, Ibn Rushd (Averroes), like Ibn BƒÅjja, wrote commentaries on De Partibus and De Generatione (see below), in which he criticizes Ibn Sƒ´nƒÅ's interpretations.

Kiko is the MƒÅori word for flesh or meat. The Kiko breed was created in the 1980s by Garrick and Anne Batten, who cross-bred local feral goats with imported dairy goat bucks of the Anglo-Nubian, Saanen, and Toggenburg breeds. The breeding aims were hardiness, fast growth, parasite resistance, and survivability with little input from the producer. The Kiko breed was imported into the US in 1992 by Goatex Group LLC. Today, three registries are in the US for Kikos: the AKGA, the IKGA, and the NKR (which is the largest of the three). Kikos can be registered as 100% New Zealand, meaning that their lineage can be traced all the way back to the original New Zealand stock.The National Kiko Registry Handbook \\"Purebreds\\" are animals that are at least 15/16ths New Zealand stock and \\"percentages\\" are those that are at least 50% New Zealand stock. Kikos-Boer crosses can also be registered as Genemaster‚Ñ¢ with the NKR. The Kiko breed continues to grow in popularity particularly in the warm, wet US southern states where drug- resistant parasites have wreaked havoc on southern herds. The Kiko shows a natural parasite resistance that allows it to thrive in climates where other goats do not. The Kiko breed, coming from a dairy background, is also proving valuable to southern dairy herds in providing parasite resistant dual-purpose dairy and meat offspring.

He was a member of the Taitazak family. With his father and brother Judah ben Solomon Taitazak, he moved in 1492 from Spain, his native land, to Salonica, where he became a rabbi. Life He was regarded as one of the most mysterious Kabbalists of the 16th century and one of the leading rabbinical figures in Jerusalem and Damascus. He discussed magic squares, which allude to the highest and most concealed concepts and their use within amulets. Many references can be found in writings of contemporary and leading Kabbalists, such as Rabbi Joseph Tirshom's manuscript (ca. 1550 CE) \\"Shoshan Yesod Olam\\" (The Rose, Foundation of the Universe), Rabbi Eljah Baal Shem's Toledot Adam (Generation of Adam) and Rabbi Isaiah Horowitz's (1560-1630 CE) Sh'nei Luchot HaB'rit (Two Tablets of the Covenant) discuss the magic square in relation to the mysteries of creation. He was a fervent adherent of the Kabbalah, in which he was well versed, and led an ascetic life. Eliyahu de Vidas related that with the exception of Sabbath nights, Joseph for forty years never slept in a bed, but on a box, with his feet on the ground.In his Reshit ·∏§okmah (Sha'ar ha-·∏≤edushshah, ch. 7) With such a disposition to asceticism and mysticism, it was but natural that Joseph should become enthralled by the messianic vagaries of Solomon Molcho, whom he supported while preaching at Salonica in 1529. Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan writes, \\"Rabbi Joseph Taitazak was apparently influenced by Abulafia's school of Kabbalah, and many ideas that he discusses seem to be taken verbatim from Abulafia's writings.\\" He was also considered one of the greatest Talmudists of his time, with even Joseph Caro invoking his authority.Ab·∏≥at Rokel, ¬ß56 Among Joseph's disciples were Isaac Adarbi, Samuel di Medina, and Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz.

Scrunchies made from bead crochet. A scrunchie (or scrunchy) is a fabric covered elastic hair tie used to fasten medium to long hair types. Large, elaborate styles and diminutive, unassuming forms are available in many different colors, fabrics, and designs. Although scrunchies are most commonly used in hair, they can also be worn around the wrist or ankle as an accessory to enhance an outfit.  History  The Scrunchie was patented in 1987US Patent #USS1D0292030, United States Patent and Trademark Office by Rommy Revson. She created the first prototype of the Scrunchie because she wanted a gentler version of the metal hair ties used in the 1980s. Revson named the decorative hair accessory the Scunci after her pet toy poodle. The name Scrunchie was a natural evolution, because the fabric scrunched up. After patenting the Scrunchie, Revson spent most of her time in legal disputes, both with manufacturers and her own lawyers. Scrunchies were particularly popular in the 1980s and 1990s, including larger, more elaborate versions. Scrunchies regained popularity in the mid 2010s.Heather Schwedel, \\"Fight to the Decades: Are We Experiencing an ‚Äô80s or ‚Äô90s Comeback?\\", Flavorwire, August 25, 2009.  Popularity  Revson's Scrunchies were extremely popular in the 1980s and 1990s. Scrunchies initially became popular in the 80s because they were a less damaging alternative for pulling big hair up. Also, scrunchies came in many different colors and patterns, so they matched the colorful and over-the-top aesthetic of the 1980s. Well-known celebrities such as Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul, Demi Moore, and Sarah Jessica Parker were all seen wearing them. Debbie Gibson in particular wore them; Madonna wore a large velvet scrunchie in Desperately Seeking Susan.Mhairi Graham, \\"The Scrunchie Revival: AnOther considers the return of that 90's classic ‚Äì the scrunchie\\", AnOther, May 29, 2014. Scrunchies were also featured in popular movies like Heathers, being passed from one Heather to another based on popularity shifts. The popularity of scrunchies continued into the 1990s as well. This time, scrunchies made an appearance in shows such as Friends, Full House, and Seinfeld. However, scrunchie popularity was not limited to celebrities and television; many female astronauts used them to secure their hair while they were on a mission. The early 2000s marked a downfall in the popularity of scrunchies. Carrie Bradshaw in an episode of Sex and the City mocked the fashion.Sex and the City Episode 78: \\"Pick-A-Little, Talk-A-Little\\", HBO, retrieved March 23, 2016. This comment represented the decline in popularity of the scrunchie during this time period. The scrunchie became a faux pas in the sense that wearing it around was embarrassing. Many people believed that scrunchies should stay in the past. Even after its downfall, the scrunchie still made a comeback. In the late 2010s it was seen all over runways and in the hair and on the wrists of celebrities. Famous women such as Hailey Bieber, Bella Hadid, Gigi Hadid, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/notorious-rbg-scotus-dissent/ and Selena Gomez have all been seen wearing them again. Famous singer Lizzo generated news when she wore a $100 scruchie with jewels on it backstage at MTV's Video Music Awards. It was featured in the popular Netflix original movie To All the Boys I've Loved Before as a symbol of power struggle between main character Lara Jean and her former BFF and the character Eleven on Stranger Things was seen wearing them in the third season of the show in 2019. Scrunchies are often exchanged between tweens and young teens as a sign of an emerging romance. Generally, a girl will give a boy a scrunchie as a sign of affection or to say that they are \\"cute\\" or that they are their \\"crush,\\" and the boy will wear the scrunchie usually on his wrist. Scrunchies are also an integral part of the VSCO girl aesthetic, which is a specific trend from the app VSCO that is discussed greatly on another app called TikTok. The re-surge in popularity is partly attributed to the rise in nostalgic culture at the end of the 2010s. Another reason cited for its rise in popularity in the late 2010s is an increased emphasis on hair health, the scrunchie is gentler on curly, coarse, or kinkier hair than normal hair ties.  Types and variations  There are over five hundred different designs of scrunchies since its invention. There are many different brands and stores that sell them. In the US, almost every major store sold some sort of scrunchie in 2019. The Sc√ºnci brand offers a range of textures, including velvet, satin, and fur, as well as various designs such as neon and metallic. There are also different variations of the scrunchie. There is a scrunchie bow, which is a normal scrunchie with a small and short or large and long bow on one side of it. There are also different patterns, such as leopard print, tie-dye, and dotted. There are also scrunchies with prints of animals or pictures of flowers on them. Overall, there are hundreds of different designs of scrunchies. The size of scrunchies also varies, ranging from as small as a normal hair tie to the over-sized scrunchie that is as big as the back of the head.

Production Director Pyun shot Urban Menace simultaneously with The Wrecking Crew and Corrupt in a derelict factory in Eastern Europe, originally intending Urban Menace and The Wrecking Crew as sections of a single film; the producers decided to make two films. The budget only permitted two stuntmen, making deaths repetitive. Pyun often superimposed the stars' faces onto stand-ins. Half the finished film was lost in transit, requiring substitution of rough duplicate footage; large parts of Urban Menace are in black and white and the photography is often blurry.Douglas Pratt, Doug Pratt's DVD: Movies, Television, Music, Art, Adult, and More!, New York: Harbor, 2004, , p. 1299.

Prior to entering politics, he was a long- serving police officer in Victoria and England. Early life and police career Savage was born in 1948 in Melbourne, and educated at the Red Hill Consolidated School on the Mornington Peninsula. From 1967 to 1969, he was a police officer with the Metropolitan Police in London. He returned to Australia and joined Victoria Police in 1970, attaining the rank of senior sergeant and acting as station commander at Mildura police station.re-member: Savage, Russell Irwin, Parliament of Victoria (Australia). In 1989 he received the National Medal for twenty years of service in the Victorian police force.SAVAGE, Russell Irwin, It's an Honour, 15 August 1989. Political career After leaving the police force in 1990, Savage entered local politics as a councillor for the Shire of Mildura council, until 1995 when the Shire was merged with the City of Mildura and Shire of Walpeup into the Rural City of Mildura. Savage ran as an independent candidate for the seat of Mildura in the 1996 Victorian state election. Savage based his campaign on the neglect of rural Victoria by incumbent Premier Jeff Kennett's government, in particular its closure of The Vinelander rail service between Melbourne and Mildura. Savage was elected after picking up a large swing from the incumbent Liberal member Craig Bildstien, even as the Liberal state government was easily reelected. It was only the third time since the seat's creation in 1927 that it had been out of the hands of a conservative party. At the next Victorian election in 1999, Savage retained his seat, and along with two other independents (Craig Ingram and Susan Davies), held the balance of power in the Victorian parliament (pending the results of a supplementary election in Frankston East following the death of sitting MP Peter McLellan on election day). At 11am on 18 October, Savage, Ingram and Davies held simultaneous press conferences, announcing their support for the Labor Party led by Steve Bracks.Independents join to end Victoria's Kennett era, The 7.30 Report (Australian Broadcasting Corporation), 18 October 1999. Savage lost his seat to the National Party's Peter Crisp in the 2006 Victorian State election, a loss he attributed to the Nationals' high-budget campaign, Labor's failure to reopen the Mildura rail link, and a proposal to build a toxic waste dump in his electorate.Green, Jonathan: It's an awful job ‚Äî I'm glad I don't have to do it, The Age, 27 November 2006.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The land now known as Meyer Ranch was homesteaded by the Duncan McIntyre family in the mid-19th century. Located near the Turkey Creek wagon road, they fed and lodged travelers. The property was purchased in 1883 by Louis Ramboz, who had the house built in 1889 from lumber milled on the property. Midway House served as an overflow house for a stagecoach stop on the route from Denver to Fairplay, named because of its location midway between Denver and Bailey. The ranch reportedly served as the winter quarters for animals of the P.T. Barnum Circus in the late 1880s, but there is no record of P.T. Barnum ever coming to Colorado. A board inscribed \\"Circus Town 1889\\" was found in the house during renovation in 1955. After Ramboz, the ranch was owned by Ralph Kirkpatrick from 1912 to 1950 and run as a working ranch with a hillside cleared for skiing in the early 1940s. Skiers were transported from the road to the base of a single rope tow in horse-drawn sleighs. The ski area was known as Mount Lugo and, though it closed in 1942, the hills at Meyer Ranch are still enjoyed by cross-country and backcountry skiers. In 1950, Norman and Ethel Meyer bought the ranch including Midway House. In 1959, they bought McIntyre's original homestead. The Meyers sold of their ranch to Jefferson County Open Space in 1987, which opened Meyer Ranch Park to the public in 1989. The house remains in the Meyers' ownership. As of September 2010, a preliminary agreement has been negotiated to conduct a feasibility study for the establishment of the house as a museum. The location appeared on the pilot episode of the History Channel documentary series Mega Movers. It first aired on April 27, 2005 as a segment of the Modern Marvels episode \\"Mega Movers\\" (#337), which followed the move of a cabin and an 1870 hay and stock barn closer to the ranch house.

Fu Hao had entered the royal household by marriage and took advantage of the semi-matriarchal slave society to rise through the ranks.

The Tu fought against the Shang for generations until they finally were defeated by Fu Hao in a single decisive battle. Further campaigns against the neighbouring Yi, Qiang, and Ba followed, the latter is particularly remembered as the earliest recorded large scale ambush in Chinese history. With up to 13,000 troops and the important generals Zhi and Hou Gao serving under her, she was the most powerful military leader of her time.

Tacitus mentions them twice; in his Germania and again in his Annals, specifically at the battle near modern Nijmegen when the XV Primigenia and V Alaudae legions were sent packing back to Castra Vetera where they were later besieged during the Revolt of the Batavi. He writes in detail how the women would gather behind the warhost, and show their breasts to flagging warriors while screaming that their loss that day would mean the enemy gaining these as slaves. Women held an honored position in German tribes, and were seen as holy spirits as shown by their adoration of such as Aurinia and Veleda. Slavery was the fate of cowards and the unlucky - and letting one's women fall into that fate was a hideous deed. Thus the men were encouraged to fight harder. * 1st century ‚Äì A Sarmatian woman was buried with weapons in what is now modern Russia. * 1st century ‚Äì A woman was entombed with a sword in Tabriz, Iran.

While the need is fairly clear, finance for the project has been done by piecemeal in the United States Congress, Illinois General Assembly, and private entities.  Problems  The tracks and junctions in the Chicago area have grown with little coordination between the railroads and the city since the first railroads arrived in the 1830s. There are a large number of at-grade crossings, sometimes not located a train length apart which is a problem as train lengths have grown. Some flyovers exist but do not always have sufficient clearance for tall or double- stack trains. Some connections that would create short cuts for traffic are missing. There are also many highway crossings at grades. The congestion in the Chicago area is predicted to lead to severe disruption by the late 2010s without the completion of the CREATE program.  Projects  The program is composed of a total of 71 separate projects, of which 46 are eliminating rail junctions and the remainder are eliminating grade crossings. As of November 2017, a total of 29 had been fully completed, 5 were under construction, four are in final design, and another 13 are in the preliminary design and environmental review process. Major projects Brighton Park Crossing The Brighton Park crossing is a major crossing serving 76 trains a day from CSX, Canadian National, Norfolk Southern, Metra's Heritage Corridor, and Amtrak. There are two major projects at Brighton Park in coordination with CREATE. The first project, completed over the Fourth of July in 2007, replaced a semaphore signal and interlocked the crossing at a cost of $9.5 million. The second project is to construct a flyover on Canadian National tracks over the Western Avenue corridor tracks to reduce congestion and eliminate delays. This project is currently unfunded. Englewood Junction A $140 million project in Englewood, Chicago planned since 2002, began construction in 2011. The junction would get a flyover for Metra trackage above a Norfolk Southern route, eliminating a diamond crossing. 138 trains a day operate through the junction, which is the cause of the majority of delays in the Midwest for Amtrak trains. On June 22, 2011, it was announced that the State of Illinois, Amtrak, Norfolk Southern, and the Federal Railway Administration had signed a final agreement for financing the project with the federal government paying 95% of the cost. The project was completed and began service in October 2014. 75th Street Corridor On a daily basis, 80 Metra and freight trains cross paths along the Belt Railway of Chicago on Chicago's South Side near 75th Street. The project budgeted at $474 million, began construction in October 2018, and is scheduled to be completed in 2025. As a part of this project, Metra plans to reroute SouthWest Service commuter trains from Chicago Union Station to LaSalle Street Station, in order for high-speed passenger trains to operate into Union Station. Other projects *Construction of additional Union Pacific mainline trackage near Proviso Yard *Signaling and grade-separation improvements to the Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad *General improvements to roadways near railroad overpasses *Additional trackage, improved signaling and grade separations on CSX trackage in Alsip Funding CREATE is a public-private partnership estimated to cost around $3 billion, up from an initial predicted cost of $1 billion. $230 million is to be supplied by railroads that are part of the program, with the remainder coming from governments at federal, state and local levels. In July 2010, a $100 million TIGER grant from the federal government was finalized. As of late 2010, a total of around $320 million had been committed to the project, with an additional $133 million to be provided from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

This was the first - and to date, the only - occasion on which the Tahitian language was used at the Contest. The song is inspired by island music - particularly that of the South Pacific. Ferrer, herself raised on R√©union island in the Indian Ocean, sings about the need to relax and let the world pass one by, as well as to \\"Let yourself go and come dancing\\". She then tells her listeners that when they feel \\"your luck below zero\\", they should join with her in the titular \\"coco dance\\", which is apparently related to the tamure of French Polynesia. The chorus itself is delivered in Tahitian, while the dance instructions are in French. In keeping with the theme of the song, Ferrer (wearing a tight multicoloured dress) was joined onstage by five dancers (some of whom also doubled as backing singers) wearing grass skirts and performing a more energetic version of the dance she was instructing her listeners in. The Tahitian-language shouts of \\"Join us in our dance\\" were performed by the male members of this group. At the close of the song, Ferrer was lifted onto the shoulders of her male dancers, delivering the spoken line \\"Coco-Dance\\" a cappella. The uncharacteristic style and performance (Monaco and France both being known for entering gentle ballads) was remarked upon by the BBC commentator immediately following the performance, who said \\" - Who knew Monaco was so versatile?\\"'' As Monaco had not competed in the final at the 2005 contest, the song was performed in the semi-final. Here, it was performed tenth (following Cyprus' Annette Artani with \\"Why Angels Cry\\" and preceding Macedonia's Elena Risteska with \\"Ninanajna\\").

Kath's appearance is notable; mostly her hair, a curly blonde perm. Kath is proud of her fashion sense, even though she favours an outdated 80s fashion style, including shoulder pads, high-waisted trousers, brightly patterned sweaters and oversize earrings. Her favourite singer is Barbra Striesand and her favourite song to dance to is Darren Hayes‚Äô Insistable. Personal outlook Kath is extremely proud of herself and her looks. She is confident with a positive outlook on life; in fact the opening scene of season one episode one features Kath reflecting on how proud she is of her looks and calls herself \\"high maintenance\\". She is exasperated by her daughter Kim, who by contrast is overweight, lazy and rude. She and her husband Kel like to think of themselves as being adventurous, they have a healthy and active sex life and both love dancing. Despite never having self image problems, Kath suffers occasional feelings of sadness for being four months older than husband Kel. Background and short story lines  Kath was born in 1954, and was married to Garry Poole. She lived in Fountain Lakes with Kim alone before meeting Kel. It was revealed that she was still married to Garry at the time, causing her worry she might get sent to prison for bigamy. They officially divorced and she married Kel again legally. Other than this, little is known about Kath's life although while sorting through old family pictures, Kath discovers that she is of Aboriginal descent, and this is proven by a DNA test. She is also of Manx and Chinese descent. She is primarily a housewife and doesn't have a full-time job although she did take Tafe courses in Real Estate as well as Yoga. She likes acting and appears in community theatre productions and a television commercial for adult nappies (causing sales to plummet). During the season finale, Kath & Kel make their house into a Bed and Breakfast named Kath & Kel's Kountry Kottage after they unsuccessfully attempt to buy their neighbour (and nemesis) Mandy's house next door. Kath is constantly frustrated by Kim and Brett's presence in her house after they move in during season two, and particularly after they turn the upstairs bathroom into a bedroom for Epponnee, forcing Kim and Brett to use Kath's ensuite. Kath is a strong supporter of the Richmond Tigers. Relationships Kim Kim Craig Kim Craig, played by Gina Riley is Kath's lazy, ignorant, rude and shallow twenty-seven-year-old daughter. Kim took large advantage of Kath growing up, due to the fact that they had no male figure and Kath's husband Gary Poole left them to fend for themselves. Kim continues to take advantage of Kath as an adult, living in her house, eating her food and messing it up (which Kath hates as she is a \\"Neat-Freak\\"). Kath often doesn't take Kim's life and her several problems seriously, such as her repeated marriage break-ups with Brett. Kath is exasperated by Kim's presence and often nags her to move out and be more responsible. A running gag in the show are unreturned DVDs that Kath keeps nagging to Kim to return (that eventually by the end of the series have run up $90,000 in fines). During the final season, Kim got to be such a bother to Kath & Kel that they try to purchase their next-door neighbour Mandy's house, but are unsuccessful when nobody buys their own house. Ultimately, Kath and Kim do have a close relationship, as seen by the end of each episode where they chat and gossip in the back garden. Kel Kel Knight Kel Knight Is Kath's metro husband, played by Glenn Robbins. Their relationship has always been fun, with the two \\"Oldies\\" feeling liberated. They married and moved in together. Kath and Kel have an almost picture-perfect marriage with relatively minor downfalls compared to Kim and Brett, such as the time when Kel took over duties as the house woman (cooking, cleaning and maintaining the house) which bothered Kath to the brink; also the fact that Kim hates Kel and has never accepted her mother getting married at fifty years old and having a life outside of hers. Sharon Sharon Strzelecki Sharon Strzelecki is Kim's second best friend. During the series Kath and Sharon like each other, Kath is usually the one standing up for Sharon when Kim throws a tantrum at Sharon (usually concerning food). The only time Kath is seen throwing a tantrum at Sharon is when her drink was spiked in the episode \\"Party\\". Brett Brett is Kath's son-in- law, during the series Brett is bombarded with Kath and Kel's sexual relationship (usually when they would just come back from a holiday). In the episode \\"Holiday\\" Brett and Kim plan a romantic trip to Queensland, however Brett ends up going to Queensland with Kath and Kel also Sharon, Brett eventually yells at Kath making her upset and their relationship is temporarily ruined, however after returning home they reinstate their relationship. Other relationships Kath is very much liked by Kim's husband, Brett Craig and Kim's second-best friend Sharon Strzelecki. Kath appears to be there for the two of them while Kim sits and watches Television or is obsessed with herself. Kath also provides advice to them, Sharon especially. Kath encouraged Sharon to chase her roots in the last season, which led her to meet her obnoxious (almost Kim's reflection) half sister Karen (played by Matt Lucas). Kath is also a loving grandmother to her beautiful infant granddaughter, Epponee Raye, there for her more than her own mother, Kim. Quirks, personality traits and features Kath has many different habits and mannerisms which have gained iconic status in Australian culture, particularly her idiomatic accent and frequent mispronunciations and malapropisms. Kath consistently makes references to her dozens of courses in TAFE during the series; these include cycling and tennis, real estate, floral design, interior design, and business studies. When Kim, Sharon, Kath or others are in a difficult situation, she will stop and say \\"look at me\\" with an exaggerated West Melbourne accent (\\"look at moi\\") and get everyone present to stare her in the eye. She will then go on to say \\"I've got one word to say to you\\", which will usually be followed with a comment of more than one word. When Kath and Kim (and often Sharon) see something they like or something out of the blue, they all murmur to each other \\"It's nice, It's different, It's unusual\\" all at the same time. These two running jokes are the taglines of the franchise, and are widely quoted in popular culture.

Discussions  The participants soon found substantial difficulties in formulating and reaching agreement on their fundamental propositions.

Villa Donn'Anna is a historic residence in Naples, Italy. It sits prominently at water's edge at the beginning of the Posillipo coast, just west of the Mergellina boat harbor. The building is on the site of the so-called \\"Rocks of the Siren\\" and, indeed, was originally called La Villa Sirena. History The original building on the site was probably built by one Dragonetto Bonifacio in the early 15th century. It changed hands a number of times and finally was inherited in 1630 by the woman whose name it now bears, Anna Carafa, duchess of Stigliano and wife of Ramiro N√∫√±ez de Guzm√°n, the Spanish Viceroy of Naples. She had the building redone by architect Cosimo Fanzago in the 1640s. The palace was purchased from the heirs of Anna Carafa by Teora Mirelli.Notizie del bello dell'antico e del curioso della citt√† di Napoli, Volume 5; by Carlo Cerano; Curated by Giovanni Battista Chiarini; Stamperia di Agostino di Pascale, Naples (1860); page 638. In the lore of the city of Naples, the villa is said to have been the site of various murders and other sordid episodes, at least some of which involved queen Joan I of Naples (1326‚Äì1382), daughter of Charles, Duke of Calabria, and/or Joan II (1373‚Äì1435). By the 19th century, the structure was already markedly dilapidated, as it remains to this day.Also Celano, page 639, in 1860 mentions similar rumors.

Along with co-star Jane Turner who plays Kim's onscreen mother Kath Day-Knight, Riley is the creator and writer of the series. Turner invented the character of Kim Craig during the nineties while performing on Australian sketch comedy shows such as Big Girl's Blouse. Kath & Kim first aired on 16 May 2002, and become a hit in Australia as well as internationally. The series ended in 2007. Riley returned to screens as Kim in the film version Kath & Kimderella, which premiered in cinemas in September 2012. Personality Physical appearance Kim is often portrayed as lazy and rude. She is often seen lying down most of the time, shopping or snacking. Kim often wears short T-shirts which allow her belly to show. Her fashion choices change frequently, at some points she wears comfortable clothing (e.g. baggy pants and a sweatshirt) and the rest of the time obsesses over herself in the mirror and talks about the latest fashion trends, which don't usually flatter her. Kim has long brown hair and always wears make-up. Kim smokes and can be seen in the pantry of their Fountain Lakes Home, scouring it for food (usually which Sharon ends up taking and Kim reacts). Kim is also seen reading Australian magazines such as New Idea and Famous. Personal outlook Kim's outlook on herself appears to vary. She has called herself a \\"Yummy Mummy!\\" and most of the time she refers to herself as a \\"horn-bag\\" and says that people would kill to be with \\"this\\" (referring to herself). However at other points in Kath & Kim she appears to be very unhappy with herself and self-conscious of her weight. This attitude contrasts with that of her mother, Kath, who is happy with her outward appearance and calls herself \\"high maintenance\\". Kim, like her mother, is currently unemployed and has a hard time trying to search for a job - let alone keep one, as illustrated by her constant hiring and firings from the call center. In the episode \\"The Moon\\", Kim's astrological sign is revealed to be Scorpio. Relationships Brett Brett, Kim's husband, is played by Peter Rowsthorn. They are newly married at the start of the series and Kim leaves him after a few months, claiming her marriage is \\"Over! O-V-A-H!\\". Their relationship can be very superficial. Brett obviously loves Kim and always tries to show her affection; Kim frequently rejects him and only seems to show affection when she wants something. Brett cheats on her numerous times. However, they always reconcile. In Da Kath & Kim Code, Brett cheats on Kim with his boss. Kim reacts badly for a few minutes but seems to not care later, accepting that her marriage was going nowhere. Brett's affair with his boss continues behind Kim's back. When Brett cheats on Kim with Kylie & Dannii Bolton in the episode \\"Sport\\", she reacts heavily and wants revenge on the twins. Kath Kath Day Kath Day-Knight, Kim's content fifty-year-old mother is played by Riley's co-star and creative Kath & Kim partner, Jane Turner. The relationship between the two is both good and bad. They often argue about various things, with Kath always referring to Kim as a \\"stupid girl\\". Growing up, Kim adopted a disrespectful attitude towards Kath, who was abandoned by Kim's father and Kath's ex-husband Gary Poole when Kim was baby. Despite this, Kim continues to take advantage of Kath. It appears she has no one else to go to besides Kath (and maybe her \\"second best friend\\", Sharon). Kim is always running back home to Kath and her new husband Kel, and lives with them by the end of the series. During the final season, Kim got to be such a bother to Kath and Kel that they opted to purchase their next-door- neighbour's mansion-like house, but were unsuccessful as no one auctioned to buy their own house. Sharon Sharon Strzelecki Sharon Strzelecki is played by popular Australian comedy actress Magda Szubanski who had previously acted in the international film Babe. Sharon is Kim's \\"second best friend\\". (Kim claims she has another best friend, \\"Tina\\" - who is subsequently never seen during the show.) Sharon and Kim are often seen \\"hanging out\\" together. Kim takes advantage of Sharon's friendship and willingness to do absolutely anything to help her. Kim shows little respect or affection for Sharon. When Sharon shares her desire to track down her mother in the episode \\"Roots\\", Kim laughs and retorts, \\"why would she want to meet you!\\". In the same episode, Sharon meets her overweight model sister, Karen (Matt Lucas), but Karen bonds with Kim instead of Sharon. Whenever Sharon is seen crying, Kim always makes a rude remark. For example, when Sharon finds out that her \\"fiancee\\" is really just spam on a computer in Da Kath & Kim Code, Kim says, \\"oh Sharon... I knew you would never get married, I just knew it.\\" Kim is exceptionally mean to Sharon, often zeroing in on her biggest insecurities such as her desperation to find a man, her weight, or her appearance - and then exploiting them. Despite the ups and downs, the two remain in an awkward and unequal friendship. After Sharon sleeps with Brett in the Season 4 finale \\"Lust\\", Kim tells Sharon that she's dropping her to sixth best friend. Kel Kel Knight Kel Knight, Kim's metrosexual stepfather, is played by Glenn Robbins. From the beginning of the series Kim has an instant dislike of Kel, perhaps because Kath & Kim had each other all of their lives without a father/husband figure in place. Kim insists that Kel is \\"using\\" Kath for manipulative reasons, however she is proven wrong. Kim and Kel rarely interact, and when they do, the mood is \\"off\\" and the scene is completely awkward - with one muttering a single word to the other, and the other either walking away or trying to put on a smile. Kel is now the focus of Kath's attention, and this annoys Kim because she likes to always be the centre of attention wherever she goes. Cujo Cujo is Brett's 75 kilo rottweiler. Kim has an intense dislike of Cujo and once bit her head for not getting off Kim's bed. Kim also once repeatedly tapped Cujo so she would jump off Epponnee's pram. Cujo hates Kim as well. In a Season 2 episode, Kim taps on the door and says to Cujo, \\"it's all right Cujo, it's just Kimmy\\". In response, Cujo starts barking until Brett tells her to be quiet. Education Due to Kim's lack of commitment, she has never actually completed any of her education, most notably her high school education. Fountain Lakes High Kim attended Fountain Lakes High, but dropped out in year 10. Cake decorating course She also started a cake decorating course, but didn't complete it. Kath finished her cake for her. Nail design course She also started a nail design course, but didn't complete it. Family Kim shows no appreciation to her family, often slandering them for their mishaps. Kim's family with Brett is very dysfunctional. Throughout her pregnancy they face many problems, most of which are their own creation, such as issues with renovating their house. The young couple, along with their daughter Epponnee Ray, always end up moving back with Kath and Kel despite the older couple understandably wanting their space. When Kim's father Gary Poole unexpectedly returns to Melbourne after 25 years in exile in Hong Kong, Kim unwisely loans him money for \\"ventures\\", ultimately causing her and Brett to lose their marital home to repossession. Kim tries to have Epponnee try out for the Australian Soap Neighbours, however Brett is against it - showing the couple's opposing values and life goals. During an episode which seems to take place in the future but is later revealed to be a dream, Kim and Brett have divorced, Brett has married Sharon, and Brett and Sharon have had triplets together. In that episode, Epponnee (played by Kylie Minogue for a one-off portrayal) is getting married and treats Sharon better than Kim. Elsewhere in the series, it was revealed that Brett and Sharon dated prior to Kim's relationship with Brett. As a mother Kim enjoys the idea of being a mother to Epponnee Ray, but does not show a lot of responsibility for her. Epponnee Ray is named after a dog (however, Kim says she'd already thought of this name and Kath \\"stole it\\"). Like most of her relationships, Kim lavishes affection on Epponnee Ray when she can be useful for something, such as Bubs Idol. On rare occasions, Kim will actually yell at the infant, telling her to stop crying so she could hear the television. Brett is seen giving more affection to their child and enjoys taking her to work, although he partially does this to help boost sales. Kath is also very good with Epponnee, taking care of her on occasions and creating a nursery for Epponnee just prior to her birth. Kim believes that Epponnee Rae will be her ticket to a brighter future and grooms her to be a performer, despite the fact that Epponnee Rae is not even 6 months old. She manages to find Epponnee a position on the Australian Soap Opera Neighbours, however the gig fails due to Epponnee vomiting on Harold Bishop. Quirks, personality traits and features Almost every character on the show has their own humorous features and Kim also has a few notable ones. One very recurrent reference; Kim makes to her \\"best friend\\" Tina. Tina is mentioned several times by Kim and Kath, being Kim's apparent best friend however has never been seen, and has always had problems and could never show up to Kim's important affairs. Kim does have weight issues, and acknowledges it on some occasions; but likes believes she is \\"foxy and trim\\". Kath usually tries to 'helpfully' point out when Kim is eating unhealthy food, which makes Kim more defensive than usual. Both Kim and Kath like to refer to themselves as \\"hornbags\\". Rude comebacks aimed Sharon are a large part of Kim's humour. Whenever there is a situation in which Sharon cries or breaks down; Kim makes it worse. An example is when Sharon cried about not having any love, Kim responds \\"I knew you would never get married... but the good news is I'm getting back with Brett,\\". Kim watches Big Brother Australia often and is glued to the television set, choosing to reprise her duties as a couch potato rather than her duties as a mother.

He died in Kensington, England, at age 16, the only grandson of Abraham Lincoln. Early life After President Lincoln's assassination, the former first family relocated to Chicago, Illinois, where Robert Todd Lincoln settled and married a U.S. senator's daughter, Mary Eunice Harlan. Abraham II was born in 1873, the second of three children, and was nicknamed \\"Jack\\". His appearance and temperament were much like those of the president's fourth son, Tad. When 8 years old, his family moved to Washington, D.C., while his father was Secretary of War for four years. In 1881, Jack befriended President Garfield's son Abram, who was a year older, and they often played at the White House. Jack's family returned to Chicago in 1885. Later life Abraham Lincoln II (top), with his sisters Mary \\"Mamie\\" Lincoln (left) and Jessie Harlan Lincoln (right) in 1889 At age 14 in October 1887, Lincoln unveiled Abraham Lincoln: The Man, an original well-received 12-foot bronze statue of his grandfather by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, at a dedication ceremony in Chicago's Lincoln Park. In 1889, President Benjamin Harrison appointed Robert Lincoln as Minister to the Court of St. James, and the Lincoln family moved to London. Jack was preparing for his Harvard University entrance examinations and went to Madam Passa‚Äôs school in Versailles to study French. While he was there, he had minor surgery to lance a carbuncle that had developed under his arm. The wound became infected, and Jack fell ill with blood poisoning. By mid-November 1889, his condition was critical, and the entire family moved to Versailles to be with him. Convinced that Jack would die if he remained in France, the family returned to London in January 1890, where Jack seemed to improve. Death Sarcophagus at Arlington National Cemetery in which Lincoln's and his parents' remains are interred Jack's improvement was short lived. His wound refused to heal. He became increasingly exhausted and weak. On March 5, 1890, 16-year-old Jack Lincoln died. His parents and sisters were devastated. Robert Lincoln wrote to friend John Hay, \\"Jack was to us all that any father and mother could wish and beyond that, he seemed to realize that he had special duties before him‚Ä¶. I did not realize until he was gone how deeply my thoughts of the future were in him.\\" To another friend, Robert admitted simply, \\"the loss is very hard to bear.\\" Robert accompanied his son's body to the United States, where Jack was buried in the Lincoln Tomb in Springfield, Illinois. In 1930, four years after Robert's death, Mary Harlan Lincoln had her son‚Äôs body moved to lie beside his father's in Arlington National Cemetery.

He had built many structures still seen in Bermuda today including many of the island's coastal fortresses and the State House, in St. George's, the oldest surviving English settlement in the New World (the State House, completed in 1620, was the first purpose-built building to house the Bermudian parliamentDelta Vacations). He also has the distinction of introducing the potato, the first seen in North America, to the early English colonists of Jamestown, Virginia. First serving in the service of the Earl of Warwick during his early sailing career, he was later appointed as governor of Bermuda, then administered by the Somers Isles Company (an offshoot of the Virginia Company), a post which he served from 1619 to 1622. During this time, he salvaged guns from a shipwrecked vessel and used them to arm the island forts then under construction including Southampton FortBermuda's British Army forts from 1609 and those of Smith's and Paget Island in 1620 (the incident would later be recorded by John Smith in 1624).Bermuda's History from 1500 to 1699 While Governor of Bermuda, he played an indirect role in the development of the Bermuda rig, when he employed a shipwrecked Dutch boat-builder.

While on a privateering expedition in mid-1639 along the Spanish Main, he successfully captured a Spanish frigate at the harbour of Trujillo, and was later paid 16,000 pesos in ransom. However, the frigate alone was considered a poor prize by the standards of the time and, suffering from inexperienced officers unfamiliar with the region (including future privateer James Riskinner), the expedition followed a very erratic course throughout the Caribbean and failed to capture anything else of value by the time of their return to Providence in September 1639.

Marie, Ontario. Its largest group of franchise operators is Dixie Lee Maritimes, based in New Brunswick with 38 locations in two provinces. The parent organization is the direct franchisor of ten restaurants in small-town Ontario. History The first Dixie Lee restaurant opened in 1964 in Belleville, Ontario. The first Dixie Lee restaurant in New Brunswick opened its door in Caraquet in a small take- out restaurant just past the wharf. It moved to a new location, following a fire during a winter storm, where is now situated Cin√©ma Vid√©o, not far from what was once the Enfant-J√©sus hospital and adjacent to the Petro-Canada gas station. It then moved to a bigger building in the mid-1990s, where the Trio- √âclatant's clothing store used to be. Other restaurants opened in Grande-Anse, Shippagan, Tracadie-Sheila and then in Lam√®que. The Tracadie-Sheila location is one of the biggest Dixie Lee restaurants in New-Brunswick, and one of the first to include a drive-through function.

By 1975, the chain claimed \\"over 101 fried chicken and seafood takeout stores in the U.S. and Canada\\" and was actively recruiting new franchisees through a U.S. office in Massena, New York.Lakeland Ledger - Google News Archive Search Many of these locations were existing restaurants under local branding who carried Dixie Lee chicken as a sideline.Advertisement for Mocambo Restaurant, 125 Bank, Ottawa-Centretown in 1971 promoting Dixie Lee chicken David Silvester started in the business in 1977 as an owner/operator of a single Dixie Lee outlet in Castlegar, British Columbia. He then acquired a Dixie Lee area franchise for British Columbia where he opened and sold 17 franchises. After developing British Columbia, he bought the Dixie Lee franchise parent company in 1979. Silvester moved to Dixie Lee's Head Office in Belleville. He was responsible for developing Dixie Lee from eight outlets in Ontario to more than 50 by 1987; he sold the company in January 2006. In 2006, the chain claimed to be the fourth largest chicken franchise company in Canada with sales in excess of $55 million per year from over 77 restaurants in operation in Canada and the United States. Dixie Lee restaurants were located in Ontario (25 outlets), New Brunswick, British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec. In 2006, Joe Murano assumed the management of the company as a president. His previous franchise experience is with Kingston local chains Bandito Video (now defunct) and Papa Pete's pizza.https://media.marketwire.com/attachments/200801/398115_DLII- Reovestreport.final.pdf The corporate head office was located in Napanee, Ontario and the company listed by OTC Markets Group as over-the-counter stock Dixie Lee International Industries, Inc (Pink Sheets: DLII). In January 2006, as Joe Murrano took corporate ownership, by June 2006, Maria Struik and John Struik became entangled in a legal battle with the new corporate owner. In May 2008, John became suddenly ill and was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer; he died in June 2008. Although Maria had always been involved in the business, it was more in a supporting role. After John's death, she honored his previous agreement with Dixie Lee. The legal battle ended in September 2011; however she was left with many ongoing leases. Dixie Lee Food Systems refused to assume these leases, even at no cost, which forced Mrs. Struik to start her own business in the hospitality industry. With the vesting of all of the Dixie Lee franchisor's rights for the Northern Ontario area, Mrs. Struik is now in charge of eight units in the area. The Dixie Lee units affected by the court order were: Dixie Lee Spanish, Dixie Lee Garson, Dixie Lee Penetanguishene, Dixie Lee Bancroft and Dixie Lee Barry's Bay. Mrs. Struik was forced to seek the help of the legal system, when, on November 5, 2012, she received communication from the president and owner of Dixie Lee Food System, Mr. Murano, stating that he had suspended the payments due to her under their 2011 Settlement agreement. Mrs. Struik had sold her area-franchise interest in the Northern Ontario area back to Dixie Lee Food Systems Ltd., a company controlled by Mr. Murano. After Murano defaulted, a court order was handed down on January 22, 2013, which transferred all rights of the franchisor to Mrs. Struik. Dixie Lee International  One branch opened in Dubai, United Arab Emirates in 2008 but is now closed. A Kiev, Ukraine location operated briefly in 2008 with plans to establish five restaurants in that country. Expansion to Manchester, UK was also attempted; the chain predicted locations in China and India would be in operation by the end of 2008. In 2012, an expansion was attempted into Jamaica.

He determined that the Earth is not perfectly spherical but is oblate, i.e. flattened at the poles. Juan also successfully measured the heights of the mountains of the Andes using a barometer. Family and education Jorge Juan was born on the estate El Fondonet, the property of his grandfather don Cipriano Juan Vergara in Novelda, Alicante, Spain. He was baptised in the Church at Monforte del Cid. Juan was born of two distinguished families: his father was don Bernardo Juan y Canicia who came from the branch of the Counts of Pe√±alba, and his mother was do√±a Violante Santacilia y Soler de Cornell√°, who came from prominent land-owning family in Elche. Both of his parents were widowed and remarried. They lived in their house on the Plaza del Mar in Alicante and only vacationed in Novelda. His father died when Juan was only three years old and he grew under the care of the Jesuits of the Jesuit school in Alicante. His uncle don Antonio Juan, a Canon at the Collegiate Church took charge of young Jorge and continued his education. Later another uncle, don Cipriano Juan, a Knight of the Order of Malta, took charge of his education and sent him to Zaragoza for a preparatory education for higher studies. At the age of 12, he was sent to Malta to receive Holy Orders at the Order of Malta. The next year he became page to the Grand Master don Antonio Manuel de Villena, who granted him the title of Commander of Aliaga in Arag√≥n. Thus, he received his first title when he was only 14. Soon, he became a Knight of the Order of Malta, which implied lifelong celibacy. In 1729, when he was 16, he returned to Spain and applied for entry to the Royal Company of Marine Guards, the Spanish military school for naval officers. He entered the academy in 1730 and studied modern technical and scientific studies subjects such as geometry, trigonometry, astronomy, navigation, hydrography, and cartography. He also completed his education in the humanities with classes in drawing, music, and dancing. He earned the reputation of being an outstanding student and his fellow students called him Euclid. He finished his studies at the academy in 1734. At the young age of 22, he was given command of a corvette and he participated in the expedition against Oran and the campaign of Naples. Career Mitad del Mundo, Ecuador In 1734, King Philip V of Spain asked Jorge Juan and fellow scientist Antonio de Ulloa to join the French Geodesic Mission organized by the French Academy of Sciences from Paris, under command of the astronomer Louis Godin, and fellow geographers Charles Marie de La Condamine and Pierre Bouguer. The mission was to measure the length of a degree of meridian arc at the Equator in South America and to determine the roundness of the Earth. On 26 May 1735, they left Cadiz in the company of the Marquess of Villagarc√≠a, who had just been appointed Viceroy of Peru. Jorge Juan was on board the ship El Conquistador and Antonio de Ulloa on the frigate Incendio. The expedition traveled to Quito, in present-day Ecuador, and after nine years of careful study, determined that the Earth is not perfectly spherical but is oblate, i.e. flattened at the poles. Juan also successfully measured the heights of the mountains of the Andes using a barometer. Juan remained nine years in America, studying the political and social situation of the Spanish territories. Among other things, he observed a new metal the miners called Platina de Pinto (little silver of the Pinto river). On his return to Spain, King Ferdinand promoted him to captain. For their work and discoveries in Peru, both he and de Ulloa were elected Fellows of the Royal Society, Juan y Santacilia in 1749. The Marques de la Ensenada ordered Juan to travel to England secretly to study new naval construction methods and armament of the British. In 1749, he travelled incognito under the name of Mr. Josues and learned all that he could in England (writing back in a numerical cipher), and brought back 50 British naval constructors. In an ironic twist, many of them (including Matthew Mullan and Richard Rooth) went on to build the Spanish ships that would later fight in the American Revolutionary War and the battle of Trafalgar. He was, however, disappointed with the English naval construction methods and upon his return to Spain in 1750, he was placed in charge of Spanish naval construction, creating his own naval construction system (approved in 1752) and improving the shipyards (such as the ones in Cartagena, C√°diz, Ferrol, Havana) and armaments. He implemented modern industrial division of labor among the different disciplines involved in naval construction such as dry-docks, shipyards, furnaces, rigging, and canvas manufacturing. In 1757, he founded the Royal Astronomical Observatory of Madrid (Real Observatorio de Madrid). He died in Madrid in 1773 at the age of 60. His reported symptoms, including muscle stiffness and seizures, were almost certainly the result of a cerebral amebic infection. He was buried in the church of San Mart√≠n.

It remains a ruin. It is between the villages of Outrem√©court and Soulaucourt-sur-Mouzon (Haute- Marne), west of Neufch√¢teau, Vosges.  History  The citadel was founded in 1258 and soon became a key commercial town of 2,000 inhabitants. In the 17th century, the Duke of Lorraine Charles IV lost all his possessions to cardinal Richelieu except La Mothe. In 1634, the citadel withstood a siege of 141 days before it surrendered on 26 July 1634. A map of la Mothe during its siege of 1645 La Mothe was given back to the Duke in 1641. It was besieged three more times: 25 July - 30 August 1642, December 1642 - May 1643 and the last, begun by Mazarin, on 4 December 1644. After 205 days of resistance the city surrendered on 1 July 1645. Contrary to the agreement, Mazarin destroyed not only the fortifications, but the entire city. This period was always a painful memory in Lorraine. French authorities, conscious of this, divided as France into its departments so that La Mothe forms a projection of Haute-Marne. This removed a brusque reminder of French triumph from Lorraine. The ruins were classified as an \\"historical monument\\" in 1923 and large-scale restoration work was undertaken.

Like Physalis, the species belongs to tribe Physaleae of the Solanaceae, but (within that tribe) to subtribe Withaninae, not Physalinae. The plant was long thought to be extinct but a small population was discovered in 1998 by Stedson Stroud. As of 2011, it was considered \\"effectively extinct in the wild\\" by experts at Kew Botanical Garden because there were no longer any flowering plants left in the wild. Only one adult plant was left by 2010, and it was under extreme stress due to drought and pests. That plant died, but some seedlings sprouted from 2011 rains.

Originally a King County park, it was given to the newly incorporated city of Burien in 1996. The beach is about long, and the upper part of the beach has been made into a sea wall.  Geology  The western border of the park is a beach on Puget Sound. At the eastern edge of the park the elevation is as high as . The beach is undergoing a restoration to a more natural state, the biggest part of which is removing a 35-year-old seawall and replacing it with a sloping beach. There are two primary streams in the park one on the south end and one on the north. Between the streams a steep slope runs along the shore just above the beach. The north creek basin contains a large wetland area that extends back from the beach nearly to the eastern border of the park in some places. Many of the slopes in Seahurst Park are considered unstable and there is historical evidence of numerous landslides in some areas. The park also has many springs.For detailed Geologic information see Appendix B-Part 1 of the Seahurst Park Master Plan from the City of Burien.  Wildlife  Great Blue Heron at Seahurst Park Seahurst Park is home to a wide variety of wildlife. Eagles, Herons, woodpeckers, owls, pheasants, raccoons, and the usual host of seabirds and marine creatures are all regularly seen or heard in the park. There is a salmon hatchery in the Park, but no natural salmon run, the returning salmon are used as the source for the next batch of salmon to be released. The hatchery and related Marine Technology Lab is operated by several local school districts as an educational facility. Seahurst Park is designated a Marine Reserve Area by the City of Burien in order to protect marine creatures along the shore. In a 1997 assessment of beaches in the King County region, Seahurst Park had the second fewest clams per square foot, and the smallest average size among the surveyed beaches. In 2004 a major beach habitat rehabilitation project began at Seahurst Park so those numbers may have improved by now. No current study is available for comparison.  History  Created in 1975, Seahurst Park was under the management of the King County Department of Natural Resources and Parks until 1996, when it was ceded to the new city of Burien. The park is also referred to as Ed Munro Park or Ed Munro Seahurst Park, in honor of the Washington state legislator who played a key role in its creation.Seahurst Park History Webpage  Modern  The seawall in the park (which was built in 1972) is deteriorating and has changed the environment on the beach. Large logs and native vegetation had been added to the upper beach to both make it look natural and limit access to the beach. A Beach Habitat Restoration project started in 2004 that has already removed 1/3 of the seawall and restored a more natural beach on the southern end of the park. The northern portion started in September 2013 and concluded in the Summer of 2014. During this time, the city has also acquired a parcel on the southern edge of the park and added it to the system. In addition to the beach restoration some work was done on removing invasive plant species, trails were improved and facilities were upgraded.

Robinson Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes pg 69 Oxford University Press 1996 The grape is also featured in red blends from several vin de pays regions in the south west with significant plantings coming from the Aveyron department. J. Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 205 Mitchell Beazley 1986 According to wine expert Oz Clarke, wine made from Fer is often characterized by its perfumed aromas of currants and red fruit, soft tannins, and concentration in fruit. Oz Clarke & M. Rand Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 89 Webster International Publishers The grape is not related to the clone of Malbec known as Fer that is widely planted throughout Argentina. The name Fer is French for iron (Latin Ferrum), a reference to the very hard and \\"iron-like\\" wood of the vine's above ground canopy.Wine Pros \\"Fer entry \\" Oxford Companion to Wine, Accessed: February 14th, 2011Les Caves de Pyrene \\"Grape Varieties \\" Accessed: February 14th, 2011 Because of this very hard wood stock, the vine can be difficult to prune and trellis. History The very hard wood stock of the Fer's grapevine gave rise to the grape's name from the French and Latin names for iron. Fer has a long tradition in the southwestern wine regions of France and is possibly indigenous to the area. For centuries many of the full-bodied red wines of the many wine-producing communes often included some percentage of Fer in the blend. The grape was prized for the color and concentration it added even though viticulture and cultivation could be difficult due to its extremely hard wood stock. Though the grape developed numerous synonyms throughout the region, the \\"iron-like\\" hardness of the vine's wood gave rise to its primary name, Fer, which is also the French word for iron.  Wine regions  In the Gaillac wine region (pictured) of the Tarn department, Fer is also known as Brocol and Braucol While plantings of Fer can be found through southwest France, the grape is most widely planted in the Aveyron department where it is featured in the wines of Marcillac, Entraygues and Estaing where the grape is also known as Mansois. In Madiran and B√©arn, Fer is also as known Pinenc and while once more prominently utilized, now is usually only a complementary player to Tannat, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. In the Tarn department, it can be found in the AOC wines of Gaillac where it known under the old synonyms of Brocol and Braucol. Other AOC wines that include Fer among their permitted varieties is Cabard√®s in the Languedoc-Roussillon wine region and Bergerac in the Dordogne which is essentially the northernmost reach of the grape. Outside France growers in Argentina thought that they had plantings of Fer under cultivation but in the late 20th century it was discovered that the 3,700 acres (1,700 hectares) of the vine was actually a clone of Malbec which, though a French grape itself, has no known relation to Fer.  Wine styles  Grape leaf of the Fer vine in autumn. Wine expert Jancis Robinson describes the wines made from Fer as \\"interestingly perfumed\\" with a rhubarb aroma note. Typically the wines are often full-bodied with dark ruby colors and concentrated fruit flavors. Robinson notes that the predominantly Fer composed wines of Marcillac can be tannic and rustic with smokey aromas.  Synonyms  Over the years Fer and its wines have been known under various synonyms including Arech, Arrouya, Bequignaou, B√©quignol, Bois droit, Braucol, Brocol, Caillaba, Camarouge, Camirouch, Chalamoncet, Chalosse noir, Chausset, Couahort, Cruchenit, Estronc, Estrong, Fer bequignaou, Fer Noir, Ferre, Folle Rouge, Here, Herrant, Herre, Mances, Mansoi, Mansois, Mauran, Moura, Mourach, Noir brun, Panereuil, Petit Fer, Petit here, Petit Mourastel, Petite here, Piec, Piek, Pienc, Pinenc, Plant de fer, Queufort, Salebourg, Saoubade, Saumances, Saumansois, Saumences, Scarcit, Veron and Verron.Fer , Vitis International Variety Catalogue, Accessed: February 14th, 2011  References  Category:Red wine grape varieties ","title":"Fer"},{"id":"8126599","text":"Brett Dean Craig is a fictional character on the Australian comedy television series, Kath & Kim.

After training as an engineer, and serving as an officer in the Royal Engineers, he was appointed as government surveyor in St Helena from 1860 to 1871. In 1871, because of government cutbacks, he was made redundant and returned to London, where he subsequently formed the firm of J.C. Melliss and Co. In 1875, he published the book for which he is best known: St. Helena: A Physical, Historical and Topographical Description of the Island, Including the Geology, Fauna, Flora and Meteorology. Joseph Dalton Hooker named the genus Mellissia in his honour. To commemorate the book's centenary in 1975, the St. Helena Post Office published a series of stamps.

He is most noted for gaining federal recognition for the Venetie Indian Reserve in 1941, then the largest reservation in Alaska, and containing approximately 1.4 million acres (5,700 km¬≤). This was before Alaska was admitted as a state. As a youth, Fredson had taken part in Hudson Stuck's expedition to climb Denali, and served as base camp manager. Afterward Stuck sponsored him for college, and he attended Sewanee, The University of the South, becoming the first Alaska Native to graduate from college. Fredson returned to Alaska, where he worked in a hospital and as a teacher, becoming a leader and political activist. Early life and education Born in 1896 to a Gwich'in family near Table Mountain in what is now designated as Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska, John Fredson grew up speaking Gwich'in as his first language. Orphaned at a young age, he attended a mission school operated by the Episcopal Church of the United States, where he learned English. From an early age, he became highly skilled in following trails, climbing and hunting. At the age of 16, Fredson was part of the 1913 climbing expedition of Hudson Stuck, Episcopal Archdeacon of the Yukon, who led the party that ascended Denali, the highest peak in North America. Fredson was the base camp manager. His role is documented in Stuck's book, Ascent of Denali (reprint 2005). Fredson stayed at base camp for 31 days by himself, hunting caribou and Dall sheep, while awaiting the return of the climbing party. He saved his ration of sugar for their return. With Stuck's encouragement, Fredson gained more formal education, becoming the first native of Athabascan descent to complete high school.Clara Childs Mackenzie, Wolf Smeller: A Biography of John Fredson, Native Alaskan, Alaska Pacific University, 1985 He attended Sewanee, The University of the South, an Episcopal college in Middle Tennessee, and was the first Alaska Native to graduate from a university. While there, Fredson worked with Edward Sapir, a noted linguist, and helped to classify Gwich'in within the Na-Dene language family. This work is documented in the book John Fredson Edward Sapir Ha'a Googwandak (1982), a collection of stories that Fredson told to Sapir. His work on communicating Gwich'in concepts of space and time may have also influenced Sapir's later work that established the Sapir‚ÄìWhorf hypothesis. Life's work After his return to Alaska, Fredson worked at a hospital in Fort Yukon. In his later years, Fredson built a solarium for tuberculosis patients at the hospital. Then the only hospital in the far north, the facility was often overwhelmed by Alaska Native patients, primarily Gwich‚Äôin. They needed treatment for Eurasian infectious diseases, to which they had no immunity. Fredson taught school in the village of Venetie, and taught the community how to grow gardens. He was assisted by Chief Johnny Frank, a notable medicine man and storyteller among the Gwich'in. The chief's exploits are recounted in the book Neerihiinjik: We Traveled From Place to Place (2012). Fredson became a tribal leader, working to re-establish his people's rights to their traditional lands. He was the primary founder of the Venetie Indian Reserve, the largest reservation in Alaska. It achieved federal recognition in 1941, before Alaska was admitted as a state. The Reserve was approximately 1.4 million acres (5,700 km¬≤) when it was established. Family life John married Jean Ribaloff, a woman whom he met while at the hospital in Fort Yukon. They had three children, William Burke Fredson, Virginia Fredson (Dows), Lula Fredson (Young). Fredson died of pneumonia at about age 49 on August 22, 1945.

It consists of of which are publicly accessible, and is bounded by Dandenong Creek, Boronia Road, EastLink, Mountain Highway and Burwood Highway in a clockwise direction. It is managed primarily by VicRoads and Parks Victoria. The park opened in December 1981, and its land was previously used for cattle grazing and apple orchards. The surrounding area is still used for grazing. There are three major power transmission lines running through the park: Rowville-Templestowe Single Circuit Southern (1st and 2nd), and Rowville-Ringwood. In 2019, a study found that Koomba Park was one of the least used areas of the Dandenong Valley Parklands, and also garnered the least satisfaction from park users when compared to Jells Park and Tirhatuan Park. Ecology The park forms part of the wildlife corridor of Dandenong Creek, and contains a large amount of riparian forest, as well as wetlands and swamps and some areas of indigenous revegetation. Common mammals in the park include various species of bats, possums, and sugar gliders. There is a bird hide adjacent to one of the ponds, from which many species of native birds are observable. The park also provides habitat to a variety of indigenous plant species, many of which are threatened or endangered. Koomba Park has several man-made water bodies, and is classified in the Urban Floodway Zone since it is prone to inundation. Paths and trails Cycle paths Both Dandenong Creek Trail and EastLink Trail run through the park on the primary north‚Äîsouth concrete path, before the trails split near the southern car park. All trails were originally of fine crushed gravel, but in mid-late 2007, the existing Dandenong Creek Trail was upgraded to 3 metre wide concrete from Boronia Road south to the former toilet block as part of the construction of EastLink. A new path of the same standard was constructed which leads further south to the Mountain Highway intersection with Burwood Highway, which forms part of the EastLink Trail, opened in mid 2008. The primary path exit at the north of the park leads under Boronia Road and continues to run alongside the Dandenong Creek while the southern path (the EastLink Trail) leads further along EastLink to the south and the south west path (the Dandenong Creek Trail) crosses the Dandenong Creek and meets the Burwood Highway in Vermont South, with this link being constructed as a raised boardwalk and opened in 1997. Koomba Park constitutes part of the Opperman Trails, a tribute to cyclist Sir Hubert Opperman. The Lands End Trail is signposted through the park, including an information board about Opperman. Walking paths There are also a series of official fine course gravel criss-crossing paths which are located in the park designed for walkers, although can be used by cyclists. These paths are usually very poorly maintained, with sections bumpy, narrow and even impassable due to overgrowth and fallen trees. A number of unofficial paths have also been created by visitors in the park. Facilities Koommba Park has a large carpark at the southern end, on a service road off Burwood Highway, which is shared with Wantirna Reserve. There is another smaller carpark at the northern end off Boronia Road. A joint picnic shelter and toilet block (which was originally a sports pavilion) existed in the park for some time, but was demolished in mid 2008 due to numerous crime incidents . Electric barbecues were also removed at the same time. Information boards are located at the north and south pedestrian entrances to the park. A drinking fountain is also located at the junction of Dandenong Creek Trail and EastLink Trail. Wantirna Reserve The adjoining Wantirna Reserve, managed by Knox City Council and located at the southern end of the park, features a sporting oval with an adjacent clubhouse and cricket nets which caters for Australian rules football and cricket. The reserve also contains the Wantirna Tennis Club, as well as a scout hall and playground. All facilities are accessed by dirt roads with parking areas provided. The Victorian Jazz Archive is also located on the left side of the southern entrance to Koomba Park. Incidents The park is known by locals and the police to be a meeting point for drug deals and gay sex, due to its remoteness from residential areas and densely wooded forests, especially at night. There have been several attempts to decrease criminal activity in the park, including regular patrolling. In 2006, the male toilets were permanently closed in a bid to curb gay sex meetings. In late 2008, the entire toilet block/picnic shelter was demolished in a further effort. On 7 May 2010 at approximately 1 am, a drug deal in the park lead to the stabbing murder of a 41-year-old man from Dandenong. In 2010, a 50-year-old man fell from an elevated boardwalk in Koomba Park whilst cycling, suffering fatal injuries.

Two years after the complex opened, its owners were asked by Pinellas County officials to pay for road improvements necessitated by mall traffic. Original tenants included TJ Maxx and Bealls. Although the mall was foreclosed on in 1997, a Ross Dress for Less store was added the same year. By early 2005, the complex was almost entirely vacant and slated for redevelopment. In 2005, Wal- Mart announced that it would buy the mall and replace it with a supercenter, but the plan to buy the mall fell through. The property was purchased by developer Boulder Venture South LLC for $26 million in May 2005. At the time, only seven stores operated in it. It officially closed its doors in August 2005, and has been demolished, with part of the property now occupied by a strip mall and a Cheddar's Casual Caf√©.

Like many of Anthony's other fictional works, it explores themes of violence, the abuse of power, sexism and male dominance, gender roles, the environment, integrity and personal honor, sapient animal life, parallel and alternative evolution, space travel, alternate dimensions, paradox, obscure concepts in physics and mathematics, sexual assault and abuse, child and adolescent sexuality, and suicide. Though initially marketed as fantasy, the Mode series is similar to the Incarnations of Immortality and the Apprentice Adept series, blending fantasy and science fiction. Mode theory Mode, in the series, is another word for \\"reality\\" or \\"universe.\\" The philosophy is heavily inspired by eastern philosophies. The Virtual Mode is like a three-dimensional plane that cuts across many realities. It requires five points, represented both by anchor modes and anchor persons, to hold it in place. When someone hears the call of the Virtual Mode, he may reach out with his mind and set his anchor point, thereby becoming an anchor person. When two or more persons act in tandem to attach the Virtual Mode, both will become anchors. Only anchor persons may travel freely on the Virtual Mode; other travelers must remain in contact with the anchors lest they become lost in one of the non-anchor modes. In addition, only objects from anchor modes may be transported on the Virtual Mode; any other materials will remain in their mode of origin. Once the anchor point is fixed, mode travelers may step in and out of the Virtual Mode at that point, thereby being able to interact fully in the anchor reality. Anchor persons may only travel ten feet across non-anchor modes before crossing the border into the next reality. Though each mode is only ten feet deep, it is infinitely wide; anchor persons may travel as far as they like to the side as long as they don't cross the border. Each reality is like an individual sheet of mica, and when each individual plane is placed next to others, together they form the whole Virtual Mode. Each mode has its own rules which determine which aspects of science and magic will work there. Only the death or purposeful release of an anchor person can free an anchor point. When that happens, the Virtual Mode is unstable until another person invokes their anchor. Few people are able to sense the Virtual Mode; only those who can may become anchor persons. In the series, those who invoke the Virtual Mode are typically individuals who have some great need for change in, or escape from, their current situation that only access to the Virtual Mode will provide. In addition, the Chip that invokes the Virtual Mode has different settings which determine the realities that will be included in any given Virtual Mode. Though it can be set to include only modes populated by human beings, the Virtual Mode in the novels is set instead to include sapience of any type, including non-living beings such as machines. Novels Virtual Mode Colene, who appears to be bright and popular at school, secretly flirts with suicide and cutting herself for emotional release. Her death wish prompts her to approach a strange man that she finds in a ditch on her way home from school, and her relationship with Darius begins. Darius and Colene rapidly fall in love, but he regretfully leaves her when she cannot bring herself to accept that he is from a magical reality. After his departure, Colene realizes he was telling the truth, and, in despair, she prepares to commit suicide. Back in his own mode, Darius realizes that he loves Colene too much to give her up. He therefore uses a magical device called the Chip to create a Virtual Mode so he can travel back to Colene. Colene quickly seizes the opportunity to become an anchor person and sets out along her side of the Virtual Mode. On her way, she befriends Seqiro, a telepathic stallion and, to Colene's joy and surprise, another anchor. As Sequiro joins her in traveling the Virtual Mode, she opens up to him and reveals the source of her depressive and suicidal nature; she had been raped at a party by several older boys but did not report the incident out of fear of humiliation and because she had become drunk during the party. The two make rapid progress towards Darius' mode until they are unexpectedly trapped in DoOon, home mode of the emperor Ddwng, who is the anchor for his world. Forced to suffer captivity thinly veiled as hospitality, Colene and Seqiro must wait for Darius to arrive. Meanwhile, Darius has encountered another anchor‚ÄîProvos, a strange older woman, while traveling toward Colene. Able to remember the future, she is able to help him avoid or defeat many hazards on the Virtual Mode. Eventually, they reach a series of beacons, which they follow to DoOon. Darius and Colene reunite, but are almost immediately separated. Ddwng, who wants to coerce Darius into giving him the Chip, assesses his personality by sending him on a mission to another planet. Though Darius is reluctant to accede to the emperor's request, Ddwng threatens Colene and Darius finally agrees. Though Darius considers his promise binding, Colene prompts Seqiro to use his telepathy to trick Ddwng into freeing his anchor. He does, and Colene, Darius, Seqiro, and Provos slide through the modes to the new anchor, Oria. Fractal Mode Nona is the woman ordained to bring the anima, the force of female magic, to her home planet of Oria, which is part of a fractal universe. In order to summon the Megaplayers, a group of musical giants, to help her, she dances by a sea cliff and unwittingly becomes the new anchor person. After Colene, Darius, Seqiro, and Provos arrive in Julia Mode, Nona and her friend Stave prompt them to report to the nearest despot castle. Though the despots attempt to discredit Darius, rape Colene, and steal Seqiro, the four companions escape captivity and rejoin Nona and Stave. They help Nona travel to Jupiter, where she again seeks the Megaplayers. Angus, a native of Jupiter, advises Nona on how to bring the anima and ferries the party back to Oria. Nona, who must stand on a specific rad to summon the magic of the anima, has no idea how find the correct one. Colene and Provos travel back to Earth in order to learn enough nomenclature to allow Colene to help Nona number the rads. While in the Earth mode, Colene rescues an abused girl, Esta, and her uncle, Slick, from a life of crime and despair. Though Slick and Esta plan to flee the country together, a police pursuit forces them to seek refuge on the Virtual Mode. Meanwhile, Darius, Seqiro, Nona, and Stave have been forced to hide from the despots in the underwater caves of the rabble, a community of quasi-humans who are able to transform their bodies. Though the rabble initially plan to force all four companions to remain until they breed with one thousand rabble each, they agree to free Darius, Seqiro, and Nona if Stave will remain for four thousand breedings. Nona promises to allow four thousand rabble to live on the surface after she brings the anima, whereupon they will release Stave. Colene and her companions return to Oria and reunite with the rest of the anchor persons. Colene helps Nona find the correct rad while the others distract the despots, and Nona successfully invokes the anima, shifting the magic of Oria to favor women. Nona joins the party on the Virtual Mode, and they return to Provos' anchor, where Provos plans to adopt Slick and Esta as son and granddaughter. Provos releases her anchor, and Colene, Darius, Seqiro, and Nona slide through the Virtual Mode to the newest anchor, Shale. Chaos Mode Burgess, a hiver, acted as a diplomat to other hives. After he contacted a hive which suffered from the mental disease of bigotry, his own hive cast him out and forced him to flee across the plains. Bereft of his community, he eagerly becomes an anchor person and joins the companions of the Virtual Mode. Colene, Darius, Seqiro, and Nona are initially concerned that the new anchor person may be an alien monster, but Seqiro soon helps Nona to establish mental contact, and their fears are allayed. Colene soon realizes that this reality is the product of Earth's alternative evolution, and she names the mode Shale and the new anchor Burgess. Though the party plans to continue traveling the Virtual Mode, Colene is soon pursued by the mind predator which once attacked Provos. The anchor persons, attacked by the hivers near the anchor point, are forced to spend several days in Shale. While there, each of the humans learns to relate to Burgess, and Burgess declares the strange group to be his new hive. Though the companions encounter many hostile native creatures, they are eventually able to reach the anchor point and return to the Virtual Mode. As the companions approach the Julia mode, the mind predator returns and attacks Colene. Only Burgess seems able to mitigate the effect, so he carries Colene while the pursuit continues. The party, once again forced to wait in an anchor mode, soon discovers that Oria is in a martial state due to the lack of strong magical leadership. Because Nona doesn't want to remain and become queen, she enlists Angus' help to recruit Amazons from a slightly larger anima world to become regents on Oria. Afterwards, Nona feels free to return to the Virtual Mode with the others. As they travel toward Earth, Burgess' health begins to fail, and the anchor persons plan to spend some time in the Earth mode while he recuperates. Colene and Nona enlist the help of Amos Forell to cure Burgess' malady, which turns out to be a magnesium deficiency. In order to repay Amos, Darius and Seqiro help a troubled boy by spreading his despair to his unsympathetic community. While in the bad part of town, they are also able to seek revenge on the group of delinquents who mugged Darius in the first novel, as well as the boys who raped Colene. Colene reconciles with her parents, who agree to allow her to marry Darius, but she misses her own wedding while tiding Burgess through a bad reaction. Nona, however, acts as Colene's proxy, so Darius and Colene do become legally married on Earth. While passing through the modes of the telepathic animals, Colene is once again attacked by the mind predator. The companions, forced to seek refuge in Seqiro's mode, discover a mare who has been mind-blasted, telepathically attacked and stripped of her memories. Colene heals the mare by imprinting her with the character of her imaginary friend, Maresy Doats. After defeating his rival Koturo, Seqiro becomes herd stallion. Though he would prefer to remain on the Virtual Mode, Seqiro is forced to free his anchor to relieve Colene of the mind predator's pursuit. Colene, Darius, Nona, and Burgess slide through the modes until they reach the newest anchor mode, DoOon. DoOon Mode Because the Feline trio of Tom, Cat, and Pussy are in disgrace, they enter a dangerous contest to regain their social status. After the Felines and their Caprine companions win the competition, a no-holds-barred game of capture the flag, they are educated about Colene and Darius and trained to become the next mode anchors. The six nulls, along with four unknown individuals, become co- anchors as soon as Seqiro frees his anchor, and Colene, Darius, Nona, and Burgess are immediately captured by Ddwng. The companions are taken to the primitive planet Chains, where they are forced to remain until Darius agrees to give the Chip to Ddwng. While there, Burgess and the humans form close bonds with the Felines and with Doe, the Caprine female. Colene persuades the predatory dragons of the world to prey on rats instead of nulls, and Darius agrees to give Ddwng the Chip in return for the continued safety of Chains and its inhabitants. Once on the Virtual Mode, the party attempts to evade the pursuit of the four unknown anchor persons. Colene regains mental contact with Seqiro, but the mind predator soon finds her, and the group must return to Earth. When Colene discovers her mother Morna is the victim of hallucinations brought on by improper medical treatment, she and her companions force the insurance representative to approve RTMS, an experimental treatment, to cure Colene's and Morna's depression. Nona, Burgess, and Tom repay Amos Forell for his financial help by giving him one of Tom's alien germs to claim as a scientific discovery. Colene returns after one week of her two-week treatment, and the anchor persons return to the Virtual Mode. Unfortunately, the mind predator soon finds Colene, and the companions attempt to wait it out by staying in Oria. Though one of the regents tries to persuade Nona to stay and become queen, she is unwilling to leave the Virtual Mode. The mind predator remains tenacious, however, and Nona is forced to free her anchor. Nona, who has been engaging in sexual intercourse with Tom, asks him to stay in Julia mode and marry her. Tom loves Nona and realizes his trio is facing destruction anyway, so he agrees. As soon as Nona frees her anchor, Seqiro and Maresy become co-anchors. Colene, Darius, Burgess, Cat, and Pussy slide to the Horse Mode, where the horses join the party. After passing through several more modes, one of which is or resembles Xanth, the companions finally arrive at Darius' home mode. Burgess and the horses settle comfortably on a pasture dais and Colene and Pussy join Darius' household. After obtaining the Chip, Cat returns to DoOon to discharge his commitment, and Darius shuts down the Virtual Mode. Though Cat is honest, Ddwng suspects treachery and plans to torture it. Cat uses its link to Seqiro and the Key it has secretly swallowed to rescue Doe from Chains, though her trio is destroyed. After transporting back to Darius' mode, Cat and Doe recover, and the Felines adopt Doe as the third member of their new trio. Though Colene and Darius are married and home at last, Colene remains unable to perform sexually. Pussy convinces Colene to face the mind predator in order to come to terms with her worst fears. After an intense psychological battle, Colene defeats the mind predator, and she is finally healed. Anchor modes Earth, late 20th century Colene's anchor mode is a contemporary town or small city in Oklahoma. This mode is portrayed realistically, with ordinary laws of physics; however, psionic power and some other forms of magic are functional though somewhat limited. Colene's house, which is in the suburbs, is close enough to her school that she is able to walk there. Colene calls her house the \\"Charles Mansion,\\" a pun on Charles Manson. She spends much of her time in Dogwood Bumshed, a wooden shed behind the house, so named because of the dogwood tree it stands under and as a pun on the comic strip character Dagwood Bumstead. Dogwood Bumshed is slightly larger than a playhouse. Colene stores her important possessions there, such as her journal and her picture of a horse, captioned For Whom Was That Neigh?, which is the basis for her imaginary pet horse, \\"Maresy Doats\\". The Cyngdom of Hlahtar The specific name of Darius' anchor mode is unknown; Colene calls it the \\"Land of Laughter\\" or the \\"Kingdom of Laughter.\\" Sympathetic magic (such as emotional transfer and conjuration) is native to this mode. Psionic power is operational. The people of Darius' mode live and work on daises high above the ground, due to the numerous sharp crystals covering the land surface. The crystals are multicolored, as are the clouds in the sky. Trees have green trunks and black leaves, and feed from the nutrients contained in the colored clouds. The people wear clothes Colene describes as \\"Oriental,\\" and women are required to wear secure halters and diapers under their clothing in order to hide their feminine contours. Sexual expression is an important part of culture: concubines are common, and the age of consent is non-existent. The Mode series makes a referential crossover into the Xanth series in Question Quest, where the Good Magician Humfrey makes a note in his book about Darius being the \\"Cyng of Hlahtar\\". The Horse Mode Seqiro's anchor mode, which remains unnamed, is the home of primitive humans and telepathic horses. The horses, though of inferior intelligence, rule by borrowing the mental potential of their human servants. Horses are socially stratified; notably, a lead stallion heads each community. Their telepathic powers can be used not only to communicate, but to control their servants or increase their ability or skill. They are also capable of stunning humans with a telepathic attack, or even \\"mind-blasting\\" other horses, effectively erasing their personalities. Nearby modes are dominated by telepathic animals of different species (bears, for example). Provos's mode The name of Provos's anchor mode is unknown, and little time is spent there in the novels. The people possess a unique kind of prescience: they remember the future, but not the past. They are highly environmentally-conscious and seem to have a symbiotic relationship with their environment. Houses are tall and narrow so as to avoid interfering with the environment, and are anchored by guy-wires to the thick yellow-trunked and blue-leaved trees. Farming is done wherever space is available without clearing the land. People travel by walking or by public transportation in the form of a large, tame snake with attached seats, which travels along a channel rather like a monorail. Food is organic, and clothing is made of natural fibers. DoOon Ddwng's anchor mode, pronounced , is a super-science reality in which psionic power, including emotional transfer, is possible in limited form, but sympathetic magic is non-operational. The people of the primary planet have created technology which is able to bypass some of the laws of physics, such as the speed of light, making FTL travel possible. They have refined the science of genetic engineering; people suffer from no genetic diseases and few effects of aging. They are also able to manufacture android-like beings called \\"nulls\\" from leftover genetic material. In addition, interstellar travel has made it possible for them to conquer and colonize many of the planets of their galaxy and beyond. Ddwng's people, though scientifically advanced, have tastes Colene describes as \\"lowbrow American.\\" In addition, the more powerful members of the mode seem quite ruthless and cruel: in the past, they had attempted to conquer their neighboring modes in order to exploit their resources. Due to these actions, a confederation of other modes confined the DoOon to their home mode and prevented their use of Virtual Mode chips. Leaders possess pain dials that can be used to cause pain directly to the nervous system of anyone within the radius of the possessor. Pain dial levels are graded, rather like Star Trek phasers or The Machine in The Princess Bride. Julia Nona's anchor mode corresponds to the planet Earth, but in a universe which is fractal, rather than spherical, in nature. Her planet, Oria, is one rad on a Mandelbrot set in a Julia universe. Psionic power (not including emotional transfer), conjuration, levitation, and various other magic is operational; however, ordinary laws of physics such the square-cube ratio do not apply. The culture resembles that of the Middle Ages: the social structure is similar to the feudal system, and few advances have been made in technology. The peasant class has few rights, and women are expected to marry and produce offspring. Because even peasants are expected to possess the magic of simple illusion, those who do not become outcasts, or \\"rabble,\\" and are forced to live under the land's surface. Every few generations, the source of power on each planet shifts between animus, the male force, and anima, the female force. When the animus is in power, firstborn men possess the greater magic and a woman loses her magic as she gives birth to more children. When the anima is in power, lastborn women possess the greater magic, and a woman's magic grows as she gives birth to more children. Sex and social class is easily identifiable by tunic color: black and white are worn by the men and women, respectively, who are empowered by the animus; blue and red are worn by the men and women, respectively, who are empowered by the anima. Those of unknown rank wear green, and animals wear yellow. Shale Burgess' anchor mode is the product of alternative evolution on Earth, predicated on the assumption that, had the creatures of the Burgess Shale survived the Cambrian period, evolution might never have given rise to chordates. Shale is populated by hivers, such as Burgess, and evolved versions of many other creatures, such as giant land crabs, giant Hallucigenia, land-bound Marella, and giant Anomalocaris. Most of the creatures of this mode seem largely predatory in nature. For example, the beach area is populated by shears, flying creatures with scissor-like beaks that attack in swarms, and the ground of the plains area conceals huge carnivorous underground worms. Hivers such as Burgess appear to be the only creatures that have created a form of civilization. Characters Primary characters ;Colene:Colene, the protagonist, is a fourteen-year-old girl, a high school freshman from Oklahoma. Though pretty and popular, she has a dark secret: stresses from her dysfunctional family and lasting depression from a past rape have made her suicidal. Incredibly intelligent and creative, she is also stubborn, willful, and somewhat immature at times. Her past experiences have given her an urge to flirt with death and a tendency to sexual exhibitionism. Colene has a great love of horses, and writes letters to an imaginary friend named \\"Maresy Doats\\" based on a picture of a horse. ;Darius:Darius is Cyng of Hlahtar, the one responsible for the emotional transfer of joy to the people of his homeland. Darius is handsome and intelligent, but without great physical prowess. Though mature, he is still considered a young man in his culture, and he holds somewhat romantic notions about the nature of his post. Darius' code of ethics is rigid, and he considers his honor binding and ultimate. ;Seqiro:Seqiro is a telepathic horse, a large stallion of approximately eighteen hands. Though he possesses little native intelligence, he is adept at relating to human minds and using their intelligence to buttress and enhance his own. Because the other leading stallions felt threatened by Seqiro, they attempted to confine him to his stall. Seqiro appreciates female human company, particularly Nona's, but his ultimate love and loyalty lie with Colene. ;Nona:Nona is the \\"ninth of the ninth\\"‚Äîthe ninth daughter of the eighth daughter of the seventh, back nine generations. The significance of her birth gives her strong magic and the ability to bring the anima, the female magical force. She also possesses significant physical beauty and musical skill. Though she is kind and relatively intelligent, her extreme innocence and na√Øvet√© hamper her ability to adapt to some situations. ;Burgess:Burgess is a hiver, the evolutionary equivalent of a human being in the Shale Mode. Because he is unable to return to his own hive, he joins the party of anchor persons out of necessity. He soon adapts to their mode of communication, even though he is unaccustomed to individuality and emotion. Unhampered by human foibles, he is direct and honest, and sometimes surprisingly insightful, particularly regarding Colene. ;Pussy:Pussy is a seductive null of the Feline persuasion. Like other female nulls, she is trained to provide for her employer's sexual and emotional needs. ;Cat:Cat is a neuter null of the Feline persuasion. Imminently calm and rational, he is the intellectual backbone of his null trio. ;Tom:Tom is a muscular male null of the Feline persuasion. Though trained to be relentless in physical combat, he is rather insecure in emotional matters. Significant secondary characters Provos, an older woman who can effectively remember the future but cannot foresee the past. She becomes an anchor because her memory of future events has become foggy ‚Äî there's a blank space which troubles her, and she quests to recover these lost memories. Because of her backward memory, the others have difficulty communicating with her to any great extent. Maresy Doats, a fictional mare to whom Colene addresses her journal entries. She represents Colene's mature and rational self, and Colene considers Maresy her best friend until she meets Seqiro. Late in the series, Maresy becomes incarnate in a telepathic mare from Sequiro's Mode whose memories and personality have been erased due to persecution from the dominant horses of that society. Rather than leave the mare mentally impaired, Colene uses her improving telepathic power to imprint the personality of \\"Maresy Doats\\" upon the mare; in the process, Colene essentially creates the perfect mate for Sequiro. Ddwng, pronounced , is the emperor of the DoOon. Ruthless and unethical, Ddwng is determined to coerce Darius into giving him the Chip that will allow him to travel to and exploit the Virtual Mode. Though clever, he is extremely suspicious, particularly after having been previously balked. The mind predator, a creature of the Virtual Mode who attacks travelers whose minds are in conflict. It first attempts to feed on Provos, but later pursues Colene. It can be escaped by crossing into anchor modes, where it cannot pursue. Prima, a mode traveler from a mode similar to Darius' home who was captured on the Virtual Mode. Prima possesses an ability to magnify joy which rivals Kublai's; in their youth, they sought to place Prima in post as Cyng of Hlahtar, but were denied because of sexual bias. Doe, a null of the Caprine persuasion, has the appearance of a beautiful woman with a face suggestive of that of a goat. Garret, Colene's father. A victim of depression and the spouse of an alcoholic, Garret seeks to avoid troubles at home by having extramarital affairs. Though often absent, he attempts to be understanding to Colene and encourages her when she seeks to become more independent. Morna, Colene's mother. A victim of chronic, untreated depression, Morna turns to alcohol to dull her pain. Though she is aware of her husband's infidelity, she generally avoids conflict lest he criticize her for her alcoholism. Brought up Roman Catholic, she attempts to instill many of her traditional values in Colene. Amos Forell, aspiring biologist and Colene's former eighth grade science teacher. Kublai, a former Cyng of Hlahtar who assumes Darius' post while he is traveling the Virtual Mode. After being forced to marry and discard many women during his tenure, Kublai has finally married Koren, the woman he loves. Koren, once Kublai's wife, must instead become his mistress while he performs the role of Cyng of Hlahtar. Angus, a giant from the planet Jupiter in the Julia Mode who helps Nona after becoming enraptured with her music. Slick, a member of the criminal underworld in Colene's home town. Though he is a hired killer who carries a straight razor, he longs for a normal life. Slick longs to see his niece Esta, but her mother, his sister, has barred him from doing so because of his unsavory connections. Esta, Slick's niece, is a depressive twelve-year-old with an unhappy home life. Stave, a peasant of Oria, is a friend and possible love interest of Nona. Significance of character names Colene is the anglicized form of the name Cail√≠n, which means \\"girl\\" in Irish. Darius was a common name for kings in ancient Persia. Maresy Doats is named for the song \\"Mairzy Doats.\\" Colene was unaware of the proper spelling at the time she named her imaginary friend. Kublai is reminiscent of Kublai Khan, a Chinese emperor. Koren is possibly derived from the Greek word kore, \\"maiden.\\" Prima may be a feminization of Primus, which means \\"first\\" in Latin. Tom is the name for a male cat and may also be a shortened form of tomcat, a slang term indicating sexual promiscuity. Pussy is a double-entendre on the name for a female cat and a slang term for the female sex organ. Female cats are more commonly called \\"queens.\\" Nona means \\"ninth\\" in Latin. Burgess‚Äò real name is a series of electrical impulses, so Colene calls him after the Burgess Shale. Doe is a generic name for female animals of several hoofed species. Though a female goat may be called a \\"doe,\\" they are often called \\"nannies\\" as well. Morna is the anglicized form of Muirne, which means \\"beloved\\" in Irish. It also sounds similar to the word mourn, meaning \\"to grieve.\\" Patterns *For much of the series, the anchor persons are telepathically linked with the help of Seqiro. Thoughts are written as italics. *The Mode series is written in alternating third person limited perspective. Out of all four novels, Seqiro's perspective is used in only one chapter. *Seqiro's voice is usually written as italics. Only in Burgess' perspective are Seqiro's thoughts voiced with quotation marks. *Burgess' voice is written as narration, or indirect quotes. *Each of the first three novels ends with a member of the party letting go of their anchor and a new member taking hold. *Each of the first three novels ends with Colene saying, \\"Uh-oh,\\" or \\"Oh, no,\\" as the party meets the new anchor person. *The titles of the novels generally indicate where the most time is spent in each. In Virtual Mode, much time is spent on the Virtual Mode itself. In Fractal Mode, the primary setting is Julia Mode, a fractal universe. Chaos Mode is fragmented, with several sections set in various anchor modes and a great deal of time spent on the Virtual Mode as well. DoOon is the setting for approximately half of DoOon Mode. *The Earth Mode is visited at least once in each novel. *Colene recounts her rape in each novel. Publication According to Piers Anthony in the author's note to DoOon Mode, the series achieved limited release due to an error on the part of a representative of the initial publishing company, Ace/Putnam. Because the number of paperback copies ordered is based on the number of hardcovers sold, the series never achieved the widespread popularity Anthony had hoped for. Subsequent novels in the series continued to suffer from the inadequate sales of the first, finally finding Anthony unable to find a publisher for the fourth novel. Anthony credits the Internet with raising his awareness of fan support for the series and of alternative publishing methods. Though the final book, DoOon Mode, was eventually published by Tor, an imprint of Tom Doherty Associates, LLC, its publication was delayed until 2001, eleven years after the writing of the first book, Virtual Mode.

A fire pan is a pan for holding or conveying fire which is often used as method for building a Leave No Trace fire.  Background  Fire pans were initially used by river guides to minimize the impact of their fires but they are becoming increasingly popular with backpackers, campers and other outdoor users. The pan is usually a metal tray with rigid sides at least three inches high such as a metal oil drain pan or a backyard barbecue grill.  Purpose  The use of a fire pan reduces the impact to the ground, vegetation and rocks, and its compact size results in the burning of less wood. Fire pans also allow users to easily burn their accumulated garbage although the best practice is to only burn paper. Combustible items will be reduced to ash. A fire pan user can leave no trace of their previous fire because the ashes can be collected and buried.  Usage  When using a fire pan care should be taken so the heat does not scorch vegetation or sterilize the ground, therefore it is necessary to elevate the pan with rocks or with several inches of mineral soil. Used in winter a fire pan can be placed atop limbs or logs to keep the pan from sinking into the snow. A fire pan can be more convenient than a traditional campfire because it allows the fire to be picked up and moved should the need arise.

Umpqua National Forest, in southern Oregon's Cascade Range, covers an area of in Douglas, Lane, and Jackson counties, and borders Crater Lake National Park. The four ranger districts for the forest are the Cottage Grove, Diamond Lake, North Umpqua, and Tiller ranger districts. The forest is managed by the United States Forest Service, headquartered in Roseburg.  Geography  Stands of western hemlock, true fir, Douglas-fir and cedar transition to lower-elevation forests of mixed conifers and hardwoods. Timbered valleys of old-growth ponderosa and groves of oak separate mountains like the Mount Thielsen and the Mount Bailey. Notable geologic features include volcanic basalt and andesite monolithic spires with descriptive names like Eagle Rock, Rattlesnake Rock, and Old Man.  History  Ancestors of the Umpqua, Southern Molala, Yoncalla, and Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians lived here before Mount Mazama erupted forming Crater Lake nearly 7,000 years ago. The Indians were moved to reservations in 1856. As Europeans bought reservation lands, the tribes further fragmented to become farmers and ranchers in the Umpqua Valley. Two translations of the word \\"umpqua\\" are \\"thundering waters\\" and \\"across the waters\\".Umpqua National Forest from the US Forest Service The Umpqua National Forest was created by the United States Congress on July 2, 1907. The Forest Service staff soon began building trails, constructing bridges, fighting fires, monitoring grazing, and erecting lookouts. Logging and mining began in 1925. The Civilian Conservation Corps was active in the Umpqua National Forest by building roads, bridges and recreation facilities in the 1930s.  Points of interest  The Umpqua National Forest is home to more than 250 wildlife species. Large mammals such as elk, deer, black bear, and cougar, as well as the smaller residents, squirrels, fox, raccoons, and bats are supported by the diverse forest habitats. Raptors such as owls, eagles, osprey, and even peregrine falcons can occasionally be seen in the forest. Coho and Chinook salmon and steelhead, rainbow, brown and cutthroat trout swim, feed and spawn in the rivers and streams of the forest.About the Umpqua National Forest from the US Forest Service. A 1993 Forest Service study estimated that the extent of old growth in the forest was , of which were mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) forests. Recreational activities in the forest include camping, fishing, hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking, rock climbing, and boating. Winter activities include both Nordic and downhill skiing, as well as snowshoeing and snowmobiling. In 1988, the Oregon Omnibus Wild and Scenic Rivers Act designated a portion of the North Umpqua River as Wild and Scenic. Twenty-six miles of the river run through the forest. The Rogue-Umpqua National Scenic Byway extends through the Rogue River‚ÄìSiskiyou and Umpqua national forests, as well as the Medford and Roseburg districts of the Bureau of Land Management and private lands.  Wilderness areas  Map of wilderness areas in the Umpqua National Forest. The Umpqua National Forest contains three wilderness areas: Boulder Creek, Rogue-Umpqua Divide, and Mount Thielsen.  Boulder Creek  Boulder Creek is a wilderness area located east of Roseburg. One popular area in Boulder Creek is Pine Bench. A flat area overlooking Boulder Creek, Pine Bench is home to a grove of majestic old growth ponderosa pines. In 1996 the Spring Fire burned in the Boulder Creek Wilderness.Boulder Creek Wilderness from the US Forest Service  Rogue-Umpqua Divide  The Rogue- Umpqua Divide is a wilderness area, of which is inside the National Forest. (About 17% of it lies within Rogue River‚ÄìSiskiyou National Forest.) Located east of Roseburg, the Rogue-Umpqua Divide ranges in elevation from 3,200 to and separates the drainages of the Rogue and Umpqua rivers. The wilderness includes sub-alpine meadows and old-growth forests.Rogue-Umpqua Wilderness from the US Forest Service  Mount Thielsen  Mount Thielsen is a wilderness area, of which is located inside the National Forest. (The rest lies in either Winema National Forest or Deschutes National Forest.) Located east of Roseburg, this wilderness area is the largest in the Umpqua. The Mt. Thielsen was born of the same volcanic activity that created Crater Lake and some trails pass over deep pumice that was deposited when Mt. Mazama erupted. The Pacific Crest Trail passes through the middle of the wilderness area.Mount Thielsen Wilderness from the US Forest Service See also *High Cascades Complex Fires  References   External links  * Forest Service page on Umpqua National Forest * Landscape Photos Showing Umpqua National Forest * Umpqua National Forest Wilderness Areas Category:Protected areas of Douglas County, Oregon Category:Protected areas of Jackson County, Oregon Category:Protected areas of Lane County, Oregon Category:National Forests of Oregon Category:1907 establishments in Oregon Category:Protected areas established in 1907 ","title":"Umpqua National Forest"},{"id":"8126760","text":"Wagafi bread (in Arabic often referred to as white bread) is an Iranian type of bread that normally contains a greater amount of flour than normal bread.

Between the late 19th century and the 1960s, it was France's most grown grape variety, but plantings of Aramon have been in continuous decline since the mid-20th century. Aramon has also been grown in Algeria, Argentina and Chile but nowhere else did it ever reach the popularity it used to have in the south of France. It is most noted for its very high productivity, and yields can reach levels as high as 400 hectolitres per hectare. The vine's resistance to oidium, phylloxera, and powdery mildew led to its reputation as workhorse grape that could be relied on by growers for dependable financial returns.J. Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 205 Mitchell Beazley 1986 However, when cropped at high yields, the resultant wines are very light red in color (but show a blue-black tinge), low in alcohol and extract and generally thin on character. Such Aramon wine is often blended with wine from grapes of darker color such as Alicante Bouschet and Grand Noir de la Calmette to darken the resulting wine. If planted on poor soils and pruned very severely to much smaller yields, it has been shown to be able to give concentrated wines with spicy, earthy, herbaceous, and somewhat rustic character.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes Harcourt Books 2001 However, such Aramon wines are extremely rare, but some varietal wine is still produced in Languedoc. A viticultural drawback of Aramon is that it buds early and ripens late, which means that it only is suitable for growing in hotter regions, and that it is very sensitive to spring frost.  History  When the south of France - Le Midi - was connected by railways to the more industrial and populous north of the country in the 19th century, the cost of transporting wines and other goods decreased considerably. Previously, waterways had provided the best transportation routes for wine, and only more expensive wines had been able to bear the cost of long overland transport. In the resulting 19th century vineyard expansion of southern France, Aramon became the grape variety of choice in Languedoc. As an indication of the wine industry boom of the era, the vineyards of the H√©rault department (one part of Languedoc) more than doubled between 1849 and 1869, when they covered a massive . Thus, in this department alone, a vineyard surface somewhat larger than that of the entire Bordeaux region of today was added in 20 years, most of it planted with Aramon. The wine produced was undistinguished, but it was produced cheaply and in huge quantities. The simple reds of Languedoc initially competed with equally simple reds made closer to Paris, in areas where most of the wine production disappeared in the early 20th century due to the combined effect of competition and phylloxera. Thus, the wines were not made in a mold that wine consumers of the late 20th and early 21st century would have recognised as a typical \\"warm climate\\" style, but rather outmatched other thin red wines by means of sheer volume and lower production costs. Such wines were primarily drunk as everyday table wine by French workers, and they were known as petit rouge ‚Äì small reds. Since high-yielding Aramon gives one of the least coloured wines that still pass as red, the practice of blending such wines with wines from teinturier grapes such as Alicante Bouschet was a measure used to give them a measure of increased credibility as reds. Later, Aramon-based light red wines got competition on the French market from cheap red wines from North Africa, primarily from the then-French colony of Algeria. Algerian wines, produced primarily from Carignan, had more colour, alcohol and concentration than the typical Languedoc wines of the era. Since these characteristics were attractive to consumers, it became common in the 20th century to blend cheap wines from the south of France with Algerian and other North African wines. These characters lead to a decreased popularity of Aramon in France from the mid-20th century. This trend was reinforced when the French vineyards were hit by frost in 1956 and 1963, which hit the frost-sensitive Aramon particularly hard. Aramon was primarily replaced with Carignan, which overtook Aramon as France's most grown grape variety in the 1960s. In 2000, there remained of Aramon in France, primarily in the H√©rault, with a rapidly decreasing trend.  Origin and offspring  Despite its similarities to the hybrids Villard noir and Couderc, Aramon is not a hybrid but rather a Vitis vinifera. Some have proposed that Aramon originated in Spain, but DNA typing has revealed Gouais blanc to be one of its parents, with the other parent so far unidentified.Vitis International Variety Catalogue: Aramon noir , accessed on May 25, 2008 This parentage is more typical of French or Germanic varieties, but given its heat-demanding viticultural characteristics, it is unlikely to have survived in cultivation in a colder region. Therefore, its origin could very well be southern France. Aramon was used extensively by the early French hybridizers in crosses with American grape species like Vitis rupestris and Vitis aestivalis as a source of good viticultural characteristics, and proved a better parent than many of the better known V. vinifera cultivars. Viticulturalist Albert Seibel crossed Aramon with the American hybrid grape Munson to produce Flot rouge.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 256-257 Allen Lane 2012 Aramon was also a parent of the ill-fated AxR1 rootstock, which is \\"Aramon x Rupestris Ganzin No. 1\\".

It specialises in the design, manufacture and supply of a range of parachutes and emergency, rescue and survival equipment for both the military and civilian markets. The company can trace its routes back to the Irvin Airchute Company, founded in 1919, and GQ Parachutes, founded in 1932. Both firms had become key manufacturers of emergency escape parachutes by the end of the 1930s, selling their products to many air forces throughout the globe. The rival firms cooperated during the Second World War, developing safer and increasingly reliable parachute assemblies for aircrews and airborne forces; their parachutes were extensively used throughout the conflict. In the postwar period, both companies continued to advance their products into new fields, including their incorporation into ejector seats, the recovery of space vehicles, brake parachute, and the aerial delivery of very large payloads. The Irvin Airchute Company was ultimately acquired by its long-time collaborator GQ Parachutes. During 2001, the merged entity was named IRVIN-GQ. Having changed ownership multiple times over the years, the company is presently a subsidiary of aerospace conglomerate TransDigm Group. Since 2003, IRVIN-GQ has based its main UK manufacturing site in Llangeinor, Wales. History IRVIN-GQ has its origins in the Irvin Airchute Company, which was established during 1919 in Buffalo, New York by the parachutist Leslie Irvin, who had performed the world's first free-fall parachute jump earlier that same year. During 1925, the Royal Air Force (RAF) placed an order with the Irvin Airchute Company to supply parachutes for its aircrews. To fulfil this and future European orders, the firm established a factory in the United Kingdom in 1926. During 1932, James Gregory and Raymond Quilter founded another pioneering parachute manufacturer, GQ Parachutes. By the end of the 1930s, both companies had become well established major suppliers of emergency escape parachutes to many air forces around the world. During 1940, GQ and Irvin collaborated on the X-Type parachute assembly, which provided a safe and reliable static line assembly for paratroopers. This model was mass-produced throughout the rest of the Second World War, being used by both aircrews and airborne forces alike, and for several decades after the war's end. One high-profile example of its use was during the D-Day Landings, the delivery of the advance airborne units over Normandy made extensive use of the X-Type parachute assembly. Both companies were able to maintain relevance following the end of the conflict; their products were adapted to suit the high-speed military aircraft that arrived during the 1950s and 1960s. Their parachutes were subsequently adopted by British aviation firm Martin-Baker for their range of ejector seats, including the very first use of such a seat. Over the decades, the company has become a world leader in the field of emergency escape parachutes. Both the capability and range of uses for parachutes expanded during the Cold War period, particularly into non- personnel applications, such as the safe recovery of space vehicles and unmanned aircraft. The aerial delivery of very large and varied loads of equipment, enabled by effective arrangements of parachutes, was another frontier. The company has also produced compact air-deployed survival kits; these have been integrated into various aircraft to support their crews in the event of ejection. Another market for their products was as brake parachutes; Irvin has supplied these for numerous RAF aircraft, including the BAE Systems Hawk, SEPECAT Jaguar and Eurofighter Typhoon. The United States Air Force (USAF) also adopted the company's braking parachutes for their aircraft, including the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird; NASA also used them on its Space Shuttle. Ballistic parachutes, for the purpose of recovering out-of-control aircraft, became another application from the 1960s onwards. Since 1991, the company has operated a specialised outsourced service facility, the Airborne Forces Parachute Support Unit (AFPSU), which repairs, maintains and packs all of the parachutes and related equipment for The Parachute Regiment of the British Army. The Irvin Airchute Company was ultimately acquired by its long- time collaborator GQ Parachutes. During 1994, the company acquired and integrated with Aircraft Materials Ltd, a specialist producer of survival equipment and aerial delivery platforms. During 2001, the merged entity was named IRVIN-GQ. In 2007, it was rebranded as Airborne Systems; however, during 2018, the company readopted its previous name of IRVIN-GQ. During 2000, IRVIN- GQ was sold to Alchemy Partners, a private equity firm. In December 2002, the company revealed a ¬£5 million investment programme which included the creation of around 200 jobs, in addition to the relocation of its main UK production site from Blackmill in Bridgend to neighbouring Llangeinor. Outside of the UK, IRVIN-GQ operates factories in both the Unites States and Canada. By late 2010, the Llangeinor facility reportedly employed around 250 people. During September 2006, representatives from the company formed part of a trade mission to China led by the then First Minister for Wales Rhodri Morgan. In January 2010, the company secured a ¬£50 million contract to supply equipment to the French Ministry of Defence. In response to this deal, on 1 September 2013, IrvinGQ (France), was established to provide technical and logistical repair, and support services for customers throughout continental Europe from the firm's new facility in Toulouse, France. By 2015, the firm was reportedly deriving over 50 per cent of its turnover from its export customers. During 2010, IRVIN-GQ was sold to American private equity company Metalmark Capital. During 2013, it again changed ownership, this time to aerospace conglomerate TransDigm Group. By 2020, the company's core products included naval decoy systems, parachutes, aerial delivery and survival equipment, and associated services.

History The original owners of the land, upon which Mount Stuart is built, were known as Mouheneenner band of the South East tribe of Tasmanian aborigines. Ownership of the land began to change after British occupation of the land began in 1803. Etymology The name Mount Stuart comes indirectly from a Governor of Bombay (Mumbai) in India, Mountstuart Elphinstone. Mountstuart was the fourth son of the eleventh Lord Elphinstone, and was born in Dunbartonshire, Scotland. A ship, the Mountstuart Elphinstone, was named in honour of the Governor, and in 1836, this ship visited Hobart town. The Mountstuart Elphinstone brought the news that the unpopular Lieutenant-Governor George Arthur, was ordered to return to London. This allowed reversal of some of his unpopular Laws. To celebrate, locals named two roads to the north west of the town ‚ÄòMount Stuart Road‚Äô and ‚ÄòElphinstone Road‚Äô. Over time the area around Mount Stuart Road became known as ‚ÄòMount Stuart‚Äô. After a while an area outside ‚ÄòHobart Town‚Äô (including much of West Hobart) was designated ‚ÄòMount Stuart Town‚Äô. Knocklofty (hill) was also known as Mount Stuart or Paraclete. Mount Stuart Town was absorbed into Hobart around 1908. Mount Stuart also uses the general Hobart postcode of 7000. West Hobart gradually developed as a separate suburb, and the hill of Knocklofty progressively became a reserve. Next to the Knocklofty Reserve is a water reservoir, near which walkers can take in views of Hobart. Demography Mount Stuart is a predominantly residential suburb located at the end of Elphinstone Road. Education The main school in the suburb is Mount Stuart Primary School, which opened in 1957. The site had previously been part of the Paraclete Estate. The Kindergarten on Raymont Terrace has moved and currently Mount Stuart Presbyterian Church rents the building, using it for their Kids Church and morning tea after the church service. Facilities The Mount Stuart Community Hall is a feature of the suburb, on land owned by the Hobart City Council and is managed by the Mount Stuart Community Association. The Mount Stuart Scout Group have met at this hall since 1959. A dance school is also run from the Hall. There is a local park with barbecues at the end of Benjafield Terrace, beneath the Mount Stuart Lookout, which has views of the city, Mount Dromedary, and the northern suburbs. The playground features a mock rock-climbing wall.

It is one of the successors of the South African aviation company Atlas Aircraft Corporation. The division was created during 1992 following the acquisition and absorption of Atlas Aircraft into Denel. Initially named Denel Aviation, it was rebranded as Denel Aeronautics during 2017 following the reintegration of Denel Aerostructures. It is the manufacturer of the Rooivalk, a domestically-developed attack helicopter that had been developed by Atlas Aircraft; the company also provides support services for a wide range of aircraft, both of the former Atlas Aircraft's range and from numerous international manufacturers. Denel Aeronautics is the dominant provider of aircraft maintenance and support services across various types operated by the South African Air Force; it also provides those services to other operators worldwide. History During 1992, the South African aviation company Atlas Aircraft Corporation was absorbed into Denel, a state- owned defence conglomerate. In conjunction with this restructuring, the company's name was changed to Denel Aviation, functioning as the aviation and aerospace-orientated division of Denel thereafter. During 2006, Denel Aviation was reorganised and its activities split between two separate divisions; for the most part, manufacturing activity was transferred to the newly-created Denel Aerostructures, which Denel Aviation continued to operate, specialising in aircraft servicing and maintenance. During 2017, Denel Aviation and Denel Aerostructures were reunited by their merger to form Denel Aeronautics. An Atlas Cheetah in flight Denel Aviation ties to the Atlas Aircraft Corporation meant that it effectively inherited various programmes that the company had been engaged in. It continued to remanufacture South African Air Force (SAAF) Dassault Mirage IIIs into the upgraded Cheetah into the late 1990s. Another such project was the in-development Rooivalk attack helicopter, which had been started amid the South African Border War of the 1980s. In concept, this attack helicopter was to escort friendly helicopter troop transports, conduct strike missions upon anti-aircraft positions, and effectively counter the increasing presence of Soviet-built tanks; in the latter role, it was to be equipped with anti-tank missiles. The Rooivalk was not a clean-design helicopter due to the significant challenges, very high costm and lengthy timescale that would have been needed; it was instead based upon one of existing designs already in service with the SAAF - the A√©rospatiale SA 330 Puma. The first Rooivalk prototype performed its maiden flight on 11 February 1990. Throughout the 1990s, the South African Army were broadly supportive of the Rooivalk programme, in part as the presence of South African attack helicopters would reduce the need for large numbers of tanks to be procured and maintained. The Army thus provided funding for the Rooivalk program for a time, helping it survive the tightening budgetary constraints. The delays and escalating costs of the project were a hindrance not only to its introduction but to Rooivalk's later viability. By 1998, the year in which the first production Rooivalk was delivered to the SAAF, the lengthy development time meant that the rotorcraft was already suffering from some alleged obsolescence issues; it was an aerodynamically sound aircraft but the avionics, while advanced for the 1980s, were relatively outdated, which harmed the type's export potential. FIB base in Sake 2014 Denel Aviation was reportedly keen to pursue potential export opportunities for the type, such as Malaysia, the United Kingdom, and Turkey, however no such sales had emerged by 2013. The development of the Rooivalk has been credited as positively influencing the development of several South African aviation and high technology industries, leading to the creation of firms such as Aerosud and Advanced Technologies and Engineering (ATE). In 2016, Denel was reportedly proceeding with a Mk 1.1 upgrade program for the existing Rooivalk fleet; prospective improvements include the addition of a missile approach warning system and enhancements to the rotorcraft's avionics. On 15 September 2016, it was announced that Airbus Helicopters and Denel had signed a memorandum of understanding to cooperate on the SAAF modernisation program; further details on the changes included reliability and survivability improvements, an increased payload, and the replacement of obsolete targeting systems and armaments. A significant portion of Denel Aviation's activity has been centred around the provision of support services, both domestically and internationally. The firm has been involved in supporting the Ecuadorian Air Force in keeping its fleet of Atlas Cheetah fighter jets operational; Denel having the foremost experience of the type having been its original manufacturer as the Atlas Aircraft Corporation. Denel Aviation also provides maintenance services for various aircraft manufactured by other companies, including Eurocopter, Lockheed Martin, SAAB, AgustaWestland, British Aerospace and Airbus amongst others. Denel Aviation has built partnerships with numerous international companies. It has produced components on behalf of both major airliner manufacturers, Boeing and Airbus,. along with British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce Plc. Denel Aviation has also endeavoured to cooperate with numerous local aerospace companies in its undertakings. In 2012, the firm agreed with Russian Helicopters to establish a new maintenance hub in South Africa to service its range of helicopters for the region. During 2014, a three-party collaborative agreement was signed by Denel Aerostructures, Aerosud and Airbus to create a 10-year investment plan for the development of more sophisticated manufacturing techniques; the agreement was viewed as a step towards a greater presence on the competitive global supply chain of Airbus and other original equipment manufacturers. Furthermore, Denel Aviation is the dominant provider of maintenance and support services for the numerous types of aircraft operated by the South African Air Force, including the Saab JAS 39 Gripen fighter, the BAE Systems Hawk trainer, the Rooivalk attack helicopter, the Atlas Oryx transport helicopter, the Lockheed C-130 Hercules tactical transport aircraft, as well as the CASA C-212 and Cessna 208 Caravan utility aircraft.

Its relevant property is a uniform scattering or diffusing effect. Light rays incident on any point on the inner surface are, by multiple scattering reflections, distributed equally to all other points. The effects of the original direction of light are minimized. An integrating sphere may be thought of as a diffuser which preserves power but destroys spatial information. It is typically used with some light source and a detector for optical power measurement. A similar device is the focusing or Coblentz sphere, which differs in that it has a mirror-like (specular) inner surface rather than a diffuse inner surface. Even small commercial integrating spheres cost many thousands of dollars, as a result their use is often limited to industry and large academic institutions. However, 3D printing and homemade coatings have seen the production of experimentally accurate DIY spheres for very low cost. The practical implementation of the integrating sphere was due to work by R. Ulbricht (1849‚Äì1923), published in 1900.James M. Palmer, Barbara G. Grant The Art of Radiometry, SPIE Press, 2010,, page 5 It has become a standard instrument in photometry and radiometry. It has the advantage over a goniophotometer for measuring the light produced by a source that total power can be obtained in a single measurement. The theory of a light-collecting cubical box was described by W. E. Sumpner in 1910.H. Buckley, \\"The Whitened Cube as a Precision Integrating Photometer\\" (1920) Proceedings of the Institution of Electrical Engineers 59 (London) Theory The theory of integrating spheres is based on these assumptions: * Light hitting the sides of the sphere is scattered in a diffuse way i.e. Lambertian reflectance * Only light that has been diffused in the sphere hits the ports or detectors used for probing the light Using these assumptions the sphere multiplier can be calculated. This number is the average number of times a photon is scattered in the sphere, before it is absorbed in the coating or escapes through a port. This number increases with the reflectivity of the sphere coating and decreases with the ratio between the total area of ports and other absorbing objects and the sphere inner area. To get a high homogeneity a recommended sphere multiplier is 10-25.Integrating Sphere Design and Applications, Sphere Optics , pg. 5 The theory further states that if the above criteria are fulfilled then the irradiance on any area element on the sphere will be proportional to the total radiant flux input to the sphere. Absolute measurements of instance luminous flux can then be done by measuring a known light source and determining the transfer function or calibration curve. Total exit irradiance For a sphere with radius r, reflection coefficient œÅ, and source flux Œ¶, the initial reflected irradiance is equal to: E = \\\\rho \\\\frac \\\\Phi {4 \\\\pi r^2} \\\\, Every time the irradiance is reflected, the reflection coefficient exponentially grows. The resulting equation is E = \\\\frac \\\\Phi {4 \\\\pi r^2}\\\\,\\\\rho(1 + \\\\rho + \\\\rho^2 + ...) Since œÅ ‚â§ 1, the geometric series converges and the total exit irradiance is: E = \\\\frac \\\\Phi {4 \\\\pi r^2}\\\\,\\\\frac \\\\rho {1 - \\\\rho}\\\\, Applications Simplified principle of the use of an integrating sphere to measure the transmittance and reflectance of a test sample Light scattered by the interior of the integrating sphere is evenly distributed over all angles. The integrating sphere is used in optical measurements. The total power (flux) of a light source can be measured without inaccuracy caused by the directional characteristics of the source, or the measurement device. Reflection and absorption of samples can be studied. The sphere creates a reference radiation source that can be used to provide a photometric standard. Commercial integrating sphere. This particular model employs four separate lamps that can be specified to achieve the required spectral output from ultraviolet through infrared. Integrating spheres are used for a variety of optical, photometric or radiometric measurements. They are used to measure the total light radiated in all directions from a lamp. An integrating sphere can be used to measure the diffuse reflectance of surfaces, providing an average over all angles of illumination and observation. An integrating sphere can be used to create a light source with apparent intensity uniform over all positions within its circular aperture, and independent of direction except for the cosine function inherent to ideally diffuse radiating surfaces (Lambertian surfaces). Since all the light incident on the input port is collected, a detector connected to an integrating sphere can accurately measure the sum of all the ambient light incident on a small circular aperture. The total power of a laser beam can be measured, free from the effects of beam shape, incident direction, and incident position, as well as polarization. Materials The optical properties of the lining of the sphere greatly affect its accuracy. Different coatings must be used at visible, infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths. High-powered illumination sources may heat or damage the coating, so an integrating sphere will be rated for a maximum level of incident power. Various coating materials are used. For visible-spectrum light, early experimenters used a deposit of magnesium oxide, and barium sulfate also has a usefully flat reflectance over the visible spectrum. Various proprietary PTFE compounds are also used for visible light measurements. Finely-deposited gold is used for infrared measurements. An important requirement for the coating material is the absence of fluorescence. Fluorescent materials absorb short-wavelength light and re-emit light at longer wavelengths. Due to the many scatterings this effect is much more pronounced in an integrating sphere than for materials irradiated normally. Structure The theory of the integrating sphere assumes a uniform inside surface with diffuse reflectivity approaching 100%. Openings where light can exit or enter, used for detectors and sources, are normally called ports. The total area of all ports must be small, less than about 5% of the surface area of the sphere, for the theoretical assumptions to be valid. Unused ports should therefore have matching plugs, with the interior surface of the plug coated with the same material as the rest of the sphere. Integrating spheres vary in size from a few centimeters in diameter up to a few meters in diameter. Smaller spheres are typically used to diffuse incoming radiation, while larger spheres are used to measure integrating properties like the luminous flux of a lamp or luminaries which is then placed inside the sphere. If the entering light is incoherent (rather than a laser beam), then it typically fills the source-port, and the ratio of source-port area to detector-port area is relevant. Baffles are normally inserted in the sphere to block the direct path of light from a source-port to a detector-port, since this light will have non-uniform distribution.

The film is based on a novella of the same name by Kir Bulychov about Alisa (Alice) Selezneva, a teenage girl from the future. It is a spiritual successor to 1981 animated film The Mystery of the Third Planet, from which it draws a heavy influence. Plot Alisa Selezneva joins an archeological expedition to the dead planet of Coleida. There are well- preserved cities from the past, yet all of planet's inhabitants had died centuries ago due to unknown plague. Using a time-travelling device, Alisa and an alien scientist Rrrr, who looks almost exactly like a cat, travel to the planet's past, to the day the plague began. They find themselves in a world that resembles 20th century Earth, Soviet Union in particular. Coleidians are expecting the return of their cosmonauts from their first trip to another planet. Alisa realizes that the cosmonauts were the cause of the plague, and decides to prevent it. Through numerous obstacles, she comes close to the returned spaceship and uses a disinfection spray to prevent plague from spreading. To Coleidian police, it looks like an assault, so they catch Alisa and imprison her. With Rrrr's help, she's able to escape and return to the future. Upon arrival, they find that the future changed and Coleida is no more a dead planet, but a flourishing civilisation.

Inclusion in this list does not necessarily imply that anyone involved was guilty of a crime. For accidents or crimes that involved radioactive substances unbeknownst to those involved, see the Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents. Murder and attempted murder The Karlsruhe plutonium affair An unnamed man was convicted of attempting to poison his ex-wife in 2001 with plutonium stolen from WAK (Wiederaufbereitungsanlage Karlsruhe), a small scale reprocessing plant where he worked. He did not steal a large amount of plutonium, only rags used for wiping surfaces and a small amount of liquid waste. At least two people (besides the criminal) were contaminated by the plutonium. Two flats in Landau in the Rhineland-Palatinate were contaminated, and had to be cleaned at a cost of two million euro. Photographs of the case and details of other nuclear crimes have been presented by a worker at the Institute for Transuranium Elements. The Litvinenko assassination Alexander Litvinenko died from polonium-210 poisoning in London in 2006. British officials said investigators had concluded the murder of Litvinenko was \\"a 'state-sponsored' assassination orchestrated by Russian security services.\\" On 20 January 2007 British police announced that they had \\"identified the man they believe poisoned Alexander Litvinenko,\\" Andrei Lugovoi. On 21 September 2012, a story was posted in various UK newspapers suggesting the existence of an ongoing cover-up by the British Government over the material facts of the case. The report suggests that many aspects of the case may \\"never see the light of day\\" due to the significant risk to UK/Russian relations and the implications of the declaration that an act of nuclear terrorism took place on British soil. Roman Tsepov homicide Roman Tsepov, a politically influential Russian who provided security to Vladimir Putin and others, fell sick on 11 September 2004 after a trip to Moscow, and died on 24 September. A postmortem investigation found a poisoning by an unspecified radioactive material. He had symptoms similar to Aleksandr Litvinenko.The Putin bodyguard riddle, The Sunday Times, December 3, 2006 Zheleznodorozhny criminal radiological act An unnamed truck driver was killed by five months of radiation exposure to a caesium-137 source that had been put into the door of his truck around February 1995. He died of radiation-induced leukemia on 27 April 1997. Vladimir Kaplun radiation homicide In 1993, director of the Kartontara packing company Vladimir Kaplun was killed by radioactive material (cobalt-60 and/or cesium-137) placed in his chair. He died of radiation sickness after a month of hospitalization. The source of the radiation was found after his death. Karen Silkwood poisoning allegations On November 5, 1974, Kerr- McGee worker and labor union activist Karen Silkwood found herself exposed to plutonium-239 after working to grind and polish plutonium pellets by way of a glovebox to be used in nuclear fuel rods at the Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site in Oklahoma. Inspection of the gloves would yield no evidence of external leakage of radioactive contaminant from the glovebox, despite the fact that plutonium had been found on those surfaces of the gloves that had contact with Silkwood's hands, and no other source for a plutonium leak could be ascertained despite thorough inspections of the air vents and surrounding surfaces. However, on November 6, despite Silkwood's prior decontamination and self-inspection, a detection on her part the next day yielded more signs of alpha activity on her hands, while health physics staff at the plant subsequently detected further alpha activity on her right forearm, neck and face. On November 7, Silkwood tested positive for very significant levels of alpha activity, and an inspection of her apartment showed high levels of radioactive contamination. Thereafter, Silkwood and two other co-workers personally associated with her (roommate Sherri Ellis and boyfriend Drew Stephens) would be tested at Los Alamos National Laboratory; while the latter two only tested positive for insignificant amounts of plutonium exposure, Silkwood was found to have of plutonium-239 in her lungs, though researcher Dr. George Voelz insisted that this amount was still negligible and non- harmful. Later posthumous measurements taken after Silkwood's death under separate but likewise controversial circumstances were shown to be roughly consistent with the initial findings described by Dr. Voelz, but also indicated that she had somehow ingested plutonium prior to her demise. It would also be found that Karen Silkwood would not have had access to plutonium-239 for months after her transfer from metallography to rod assembly. Allegations that Silkwood's exposure to plutonium-239 was a deliberate act of radiation poisoning are fueled by the fact that she was in possession of potentially compromising evidence that linked Kerr-McGee with egregious safety violations, encompassing unsafe workplace conditions at the plant, faulty manufacture of fuel rod components that posed a potential public safety risk, and even substantial missing plutonium supplies that were unaccounted for; Silkwood also contended that she had evidence that photographs containing evidence of hairline cracks in the fuel rods may have been doctored by company personnel as a cover-up. As Silkwood was coordinating with fellow union members and had been en route to meet a journalist to present and discuss evidence she had found of Kerr-McGee's actions at the time of her death, unverified assertions that Kerr-McGee or other associated parties may have been involved in her radiation exposure and later fatal car accident have circulated in the following period. Intentional or attempted theft of radioactive material For accidental theft or attempted theft of radioactive materials, see the Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents#Trafficking and thefts. Grozny cobalt theft or attempted theft On 13 September 1999, six people attempted to steal radioactive cobalt-60 rods from a chemical plant in the city of Grozny in the Chechen Republic. During the theft, the suspects opened the radioactive material container and handled it, resulting in the deaths of three of the suspects and injury of the remaining three. The suspect who held the material directly in his hands died of radiation exposure 30 minutes later. This incident is described as an attempted theft, but some of the rods are reportedly still missing. Official use of X-ray equipment and other radiation technology by secret police Some former East German dissidents claim that the Stasi used X-ray equipment to induce cancer in political prisoners. After the fall of the Socialist Republic of Romania, files released indicated that the secret police, Securitate, had intentionally induced cancer in striking miners. Similarly, some anti-Castro activists claim that the Cuban secret police sometimes used radioactive isotopes to induce cancer in \\"adversaries they wished to destroy with as little notice as possible\\". In 1997, the Cuban expatriate columnist Carlos Alberto Montaner called this method \\"the Bulgarian Treatment\\", after its alleged use by the Bulgarian secret police. Illicit, fraudulent, and patent medicine In the early 20th century a series of products claiming medicinal properties, which contained radioactive elements were marketed to the general public. This does not include certain medications that contain radioactive isotopes (e.g. iodine-131 for its oncological uses) but pertains to elixirs and other medications that made preposterous claims (see below) that were neither scientific nor verifiable. Radithor, a well known patent medicine or snake oil, is possibly the best known example of radioactive quackery. It consisted of triple distilled water containing at a minimum each of the radium-226 and radium-228 isotopes. Radithor was manufactured from 1918 to 1928 by the Bailey Radium Laboratories, Inc., of East Orange, New Jersey. The head of the laboratories was listed as Dr. William J. A. Bailey, not a medical doctor. It was advertised as \\"A Cure for the Living Dead\\" as well as \\"Perpetual Sunshine\\". These radium elixirs were marketed similar to the way opiates were peddled to the masses with laudanum an age earlier, and electrical cure-alls during the same time period such as the Prostate Warmer. The eventual death of the socialite Eben Byers from Radithor consumption and the associated radiation poisoning led to the strengthening of the Food and Drug Administration's powers and the demise of most radiation based patent medication.

During her thirty-year reign, she worked within the English system, trying to recapture the former power of past paramount chiefs and maintain peaceful unity among the several tribes under her leadership. She was the first of the tribal leaders to sign the Virginia-Indian Treaty of Middle Plantation.\\"Treaty Between Virginia And The Indians\\" In 2004 Cockacoeske was honored as one of the Library of Virginia's \\"Virginia Women in History\\". History The death of Opechancanough in 1646 led to the disintegration of the confederacy built by his brother Powhatan. Chiefs competed to gain power among the various tribes. Among the Pamunkey, Cockacoeske's husband Totopotomoi became leader in 1649. While assisting Col. Edward Hill in removing Rickohockans from their new settlement at the falls of the James River in 1656, Totopotomoi was killed in what was sometimes later called the Battle of Bloody Run (not to be confused with the 1763 Battle of Bloody Run in Michigan).Tucker, Spencer C., The Encyclopedia of North American Indian Wars, 1607‚Äì1890: A Political, Social, and Military History, p. 606 The Virginia Governor's Council later censured Hill for his lack of leadership.Department of Historic Resources, \\"Battle of Bloody Run\\", Historical Marker Number SA-71 Following Totopotomoi's death, the Colonial Government recognized Cockacoeske the Pamunkey \\"Queen\\". When Bacon's Rebellion erupted, Governor Berkeley's faction sought help from the Pamunkey against the hostile tribes, particularly their erstwhile enemies the Susquehannock. Sporadic raids by other Indian tribes against settlers on the colony's frontier contributed to an uprising of whites and blacks excluded from the power structure, led by Nathaniel Bacon. Although of the wealthy planter class, Bacon competed for power with Gov. Berkeley, drawing upon the frontier settler's resentments. Although raids had been perpetrated by the Doeg and Susquehannock tribes, Bacon and his men sought easier wealth, and attacked the peaceful and friendly Pamunkey, Mattaponi, and Kiskiack tribes.Alfred Cave, Lethal Encounters, at p. 151 Thomas Mathew, whose history of cheating the Doeg and Susquehannock Indians who lived in Maryland across the Potomac River, may have actually led to the raid that kills his overseer,Alfred Cave, Lethal Encounters, at pp. 147‚Äì151 described Cockacoeske's behavior when summoned to Jamestown and told to honor treaty obligations by supplying warriors against the other tribes:The Beginning, Progress, and Conclusion of Bacon's Rebellion in Virginia, In the Years 1675 and 1676 Jefferson Papers, American Memory Collections, Library of Congress Although appointed to the Governor's Council after the Pamunkey agreed to supply some warriors against other tribes, Bacon's first attacks were against the Pamunkey, who fled into Dragon Swamp. Governor Berkeley declared Bacon a rebel, but he continued his focus against friendly tribes, also killing the Occoneechees by subterfuge after they had captured a Susquehannock fort but refused to give the English (who had not fought) all the spoils.Alfred Cave, at pp. 155‚Äì156 The assembly at Jamestown attempted to reconcile Bacon and Berkeley, but did not repudiate Bacon's policy of exterminating all Indians. Cockacoeske attempted to throw herself at the mercy of the English, and eventually the Assembly authorized a naval expedition against Bacon's camp in Maryland, which miscarried.Cave at pp. 159‚Äì161 After Bacon died of disease, the rebellion fizzled. The crown appointed a commission which criticized both English parties for their ill treatment of the Pamunkey and other friendly Indians, and stressed the importance of restoring peace.Cave at p. 161 Berkeley sailed to England to protest reforms imposed by London, and died shortly after his after landing in May 1677. Cockacoeske and her son signed the Treaty of Middle Plantation with new Virginia Governor Jeffreys on May 29, 1677 by, which other tribes signed in the following years.Tucker, Spencer C., The Encyclopedia of North American Indian Wars, 1607‚Äì1890: A Political, Social, and Military History, p. 816 Essentially, these tribes accepted their de facto position as subjects of the British Crown, and gave up their remaining claims to their ancestral land, in return for protection from the remaining hostile tribes and a guarantee of a limited amount of reserved land‚Äîthe first Native American reservation to be established in America. Family Cockacoeske's only documented child was her son, John West, born probably around 1656‚Äì57 and \\"reputed the son of an English colonel.\\" On the basis of his name, and birth after her husband's death, he has often been considered an illegitimate son of John West, who established a plantation (now the town of West Point at the confluence of the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers, where they form the York River), or his son John West.

Birren (April 4, 1918 ‚Äì January 15, 2016) was one of the founders of the organized field of gerontology. He was a past president of The Gerontological Society of America, and author of over 250 publications. Personal life Birren was born on April 4, 1918 in Chicago. With the original intent to study engineering, Birren enrolled in Wright Junior College to study technical subjects. Birren changed his mind due to the Great Depression in America and decided to transfer to Chicago Teachers College to pursue what he thought to be a more practical career. It was there he took his first course in psychology, and he was encouraged by his professors to attend graduate school at Northwestern University. Birren was strongly influenced by his time as a graduate student studying experimental psychology at Northwestern University. Birren married his wife, Betty, in 1942. Theories Birren was known for defining aging as three distinct processes: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Birren was the founding dean of the University of Southern California Leonard Davis School of Gerontology and founding director of the Ethel Percy Andrus Gerontology Center, and after his retirement from USC was associated for many years with the UCLA Center on Aging. A leading gerontological theorist in the area of neurocognition and psychology, Birren established much of the framework of modern gerontological theory, such as \\"quality of life\\" as a multidimensional concept involving biological, psychological, and sociocultural domains. Career Birren was considered \\"one of the reigning pioneers of gerontology,\\" by the American Society on Aging.ASA Media Center - Press Release He was instrumental in the growth and expansion of the field of gerontology in the 1950s, and his career spanned six decades. Birren received his PhD from Northwestern University and began his research career at the Naval Medical Research Center. In 1947, he joined the U.S. Public Health Service in Baltimore and did research on aging at the Gerontology unit. Birren attended the very first meeting of GSA, The Gerontological Society of America in 1948. In 1950, he joined the National Institute of Mental Health and created the first section on aging. In 1964, he became the Director for the Program on Aging for the National Institute on Child Health and Human Development. Jim moved to the University of Southern California in 1965 where he remained until 1989. There he was the founding director of the Ethel Percy Andrus Gerontology Center. In 1989, Birren moved to UCLA, where he remained as the Associate Director of the UCLA Center on Aging until he retired in 2003. Birren's early research had an experimental base and he studied cognitive change and aging. Since developing the course Guided Autobiography more than thirty years ago, he has devoted much of his time and energy in the area of autobiographical studies. Birren was also known for serving as a mentor and founding schools in gerontology to promote research on aging. In 1965, Birren moved to California to pursue a new career with The University of Southern California. There, he became the founding dean of the USC Davis School of gerontology. In this position, Birren flourished as a teacher and a mentor, offering degrees in gerontology at the undergraduate, masters, and PhD levels. Throughout his career, he produced over 200 PhDs in gerontology, and many of his students dedicated their careers to publishing literature in the field of gerontology. He also continued publishing literature in the field of gerontology. While the Davis School of Gerontology flourished and gained international recognition, Birren produced multiple editions of the Handbooks of Aging series, including The Handbook of Mental Health and Aging, The Handbook of Psychology and Aging, and The Handbook of Theories of Aging. These compilations include relevant research on the issues of aging and contributed to the development of gerontology as a science. One of Birren‚Äôs lasting contributions to the field is these compilations of research on aging. When Birren became emeritus of The University of Southern California at the age of 71 in 1989, he went on to establish another institution of gerontology. Birren developed the Borun Center for Gerontological Research at University of California, Los Angeles. He eventually became the Associate Director of the Center for Aging at UCLA, and he continued publishing until he retired from the position in 2003.

The parish includes the hamlet of Asney. History Saxon pressure seems to have driven the Britons from the immediate area around 650 A.D. About 700 A.D. the former Celtic monastery at Glastonbury was revived under royal Saxon patronage. By about 740 A.D. the general lines of parish boundaries in this area seem to have been fixed. This early development may well have been due to the organising urges of the monastic authorities. The parish of Walton was part of the Whitley Hundred, which took its name from Whitley Wood in the parish. The name Walton comes from settlement/farmstead of Wealas ‚Äî native Celts which is what the new Anglo Saxon speaking peoples called the native inhabitants of England. There is strong evidence that in many areas of England taken over by Germanic speaking settlers, the native British (Wealas) remained undisturbed, farming the same land they did when the Romans left. Over time they just adopted or forgot their Celtic tongue (similar to Old Welsh/Cornish) for the language and culture of the newcomers in order to climb the social ladder or were coerced to do so. It was in the Anglo Saxon interest that the native British carry on as usual to ensure the economy produced food and goods for the new landowners. Walton was a manor of Glastonbury Abbey at the time of the Domesday Book, which talks about 30 hides. A hide for tax purposes (Danegeld) was counted as about worked under the 3 field system. Thus Walton could have been some , all owned and directly managed by the Abbey.Anonymous history kept in Walton church. With the Dissolution of the monasteries and the scramble for monastic assets, Sir John Thynne of Longleat acquired Walton; lock, stock and barrel. The entire village was owned by the Bath estate until sold by auction in 1939. The population rose slowly from the 150 or so in 1087 to nearly 400 in 1801, and nearly 800 by 1845. Emigration, enclosures and agricultural depression severely drove down the numbers as the 19th century rolled on. With the rise in importance of Street and the growth of a more varied, mobile society, the population started to rise again. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Wells Rural District,A Vision of Britain Through Time : Wells Rural District which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. The village falls within the 'Moor' electoral ward. The ward stretches north to Meare. The total population of the ward at the 2011 census is 2,540. It is also part of the Wells county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Landmarks Walton windmill was described as \\"new-erected\\" in 1741. It was worked until 1906. It is now a private residence. Walton Hill, part of the Polden Hills, on which there are remains of ancient earthworks, rises south of the village. The hill is part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Religious sites A Norman church was erected at about 1150 and rebuilt about 1350, when Street church was going up. Street was one of the 'seven churches' claimed by the Abbey under the Ina charter. Walton was in effect a chapelry of Street but the rectors of Street ‚Äî when resident ‚Äî lived at Walton in some style. The Old Parsonage is believed to be what remains of the monastic manor courthouse with an attached house. The Church of The Holy Trinity was rebuilt in 1866 by John Norton with carved work by Seymour of Taunton. It is a Grade II listed building. Notable residents There is no evidence in the parish registers or other documents pertaining to Walton to support the popular notion the family of William Henry Smith the founder of W H Smith came from Walton. This idea seems to have taken root from William Henry SMITH's father having Walton as a middle name and is more likely to have been either the surname of a relative, friend or business associate. It could also be a mistrancription of Walter.

It runs from Heidelberg Road in Alphington, crosses the Yarra River, then continues across the Eastern Freeway, then terminates at an intersection with Princess Street and Earl Street. Its total length is less than 2 kilometres, leading to the claim that it is \\"the shortest highway in the world\\".Only Melbourne.com For a city of its size, the Chandler Highway is one of very few river crossings in Melbourne. History The Chandler Highway was originally planned to continue east along the former rail corridor to where Earl, Asquith and Valerie Streets intersect. The highway was to end at High Street in East Kew, and although the route is still listed as a 'proposed arterial' in recent editions of the Melway street directory, the reserve has been landscaped. At the diamond interchange with the Eastern Freeway, there are visible pavements reserved for smooth (elevated) entry/ exit ramps to be constructed. These proposals are illustrated in the early eighties editions of the Melway directory, but are unlikely to be built. Some or all of Chandler Highway was renamed from Fulham Road.According to it was renamed in 1994. The 1966 Melway appears to contradict this: Chandler Highway and Bridge Act 1954 The 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan shows the Chandler Highway as part of the F6 Freeway corridor which would eventually link up to the Mornington Peninsula Freeway.  Railway bridge  Until 2019, the Yarra River crossing was over a bridge originally completed in 1891 as part of the Outer Circle railway line, that ran from Fairfield station to East Camberwell station, and then south to Oakleigh. The section of railway occupied by the highway closed in 1893, although the rail remained on it until at least 1919, and the viaduct was widened in the 1950s. After 1919, a single-track railway line ran through the middle of the Heidelberg Road-Chandler Highway intersection, with the opening of the Australian Paper Manufacturers siding, which made use of the old Outer Circle route from Fairfield station to the entrance of the company's factory. The siding was removed in the mid-1990s. Congestion Until the opening of the new bridge in March 2019, the highway was badly congested with traffic, since the four-lane highway needed to be funnelled into the two lanes of the old railway bridge to cross the Yarra. The bridge on the Chandler Highway regularly featured highly in the RACV/Leader bi-annual Redspot survey of Melbourne's worst points of traffic congestion, and in 2014 was named in the survey as the worst point of congestion in Melbourne. New bridge proposals The bridge sits on the boundary of the State Electoral Districts of Kew and Northcote. The State Member for Northcote, Fiona Richardson (Labor) led a community campaign during the term of Premier John Brumby (2007 - 2010) in advocating for the bridge to be duplicated. In October 2010, VicRoads released four proposed options for improving the Yarra River crossing with a new bridge:Northcote Leader: Hopes for Chandler Highway bridge fix *add an additional two lane bridge on either the east or west side of the existing bridge. The existing bridge would be retained as a two lane road bridge bringing the total lanes up to four. *add an additional four lane bridge on either the east or west side of the existing bridge. The existing bridge would be used as a pedestrian/cycle bridge. Local cycle groups wanted to see this bridge full integrated into the shared path network via the Yarra Trail and the Anniversary Trail with an extension of the Anniversary Trail to Fairfield railway station.Boroondara BUG - Chandler Hwy Environs With the Northcote electorate being one of the few battleground contests between Labor and the Greens Political Parties at the 2010 State Election, the Chandler Highway Bridge became a key election issue. The Labor Party committed to duplicating the bridge, while the Greens opposed such duplication. The seat was subsequently held by Labor, but the Party lost the state election to the Liberal National Coalition government. Plans to duplicate the bridge halted. In the intervening period the Amcor Paper Mill on the corner of Heidelberg Rd and Chandler Highway, Alphington ceased operations and vacated the site in 2012 before it was sold in mid 2013.http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/amcor- mill-site-sells-for-120-million-20130629-2p48r.html Successive State governments gave high level approval for residential development at the site subject to detailed planning, to address the likely increased traffic congestion in an already gridlocked area. On 15 June 2014 Labor Opposition Leader Daniel Andrews and Fiona Richardson announced that Labor would commit $110 million to fixing Chandler Highway with construction works to commence immediately, if Labor was elected to govern at the 2014 State Election to be held on 29 November.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/labor-vows-to- duplicate-chandler-highway-bridge-to-ease-congestion/story- fni0fit3-1226954968824  Bridge duplication  New bicycle path underpass works at Chandler Highway March 2019 Upon its election in 2014, the Labor government announced that construction would proceed on a new six-lane bridge on the western side. This met with some objections by residents, concerned about the proximity of the road to their residences, but the then Roads Minister Luke Donnellan stated that this was a more environmentally sensitive option, which allowed Guide Dogs Victoria to continue operating on their present site. Construction commenced in mid 2017. In March 2019 all six lanes were opened to traffic, with the old railway bridge converted for use by pedestrians and cyclists. The project also included the construction of a bicycle underpass under the Chandler Hwy for the Main Yarra Trail, eradicating the need for cyclists to ascend 79 steps to reach the Highway and regain the Trail on the other side.

He is best known for his involvement with the Vienna Aktionists and the group of films that resulted, although this accounts for only a part of his career, and he later returned to the Structural roots of his third film 3/60: B√§ume Im Herbst. Although not a seminal Structural film, 31/75: Asyl is arguably one of the more satisfying films of the movement. Biography Kren was born in 1929 in Vienna, Austria to a Jewish father and German mother. From 1939 until the end of World War II Kren lived in Rotterdam, where he was sent with one of the Children's Transports. In 1947 Kren returned to Vienna, and his father provided him a job at the National Bank, where he was also an employee. He began his film career in the early 1950s, creating experimental short 8mm films. In 1957 he moved to the 16mm format. In 1966, Kren participated along with artists like Yoko Ono, Wolf Vostell, Peter Weibel and Al Hansen in the Destruction in Art Symposium in London led by Gustav Metzger.Destruction in Art Symposium (DIAS), London, 1966. In 1968 he visited the United States for the first time, showing his films in New York City and St. Louis. After a participation in a happening \\"Kunst und Revolution\\" (\\"Art and Revolution\\") at the University of Vienna in 1968, Kren's films were confiscated and he was fired from the National Bank. Kren participated in 1970 in the International Underground Film Festival (London, UK) and 1971 in the Cannes Film Festival. He moved to Cologne, Germany for five years. Retrospective screenings of his work took place in 1976 in National Film Theatre, London, 1978 in New York City, 1979 in Museum of Modern Art, New York. From 1978 until 1989 Kurt Kren lived in the United States, sometimes just in a car, traveling, making presentations and lectures at universities, film schools and the Houston Museum of Fine Arts. In the early 1980s Kren alternated between living in Austin, Texas and Houston, Texas. He began frequenting the Texas punk rock clubs and became a fixture of the early Houston punk rock scene. Kren became good friends with punk rock band Really Red and often would show his films as a backdrop to their Texas shows. The band paid tribute to their collaborator on their New Strings for Old Puppets EP with the song \\"Ode to Kurt Kren\\". From 1983 until 1989 Kren worked as a security officer at the Museum of Fine Arts (Houston, United States). Kren returned to his native Vienna in 1989. In the 1990s his works were presented worldwide, also by the major museums and cinemas. He was a co- founder of the Vienna Institute of Direct Art and the Austria Filmmakers Cooperative.

The parish includes the village of Cloford. History The name of the village comes from the Old English and means Waendel's tree. The Bishop of Wells had an estate in the parish before the Norman Conquest which supported a prebend at Wells Cathedral. The estate was split in two with one first called East Wanstrow, and later Church Wanstrow supporting Wells Cathedral and West Wanstrow, Wanstrow Rogers and Wanstrow Buller was given by Hugh Sexey to support the hospital at Bruton. The parish was part of the hundred of Frome. The village was involved in the production of coarse earthenware, using clay dug on Wanstrow Common, until 1826. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

White, one of the co-founders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, has been extremely influential on the church, which considers her a prophet, understood today as an expression of the New Testament spiritual gift of prophecy. She was a voluminous writer and popular speaker on health and temperance. Her teachings are preserved today through over 50,000 manuscript pages of her writings, and the records of others.  Theology  Her theology was Christ-centered, particularly since the 1888 Minneapolis General Conference. Her Christology (understanding of the nature of Jesus). See Reprinted with permission by Andrews University Press. Berrien Springs, MI (February 1992). She promoted the Great Controversy theme, as outlined in her book. It has been disputed by some whether she taught one could feel assurance of salvation. Jerry Moon argues that she did.http://www.andrews.edu/~jmoon/Documents/GSEM_534/Class_outline/Assurance%202004.pdf But most Adventists do not believe in the doctrine of 'Once Saved Always Saved' as the church holds Arminian theology, and hence does not teach a \\"once-saved-always-saved\\" philosophy. Arthur Patrick believes that White was an \\"evangelical\\", in that she had high regard for the Bible, saw the cross as central, supported righteousness by faith, believed in Christian activism, and sought to restore New Testament Christianity.Arthur Patrick, \\"An Adventist and an Evangelical in Australia? The Case of Ellen White In The 1890s.\\" in Lucas: An Evangelical History Review No. 12, December 1991 By contrast, one study of Ellen White places both her and early Adventism within the context of the materialist theology of the times, seeing this to inform her Christology as well as other aspects of her teachings that are now outdated and do not correspond to contemporary Adventist views. By the same token, the study sees her as a precursor of monist covenantalism.Thomas McElwain, Adventism and Ellen White: A Phenomenon of Religious Materialism Studies on Inter-religious Relations 48, Swedish Science Press, 2010 White once wrote: \\"The greatest want of the world is the want of men‚Äîmen who will not be bought or sold, men who in their inmost souls are true and honest, men who do not fear to call sin by its right name, men whose conscience is as true to duty as the needle to the pole, men who will stand for the right though the heavens fall.\\" Ellen White avoided using the word \\"Trinity\\", \\"and her husband stated categorically that her visions did not support the Trinitarian creed.\\" Her theology did not include a doctrine of the Trinity.  Music  Ellen White wrote many times about music and its strong effects on the intellect and spirit. She was clearly a believer in music's use in worship, but advocated care in implementation. After a 1900 camp meeting with sensational music, she wrote the following: \\"The things you have described as taking place in Indiana, the Lord has shown me would take place Just before the close of probation. Every uncouth thing will be demonstrated. There will be shouting, with drums, music, and dancing. The senses of rational beings will become so confused that they cannot be trusted to make right decisions. And this is called the moving of the Holy Spirit.\\"2nd Selected Messages, p. 36-38., Ellen White Her argument is that God's aspect of the Holy Spirit never uses such disarray. She continues that \\"no encouragement should be given to this kind of worship,\\" as worshippers are excited by a power they wrongly assume to be God's. She said, \\"Those things which have been in the past will be in the future. Satan will make music a snare by the way in which it is conducted. God calls upon His people, who have the light before them in the Word and in the Testimonies, to read and consider, and to take heed. Clear and definite instruction has been given in order that all may understand. But the itching desire to originate something new results in strange doctrines, and largely destroys the influence of those who would be a power for good if they held firm the beginning of their confidence in the truth the Lord had given them.\\" Believers should hold to that which has been proven beneficial and steer away from that which can ensnare such as popular, or secular forms of music. In her book Education, White writes about the use of music for the uplift of souls. She writes that music \\"is one of the most effective means of impressing the heart with spiritual truth. . . . As a part of religious service, singing is as much an act of worship as is prayer. Indeed, many a song is prayer. . . . Heaven's communion begins on earth. We learn here the keynote of its praise.\\"Education, pg. 168 White believed that music had a special power, and could vastly benefit the listener if used correctly. Quite simply put, according to White, \\"Music, when not abused, is a great blessing; but when it is put to a wrong use, it is a terrible curse.\\"Testimonies, vol. 1, pg. 497.  End times  She described a \\"shaking\\" in the end times.Ellen White, \\"The Shaking\\" section in Early Writings, p269‚Äì73.

Gordon, \\"E. G. White's Role in Ministering to God's End-time Remnant\\". Journal of the Adventist Theological Society 2:2 (Autumn 1991), p217; as cited elsewhere See the compilation of her end-time views by former White Estate director Robert W. Olson.Ellen White Comments on the Crisis Ahead: Answers to Questions About the End-Time, compiled by Robert Olson. Review and Herald, 2000  Health  White expounded greatly on the subject of health and nutrition, as well as healthy eating and a balanced diet. At her behest, the Seventh-day Adventist Church first established the Western Health Reform Institute in Battle Creek, Michigan in 1866 to care for the sick as well as to disseminate health instruction.\\"Adventist Health,\\" Company Histories, FundingUniverse Over the years, other Adventist sanitariums were established around the country. These sanitariums became hospitals, forming the backbone of the Adventists' medical network and, in 1972, forming the Adventist Health System. The beginnings of this health ministry are found in a vision that White had in 1863. The vision was said to have occurred during a visit by James and Ellen White to Otsego, Michigan to encourage the evangelistic workers there.E.G. White, Review & Herald, Oct. 8, 1867; Counsels on Diets and Foods, p. 481. White wrote in 1864 that tobacco was \\"a slow, insidious, but most malignant poison.\\" Later text spoke of a member of the church called Doctor Osborn who had not quit, saying that despite his use of tobacco, the judgment lodged against him was more offensive. She was also critical of the consumption of alcohol, saying: \\"Moderate drinking is the school in which men are educated for the drunkard‚Äôs career.\\" Early in 1866, responding to the instruction given to White on Christmas Day in 1865Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, p.489 that Seventh-day Adventists should establish a health institute for the care of the sick and the imparting of health instruction, plans were laid for the Western Health Reform Institute, which opened in September, 1866.Battle Creek Sanitarium While the Whites were in and out of Battle Creek from 1865 to 1868, James White's poor physical condition led them to move to a small farm near Greenville, Michigan. White argued that \\"drugs do not cure disease\\" and that \\"in most cases, the drug only changes the form and location of the disease.\\" White's idea of health reform included vegetarianism in a day and age where \\"meat and two vegetables\\" was the standard meal for a typical North American. Her health message inspired a health food revolution starting with John Harvey Kellogg in his creation of Corn Flakes. He also is credited as the inventor of granola after she requested he make a product that was \\"very similar\\" to it. The Sanitarium Health Food Company as it is now known was also started by this health principle. Adhering to the principles outlined in the health reform, John Harvey Kellogg differed from his brother's views on the sugar content of their Corn Flake breakfast cereal. The latter started Kellogg Company. White championed a vegetarianism that was intended to be not only physically, but also spiritually helpful to humans, and also to treat God's creatures with love and respect.Ministry of Healing pg. 315 The vegetarian diet that she recommends for her followers is said to contribute to their higher than average longevity. White prescribes that her followers drink six to eight glasses of water per day. Her views are expressed in many of her writings such as Important Facts Of Faith: Laws Of Health, And Testimonies, Nos. 1‚Äì10 (1864), Healthful Living (1897, 1898), The Ministry of Healing (1905), The Health Food Ministry (1970), and Counsels on Diet and Foods (1938).  Education  Proper Education, 1872 Ellen White's earliest essays on Education appeared in the 1872 autumn editions of the Health Reformer. In her first essay, she stated that working with youthful minds was the most delicate of tasks. The manner of instruction should be varied. This would make it possible for the \\"high and noble powers of the mind\\" to have a chance to develop. To be qualified to educate the youth, parents and teachers must have self-control, gentleness and love. Education has a Broad Scope To White, Education is \\"more than merely having a knowledge of books. It takes in everything that is good, virtuous, righteous, and holy. It comprehends the practice of temperance, godliness, brotherly kindness, and love to God, and to each other. In order to attain this object, the physical, mental, moral, and religious education of children must have attention.\\" Teach Students How to Think, Act and Decide She makes a distinction between simple training and education. The education of children should not be like the training of dumb animals. Children need to be shown how to use their own intelligent will to rule themselves. Children who are taught self-control will have moral energy and a sense of individual responsibility. Once students are taught self-control, the teacher should show them how to strengthen their weaker faculties. In this way they will cultivate a balanced mind. They need to be taught how to think, act, and decide for themselves. They should be encouraged to develop their own judgment and to have an opinion of their own. This is done by giving them opportunity to exercise their own judgment, \\"as fast and as far as practicable.\\" Respect for Experienced Judgment Students should be taught to respect the experienced judgment of their parents and teachers. The relationship should be one of guidance; a respectful meeting of the minds. When they eventually go out on their own, they do so with the guiding ideas shared with them. Thus, they are able to stand strong. Complete Control Causes Future Problems \\"That class of teachers who are gratified that they have almost complete control of the will of their scholars are not the most successful teachers, although the appearance for the time being may be flattering. God never designed that one human mind should be under the complete control of another human mind.\\" The most successful teachers over time are those who educate their students to use the power within to stand for principle. \\"Their work may not show to the very best advantage to careless observers, and their labors may not be valued as highly as the teacher who holds the will and mind of his scholars by absolute authority; but the future lives of the pupils will show the fruits of the better plan of education.\\" Ellen White's idea of creating a Christian educational system and its importance in society is detailed in her writings Christian Education (1893, 1894) and Education (1903).  Church leadership  Ellen White wrote of Jesus as the believer's leader. According to White, Jesus was the leader of the Israelites in the Wilderness \\"enshrouded in the pillar of cloud.\\" She presented leadership concepts in connection with Biblical leaders: e.g. Moses,Patriarchs and Prophets, Chapter 43, \\"Moses\\" Joshua,Joshua, A Wise, Consecrated Leader, The Story of Redemption, p. 181 Nehemiah See also Ellen White on Leadership by Cindy Tutsch.Ellen White on Leadership: Guidance for Those Who Influence Others by Cindy Tutsch.
