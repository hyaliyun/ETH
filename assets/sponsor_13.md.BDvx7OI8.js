It was released on August 23, 2003 and independently distributed by Real Music Group after being dropped from Sony Discos. The recording followed her two previous studio albums which were commercially unsuccessful and a hiatus from her musical career beginning in 1999. It featured collaborations with Latin hip hop artists including Mexicano 777, Bimbo and K-7 while the album's production was handled by a variety of musical producers; Luny Tunes, DJ Nelson, Noriega, and Iván Joy were enlisted, while DJ Adam produced a majority of the tracks. Lyrically, the album explored female empowerment, infidelity, heartbreak and love with \\"a veritable compendium of her artistic passion, femininity, and culture\\". The musical styles of the recording alternate between reggaetón and hip-hop while Queen experiments with R&B;, dancehall, and pop balladry. Diva spawned a total of seven singles: \\"Quiero Bailar\\", \\"Quiero Saber\\", \\"Papi Te Quiero\\", \\"Guillaera\\", \\"Tuya Soy\\", \\"Tu No Puedes\\", and \\"Súbelo\\", which were released over the course of three years. \\"Quiero Bailar\\" became a commercial success and her first big hit in the United States and Puerto Rico, while the other six singles failed to acquire chart success on national charts. Highly anticipated and acclaimed, Diva peaked at number twenty-four on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart, number eight on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart for the South Atlantic area, number four on the Billboard Reggae Albums and number one on the Billboard Tropical Albums chart. It became the eighth best-selling Tropical Album of 2004, while the recording helped Queen to become the eighth best-selling Tropical Artist of that year. The album was recognized as a \\"door-opener\\" for reggaetón's mainstream exposure in 2004. Background After the failed commercial success of Ivy Queen's first two studio albums, En Mi Imperio (1997) and The Original Rude Girl (1998), she was dropped from the Sony label and took a hiatus from her musical career in 1999. The 1999 single, \\"In The Zone\\", a duet with Haitian singer Wyclef Jean, was a moderate success in the United States. The following single \\"Ritmo Latino\\" and its parent album, were overlooked by consumers and failed to chart. However, The Original Rude Girl was critically acclaimed by many including an editor for Allmusic who awarded the album four out of five stars and listed it as a selected \\"Allmusic Pick\\". This occurred after she left Sony and stepped out of Wyclef Jean's shadow. In 2001 and 2002, Queen began appearing on reggaetón compilation albums spawning hits like \\"Quiero Bailar\\" from The Majestic 2 and \\"Quiero Saber\\" from Kilates. In 2003, Queen and her then-husband Gran Omar signed with Real Music, an independent label based in Miami, Florida and established by Jorge Guadalupe and Anthony Pérez. They appeared on the label's first album Jams Vol. 1 which Pérez released after several major record labels turned him down. She benefited from Pérez producing the \\"important reggaetón television show\\" The Roof, which aired on Mun2 and detailed urban music and lifestyle by frequently appearing and performing on the show. Recording and production Recording sessions for the album began in 2000 and ended in 2003 in various recording studios. Queen recorded at After Dark Studios in Cartersville, Georgia; Boricua Music Studios in Bridgeport, Connecticut; Flow Music Studios in San Juan, Puerto Rico; Imperio Music Studios in the Bronx, New York; Los Angeles Recording in California; The Lab Studios and Mad Jim Studios. Production of the album were handled by a variety of musical producers. Queen's principal songwriter for her previous albums, DJ Nelson, produced the track \\"Quiero Saber\\". Luny Tunes, Noriega, Iván Joy, Ecko, DJ Alex, DJ Eric, Rafi Mercenario, Tony \\"CD\\" Kelly and Omar Navarro also contribute to musical production while DJ Adam produced eight of the fifteen tracks. Collaborations on the album include \\"Guillaera\\", \\"Money Making\\", which also features rapper Japanese, the remix of \\"Babe\\" and \\"Quiero Saber\\" with her then-husband Gran Omar; \\"Sangre\\" with Mexicano 777; \\"Bounce\\" with Bimbo; and \\"Dile Que Ya\\" with K-7. Release and promotion The recording was released on August 19, 2003 and independently distributed by Real Music Group. On January 27, 2004, Diva: Platinum Edition was released with remixes to songs on the standard edition. These include \\"Papi Te Quiero\\", an English remix of \\"Papi Te Quiero\\", a reggaetón remix of \\"Tu No Puedes\\", \\"Quiero Saber\\" and \\"Quiero Bailar\\". It was released in the United Kingdom on February 3, 2004. In August 2003, Queen appeared at the first Reggaetón Superfest, which drew a crowd of 12,000 at Madison Square Garden.https://mobile.nytimes.com/2003/08/12/arts/pop-review-a- caribbean-party-with-a-hip-hop-beat.html Queen embarked on a worldwide tour, the Reggaeton Tour 2004 in support for Diva. On one of the legs in Ecuador, she performed \\"Papi Te Quiero\\" and \\"Tu No Puedes\\", which was her first South American tour. This followed presentations in Atlanta, Brooklyn and New York City where she was \\"designated as the Puerto Rico Youth God Mother of the National Puerto Rican Day Parade\\" in June 2004. Often referring to herself as \\"la perra\\" (bitch) and \\"la potra\\" (female mare), the latter \\"points to her calls of female sexual agency\\", as this is similar to the metaphor \\"black stallion\\" for phallic potency.Universal Music Latino. 2004. Ivy Queen: The Original Rude Girl. DVD. United States: Real Music. Universal Product Code: 880957025093. Queen desired to name the album La Potra, however, Universal Music Latino would not sign off on the title as they considered it to be too threatening. Composition Diva is a mixture of \\"reggaetón and rap fusion\\". The musical styles of the recording alternated between reggaetón and hip-hop while Queen experimented with R&B;, pop, and tropical music genres. Its lyrics feature \\"beat-happy female-empowerment anthems\\". The introductory to the album asserts herself as the \\"queen\\", using the metaphor of a boxing match, with phrases like \\"one more round\\", in which she uses to \\"express her role as the queen and diva of reggaetón\\". Making the connection of the sport of boxing to reggaetón, which are both a male-dominated arena; Queen \\"alludes to her previous video for \\"Muchos Quieren Tumbarme\\" (Many Want To Knock Me Down) in which she takes the role of a female boxer, while also referring to women's power as underestimated. \\"Guillaera\\" (Attitude), a duet with Gran Omar, explains what type of man she does and does not desire. According to Kalefa Sanneh of The New York Times, \\"Drama\\" sets her \\"rapid-fire monologue atop a sublime, head-nodding hip-hop beat.\\" On \\"Tuya Soy\\", (I'm Yours) she explains \\"the story of woman who suspects her husband of infidelity\\", a controversial theme which has been prominent in Queen's lyrical content. \\"Bésame\\", (Kiss Me) is an evocative theme, expressing the need to go to the dance floor with the guy she like. \\"Me Acostumbré\\" (I Got Accustomed) and \\"Dile Que Ya\\" (Tell Him Okay) are \\"hip-hop ballads\\". \\"Alerta\\" (Alert) features \\"choppy rhythms, handclaps, and vaguely nefarious horns, plus an ingratiating synth line played by a one-fingered android\\". \\"Venganza\\", (Vengeance) speaks up against the mistreatment of women, which embodies what Queen represents within her musical compositions. The mid-tempo, \\"bubble-gum pop\\" \\"Papi Te Quiero\\" (Daddy I Love You), named one of the album's biggest hits, \\"pairs a straightforward love song with the well known reggae riddim Buyout.\\" Ramiro Burr of Billboard stated \\"Papi Te Quiero\\" showcases how \\"effortlessly and quickly she alternately sings and raps, claiming that she has a distinct vocal style that evokes Gwen Stefani\\". Although, the literal translation of \\"Papi Te Quiero\\" is \\"Daddy I Love You\\", it is not directed towards Queen's father but to her love interest; \\"Papi\\" can be translated to \\"baby\\". \\"Quiero Bailar\\" (I Want To Dance) incorporates the Liquid riddim, a musical riddim produced by the \\"Jamaican cross-over guru\\" Jeremy Harding.Román, Miriam Jiménez and Flores, Juan. The Afro-Latin@ Reader: History and Culture in the United States. Duke University Press, 2010, p. 401. The song's lyrics \\"warn her dance partner not to misinterpret her moves.\\" She degrades her partner who thinks that just because she dances with him that she is automatically going to have sexual relations with him. Critical reception The album garnered mainly positive reviews from critics. Sarah Bardeen of Rhapsody said the album established Queen as \\"the voice for women\\", complimenting her \\"self-assured delivery\\". She claimed that the tracks in which featured guest artists \\"get the sense that the guys she's trading verses with are trying to keep up with her and not the other way around,\\" noting that the platinum edition \\"launched the monster hit \\"Quiero Bailar\\". Rachel Devitt, also writing for Rhapsody, categorized the album as \\"Urban Latin\\" music. Michael Endelman of Entertainment Weekly called the album their number one pick for crossover success in the United States while complimenting the \\"catchy hooks and sticky grooves\\" found on the album. Kalefa Sanneh of The New York Times said \\"[Queen] celebrates her hybrid genre by refusing to stay put\\", while claiming Queen to sometimes depart from \\"reggaeton's sharp, steady shuffle to explore other rhythms\\". She later said that the album would make Queen a \\"likely candidate for crossover success, if only she didn't sing in Spanish\\". An editor for the Chicago Tribune selected the album as one of three to \\"add to your reggaetón collection\\" other than Daddy Yankee's Barrio Fino (2004). The writer noted the included hits (\\"Quiero Bailar\\" and \\"Papi Te Quiero\\"), along with \\"[the album's] handful of remixes–and a whole lot of attitude\\". The album was highly anticipated and acclaimed and widely regarded as a factor in reggaeton's mainstream exposure in 2004 along with her next studio album Real (2004), Daddy Yankee's Barrio Fino and Tego Calderon's El Enemy de los Guasíbiri (2004), after being certified Platinum in the Latin field signifying sales of over 100,000 by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).Carney Smith, Jessie. Encyclopedia of African American Popular Culture. ABC-CLIO, 2010, p. 1199. The album was listed on The Washington Post’s list of the \\"Best Old Albums Rediscovered in 2017.\\" Jonathan Widran of Allmusic described \\"Quiero Bailar\\" as a song that \\"gets the party and people moving\\" and as well as being one of Queen's hits. Kid Curry, of Rhythmic Top 40 WPOW (Power 96) cites Ivy Queen's release of \\"Yo Quiero Bailar\\" as \\"the last reggaetón super-hit\\". In 2017, the song was included on Billboard's 12 Best Dancehall & Reggaeton Choruses of the 21st Century at number ten. Later that year, the online magazine Pop Sugar listed the song as one of the best reggaeton songs of all time. It was also listed as one of 15 essential Reggaetón songs that are not \\"Despacito.\\" Rolling Stone ranked the song on its chronological list of the 50 Greatest Latin Pop Songs of all time. The song ranked at number 60 on NPR Music's list of the 200 Best Songs by 21st Century Women. \\"Papi Te Quiero\\" was selected as one of the hits from \\"The Golden Era of Reggaetón\\" which lasted from 2003 until 2007 by Jesus Trivino of Latina magazine. The album was nominated for \\"Reggaeton Album of the Year\\" at the 2005 Billboard Latin Music Awards where she was also nominated for \\"Tropical Airplay Track of the Year, Female\\" and \\"Tropical Airplay Track of the Year, New Artist\\". Commercial performance Diva was a commercial success, peaking at number twenty-four on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart. On the Billboard Top Heatseekers (South Atlantic) chart, the recording peaked at number eight. Diva peaked at number four on the Billboard Reggae Albums chart. On the Billboard Tropical Albums chart, Diva peaked at number one, spending four nonconsecutive weeks at the top with a total of 86 weeks on the chart, becoming the eighth best-selling Tropical Album of 2004. This also made Queen the eighth best-performing Tropical Artist of 2004 as well. In 2005, the album managed to peak at number seventeen on the Billboard Latin Rhythm Albums chart. On the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart, \\"Quiero Bailar\\" debuted at number thirty-five for the week of September 3, 2005, becoming the \\"Hot Shot Debut\\" of that week and peaked at number twenty- nine for the week of September 17, 2005. While on the Billboard Latin Rhythm Songs chart, it peaked at number eight for the week of October 29, 2005. It debuted under the name \\"Yo Quiero Bailar\\" at number thirty-seven on the week of December 20, 2003 and peaked at number twenty-four for the issue dated January 17, 2004 on the Billboard Tropical Songs chart. The song re-entered the Billboard Tropical Songs chart under the name \\"Quiero Bailar\\" at number thirty-six on the week of March 6, 2004 and peaked at number sixteen for the week of July 9, 2005. It became the first Spanish-language track to reach number one on Miami's WPOW Rhythmic Top 40, an American radio station based in Miami, Florida that does not usually play Spanish music. She explained: \\"I've worked very hard in my career, but I get surprised because I've never expected to get to these places.\\" She added: \\"When I read Sony's reports and they tell me my albums are being heard in London and my song is number one, I [got] surprised and look[ed] for explanations.\\" The other five singles did not gain significant airplay in the United States, however, they were heard on Miami's WPOW Rhythmic Top 40. Kid Curry, of the station commented that the commercial failure of these songs are the fault of the record label. According to him, labels were not servicing reggaetón singles at the time and that he was receiving them \\"by word-of-mouth\\". By March 2004, the original version of the album had sold 10,000 units in the United States and Puerto Rico.

Biography Wadenius was born in Stockholm, Sweden, where he attended Adolf Fredrik's Music School. After appearing on a number of Swedish hit records and being founder-member of two Swedish supergroups of the early 1970s, Made in Sweden (1966–1972 and 1976) and (1971–1972), he relocated to the United States to become lead guitarist of the US group Blood, Sweat & Tears from 1972 to 1975. In 1979 he joined The Saturday Night Live Band on television. He stayed on until 1985 and has since worked for many important artists as a session player and/or touring musician, among them Steely Dan, Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross, Dr. John, David Sanborn, James Brown, Marianne Faithfull, Kent, Paul Simon, Joe Thomas, Dionne Warwick, Roberta Flack, Donald Fagen, Doug Katsaros, Michael Franks, and Luther Vandross, as well as many important artists in Sweden. In 1970, he received a Swedish Grammis for Made in Sweden and another for his work on children's songs. In recent years he has spent more time producing other Scandinavian performers, including Anne Sofie von Otter, and in 2001 he set up a recording studio in Oslo, Norway.

Lengthsmen were used on canals and railways from the beginnings of both.Russell 1991, On land, lengthsmen might be responsible for a few miles between adjacent villages and especially on commonage. Employed originally by the 'Lords of the Manor' and latterly by parish councils, they would keep grass and weeds down in verges, keep drainage ditches clear and repair fences. Litter, such as it was in those times, was cleared and instances are recorded of wild flowers being planted and tended. The 21st century Lengthsman Lengthsmen are still employed on land by some parish councils (or groups of councils to enable financing) but security of tenure is tenuous. (e.g. Wyre Council employed a lengthsman at Kepple Lane in 2011).http://www.wyre.gov.uk/info/200313/parks/849/kepple_lane_park In 2003 Worcestershire County Council piloted a scheme which ran until 2006. Lengthsman tasks on land in the 21st century are/were biased towards tending areas of a central \\"common\\" or greens and minor drainage matters. The term was picked up by [the English organisation] National Parks of England and Wales who used volunteers with specific rural skills to engage on \\"special projects\\" including hedge-laying and wall-building and sometimes training or familiarising \\"untrained\\" volunteers. As of 2016 there is no mention of lengthsmen on the National Parks website. Since 2018 Shenstone Parish Council in Staffordshire has employed a Lengthsman on a 2 days per week basis to keep its 3 Wards of Shenstone, Stonnall and Little Aston clear of litter, its verges trimmed and tidy, maintain ditches and make repairs to bus-shelters, benches fences and footpaths. This has proven far more cost effective and resulted in far speedier conclusion of work than going through the usual system of contracting though or via the higher tiers such as the District or County Council. The Lengthsman on Canals A lengthsman's cottage on the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal in Lowsonford in 2016 Lengthsmen were used specifically on the English canal system from its inception in the late 18th century, being responsible especially for lengths of towpath and, in the absence of a lock-keeper, for locks, their trappings and surroundings. Many earlier lengthsmen were accommodated in isolated cottages which, if close to a lock, might include lock-keeper duties, including management of water levels and control of weirs. Canal lengthsmen were also responsible for repair and maintenance of banks on their \\"length\\", including cutting reeds and vegetation and treading puddle clay into sections of bank which were weak or suffering from leakage. A feature of the Thames and Severn Canal was the provision of accommodation specifically for lengthsmen. These buildings were circular and had three floors. Five examples, dating from the 1790s, remain to this day. This includes cottages at Chalford and Lowsonford (illustrated alongside. The Grand Union Lengthsmen Through the winter of 2015/16, [Grand Union Canal milestones between Brentford and Braunston had their GPS coordinates recorded by a volunteer lengthsman en route between the terminals, as a \\"Special Lengthsman Project\\" and about forty had a daffodil bulb dug in alongside, for future identification. Potential GU lengthsman groups and individuals were identified en route at the Slough Arm, at Coxley, Stoke Breurne and Blisworth. Active teams operate on the Slough Arm of the Grand Union Canal and the southern reaches of the Grand Union Canal. Croxley Green on the Herts Berks borders was involved through Croxley Green Parish Council via their \\"Towpath Taskforce\\" endeavour in liaison with the https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/volunteer/ways-to-volunteer/towpath-taskforce Canal & River Trust.

Early life Frank Bischof was born at Gowrie Junction, Queensland, on 12 October 1904, the fourth child in a family of nine, and grew up on a dairy farm. He attended Toowoomba Grammar School, and worked in a cheese factory before joining the Queensland Police Force in 1925. He married Dorothy Gledhill on 22 February 1930 at St Mary's Anglican Church in Alderley, Brisbane. Queensland Police Bischof in 1931 Stationed with the Criminal Investigation Branch (CIB) in Brisbane, he was promoted to sergeant in 1939 and inspector in 1949. He studied in Britain (including Scotland Yard) and Europe, returning to Australia in 1950 and investigating the Bulimba elections fraud. Described as 'the Big Fella' – Bischof was tall and weighed – he gained thirty-two convictions in thirty-three murder investigations. In 1955 he became head of the CIB. In January 1958 Bischof was appointed Commissioner of Police by Premier of Queensland, Frank Nicklin. The appointment was criticised as a political one by the opposition Labor Party, which felt that at least two other senior officers were more suitable. Tony Fitzgerald, who between 1987 and 1989 headed a commission of inquiry into corruption in Queensland, commented on page 31 of his report that the appointment of Bischof, who was a Mason, marked a deliberate transition away from the previously dominant Irish- Catholic \\"Green Mafia\\" influence in the Queensland Police, particularly since Bischof was appointed over the head of the more senior James Edward Donovan, a Catholic. Bischof discussing the 1963 Police Ball with three debutantes from the Main Roads Department As commissioner, Bischof set about boosting police morale and the image they portrayed to the Queensland public. He implemented a series of transfers and promotions, and set up a Public Relations Bureau as part of his plans. He attended many public functions to encourage co-operation with, and support for, the Queensland Police. In 1959 he was named Queensland's first 'Father of the Year', even though he was childless. However Bischof was an inveterate gambler, which undoubtedly led him into very shady territory. Fitzgerald's report says: During Bischof's tenure, there was persistent criticism of Bischof's management of the police force. Allegations and suggestions were made in parliament of corruption, abuse of power, and negligence on the part of individual police officers. There was also concern over undue police zeal in handling street demonstrations. During 1963 and 1964 a Royal Commission was held into alleged police protection of a call-girl service operating out of the National Hotel in Brisbane. The Commissioner, Justice Harry Gibbs did not find that such a service operated, but he did criticise the lax enforcement of the licensing laws due to friendships between hotel management and police. It seems likely that the inquiry was hampered by a cover-up, because in 1971 one of the key witnesses admitted to perjuring herself. State Treasurer Thomas Hiley established the extent of Bischof's gambling habit and confronted him. On 13 February 1969, only 240 days before his retirement, Bischof suddenly took leave on medical grounds. In December 1974 he was charged with stealing, but the Crown decided not to prosecute. Bischof died on 28 August 1979 in South Brisbane, and was survived by his wife. Paedophilia allegations Bischof operated clinics for difficult children at his office, which attempted to illustrate to potentially wayward children the error of their ways, during the 1950s–1960s. However, it was also a way for Bischof to have access to the hundreds of young children who did. Margaret Fels, a housewife from Eight Mile Plains, had an affair with Bischof. Journalist Matthew Condon, in his book Jacks and Jokers, reported that two of her sons alleged that Bischof had sexually assaulted them, and they believed that he may have also assaulted a third, deceased, sibling.

He was born in Taylorville, Illinois and attended Beloit College. He was a captain of the United States men's basketball team, which won the gold medal in the 1952 Olympic Games. He played in all eight games. Bontemps died on May 13, 2017 in Peoria, Illinois, aged 90.  Early life  Born in Taylorville, Illinois on August 11, 1926, to Carl and Katherine (McBride), Ron Bontemps attended Taylorville High School. Bontemps grew up a few blocks from childhood friend and teammate Johnny Orr, who would later embark on a storied collegiate coaching career. At Taylorville High School, Bontemps was a First-Team All- State player, as was Johnny Orr. Taylorville had a 45-0 streak and won the 1944 Illinois high school state championship under Coach Dolph Stanley. In the championship game, a 56-33 victory over Elgin High School, Bontemps was the leading scorer, scoring 18 points, with Orr adding 17. He was selected to the All- State Tournament First Team. In the four state tournament games, Orr scored 64 points and Bontemps added 49 points. In the State Tournament, Taylorville defeated East St. Louis High School, Kewanee High School, and Champaign High School (for a fourth time). “Teams like this come along once every 100 years.” said Coach Staley of his squad. Orr reflected many years later, “Years later, I look back and realize we were the first unbeaten state champion. How the hell did we ever do it? You don’t realize it until much later, what a helluva thing it was.”  College career  After high school graduation in 1944, Bontemps joined the U.S. Army and served in World War II. After being discharged in 1946, he attended the University of Illinois, joining Orr in playing for the Fighting Illini in 1946-1947. After one year at Illinois, his high school coach Dolph Stanley, was coaching at Beloit College and recruited Bontemps and Orr to attend Beloit College. At Beloit, Bontemps and Orr joined high school teammates Donald “Red” Janssen, and Fran Stahr on the Beloit roster. “It was never about individuals on that team,” Bontemps said of the Beloit teams. “We played fast and (Coach) Stanley made sure we were all in great condition. During timeouts, we never sat down. We mowed down a lot of teams. That was a fun time.” Bontemps scored 1,770 points in 83 career games over three years at Beloit College, a school record that held until 2006. In his tenure, Beloit was 72-12, winning three consecutive Midwest Conference championships from 1948-1951 and playing in the National Intercollegiate Basketball Tournament as well as the 12-team 1951 National Invitation Tournament. Said Bontemps in 2006, “The conference got upset with us for being too good.”  NBA/AAU career  After college, Bontemps, a 6'3\\" guard/forward, was the 3rd round (22nd overall) draft pick of the Moline, Illinois based Tri-Cities Blackhawks (today's Atlanta Hawks) of the fledgling National Basketball Association in the 1951 NBA draft. Instead, as was common in early basketball, Bontemps accepted a job for the Caterpillar Inc. in Peoria, Illinois and while there he played for the Caterpillar Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) team, the Caterpillar Diesels, (also called the Peoria Cats) and Coach Warren Womble. The Caterpillar Diesels played in the National Industrial Basketball League. Basketball aside, Bontemps had a thirty eight year career for Caterpillar Inc.  1952 USA Olympic Team  By virtue of their winning the 1952 AAU championship, the Caterpillar Diesels were then invited to compete in the Olympic basketball team playoffs at Madison Square Garden in New York City. In the Olympic playoffs, Caterpillar defeated the AAU Phillips 66ers in the semifinals, The Caterpillar Diesels then defeated the University of Kansas 62-60 in the tournament final. As a result, Warren Womble was selected as head coach of the 1952 U.S. Olympic basketball team and Coach Phog Allen of the University of Kansas was chosen as assistant coach. Five members of the Caterpillar Diesels (Frank McCabe, Bontemps, Dan Pippin, Marc Freiberger and Howie Williams) made the 14-player roster. Seven University of Kansas players including Naismith Hall of Fame inductee Clyde Lovellette were on the roster. Lovellette would lead Team USA in scoring. “All of a sudden, I was on the Olympic team,” Bontemps had recalled of his Olympic Team selection. “The reporters started calling, and the crowd started recognizing me. People went nuts, oh, the Olympic Games!” In the 1952 Olympic Tournament, Bontemps was the 4th leading scorer for 1952 United States men's Olympic basketball team, averaging 7.5 points in the eight Olympic games. On August 2, 1952, Bontemps and Team USA secured a 36-25 Gold Medal Game victory over the Soviet Union. Following the Olympic victory, Bontemps continued to play for the Caterpillar Diesels while working at Caterpillar, Inc. He was named a 1953 AAU All- American. In 1954, he repeated as an AAU All-American and was named \\"National Outstanding Amateur Basketball Player\\" and National Player of the Year by the Los Angeles Times. Personal Bontemps and his wife, the former Norma Jean Smith of Beloit, a 1951 Beloit College graduate, lived in Morton, Illinois. Norma Bontemps died in 2009. Ron Bontemps' son Kevin, played basketball at the University of Illinois from 1980-1983, after a career at Morton High School. Kevin Bontemps like his father, was inducted into the IBCA (Illinois Basketball Coaches Assication) Hall of Fame. Of his father he said, “I attribute all (my basketball success) to my dad. He was never one to force me to play, but he was always willing to get out on the driveway or get in the gym with me. And my older brother, Gary, we were always on the driveaway or in a gym having fun, with dad showing us things and encouraging me to work on different aspects of my game.” At age 90, Ron Bontemps died on May 13, 2017, at Rosewood Care Center in Peoria, Illinois. He was survived by his two sons and two daughters, eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

After a CIA-backed coup d'etat overthrew Mossadegh, Sedighi was arrested and later testified in defense of Mossadegh at the latter's trial. Despite the loss of power, Sedighi continued to be politically active. He helped to found the Second National Front in 1960 and, along with other pro-Mossadegh politicians, advocated a democratic system and a Shah that reigns but does not rule. By 1978, Iran was gripped by mass turmoil and there was a significant danger that Mohammad Reza Pahlavi would be toppled by a mass rebellion led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Because of this threat, the Shah appointed Sedighi as the prime minister in order to rally the moderates behind the government and neutralize the religious opposition. However, the plan collapsed over Sedighi's insistence that the Shah remains in the country and that full executive powers be entrusted in the premier's cabinet, two things that the Shah refused to grant. Because of this, Sedighi left the scene and the Shah instead appointed Dr. Shapour Bakhtiar (one of the leaders of the National Front (Iran)) as Prime Minister of Iran. Sedighi was a patriot who never left Iran and lived in Tehran until his death in March 1990. He is buried in Ebn-e Baveh cemetery in Iran.

Biography He was born the eldest of three children. His given name was Theophylact. At eighteen, he determined to become a monk and joined Paul the Hesychast at his hermitage in Phrygia, where he took the religious name \\"Peter\\". The two of them started a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, but, reportedly because of a vision, they went instead to Bithynia. There Paul established a monastery at the church of St. Zachary in the area of Atroa. The monastery grew quickly, and Paul named Peter as his successor on the former's death in 805. Leo V the Armenian was in power at the time, and supported the Iconoclasts in their efforts to destroy religious imagery. Peter was forced to disband the monastery for the safety of the monks during these persecutions, himself travelling first to Ephesus and later Cyprus. His reputation as a thaumaturge and spiritual director had become widespread by this time, and he was rarely left to pursue the secluded life he sought in peace. He wandered throughout the area in his efforts to find seclusion, ultimately finding some privacy in the area of Coracesium in Cilicia. Upon the death of Leo V, the iconoclast persecution dissipated, permitting internal struggles within the church to rise to the forefront. One of these involved accusations by several bishops and abbots that Peter exorcised demons not by the power of God, but rather the power of Beelzebub. Peter tried to convince them otherwise, unsuccessfully, and ultimately had to seek the help of Theodore the Studite in persuading them. Theodore wrote a letter to all the monks of the area, telling them that Peter was in fact above reproach in conduct, teachings, and beliefs, and was as good a monk as could be found. This letter survives to this day. Peter then returned to St. Zachary's and helped to reorganize two other monasteries he had established. During this time, he himself resided at a hermitage in Atroa. Iconoclastic attacks broke out again, more virulent than before, and Peter again found himself having to disperse his monks, successfully doing so just barely before the local bishop arrived to forcibly remove them. Peter himself left to reside with a locally famous recluse named James. While living with him, Peter cured Paul of Prusias of a fever. This was ascribed as a miracle at the time, but was apparently accomplished by doing nothing more than giving Paul a good, nutritious meal. Iconoclast persecution increased in the area, obliging Peter and James to leave for the safety of the monastery of St. Porphyrious on the Hellespont. Peter later left for the Bâlea Lake area, where he visited his friend and fellow opponent of iconoclasm Joannicius before returning again to St. Zachary's. After delivering a final statement of farewell to the assembly, he died in the choir while praying the evening office on 1 January 837. References *Burns, Paul.

Early and family life The son of Capt. Philip Pendleton Slaughter (1758-1849) and his wife, Margaret French Strother (daughter of French Strother), Slaughter was born into the First Families of Virginia, his grandfathers (uncles and cousins) having helped settle Culpeper County and fought in the American Revolutionary War. He was educated at a school at Cloverdale (in what had once been Capt. Philip Slaughter's Springfield farm), probably by classical scholar John Robertson, because by the time 1818, former Presbyterian church pastor Samuel Davies Hoge succeeded him in 1818, Daniel French Slaughter was attending the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.Eugene M. Scheel, Culpeper: a Virginia County's History through 1920 (Culpeper Historical Society1982) pp.70, 75 Dr. Daniel Slaughter lived on Slaughter Mountain (also called \\"Cedar Mountain\\" particularly after the American Civil War) and married twice. He first married Letitia Madison, a niece of President James Madison, in 1828, and they had sons Phillip Madison Slaughter (who was a lawyer by 1850) and James Edwin Slaughter (1827-1901).Philip Slaughter, History of St. Marks Parish, incl. pp.159, 170 among others, available at https://archive.org/stream/cu31924010323511/cu31924010323511_djvu.txt In 1855 the widower married Mary Wallace Winston (1819-1897), granddaughter of revolutionary Capt.

Philip Slaughter introduced his daughter Anne Mercer Slaughter and son Daniel F. Slaughter to the Marquis in Philadelphia and again at the festivities in Culpeper and Orange.Scheel p. 91 This may have been the son's political coming-out. Daniel Slaughter won election as a Whig to the Virginia Senate in 1828, initially representing Fauquier and Culpeper Counties and succeeding John Thom, who had represented them in the senate since 1820. In the redistricting following the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830, Fauquier County was paired with Prince William County and would be represented by long-term senator Charles Hunton, and Slaughter's native Culpeper County was paired with Madison and Orange Counties, long represented by General Lawrence T. Dade a lawyer in Orange, Virginia. When Dade moved to Owensboro, Kentucky, Daniel Slaughter won that senate seat in 1832, and with the creation of Rappahannock County from them, it was added in 1834. However, Extra Billy Smith, future Virginia governor and Confederate general, replaced him in 1836.Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond, Virginia State Library 1978) pp. 346, 352, 366, 370, 374, 378 In 1841, Slaughter ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, but lost. From November 30, 1855 until 1867, Slaughter was also the postmaster for Criglersville, Madison County, Virginia, as his grandson of the same name would be from 1891-1930.U.S. Appointments of Postmasters 1832-1971 available on ancestry.com During the American Civil War, his VMI-educated eldest son, James E. Slaughter, relinquished his U.S. Army commission and volunteered to fight in the Confederate States Amy. However, the younger Slaughter fought not in the Northern Virginia Campaign but further south, and rose to the rank of Brigadier General, but at the war's end fled to Mexico and never returned to reside in Virginia, nor did he ever marry as did his siblings and half- siblings. The Battle of Cedar Mountain was partially fought on Slaughter's lands (resulting in a Confederate victory on August 9, 1862), as would be skirmishes during the following fortnight.Patricia J. Hurst, Soldiers, Stories, Sites and FIghts Orage County Virginia 1861-1865 p. 42 (Bookcrafters Inc. 1998) Part of the Battle of Brandy Station (the largest cavalry engagement of the war, but inconclusive, on June 9, 1863) was also fought on Slaughter lands, as would be skirmishes before the Battle of Culpeper Court House returned the area to Union control in September 1863, although much fighting would continue into 1864. This led to considerable devastation. One nearby pasture at once was called \\"Raccoon's Ford\\" on the Rapidan River below Slaughter's Mountain (owned by merchant Philip Pendleton Nalle and later by U.S. Representative Jeremiah Morton was so disrupted by cannon fire that locals called it \\"cannon ball field\\".

His attributed legends, which also form the bulk of the information available on the historic personality, later became an important part in Turkish folk literature. His title Seyyid, as well as being an Arabic honorific, may refer, in the form \\"Seyyid\\", to family ties to Muhammad. The legends Sources available on the historical personality of Abdallah al-Battal consist of legends often written in the mesnevi style, and which may comport historically correct elements or points that support each other, as well as contradictions. For example, he is cited as having participated in his twenties to the Second Arab Siege of Constantinople in 718, and the legends name his Byzantine enemy as Leon, which could be no other than Leo III the Isaurian, the Emperor during the siege. On the basis of this information, his date of birth is reckoned to be around 690-695 and there is a consensus among historians for accepting 740 as the year of his death, at the Battle of Akroinon. On the other hand, in one story Battal Gazi raids the Maiden's Tower and rides away from Üsküdar, on the city's Asian side, with the Emperor's treasures and daughter, an event that is not confirmed by any historical record. Whence the Turkish expression, \\"Atı alan Üsküdar'ı geçti\\"; (He who takes the horse is already past Üsküdar). Battal Gazi was revindicated as an ancestor of Danishmend Gazi in the romanced epic on the Turkish Bey, Danishmendnâme, in which stories relating to the two figures are blended, possibly with a view to stress the presence of Islam in Anatolia even before the main Turkish advance following the Battle of Manzikert (modern Malazgirt). The verses that compose Danishmendnâme were compiled from Turkish folk literature for a first time by order of the Anatolian Seljuk Sultan Alâeddin Keykubad, a century after Danishmend's death, and the final form that reached our day is a compendium that was put together under the instructions of the early 15th century Ottoman sultan Murad II. Battal Gazi remains a spirited figure in Turkey's modern day urban culture. This is partly due to a series of films in which Battal Gazi was incarnated by and immortalised anew under the chiselled features of the Turkish film star Cüneyt Arkın. These modern references sometimes involve touches of indirect humour. The tombs Battal Gazi is buried in Seyitgazi, a town named after him and where he is believed to have been martyred (possibly during a siege of the nearby Amorium), in Eskişehir Province, Turkey. Upon the initiative as of 1207 of Ümmühan Hatun, wife of the Anatolian Seljuk Sultan Gıyaseddin Keyhüsrev I and mother of Alâeddin Keykubad I, Battal Gazi's tomb was extended into a complex containing a mosque, a medrese, cells and ceremonial rooms for dervishes as well as charitable services for the community such as kitchens and a bakery, and it was later renovated extensively under the Ottoman sultan Bayezid II's reign. As such, Seyyid Battal Gazi Complex in Seyitgazi remains a much visited shrine. On the other hand, many other localities across Turkey also put forth claims as burial places either for Battal Gazi, or for his father Hüseyin Gazi. A tomb in Divriği and another one in Ankara on top of a hill named after Hüseyin Gazi are the most famous among the shrines thought to contain the father's remains. The district centre of Battalgazi in Turkey's Malatya Province, formerly Eskimalatya (Old Malatya) and the previous location of Malatya city, at a distance of 20 km from the modern day urban centre, was renamed in honour of Battal Gazi. Battal Gazi's wife and two children are buried in the town.

Until the 17th century, many convicted prisoners were executed at Hango Hill. Capital punishment in the Isle of Man was formally abolished in 1993.UN report Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, July 1997 The Isle of Man is a British Crown Dependency, but not part of the United Kingdom (which had effectively abolished capital punishment in 1965). The last person to be actually hanged on the Isle of Man was John Kewish, at Castletown in 1872. No execution had taken place on the island during the three decades before that. Capital punishment was not abolished by Tynwald (the island's parliament) until 1993. Many people were sentenced to death (for murder and various other crimes) on the Isle of Man between 1873 and 1992. The last person to be sentenced to death on the Isle of Man (and anywhere in the British Isles) was Anthony Robin Denys Teare, at the Court of General Gaol Delivery in Douglas, in 1992. The case was heard before the Second Deemster of the Isle of Man, Henry Callow. Deemster Callow thus became the last judge in the British Isles to pass a death sentence (but chose not to wear a black cap whilst doing so). Following sentencing, Teare engaged a new lawyer, Louise Byrne, who immediately took the case to the appeal court, where the conviction was quashed. A retrial was ordered, and a search for new evidence was made. At the second trial Teare was represented by Peter Thornton QC, an English counsel. William Kelly, a prison healthcare officer at the Isle of Man Prison, gave evidence that Teare had told him on a number of occasions of how he had murdered the victim, Corinne Bentley. It was on his evidence alone that Teare was convicted of murder for the second time. He entered the history books as the last person in the British Isles to be sentenced to death and the first in the Isle of Man to be sentenced to life imprisonment (all previous life sentences had been commuted from death sentences). Corinne's brother was in court as Teare, head bowed, was sentenced to a minimum of twelve years' imprisonment. He was sent to HMP Wakefield in Yorkshire.

Disc one contains studio tracks from her third and fourth studio albums, Diva (2003) and Real (2004), while disc two consists of music videos from her discography beginning in 1995 up to 2005 with the release of her fifth studio album, Flashback. Diva was released on August 23, 2003, and independently distributed by Real Music Group. The album follows her two previous studio album which were both commercially unsuccessful. With collaborations with Latin hip hop artists including Mexicano 777 and K-7, the album's production was by a variety of music producers, including Luny Tunes, DJ Nelson and Noriega, while DJ Adam produced a majority of the tracks. Six singles were released from the album: \\"Quiero Bailar\\", \\"Quiero Saber\\", \\"Papi Te Quiero\\", \\"Guillaera\\", \\"Tuya Soy\\" and \\"Tu No Puedes\\". Three of these are on The Best of Ivy Queen. Highly anticipated and acclaimed, Diva peaked at #24 on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart, #8 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart for the South Atlantic area, #4 on the Billboard Reggae Albums and #1 on the Billboard Tropical Albums chart. Real was released on November 16, 2004, through Universal Latino. Queen collaborated with several top-name artist from the hip hop and reggaetón genres including Hector El Father, Fat Joe, Getto & Gastam, La India, Gran Omar and Mickey Perfecto, though this release does not have the collaborations. The tracks on the album were produced mainly by Rafi Mercenario. It also included guest production by the American producer, Swizz Beatz, and the Puerto Ricans Ecko and DJ Nelson. It was her first and only studio album to be labeled and shipped with the Parent Advisory Warning label. Two singles which appear on this compilation release, \\"Chika Ideal\\" and \\"Dile\\", both of which are on Real, peaked at #25 on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart, #4 on the Billboard Top Reggae Albums chart, and #6 on the Billboard Tropical Albums chart. \\"Dile\\" peaked at #8 on the Billboard Tropical Songs chart. However, the former was unable to acquire chart success. The album was re-released on September 25, 2007, through Machete Music. The albums are regarded as a factor in reggaetón mainstream exposure to English-speaking markets in 2004 along with other albums by Daddy Yankee and Tego Calderón. The Best of Ivy Queen reached #55 on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart, while reaching #13 on the Billboard Latin Rhythm Albums chart. Recording and production The five tracks on The Best of Ivy Queen which were originally from Diva were recorded between 2000 and 2003. These are \\"Papi Te Quiero\\" from the platinum edition of Diva along with \\"Sangre\\", a collaboration with Mexicano 777, \\"Me Acostumbré\\", \\"Tuya Soy\\" and \\"Guillaera\\". The other seven tracks, \\"Dale Volumen\\", \\"Dile\\", \\"Rebulera\\", \\"Mi Barrio\\", the lead single \\"Chika Ideal\\", \\"Ángel Caído\\", \\"Matando\\" and \\"Mi Sitaución\\", were on Real. Disc two consists of music videos from her early discography up until the compilation's release. These include songs on her fifth studio album, Flashback (\\"Muchos Quieren Tumbarme\\" and \\"Reggae Respect\\") while \\"In The Zone\\", a duet with the Haitian rapper Wyclef Jean appeared on her 1998 studio album, The Original Rude Girl.

Diva was released on August 19, 2003, and independently distributed by Real Music Group. On January 27, 2004, Diva: Platinum Edition was released with five remixes of songs on the original Diva album. Real was released on November 26, 2004. The album's original release date had been set for September 2004, but this was delayed to November 26. The album was also released in \\"edited\\" and \\"clean\\" versions. It was re-released on September 25, 2007, on Machete Music, as a result of Ivy Queen's success with her seventh studio album, Sentimiento, which was certified platinum within two months of its release. Music and lyrics The mid-tempo, \\"bubble-gum pop\\" \\"Papi Te Quiero\\" (\\"Baby I Love You\\"), named one of the album's biggest hits, \\"pairs a straightforward love song with the well known reggae riddim Buyout.\\" Ramiro Burr of Billboard stated \\"Papi Te Quiero\\" showcases how \\"effortlessly and quickly she alternately sings and raps, claiming that she has a distinct vocal style that evokes Gwen Stefani\\". Although, the literal translation of \\"Papi Te Quiero\\" is \\"Daddy I Love You\\", it is not directed towards Queen's father but to her love interest; \\"Papi\\" can be translated to \\"baby\\". \\"Dale Volumen\\" (\\"Add Volume\\"), in a minor key, is characterized by simple harmonic progressions, synthesizers and stick-drum percussion and influenced by reggae and Afro-Latin music. \\"Dile\\" (\\"Tell Her\\") features lilting rhythms from Colombia (including cumbia), combining Latin vallenato with reggaetón. Queen noted that she sang the song without rapping to prove she is a complete musician and not just a rapper. \\"Me Acostumbré\\" (\\"I Got Accustomed\\") and is a \\"hip-hop ballad\\". \\"Rebulera\\", composed in minor-key song, has Queen asserting that she is \\"queen\\" in the genre of reggaetón. The track features synthesizers and strings, and is influenced by reggae and Afro- Latin music. \\"Mi Barrio\\" (\\"My Hood\\") criticizes \\"the problems present in Añasco, Puerto Rico\\". Queen compared the song to \\"Corazones\\" by Daddy Yankee from his album, Barrio Fino (2004). On \\"Tuya Soy\\", (\\"I'm Yours\\") she explains \\"the story of woman who suspects her husband of infidelity\\", a controversial theme which has been prominent in Queen's lyrical content. \\"Chika Ideal\\" (\\"Ideal Girl\\") assures the protagonist's lover that she wants to be with him and fulfill his dreams. \\"Guillaera\\" (Attitude), a duet with Gran Omar, explains what type of man she does and does not desire. Another collaboration with Gran Omar, \\"Matando\\" (\\"Killing\\"), follows. The song explores dancing in a club. It, in a minor key, features the synthetic instrumentation of techno music. \\"Muchos Quieren Tumbarme\\" (\\"\\"), alludes to a boxing match with the phrase \\"many want to knock me down\\", and cites female empowerment as a prominent theme in the song.Universal Music Latino. 2004. Ivy Queen: The Original Rude Girl. DVD. United States: Real Music. Retrieved 2013-02-25. In addition to this, she degrades the thought of women's power being underestimated. She speaks directly to men requesting that they not be cowards. She then argues that women are actively struggling for equality among their male peers, later asserting that \\"women are coming strong\\". \\"Reggae Respect\\" musically returns to the early styles of \\"old school reggaetón\\". \\"Quiero Bailar\\" (\\"I Want To Dance\\") incorporates the Liquid riddim, a musical riddim produced by the \\"Jamaican cross-over guru\\" Jeremy Harding.Román, Miriam Jiménez. Flores, Juan. Afro-Latin@ Reader: History and Culture in the United States. Duke University Press, 2010, p. 401. The song's lyrics warn her dance partner not to misinterpret her moves. In the song, she berates a lover who thinks that just because they dance she is automatically going to bed with him. Chart performance The Best of Ivy Queen entered the Billboard Latin Albums chart at #60 in the issue week of January 7, 2006. A week later, it reached the peak position of #55.

The school was located on Portchester Road, but was moved to a new site on Harewood Avenue and the former building was demolished. Facilities In the school, there are five technology rooms, five English rooms, seven science rooms, five IT rooms, three MFL rooms, five humanities rooms, five maths rooms and two music rooms, amongst many others. The school has also two drama studios, two halls, a library, a sports lab, a science lab, a fully equipped gym, a sports hall and music studio. There are outdoor tennis and basketball courts. The sports hall is new and is called the Roy Moore Sports Hall. It has seven badminton courts and a rock climbing wall.  School history  The school opened in January 1940 in the building previously used by Bournemouth School, which had been built in 1901. The school took its name from the site's address along Portchester Road and has always been a boys-only school. This section should be expanded significantly. Here I can only provide an insight into this from personal experience. I attended this school from 1951 - 1956. At this time it was already a secondary modern school - or perhaps a technical school. It had an unusual (unique?) capability in that it filtered off boys who had 'just failed' the 11 plus exam and provided them with a route to their taking \\"O\\" level GCE exams. This qualification was otherwise only available at grammar schools. As a result of providing this facility the headmaster was awarded a significant honor - I think the OBE though it may have been the MBE. The school would later move to the present site along Harewood Avenue at Littledown in 1975 next to the sister school, Avonbourne School, although the Portchester Road building was also used until 1989. During the time after the school moved to Littledown, pupils attended both schools on alternate days until the \\"old school\\" at Portchester Road closed. Fenwick Court is now on the site and is named after D.r Fenwick, who was the first headmaster of Bournemouth School. The school changed its name from Portchester School to Harewood College in 2012. Additions have been added to the college in the following years and it now shares a sports hall, the Roy Moore Sports Hall, with Avonbourne that was built in 2012. Also recently, student Tom Clark became a Guinness world record holder for rowing. The 2012 World Junior and Cadet Kurash Championship was held at Harewood College's Roy Moore Sports Hall, of which a student from the school itself won a second place award.Link Text , additional text. Harewood College, alongside other schools from the Avonbourne Trust, were acquired by United Learning in July 2019, with the 2 lower schools being re-branded as Avonbourne Boys' Academy (previously Harewood College) and Avonbourne Girls' Academy (previously Avonbourne School). This change also affected Avonbourne Sixth Form, which was re-branded as United Sixth Form for the start of the 2019-2020 academic year. 6th form United Sixth Form (previously Avonbourne Sixth Form up until the trust's acquisition by United Learning), accepts students of both genders unlike both schools themselves. The 6th form has the same standards as most other 6th forms of the area. This being: 5 C-A* including English and Maths. No uniform is applied to these students. Pupils from both the Avonbourne Boys' and Girls' Academies as well as other schools across the borough can join. The building for the 6th form was built in the grounds of Avonbourne Girls' Academy. Following the acquisition of the trust by United Learning, the 6th form was re-branded to United Sixth Form House system The school has a house system based on sports personalities: Pelé, Redgrave, MacArthur and Moore. Each year group is split between the houses. Uniform All boys must wear black trousers, white shirt, school tie, dark blue school blazer (or tuxedo if 'School Captain' status) and black shoes. Boys are not allowed to wear any jewellery including rings, piercings or necklaces. Trainers, outside coats, hats, or 'hoodies' are not to be worn inside the school building. Relationship with Avonbourne Girls' Academy Avonbourne Boys' Academy shares a site with Avonbourne Girls' Academy (which also includes United Sixth Form). From the start of the 2011-12 academic year, the schools have been working more closely together. Starting in the 2019-2020 academic year, the schools became more inter-linked with shared communal areas and some subjects being held at either of the 2 academies. Peer mediation The school has a Peer Mediation Scheme in which students are trained to resolve arguments between other pupils.

He moved to Kansas, where he published the Leavenworth Times in Leavenworth, Kansas, as well as other newspapers in the area. He was a leader of leader of the New England Emigrant Aid Company. He was a younger brother of activist Susan B. Anthony. He killed a man in one duel, and was shot by another man in public, due to the heated politics of the era. He was considered colorful and controversial, provoking strong emotions.  Early life  Anthony was born in South Adams, Massachusetts, one of seven children of Daniel Anthony (1794–1862) and Lucy Read Anthony (1793–1880). His older sister was Susan B. Anthony. He attended school in Battenville, New York. He later worked in his father's cotton and flour mill until age 23.  Kansas  Anthony first moved to Kansas in 1854 with others sponsored by the Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Company, in order to fight against the extension of slavery to the Kansas Territory. Congress was going to allow residents to determine if they wanted the territory to allow slavery. He settled in Leavenworth in 1857, residing in a house at 515 North Esplanade Street. Around this same time Anthony was involved with the Underground Railroad in Leavenworth, helping William Dominick Matthews, a freedman, provide refuge to escaped slaves. On January 26, 1861, Anthony founded the Leavenworth Daily Conservative paper, later selling it in order to purchase the Leavenworth Times. He was also appointed as the town postmaster. At the time, Leavenworth was the end of the telegraph line. In January 1861 Anthony printed a special edition of his newspaper and rode by horseback to Lawrence, Kansas to inform the territorial legislature that Congress had approved statehood for Kansas. In 1861, rival publisher Robert C. Satterlee of the Kansas Herald accused Anthony of being a coward. They met on the street in Leavenworth and exchanged gunfire, resulting in the death of Satterlee. A jury acquitted Anthony in the death.  Military service  During the American Civil War, in 1861 and 1862, Anthony served as a lieutenant colonel in the Union 7th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry. He saw action in Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi and Alabama. He was elected as mayor of Leavenworth in 1863. He enlisted several volunteers to burn buildings of Confederate sympathizers on the edge of town. Union General Thomas Ewing, who placed Leavenworth under martial law during the American Civil War, had Anthony arrested for interfering with martial law. (Anthony said that the city could maintain its own order.)  Postwar years in Kansas  In 1864 Anthony bought the Leavenworth Bulletin. In 1866, he was removed as postmaster because he did not support Reconstruction policies of President Andrew Johnson, whom he thought too accommodating of the South. Johnson came to office after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Anthony was elected as presiding officer of the 1868 Republican State Convention. In 1870–1871, he was elected to the Leavenworth City Council. In 1871, Anthony purchased the Leavenworth Times, the oldest daily newspaper in Kansas. His editorial stance on issues and his steady acquisition of newspapers were controversial, as observers did not think one man should control the newspapers. In 1875, William Embry, rival editor of the Daily Appeal, shot Anthony at the Leavenworth Opera House, seriously wounding him. His sister Susan B. Anthony came to visit him. After recovering from his injuries, in 1876 Anthony bought the Leavenworth Commercial, gaining a monopoly on local newspapers. He continued to provoke strong emotions amid the heated late 19th-century politics. In 1887, Anthony was horsewhipped by a man. Many Leavenworth residents raised money by \\"nickel subscription\\" to pay the $100 fine for the man charged with horsewhipping. In 1891, the town's mayor was fined $30 for whipping Anthony.  Death and legacy  Anthony died at the age of 80 on November 12, 1904 in Leavenworth, Kansas. He is buried at Mount Muncie Cemetery in Lansing, Kansas. Anthony married Anna Eliza \\"Annie\\" Osborn (1844–1930) from Edgartown, Massachusetts on January 21, 1864. They had several children together including son, Daniel Read Anthony Jr.. His son Daniel Read Anthony, Jr. went into the newspaper business with his father, editing the Leavenworth Times. He was elected to the US Congress, serving more than two decades from 1907 to 1929. The Anthony family retained control of the Leavenworth Times for four generations until 1960; their last editor was Daniel R. Anthony IV.

It welcomes faculty, students, and staff from all faiths and national or ethnic origins. The university is located in the northern district of El-Koura, Lebanon. It was founded by the Orthodox Patriarch Ignatius IV of Antioch in 1988. The university's main campus is adjacent to Balamand Monastery, but it has two other campuses in Beirut: One is in Sin el Fil, which houses the majority of the Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts, and the other neighbors Saint George Hospital in Achrafieh, which houses the faculty for medicine and medical sciences. It also has campuses in Akkar and Souk El Gharb. Formerly conceived as just a project in the Koura District, it fused administratively with the Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts (ALBA) and St. John of Damascus Institute of Theology to become a full-blown university. The University of Balamand was founded by the Patriarch through the concept of a Kouranian engineer called Elias Abi Chahine of Amioun, in which the concept formed between years 1983 and 1987, in the midst of the Lebanese Civil War. The project started soon after Governmental Clearance in 1988. As of 2014, the implementation of its Master Plan at the mount of long heritage, Balamand, proceeds steadily. Name Local legend in Lebanon reports that when Bohemond VII of Antioch escaped Latakia after it was taken by Qalawun in 1287, he hid in the village of Toula, Batroun, in the Northern Lebanese mountains. Legend has it that he lived there for a while, and produced offspring, from which the Prince, Conte, Zeeni and Aboujaoude families claim descent. The Balamand Monastery in Batroun is reputed a gift of the Prince's family, and now hosts the major University of Balamand, Balamand being a local adaptation of Bohemond.  Faculties  The university consists of 12 faculties, and they are as follows: Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts (French and English) St. John of Damascus Institute of Theology (Arabic, English and Spanish) Faculty of Arts and Sciences (Arabic, English and French) Faculty of Business and Management (English) School of Tourism and Hotel Management (English) Faculty of Sciences (English) Faculty of Engineering (English) Faculty of Health Sciences (English) Saint George's Postgraduate Medical Education (English) Faculty of Medicine & Medical Sciences (English) Issam M. Fares Institute of Technology (English and French) Faculty of Library and Information Studies(English) There are also further expansion plans, including: * Programs for arts and social sciences, business and management, engineering, health sciences for a new University of Balamand campus in Souk El Gharb. * A seven-story Balamand hospital in El-Koura (under construction) * A museum, containing some of the most important historical documents, old pictures, and precious artifacts of the Antiochian Patriarchate Heritagehttp://www.balamandmonastery.org.lb/index.php/museum  Buildings under construction  On the Main Campus: * An Engineering complex of presently two buildings: the “Riad Rizk and Khalil Rizk Civil Engineering Building,” now under construction and an Engineering building that will house the Mechanical, Electrical, and Computer engineering departments—both occupying 16,000 square meters * The Ghassan Rizk Business Executive Center of 1,500 square meters. * The Balamand Hospital will cover an area of 24,000 square meters and will be located at the hill-bottom of the main campus.

During World War II, a total of about 13.6 million soldiers served in the German Army. Army personnel were made up of volunteers and conscripts. Only 17 months after Adolf Hitler announced the German rearmament program in 1935, the army reached its projected goal of 36 divisions. During the autumn of 1937, two more corps were formed. In 1938 four additional corps were formed with the inclusion of the five divisions of the Austrian Army after the Anschluss in March. During the period of its expansion under Hitler, the German Army continued to develop concepts pioneered during World War I, combining ground and air assets into combined arms forces. Coupled with operational and tactical methods such as encirclements and \\"battle of annihilation\\", the German military managed quick victories in the two initial years of World War II, a new style of warfare described as Blitzkrieg (lightning war) for its speed and destructive power. The German Army fought a war of annihilation on the Eastern Front and was responsible for many war crimes alongside the Waffen and Allgemeine SS.  Structure  Adolf Hitler with Wilhelm Keitel, Friedrich Paulus and Walther von Brauchitsch, October 1941 The Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH) was Nazi Germany's Army High Command from 1936 to 1945. In theory, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) served as the military General Staff for the Reich's armed forces, coordinating the Wehrmacht (Heer, Kriegsmarine, and the Luftwaffe) operations. In practice, the OKW acted in a subordinate role to Hitler's personal military staff, translating his ideas into military plans and orders, and issuing them to the three services. However, as World War II went on, the OKW found itself exercising an increasing amount of direct command authority over military units, particularly in the west. This meant that by 1942 the OKW was the de facto command of Western Theatre forces while the Army High Command (OKH) was the same on the Eastern Front. The Abwehr was the army intelligence organization from 1921 to 1944. The term Abwehr (German for \\"defense\\", here referring to counter-intelligence) had been created just after World War I as an ostensible concession to Allied demands that Germany's intelligence activities be for defensive purposes only. After 4 February 1938, the name Abwehr was changed to the Overseas Department/Office in Defence of the Armed Forces High Command (Amt Ausland/Abwehr im Oberkommando der Wehrmacht). Germany used a system of military districts (German: Wehrkreis) in order to relieve field commanders of as much administrative work as possible and to provide a regular flow of trained recruits and supplies to the field forces. The method OKW adopted was to separate the Field Army (OKH) from the Home Command (Heimatkriegsgebiet) and to entrust the responsibilities of training, conscription, supply, and equipment to Home Command.  Organization of field forces  German soldiers in Greece, April 1941 The German Army was mainly structured in Army groups (Heeresgruppen) consisting of several armies that were relocated, restructured or renamed in the course of the war. Forces of allied states, as well as units made up of non-Germans, were also assigned to German units. For Operation Barbarossa in 1941, the Army forces were assigned to three strategic campaign groupings: * Army Group North with Leningrad as its campaign objective * Army Group Centre with Smolensk as its campaign objective * Army Group South with Kiev as its campaign objective Below the army group level forces included field armies – panzer groups, which later became army level formations themselves, corps, and divisions. The army used the German term Kampfgruppe, which equates to battle group in English. These provisional combat groupings ranged from corps size, such as Army Detachment Kempf, to commands composed of companies or even platoons. They were named for their commanding officers.  Select arms of service  * Panzerjäger (Anti- tank troops) * Panzergrenadier (Armoured infantry troops) * Panzerwaffe (Armoured troops) * Army propaganda troops * Experimental command Kummersdorf * Foreign Armies East * Feldgendarmerie (Military police) * Gebirgsjäger (Mountain troops) * Geheime Feldpolizei (Secret Field Police) * Prussian Military Academy * Kriegsschule (War college) Doctrine and tactics The German operational doctrine emphasized sweeping pincer and lateral movements meant to destroy the enemy forces as quickly as possible. This approach, referred to as Blitzkrieg, was an operational doctrine instrumental in the success of the offensives in Poland and France. Blitzkrieg has been considered by many historians as having its roots in precepts developed by Fuller, Liddel-Hart and von Seeckt, and even having ancient prototypes practiced by Alexander, Genghis Khan and Napoleon. Recent studies of the Battle of France also suggest that the actions of either Rommel or Guderian or both of them (both had contributed to the theoretical development and early practices of what later became Blitzkrieg prior to World War II), ignoring orders of superiors who had never foreseen such spectacular successes and thus prepared much more prudent plans, were conflated into a purposeful doctrine and created the first archetype of Blitzkrieg, which then gained a fearsome reputation that dominated the Allied leaders' minds. Thus 'Blitzkrieg' was recognised after the fact, and while it became adopted by the Wehrmacht, it never became the official doctrine nor got used to its full potential because only a small part of the Wehrmacht was trained for it and key leaders at the highest levels either focused on only certain aspects or even did not understand what it was. Max Visser argues that the German army focused on achieving high combat performance rather than high organisational efficiency (like the US army). It emphasised adaptability, flexibility and decentralised decision making. Officers and NCOs were selected based on character and trained towards decisive combat leadership and rewarded good combat performance. Visser argues this allowed the German army to achieve superior combat performance compared to a more traditional organisational doctrine like the American one; while this would be ultimately offset by the Allies' superior numerical and material advantage, Visser argues that this allowed the German army to resist far longer than if it had not adopted this method of organisation and doctrine.Visser, Max. \\"Configurations of human resource practices and battlefield performance: A comparison of two armies.\\" Human Resource Management Review 20, no. 4 (2010): 340-349. Peter Turchin reports a study by American colonel Trevor Dupuy that found that German combat efficiency was higher than both the British and American armies - if a combat efficiency of 1 was assigned to the British, then the Americans had a combat efficiency of 1.1 and the Germans of 1.45. This would mean British forces would need to commit 45% more troops (or arm existing troops more heavily to the same proportion) to have a even chance of winning the battle, while the Americans would need to commit 30% more to have an even chance.Turchin, P., 2007. War and peace and war: The rise and fall of empires. Penguin, pp.257-258  Tactics  Grossdeutschland Division during Operation Barbarossa, 1941 The military strength of the German Army was managed through mission-based tactics (Auftragstaktik) (rather than detailed order-based tactics), and an almost proverbial discipline. Once an operation began, whether offensive or defensive, speed in response to changing circumstances was considered more important than careful planning and coordination of new plans. In public opinion, the German military was and is sometimes seen as a high-tech army, since new technologies that were introduced before and during World War II influenced its development of tactical doctrine. These technologies were featured by Nazi propaganda, but were often only available in small numbers or late in the war, as overall supplies of raw materials and armaments became low. For example, lacking sufficient motor vehicles to equip more than a small portion of their army, the Germans chose to concentrate the available vehicles in a small number of divisions which were to be fully motorized. The other divisions continued to rely on horses for towing artillery, other heavy equipment and supply-wagons, and the men marched on foot or rode bicycles. At the height of motorization only 20 per cent of all units were fully motorized. The small German contingent fighting in North Africa was fully motorized (relying on horses in the desert was near to impossible because of the need to carry large quantities of water and fodder), but the much larger force invading the Soviet Union in June 1941 numbered only some 150,000 trucks and some 625,000 horses (water was abundant and for many months of the year horses could forage – thus reducing the burden on the supply chain). However, the production of new motor vehicles by Germany, even with the exploitation of the industries of occupied countries, could not keep up with the heavy loss of motor vehicles during the winter of 1941–1942. From June 1941 to the end of February 1942 German forces in the Soviet Union lost some 75,000 trucks to mechanical wear and tear and combat damage – approximately half the number they had at the beginning of the campaign. Most of these were lost during the retreat in the face of the Soviet counteroffensive from December 1941 to February 1942. Another substantial loss was incurred during the defeat of the German 6th Army at Stalingrad in the winter of 1942–1943. These losses in men and materiel led to motorized troops making up no more than 10% of total Heer forces at some points of the war. In offensive operations the infantry formations were used to attack more or less simultaneously across a large portion of the front so as to pin the enemy forces ahead of them and draw attention to themselves, while the mobile formations were concentrated to attack only narrow sectors of the front, breaking through to the enemy rear and surrounding him. Some infantry formations followed in the path of the mobile formations, mopping-up, widening the corridor manufactured by the breakthrough attack and solidifying the ring surrounding the enemy formations left behind, and then gradually destroying them in concentric attacks. One of the most significant problems bedeviling German offensives and initially alarming senior commanders was the gap created between the fast moving \\"fast formations\\" and the following infantry, as the infantry were considered a prerequisite for protecting the \\"fast formations\\" flanks and rear and enabling supply columns carrying fuel, petrol and ammunition to reach them. In defensive operations the infantry formations were deployed across the front to hold the main defence line and the mobile formations were concentrated in a small number of locations from where they launched focused counterattacks against enemy forces who had broken through the infantry defence belt. In autumn 1942, at El Alamein, a lack of fuel compelled the German commander, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, to scatter his armoured units across the front in battalion-sized concentrations to reduce travel distances to each sector rather than hold them concentrated in one location. In 1944 Rommel argued that in the face of overwhelming Anglo-American air power, the tactic of employing the concentrated \\"fast formations\\" was no longer possible because they could no longer move quickly enough to reach the threatened locations because of the expected interdiction of all routes by Allied fighter-bombers. He therefore suggested scattering these units across the front just behind the infantry. His commanders and peers, who were less experienced in the effect of Allied air power, disagreed vehemently with his suggestion, arguing that this would violate the prime principle of concentration of force. Campaigns The infantry remained foot soldiers throughout the war; artillery also remained primarily horse-drawn. The motorized formations received much attention in the world press in the opening years of the war, and were cited as the main reason for the success of the German invasions of Poland (September 1939), Norway and Denmark (April 1940), Belgium, France and Netherlands (May 1940), Yugoslavia (April 1941) and the initial stages of Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union (June 1941). However, their motorized and tank formations accounted for only 20% of the Heer's capacity at their peak strength. The army's lack of trucks (and of petroleum to run them) severely limited infantry movement, especially during and after the Normandy invasion when Allied air- power devastated the French rail network north of the Loire. Panzer movements also depended on the rail, since driving a tank long distances wore out its tracks. Personnel Equipment It is a myth that the German Army in World War II was a mechanized juggernaut as a whole. In 1941, between 74 and 80 percent of their forces were not motorized, relying on railroad for rapid movement and on horse-drawn transport cross country. The percentage of motorization decreased thereafter. In 1944 approximately 85 percent was not motorized. The standard uniform used by the German Army consisted of a Feldgrau (field grey) tunic and trousers, worn with a Stahlhelm.

He was responsible for the considerable expansion of the family's retail and wholesale drapery firm between 1892 and 1927. Biography Born at 42 Wigmore Street, Marylebone, he was the son of Frank Debenham and his wife Emma Folkard née Ridley. Educated at Marlborough College and Trinity College, Cambridge, At the age of 27 he joined the successful business of Debenham & Co., which had been run by his grandfather and father. His restructuring activities led to the splitting of the manufacturing from the retail side of the business, under the name Debenham & Freebody (Freebody was the maiden name of his grandmother). He effected a merger with Marshall & Snelgrove as well as a takeover of Harvey Nichols. He was noted for his paternalistic attitude towards his staff, providing medical and educational support. He was also a pioneer in the dairy industry. On 8 November 1892 he married Cicely Kenrick (1869–1950), daughter of William Kenrick. The couple had eight children, including the artist Alison Debenham. Debenham had an interest in politics, and was a supporter of the Conservative Party. Although he considered entering parliament his business interests prevented this. He did enter local politics, however. He was a member of St Marylebone Borough Council, serving as mayor of the borough in 1910–12. He was also a member of the London County Council. He was elected unopposed at a by-election on 28 February 1912 for the Conservative-backed Municipal Reform party to represent the Marylebone East division, remaining a councillor until 1919. On his retirement in 1927 he sold most of his shares in the firm for £1.8M, so severing his family's connections with the retail chain that still bears his name. He devoted the rest of his life to dairy farming on his estates in Dorset. He was created a baronet, of Bladen in the County of Dorset, in 1931. He died on Christmas Day 1952 at Moor Lane House, Briantspuddle, Dorset, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son, Piers Kenrick Debenham, born in 1904.

Joseph P. Couthouy in command. That day she was ordered to Key West, Florida, for duty in the Gulf Blockading Squadron. On 21 January 1862, she joined in capturing the Olive Branch bound from Cedar Keys to Nassau, Bahamas, with a cargo of turpentine. She again cooperated with Ethan Allen on 26 January 1862 in manning and equipping a boat expedition to the mouth of the Manatee River which captured the sloop Mary Nevis and burned Confederate cavalry barracks. Three days later, she took Spanish brig Terisita of Havana bound for Matamoros, Tamaulipas with a contraband cargo. On 25 February 1862, Kingfisher overtook blockade runner Lion in the Gulf of Mexico after a three-day chase. The great risks involved in blockade duty during the Civil War have not been generally recognized. The need for water, food, or timber often forced parties from the Union Navy ships to venture ashore in hostile territory. On 2 June 1862, two boats from Kingfisher rowed up Aucilla River, Florida, to obtain fresh water. A Southern raiding party surprised the expedition killing two men and capturing the remaining nine. Other landing parties from the bark fared better. An expedition destroyed salt works at St. Joseph Bay, Florida, which had produced some 200 bushels a day. But the hardships of blockade duty in the Gulf were unabated. Early scurvy became a serious problem for the crew prompting Rear Admiral Lardner to order Kingfisher to Boston, Massachusetts. When the ship had been repaired and her crew reinvigorated, Kingfisher was assigned to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron and ordered to Port Royal, South Carolina, where she arrived on 21 December 1862. The bark was stationed in St. Helena Sound, South Carolina, where she distinguished herself for efficiency in reconnaissance work and operations against small parties of Confederates ashore. On 9 April 1863, a party from Kingfisher landed at Middleton's estate, Edisto Island, South Carolina, and captured a group of Southern cavalrymen stationed there to observe and report activity of Union ships in the area. From time to time during the ensuing year, she shelled Confederate troops ashore and sent small landing parties inland to gather information and capture food for her crew and for refugees who had flocked to her for protection. Kingfisher grounded on Combahee Bank in St. Helena Sound on 28 March 1864 and filled with water. After efforts to save the stranded ship proved fruitless, she was abandoned on 5 April 1864.

He serves as the first editor-in-chief of the open-access journal Open Biology published by the Royal Society.Press release by the Royal Society on the launch of the journal, 17 October 2011 (WebCite)http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/g/5256/David+Moore.aspxGLOVER, Prof. David Moore', Who's Who 2011, A & C Black, 2011; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2010 ; online edn, Oct 2010 accessed 11 June 2011 After graduating from Cambridge University, David Glover undertook his PhD research in the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratories as a student of University College, London. As a Damon Runyon Fellow at Stanford University he participated in the Recombinant DNA revolution and discovered sequences that interrupted the ribosomal genes of Drosophila. On establishing his independent laboratory at Imperial College London in 1975, he later showed that these were ancient transposable elements. Together with Peter Rigby, Jean Beggs and David Lane, he co-directed a combined research group exploiting the new techniques of recombinant DNA research. During this time he was elected Member of EMBO. While at Imperial, Glover was awarded a 10-year personal fellowship from the UK's Cancer Research Campaign that allowed him open up a new area of research pioneering the use of Drosophila as a model in which to study cell cycle regulation. He began by characterising the duplication cycles of centrosomes in the rapid nuclear division cycles of Drosophila embryos. This led to genetic studies that allowed him to discover and name the Polo and Aurora protein kinases, required for the function of centrosomes at the poles of mitotic spindles. In 1989, he relinquished his position as Head of the Department of Biochemistry at Imperial to move to the University of Dundee, where with David and Birgitte Lane he established the Cancer Research Campaign Laboratories, Dundee. Here his work demonstrated Polo not only to be required at centrosomes in Drosophila but also for cytokinesis. In parallel studies, Glover found that in an organism as distant as fission yeast, Polo's counterpart, that he named Plo1, was also required to establish functional spindle pole bodies and cytokinesis rings. Remarkably, the localisation and function of Polo kinase at the centrosome, the kinetochore and the central spindle in cytokinesis was highly conserved in human cells where its expression was elevated in tumours. This led Glover to collaborations with Biotechnological and Pharmaceutical industries in developing small molecule inhibitors of Polo for use in cancer therapy. In Dundee he continued to use Drosophila as a means to uncover new components of the mitotic apparatus and its regulatory circuits. These studies uncovered spindle pole molecules whose functions were regulated by Polo kinase; a germ line specific Cdc25 phosphatase that regulates meiotic entry; and demonstrated the roles of PP1 and PP2A protein phosphatases as negative mitotic regulators. His contribution to science in Scotland was recognised by his election to Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1999, Glover moved to the University of Cambridge to become the 6th Arthur Balfour Professor of Genetics and Head of Department. In Cambridge he discovered the second main Aurora B kinase required for cells to progress through metaphase and used genetic approaches to identify and demonstrate the roles of the Greatwall kinase in inhibiting protein phosphase 2A during mitotic entry and progression. Over the past decade he has uncovered the major steps of centriole duplication by demonstrating that Polo-like- kinase 4 (Plk4) is its master regulator; Plk4 expression can drive the de novo formation of centrioles in unfertilised Drosophila eggs. In searching for Plk4's partners, his group identified Asterless (Cep152 in human cells) as required for bringing Plk4 to centrioles and an F-box protein, Slimb – a component of the SCF ubiquitin protein ligase, as responsible for targeting excess Plk4 for destruction. They showed that Plk4 phosphorylates the centriole protein Ana2/STIL to enable it to bind the \\"cartwheel protein\\" Sas6 and thus initiate procentriole formation, the first step of centriole duplication. Glover's group are now studying the consequences of supernumerary centrosomes in a variety of mammalian tissues and their consequences for the balance of cell proliferation and differentiation in the skin and pancreas.

He led the Big Ten Conference in Free Throw Percentage (85.7%) for the 1948-49 season. He was a 3rd Round pick of the Minneapolis Lakers in the 1950 NBA draft but chose instead to sign a contract with the Peoria Caterpillars of the American Athletic Union and the National Industrial Basketball League. The Caterpillars finished 4th in the NIBL but won the National AAU title (the first of three consecutive titles), knocking off the regular season champions, the Phillips Oilers in the semi-finals on Williams last second bucket. Williams and the rest of the Caterpillar team defeated the NCAA Champion Kansas Jayhawks in the AAU Title game. Following the title game, the Los Angeles Times named Williams the AAU Player of the Year; Williams then led Peoria to another AAU National title in 1953. The 1952 win placed Williams as well as Peoria teammates; Ronald Bontemps, Marcus Freiberger, Frank McCabe and Dan Pippin on the U.S. Olympic squad. That team, led by fellow native Hoosier Clyde Lovellette won the gold medal. He played all eight games and finished #8 in scoring for the squad. Williams spent four seasons playing for the Caterpillars and finished with 1,235 career points, eighth on their career scoring list. He was inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Greater Peoria Sports Hall of Fame in 1991.

The Governor of Acadia Louis-Alexandre des Friches de Menneval had only 70 soldiers; the unfinished enceinte remained open and its 18 cannon had not been brought into firing positions; 42 young men of Port-Royal were absent. Any resistance therefore appeared useless. Meneval surrendered without resistance not long after the New Englanders arrived. The New Englanders, led by Sir William Phips, after alleging Acadian violations of the terms of surrender, plundered the town and the fort. After the British sacked Pentagouet, the Wabanaki Confederacy's retaliated with raids along the New England border (See Siege of Pemaquid (1689) and Raid on Salmon Falls) . These attacks were coordinated from Fort Meductic in Acadia. The merchants of Salem and Boston got up a subscription, and in the spring of 1690 the government of Massachusetts organized a campaign led by William Phips against the Acadian settlements. The aftermath of the surrender of Port Royal was unlike any of the previous military campaigns against Acadia. The violence of the plunder alienated many of the Acadians from the New Englanders, broke their trust, and made future relations with their English-speaking neighbors more difficult.Plank, p. 32 Meneval was replaced by Governor Joseph de Villebon who moved the capital of Acadia to Fort Nashwaak on the Saint John River for defensive purposes, and to better coordinate military attacks on New England with the natives at Meductic Indian Village / Fort Meductic. Historical context The Nine Years' War, begun in 1688 in Europe, widened to include the Kingdom of England in 1689 as part of the alliance against France.Plank, pp. 10–11 Authorities in New France capitalized on turmoil in the English colonies in the aftermath of the 1688 Glorious Revolution to launch raids with their Indian allies against targets on the already tense frontiers of New England and New York. Two raids in early 1690, one against Schenectady, New York and the other on Salmon Falls, New Hampshire, galvanized authorities in the Massachusetts Bay Colony to authorize a retaliatory expedition against French Acadia. The idea for an expedition against Acadia first arose in the wake of the August 1689 fall of Fort William Henry at Pemaquid (present-day Bristol, Maine) to French and Indian forces.Baker and Reid, p. 83 In December 1689 Massachusetts authorized an essentially volunteer expedition against Acadia, and established committees to organize it, but the urgency to deal with it brought more public support after the raids in early 1690. Several prominent colonists were considered to lead it. One of the expedition's major proponents, the merchant John Nelson, was rejected because of his previous trade dealings with the French in Acadia.Baker and Reid, p. 84 The command was finally given to Sir William Phips, a Maine native with no military experience who achieved prominence by finding a wrecked treasure ship in the West Indies.Plank, pp. 14–15 (Phips had survived a raid by tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy from Acadia when they destroyed his hometown near Portland, Maine during the First Abenaki War (1676).) On 24 March Phips was commissioned a major general and given command of the expedition. On 28 April 1690 Phips sailed from Boston with a fleet of five ships, carrying 446 provincial militia. His flagship, the Six Friends, mounted 42 guns, while the Porcupine mounted 16. They were accompanied by the sloop Mary and two ketches. At Mount Desert Island they made a rendezvous with the barque Union and another ketch. After investigating French holdings in Penobscot Bay and Passamaquoddy Bay, Phips sailed for Port Royal, arriving near Port Royal on 9 May.Baker and Reid, p. 87 Before approaching the town, he made contact with Pierre Melanson dit Laverdure, a bilingual French Huguenot, early the next morning, and ascertained the condition of the town. He then weighed anchor and sailed up to the town.Baker and Reid, p. 88 Surrender The French garrison consisted of fewer than 90 soldiers, and the fortifications were in a state of destruction. A military engineer had arrived in October 1689 and had begun razing the fort in order build a new one, over the objections of Governor Louis-Alexandre des Friches de Meneval, and none of its cannons were mounted. Furthermore, the garrison only possessed 19 muskets. When Phips sent an emissary on 10 May to demand the fort's surrender, Meneval sent the local priest, Louis Petit, to negotiate terms of surrender. The basic terms he and Phips agreed included protection of the persons and personal property of the Acadians, and preservation of their right to Catholic worship. Phips refused to put the terms in writing, but they were reconfirmed by multiple witnesses when Governor Meneval came to the Six Friends the next day. Aftermath What occurred after the surrender, and the motives for it, has been a subject of historical debate, because French and English sources disagree on a number of points. The terms of the surrendered were breached, and the English militia plundered not only the fort but the town as well, and they desecrated the fort's chapel. Private property was taken and livestock killed. By English accounts, French soldiers and residents were seen removing stores from the fort (which would normally go to the victor as spoils of war) while the surrender negotiations were taking place. When Phips was made aware of this, he flew into a rage, declared the agreement void, and permitted the plunder to take place. French accounts tell a slightly different story. Governor Meneval supposedly did not leave detailed orders when he went to parley with Phips, and some of the garrison's soldiers began drinking. They then broke into merchant stores belonging to one of Meneval's political opponents, Francois- marie Perrot, and removed his goods from the storehouse. It is unclear whether they removed goods belonging to either other merchants or to the government. Since only the \\"King's Stores\\" were supposedly part of the surrender agreement, Phips biographers Baker and Reid note that there is \\"room for doubt whether the agreed terms would thereby have been breached.\\"Baker and Reid, p. 89 Meneval and Petit, when they reported the events, claimed that Phips, unhappy with the condition of the fort and the size of the garrison that had surrendered, used the action of the French soldiers as an excuse to terminate the agreement.Baker and Reid, p. 90 However, the fact that Phips had met with Laverdure prior to approaching Port Royal, and had a presumably reliable assessment of the conditions in the town, renders this explanation unlikely. Phips' biographers posit that it is more likely that Phips needed to have as much plunder as possible. Spoils from the expedition were expected to pay its costs, and Phips made a verbal surrender agreement as \\"a convenience that could be disposed with\\" once the surrender had been given. Consequences A 1691 French document with news of a skirmish: Flotte angloise repoussée en Canada (English flotilla repelled in Canada). Phips also ordered the Acadian peasantry to swear an oath of allegiance to William III and Mary II of England. Phips then determined to install a new government; he organized a provisional government by personally selecting French Acadian leaders to form a council. The council's government did not last long. Joseph Robineau de Villebon, one of Meneval's assistants, returned to Port Royal from France in June, and reestablished French authority. He moved the capital to Fort Nashwaak on the Saint John River for defensive purposes, and to better coordinate military activities with the Abenaki. Port Royal was subjected to a pirate raid not long after the Phips expedition left. The pirates captured the ship that delivered Villebon, destroyed homes and cattle, and allegedly killed some of the inhabitants.Calnek, p. 39 Phips detached Cyprian Southack, commander of the Porcupine, with orders to raid a French fishing port on the Atlantic coast of the Acadian peninsula. Southack went on to conquer Fort St. Louis in the Battle of Chedabucto. Phips returned to Boston, where he was chosen to lead a larger expedition against Quebec later that year, which was a disastrous failure. Phips retained his popularity in New England, and was appointed governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1692 by King William. He continued to be involved in the war until he was recalled in late 1694. The expedition marked the climax of a period of steadily worsening relations between New Englanders and the French imperial authorities, and reconfigured relations between New England and Acadia.Plank, p. 10 Trade was affected, since those who wanted profitable trade with the Mi'kmaq and Acadians, led by John Nelson, failed to gain control of the expedition.Plank, p. 11 The following year, after the English lost a naval battle off St. John, Villebon tried unsuccessfully to negotiate the freedom of 60 French prisoners taken in the siege.

The group consists of two guitarists, a bass guitar player, a drummer and a vocalist/guitarist. History In 1995, Christoph \\"Christ\\" von Freydorf (vocals) and Stefan \\"Fini\\" Finauer (drums), pupils of a convent school, founded the band together with Christoph's church choir friend Jamie \\"Citnoh\\" Richardson (bass guitar). They were joined by Stephan Karl \\"Moik\\" and Franz Wickenhäuser (both guitar). The band was founded in Hohenschäftlarn near Munich. The name Emil Bulls is derived from a children's movie. In 1996, they recorded their first CD Red Dick’s Potatoe Garden themselves. The CD is in great demand today because of its small circulation. In 1997, they attended the Emergenza festival, won the regional finals in Munich and finished third in the European competition. For this competition they hired DJ Paul Rzyttka (known as DJ Zamzoe) who afterwards became a permanent member of the band. After a long tour, their album Monogamy was released by the indie record label Oh My Sweet Records. The record could only be purchased through the internet or during live shows. Monogamy was noticed by Island Records, which offered the band a recording deal. Some of the songs on Monogamy and a few new songs were recorded. The result was Angel Delivery Service, released in 2001. The album was already out of stock a few months later. A new edition was released including a cover version of A-Ha's \\"Take on Me\\". The songs \\"Smells Like Rock'n'Roll\\", \\"Leaving You with This\\" and \\"Take on Me\\" were released as singles. In May 2002, Porcelain was released through Motor Music. \\"The Coolness of Being Wretched\\" and \\"This Day\\" were released as singles. Between June 2001 and August 2002, the band played 129 live shows including Rock am Ring. In August 2003, drummer Stefan Finauer left the band to go to university. He was replaced by Fabian Fab Füß. In 2003, the band played some shows in Canada and the United States. On June 20, 2005, The Southern Comfort was released on Pirate Records. It was the last record with DJ Zamzoe. In February 2007, the live and acoustic album The Life Acoustic was released. The album, which was recorded in Pullach in 2006, was followed by an acoustic tour. The following album The Black Path was released on April 4, 2008, on Drakkar records. It is the hardest record of the band so far and was recorded in Hannover by Benny Richer (Caliban, Krypteria). The single \\"The Most Evil Spell\\" was offered as a free download. In 2009, Chrissy Schneider left the band and was replaced by Andy Bock, who was the guitar player of From Constant Visions. On September 25, 2009, Phoenix was released. \\"Here Comes The Fire\\" was offered as a free download on their website. In September 2009, a music video of \\"When God Was Sleeping\\" was released. The band's next studio offering, Oceanic, was to be released on September 30, 2011. In 2014 the band recorded new album Sacrifice to Venus and released it on August 8 the same year. In the beginning of 2016 band released double Best Of compilation XX. CD1 contained acoustic versions of best Emil Bulls songs while on CD2 there were original versions. The latest Emil Bulls studio album called Kill Your Demons was released on September 29, 2017.

The practice involved nudity, asceticism, and meditation. History In the early 20th century, the term was appropriated by several groups to denote a broad philosophy that included as a central thought that the nude human body is a natural condition and should be widely acceptable for the betterment of society. This philosophy is related closely, and often interchangeably, with nudism and naturism, and has close connection to the hippie movement.Hippie Roots & The Perennial Subculture, 2003. The movement is known by mainly three organisations, the English Gymnosophical Society, Societe Internationale de Gymnosophie and the American Gymnosophical Association. In 1919, the Yoga teacher Blanche DeVries opened a Yoga Gymnosophy Institute in New York that combined Oriental Dance and Yoga. The English Gymnosophical Society was founded in 1922 and became The New Gymnosophy Society in 1926. One of the first members was Gerald Gardner, who in 1945 established the 'Five Acres Club', ostensibly as a nudist club, but as a front for Wiccans, as this was illegal in England until 1951. The Societe Internationale de Gymnosophie was founded in 1926 in France. Dr. Maurice Parmelee (1882-1969), professor of sociology at the City College of New York, wrote from 1923 to 1924 a book, The New Gymnosophy, the title was changed to Nudism In Modern Life in later editions. He took part in the founding of the American Gymnosophical Association 1930. In 1932, Rochester Gymnosophy League in Bushnell's Basin was founded. In 1933 the Dunedin Gymnosophy Club in New Zealand. The biochemist and historian Joseph Needham was known to practice gymnosophy. In the last decade, the word gymnosophy has begun to be used as a term for a new, more spiritual and holistic, free body culture.  The word \\"gymnosophy\\" in literature  A famous poem from the book Non Serviam, 1945, by the Swedish author Gunnar Ekelöf is named \\"Gymnosofisten\\", (the gymnosophist).

Outside the former Soviet Union, the subspecies occurs in Saint Lawrence Island in the Bering sea. It is closely related to one clade of brown bears in Alaska and northwest North America, and is thought to be the ancestor of the Kodiak bear. Description Captive bear with cub at Tierpark Hagenbeck, Germany It is a very large brown bear, the biggest in Eurasia, with a body length of , to tall on hind legs, and a weight up to at least . It is nearly the size of the Kodiak bear; however, the skull is broader than that of the Ussuri brown bear, and compared to that of the Kodiak bear, the breadth of the skull is much greater in proportion to its length, the anterior narial opening is much shorter, and the molars differ in relative size and form. The greatest skull length for males is , and they are wide, while the skulls of females measure in length and in width. Fur colour is predominantly dark brown with a violet tint. Light coloured individuals are rarely encountered. Behaviour and ecology Bear near Dvuhyurtochnoe Lake In the summer period they feed on blueberries, crowberries, humpback salmon, and steelhead. In autumn, they eat nuts from nut-pines and mountain ash, and fish. In times of famine they eat dead fish or marine mammals, berries, and graminoid vegetation. Relationship with humans Bear passing by people at Kurile Lake Kamchatka brown bears are generally not dangerous to humans, and only 1% of encounters result in attack. The first Europeans who went to Kamchatka in the 19th century, although surprised by the number and size of bears there, observed that they were relatively harmless, compared to their Siberian counterparts. However, in July 2008, a platinum-mining compound in the Olyutorsky District of Kamchatka Krai was besieged by a group of 30 starving bears who killed two guards. Trophy hunting Kamchatka brown bears are among the most prized trophies for the Russian hunting industry. In 2005 the Kamchatka Department of Wildlife Management issued 500 hunting permits. Clients paid up to $10,000 to hunt bears. Thus, the economic impacts from recreational hunting of Kamchatka brown bears are significant.

Emerson was married to Anita Loos from June 15, 1919 until his death, and prior to that the couple had worked together as a writing team for motion pictures. They would continue to be credited jointly, even as Loos pursued independent projects. Biography Born and educated in Ohio, Emerson's earliest documented acting credits date from 1904, however like D. W. Griffith he probably played in regional stock companies before then. By 1912—the earliest known year for his involvement in film, as a writer—Emerson was working regularly as a director and writer on the Broadway stage. After periods with American Film Manufacturing Company, where he worked with Allan Dwan and Famous Players-Lasky, Emerson collaborated with George Nichols in making Ghosts, a Griffith production made for Reliance-Majestic Studios during the waning days of work on The Birth of a Nation. The result impressed Griffith to such an extent that Emerson stayed on as Reliance- Majestic changed its name to Fine Arts Film Company and came under the Triangle Film Corporation banner. John Emerson became one Triangle's best- known directors, primarily after the partnership with writer Anita Loos began in 1916; Griffith also valued the pair as being among the best film editors in the business, and they also worked on editing Griffith's massive Intolerance in addition to light, breezy and athletic comedies starring Douglas Fairbanks. Emerson seemed to lose interest in direction around 1919, and afterward worked as a producer and writer, though commonly in projects more readily associated with Loos' taste than his own. Loos wrote extensively, and often disparagingly, of Emerson in her memoirs, but in her early career insisted on maintaining the appearance of partnership with Emerson even if there was none.Anita Loos Emerson's later years were marked by mental illness and long institutionalizations; Loos never divorced him. Although Anita Loos' memoirs may not paint Emerson in the most flattering of terms, the silent films he directed from 1915–19 were important ones. Most of them survive, and several—notably The Mystery of the Leaping Fish and The Americano—remain among the most frequently seen films from this period. He was president of the Actors' Equity Association from 1920 to 1928.

During her first wartime cruise, 27 October 1861 to 30 March 1863, Ethan Allen patrolled in the Gulf of Mexico, capturing eight prizes, and destroying extensive salt works along the Florida coast, thus hampering the Confederate war effort and civilian economy. Ethan Allen returned to Boston for repairs, and between 22 June and 28 October 1863, cruised along the New England coast to protect merchantmen and fishing craft from Southern cruisers. On 9 November, she sailed from Boston to join the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron off Port Royal, South Carolina, 26 November. During the following year and a half, she patrolled the Carolina coast, and for several months served as practice ship for junior officers of her squadron.

It was founded in 1937, and it was the first national institution of higher education in Lebanon. In 1988, it joined the University of Balamand during its foundation as one of the three founding faculties at the time. The faculty currently offers several programs in French in its original location in Sin el Fil, Beirut. They include, but are not limited to, architecture, decorative arts, plastic arts, urban and regional planning, Graphic Design, Digital art direction, Fashion design and audiovisual directing. In October 2000, the University of Balamand launched new programs in English for the faculty at its main campus in El-Koura, which now consists of Architecture, Interior Architecture, Graphic Design and Computer Graphics And Interactive Media.  History  Founded in 1937 by a group of young classical musicians led by the engineer Alexis Boutros.  Details on the foundations of its fields  In 1943, a branch of architecture was sponsored by the famous French engineer Daniel Abou Dargham. In 1948, the school of letters was created which graduated specialists in literature, history and geography. There followed in 1949 by the school of political and economic science. In 1950, the academy set up a school of law, which was forced to close later in 1959. In a later stage, additional fields of study were added to the basic core such as the school of classic dance, the school of acting and the school of sculpture. The academy added new sections of publicity and information in 1975, and audio-visual production in 1987, and urban studies in 1994 Soon after the death of Alexis Boutros, Mr. Georges Haddad was appointed dean of Alba in 1979. He struggled during the civil war to keep the programs running. He managed to achieve the fusion with University of Balamand in 1988. In 2000, the Academy started offering the \\"Interior Architecture and design and Graphic Design\\" programs in English under supervision of Mr. George Fiani.

She was portrayed by Elizabeth Keifer from August 19, 1992 to September 18, 2009. Previous portrayers include Gina Foy from June 1975 to May 1978, Cheryl Lynn Brown from January 1979 to September 26, 1980, Elizabeth Dennehy from May 1988 to June 2, 1989 and Sherry Stringfield from July 21, 1989 to August 3, 1992.  Character Information   Biography  Christina Blake Thorpe was born on-camera in July 1975. Her mother went into labor in the Cedars Hospital cafeteria. Though she was thought to be the daughter of Holly Norris Bauer and Ed Bauer, it later came out that Christina was the product of an affair between Holly Norris Bauer and Roger Thorpe. When this was revealed, Ed Bauer divorced Holly though, being very attached to young 'Chrissy', he agreed continue to raise her as his daughter, with the stipulation that Roger not be a part of her life. In 1979, Holly married Roger, though the marriage was stormy one, ending when Roger raped Holly. Holly pressed charges against Roger though, when it looked as though he would be acquitted, she shot him (in a moment of post-traumatic stress), and was convicted of his murder and sent to prison. While her mother was in prison, Christina lived with Ed and his new wife Rita, until it was learned that Roger was in fact alive (thus negating Holly's murder conviction). After an initial failed kidnapping attempt, Holly fled with Christina to Santa Domingo. However, Roger followed them, eventually cornering them. The encounter ended with Roger falling over a cliff to his presumed death. In an effort to start over, Holly relocated with Christina and her mother Barbara Norris to Europe, where they remained for nearly a decade. Return to town Much later, as an adult—and now going by her middle name, Blake—she returned to Springfield as a spy for Alan Spaulding. Soon, she was tied up in the circuit of double-crosses between Alan, Phillip and Alex where each of them tried to outdo the other. Things were worsened by the reappearance of her father, Roger, who had long been presumed dead in 1989. Phillip tricked Blake into marrying a man posing as him on a yacht, but soon they resumed their romance when she started having true feelings for him. Things became even more difficult after Phillip and Blake married and she tried to cover up the fact that his former wife, Beth, might still be alive. Insecure, she began an affair with Phillip's younger brother, Alan-Michael, while searching for Beth herself, going so far as to have Phillip briefly committed to a mental hospital. Phillip eventually found Beth, ending the marriage. Blake ran to former brother-in-law Alan-Michael in an attempt not to lose a hold on her share of the family fortune. Alan-Michael's wife, Harley, did everything she could to not lose her husband. Harley tried to get even with Blake, but Blake paid Harley to divorce Alan-Michael and faked a pregnancy so that he would marry her. Soon after, her ex-boyfriend kidnapped and tried to kill Alan-Michael and Blake. When the couple was rescued by Roger, Alan-Michael soon discovered Blake's deceptions and left her. She spent some time trying to get him back and pulled him into her blackmailing schemes, but failed to shake his obsession with Eleni Andros. She quickly dove into a relationship with her mother's former flame District Attorney Ross Marler, much to the chagrin of her father, who blackmailed Ross out of his political career. Blake initially seduced Ross only to hurt Holly, who was in love with Ross, but soon fell in love with him herself. They eventually managed to win both of Blake's parents over, and married in 1994. Ross Marler and Ben Warren Things got more complicated for the couple as Alan Spaulding began manipulating them and Ross' estranged daughter Dinah returned to tear them apart. Her suspicions of her stepdaughter led her to bug her rooms and create distrust in the family. After a one-night stand with Rick Bauer, she discovered she was pregnant with twins. She went to Roger and Amanda, who tried desperately to hide her transgression from Ross, but it would eventually come out when the twins had to undergo an operation. In 1997, things got worse when his brother Ben Warren came to town and began trying to blackmail her for sex. She eventually gave in, only to be caught by Ross. After accusing Ben of rape, Ross tried to shoot him and shot his wife by accident, paralyzing her. This didn't last because it was purely psychosomatic, yet she continued to charge Ben for rape, despite evidence that it was consensual. The proof fell into the hands of the mob and they were both blackmailed. Under the weight of guilt, she confessed the truth and Ross left her, suing for custody. She moved on with Ben and tried to help her mother when she learned that she was the Nursery Rhyme Stalker. She and Ross bonded over Holly's case and wound up making love. Suffering through mental breakdowns, psychotic relatives and numerous affairs gave her plenty of fodder for her career as a romance novelist. This would often get her in trouble as her thinly veiled portraits of townspeople often led to their lives becoming endangered. Danger also stalked her when the crazed Tory came to town and attempted to steal Ross and the children away before trying to murder her. She would be constantly torn between loyalty and self-interest as she manipulated or went to ludicrous ends to protect her relationship with Ross, particularly from his daughter. In 1995, Blake had an affair with Rick Bauer and got pregnant and soon learned she was expecting twins. She learned that she was pregnant with children from both men as each man fathered one child. After months of working out the best possible situation for her sons Jason and Kevin, it was revealed that Ross was the father of both children. As Ross returned to his political career, she switched through several careers of her own until his accidental death. Later years Devastated and insecure, she soon entered into a relationship with mayoral rival Jeffrey O'Neill and became the author of the infamous Springfield Burns blog which she used to destroy the lives of her rivals and friends. After sabotaging Jeffrey's campaign, she won the mayoralty race only to be poisoned. The investigation quickly dug up the fact that she was the blogger. In her hospital bed she claimed that she had to lash out at everyone because they made her feel like she didn't exist. After lapsing into a coma for months, she eventually awakened and set her sights on Dinah and Mallet. Blake's schemes resulting in Dinah (who survived being shot in the head by a man from Mallet's past) received backlash from viewers. In 2008 Blake began pursuing Henry Cooper Bradshaw (AKA \\"Coop\\") much to the dismay of viewers. In 2009, Blake, while still in a supporting role, began to receive more sympathetic writing and an increase in screentime. She helped Reva Shayne cope after the death of her husband Jeffrey, helped Olivia Spencer and Natalia Rivera process their feelings for each other, and, after taking over as manager at the Cooper family restaurant Company, helped publish Coop's last book, using the advance to stop Company from being foreclosed. During this time Blake decided to finally move on from the memory of her beloved Ross, and she began talking over the computer with a man she met at a dating service. After a few weeks, they met, and the man was, to her surprise, Frank Cooper, her longtime friend and former lover. They decided to go out on a real date, and a year later, were still together.

The names Apocalyptic Year and Apocalyptical Year have also been used in some literature, in obvious reference to Revelation, also known as \\"The Apocalypse of St. John\\". The fact that the prophets understood a year as 360 days is well attested, and can be seen in the prophecies of Daniel and Revelationhttps://www.jewishroots.net/library/prophecy/daniel/daniel-9-24-27/360-day- prophetic-year.html as seen in the use of \\"time, times and half a time\\" (i.e. 1+2+0.5=3.5), \\"1,260 days\\" and \\"42 months\\". These references represent a period of 1260 days (based on the 360 day Jewish year multiplied by 3.5). Divide 1,260 days by 42 months and you will get a 30-day month, as 12 months of 30 days equals 360-days in a year These time periods occur eight times in scripture: *, \\"time, times and a half\\". *, \\"half one set of seven\\". *, \\"time, times and a half\\". *, \\"42 months\\". *, \\"1260 days\\". *, \\"1260 days\\". *, \\"time, times and a half\\". *, \\"42 months\\".  Origins  The origin appears to be in connection mainly with the following Bible verses referring to the period translated, \\"time\\". And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time. Daniel 7:25 And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and a half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished. Daniel 12:7 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. Revelation 12:14 History In ancient times, twelve thirty-day months were used making a total of 360 days for the year. Abraham, used the 360-day year, which was known in Ur.https://www.fbinstitute.com/Anderson/Chapter6.html The Genesis account of the flood in the days of Noah illustrated this 360-day year by recording the 150-day interval till the waters abated from the earth. In other words, it indicates a 5-month period as being exactly 150 days in length, or five 30-day months. We see it here in the account of the Flood: In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. Genesis 7:11 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. Genesis 7:24 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. Genesis 8:4 The 150 days began on the seventeenth day of the second month, and ended on the seventeenth day of the seventh month. This of course had issues in keeping the seasons correctly in context. The Hebrews added an extra month to compensate.  Examples in literature  Examples of use of the first definition: > Now this seventieth week is admittedly a period of seven years, and half of > this period is three times described as \\"a time, times, and half a time,\\" or > \\"the dividing of times'\\"* twice as forty-two months;† and twice as 1,260 > days.‡ But 1,260 days are exactly equal to forty-two months of thirty days, > or three and a half years of 360 days, whereas three and a half Julian years > contain 1,278 days. It follows therefore that the prophetic year is not the > Julian year, but the ancient year of 360 days.§Anderson, Robert \\"The Coming > Prince\\". Pages 74–75 of the 10th Edition > (*) Dan. vii. 25; xii. 7; Rev. xii. 14. > † Rev. xi. 2' xiii. 5. > ‡ Rev. xi. 3' xii. 6. > § It is noteworthy that the prophecy was given at Babylon, and the > Babylonian year consisted of twelve months of thirty days. That the > prophetic year is not the ordinary year is no new discovery.

The second and third definition can be said to follow from application of the day for a year principle. Examples of the third definition:Fleming, Robert Jr. The Rise and Fall of Papacy (1801). 1848 edition, page 34 > ...we will find that the twelve hundred and sixty days in the Revelation, > being reduced to years, are eighteen years short of Julian years in the > prophetical reckoning, by reason of the additional days turned into years in > the ordinary accounts now, above the Apocalyptical reckoning. > To demonstrate which, I present you with the following scheme:--- > The Prophetical Year. > One 360 + One 360 = Two 720 > Three 1080 + Half 180 = Three Years and a half - 1260 > The Julian Year. > One 365 + One 365 = Two 730 > Three 1095 + Half 183 = Three Years and a half - 1278 > Now if, according to this computation, we subtract twelve hundred and sixty > Apocalyptical years from twelve hundred and seventy-eight Julian or > Gregorian ones ( I call them so ore rotundo, overlooking the smaller > measures of time), there remain eighteen years to be cut off.  Discussion  In scripture, Prophetic Years of 360 days instead of normal years of 365 days has been interpreted as being equal to prophetic months of 30 days or years which has been interpreted as being equal to one \\"time\\" to be able to fit the interpretation that Jesus was the messiah as per Daniel 9. To arrive at that theory, they use \\"times, time, and half a time\\" mentioned in one verse and subsequently 42 months and 1260 days have been mentioned in other verses as found in Daniel and Revelation, these periods have been taken by many as talking about equal periods of time. Prophetic Months Other interpretations, (reference 4) have taken instead, prophetic months as equal to an average of 30.44 years based on 365.2422 divided by 12.

Biography  The final page from Rendezvous, Vampirella #35. Fernández was born in Barcelona. In 1956, aged 16, he joined the Spanish agency Selecciones Ilustradas. From 1958 through 1964 Fernandez worked on war comics (including Air Ace and War Picture Library) and romance comics (including Valentine, Roxy and Marilyn) for British publishers. He also painted covers for paperbacks and picture libraries like Commando and Chiller. Fernández left the comics industry for a period of time in the 1960s, returning in 1970. He drew the strip Mosca from 1970 to 1973. Fernández started working for Warren Publishing in 1973 due to his connections with Selecciones Illustradas. Unlike many of the Spanish artists from S.I., Fernández both wrote and drew his stories. During his period with Warren from 1973 to 1975 a total of 11 of these stories were made, all of which were published in Vampirella (issues 28–32, 35–6, 40–3). The story Rendezvous (issue 35) was included in a list of the top 25 Warren stories of all time in the book The Warren Companion by author David A. Roach. Fernandez won a Warren Award in 1975 for Best Artist/Writer on the story Goodbye My Love, Goodbye (issue 41). An additional story written by Fernandez, but drawn by Jose Miralles appeared in issue 57 of Vampirella in 1977. Warren would later reprint three additional Fernandez stories originally done in Spain in Eerie in 1978 (issue 94), 1980 (issue 117) and 1981 (issue 118). After Warren, Fernández worked on French educational comics for Afha as well as the Cuando el Comic es Arte series for Jose Toutain. He also worked on the series Circulos in 1979 and Zora y los Hibernautas in 1980, which would later be reprinted in the U.S. in the magazine Heavy Metal. In 1982 he drew the comic version of Bram Stoker's Dracula for the Spanish edition of Creepy. He adapted Isaac Asimov stories in 1983 for the book Firmado por: Isaac Asimov, and collaborated with Carlos Trillo to create the medieval fantasy La Leyenda de las Cuatro Sombras for Zona 84. He would later adapt Asimov again with Lucky Star in 1989. Fernández eventually left the comics field in the 1990s to focus exclusively on painting.

It was founded as Fisherwick Hockey Club in 1898, changing its name to Parkview in 1924. It is based in the Co Antrim village of Doagh, near Ballyclare. The club's founding members were workers from the local spinning mills and from agriculture. The club currently plays in Section 2 of the Ulster Senior League. It currently fields two teams every Saturday. Grounds In 1970 a clubhouse built by the members was opened, and in 1974 it was renovated to include a bar. The senior team has to play its home matches on the artificial turf at the Valley Leisure Centre. Plans are advancing for the laying of an artificial pitch at Doagh. Pre World War II record Prior to World War II, Parkview played as a Junior League club. The major success during this period came in the 1936-37 season when the club’s first team won the Irish Junior Cup for the only time in the club’s history.Belfast Newsletter 12/04/1937 Page 3 Senior League success The period between World War II and mid 1970s was the most successful period for the club.

However further success was achieved in knock-out competitions with another Kirk Cup win in 1966-67. 1980s to current day 1983 saw the Club relegated to the Intermediate League and it took 11 years to regain senior status. Promoted after the 1993-94 season, Parkview initially challenged for promotion to Section 1 in its first few years back. After seven years, however, senior status was relinquished again when the Senior League was reorganized after the 2000-01 season. Parkview returned briefly for one season when they won Section 2 in 2001-02. In the most recent season, 2006–07, Parkview finished in fourth place in Section 2, fifteen points behind Down.

The Sandalbinder, an antique statue restored by Cavaceppi, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek Bartolomeo Cavaceppi (c. 1716 – December 9, 1799) was an Italian sculptor who worked in Rome, where he trained in the studio of the acclimatized Frenchman, Pierre-Étienne Monnot, and then in the workshop of Carlo Antonio Napolioni,His name was variously given in contemporary notices. Francesco Giuseppe Napoleoni, who provided sculptures for Bernini's colonnade at St. Peter's may have been kin, according to Seymour Howard, \\"Some Eighteenth-Century 'Restored' Boxers\\" Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 56 (1993, pp. 238-255) p 240 note 5. a restorer of sculptures for Cardinal Alessandro Albani, who was to become a major patron of Cavaceppi, and a purveyer of antiquities and copies on his own account.Tomasz Mickoki, \\"Zeichnungen und Stiche nach Skulpturen in polnische Sammlungen\\", Jahrbuch des deutschen Archäologischen Institut, 1992:205; Mickoki is concerned with three antiquities that passed through Cavaceppi's hands that are conserved in Poland, two sarcophagi and a grave stela. The two sculptors shared a studio. Much of his work was in restoring antique Roman sculptures, making casts, copies, and fakes of antiques, fields in which he was pre-eminent and which brought him into contact with all the virtuosi: he was a close friend of and informant for Johann Joachim Winckelmann.Winckelmann and Cavaceppi are discussed by I. Gesche, \\"Antikenergänzungen im 18. Jahrhundert: Johann Joachim Winckelmann und Bartolomeo Cavaceppi\\", Antikensammlungen im 18. Jahrhundert, 1981:335ff. Winckelmann's influence and Cardinal Albani's own evolving taste may have contributed to Cavaceppi's increased self-consciousness of the appropriateness of restorationsQuickly shifting parameters of what was considered appropriate in restoring antique sculpture is discussed in O. Rossi Pinelli, \\"Artisti, falsari o filologhi? Da Cavaceppi al Canova: il restauro della scultura tra arte e scienza\\", Richerche di storia dell'arte 13/14 (1981:41ff. — a field in which earlier sculptors had improvised broadly — evinced in his introductory essay to his Raccolta d'antiche statue, busti, teste cognite ed altre sculture antiche restaurate da Cav.The designation Cav[aliere] shows that Cavaceppi, like Giovanni Battista Piranesi, had received the papal Order of the Golden Spur. Bartolomeo Cavaceppi scultore romano\\"Collection of antique statues, busts, identified heads and other antique sculptures restored by Cav. Bartolomeo Cavaceppi, Roman sculptor\\"\\". (3 vols., Rome 1768-72). The baroque taste in ornate restorations of antiquities had favoured finely pumiced polished surfaces, coloured marbles and mixed media, and highly speculative restorations of sometimes incongruous fragments.Jennifer Montagu, Roman Baroque Sculpture: the Industry of Art (New Haven: Yale University Press) 1989. Only in the nineteenth century, would collectors begin for the first time to appreciate fragments of sculpture: a headless torso was not easily sold in eighteenth-century Rome. In the competition for a permanent marble of Saint Norbert for the last available niche in St. Peter's Basilica, Cavaceppi, the candidate favoured by Cardinal Albani, lost out in the end to the more conservative declamatory Baroque manner of Pietro Bracci, who received the commission.The details of the story, which \\"admirably documents the workings of power politics and intrigue in matters of taste, traditional factors in the competition for lucrative commissions in the art capital of Western Christendom\\" has been detailed by Seymour Howard, \\"Bartolomeo Cavaceppi's Saint Norbert\\" The Art Bulletin 70.3 (September 1988), pp. 478-485. Cavaceppi, \\"now certainly one of the most underrated artist-personalities in that era\\" according to Seymour Howard, was the Pope's chief restorer, and a measure of his other clientele may be drawn from the plates that illustrated the works of art that had been restored in his extensive studio in the Raccolta, which appeared in three folio volumes, 1768-72. Haskell and Penny noteHaskell and Penny 1981:68. that of sixty plates in the first volume, thirty-four reproduced works already belonging to Englishmen, while a further seventeen showed works in German collections. The remainder were divided among Cardinals Alessandro Albani and Giuseppe Alessandro Furietti (1684–1764) and Conte Giuseppe Fede,Conte Fede owned part of the site of Hadrian's Villa where he carried out excavations in his property. with one more in the Capitoline Museum and another belonging to Jacques-Laure le Tonnelier de Breteuil, the Bailli de Breteuil.C. Depasquale, \\"The Bailli de Breteuil, the Château de Breteuil and its literary connections\\" 2001. The following year's volume showed sixty plates of sculptures that were all on the market. Cavaceppi made a considerable fortune from his endeavors. Cavaceppi's studio, staffed with a host of assistants, was a stop for all the young connoisseurs making the Grand Tour. Goethe described his visit in Italienische Reise XXXII. Cavaceppi was entrusted with making casts of antiquities. Joseph Nollekens purchased from Cavaceppi the casts of the Furietti Centaurs that may still be seen at Shugborough Hall, Staffordshire; Cavaceppi also produced full-size copies in marble. For his contributions in the formation of the Museo Clementino, based in large part on Albani's collection, Cavaceppi was made a Knight of the Golden Spur in 1770Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was made a cavalier of the Golden Spur the same year. (Howard 1988:479). and was henceforth Cavaliere Cavaceppi. His sculptures were presented for sale in the Museo Cavaceppi between the Piazza di Spagna and the Piazza del Popolo, the part of Rome most frequented by foreigners. In the 1770s he carved a reduced version of Trajan's Column, which was purchased by the English virtuoso Henry Blundell to complement his antiqities at Ince Blundell; Blundell also acquired Cavaceppi's working model, a wooden column painted in grisaille.Haskell and Penny 1981:47 At the time of his death, the collection of fragments and casts in the Museo was vast. Prince Giovanni Torlonia purchased over a thousand items from Cavaceppi's legacy.Howard 1993:243 note 5. In some senses, Vincenzo Pacetti, who had collaborated with Cavaceppi on restorations and who supervised restorations and display of the Borghese collection at Villa Borghese was Cavaceppi's successor. An exhibition \\"Bartolomeo Cavaceppi\\", curated by C.A. Picon in London, 1983, helped to bring him out of obscurity.

The film debuted on the cable television channel Syfy in 2008. The film was filmed largely on location at Kualoa Ranch on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. Plot Taking place in 1521 on the coast of Mexico, a group of Aztecs worships and makes sacrifices to a pair of living Tyrannosaurus rex. A group of conquistadores led by Hernán Cortés later arrive on the location and venture into the forest to make camp. One of the Tyrannosaurs crosses the path of one of the conquistadores and devours Cortés's horse. His fellow conquistadores do not believe his story and continue to venture through the dense forest. An Aztec who is not aware of the Tyrannosaur is eaten, while another witnesses the event with an expression of deep horror and surprise. Later, the conquistadores try to kill the tribe of Aztecs, but are put to sleep by a hidden Aztec with a tube of tranquilizer darts. Hernán Cortés surrenders and demands a truce, but realizes they cannot understand him. He murmurs to himself that they are savages, not realizing the chief can understand Spanish, and is knocked out. Once he regains consciousness, he meets a Spanish-speaking female Aztec. She tells him the Aztecs call the Tyrannosaurs \\"Thunder Lizards\\". Later, Hernán Cortés is offered up as a sacrifice, but is freed by his new friend, Gria. It is revealed that of Hernán's fault, the female, who was the chief's daughter, was consumed by one of the Tyrannosaurs. The chief becomes enraged, but he does not know that his daughter Ayacoatl is actually alive and it was her friend who was eaten in her place. The chief orders a sacrifice of all the conquistadores, but his mind changes when his daughter returns. The daughter's marriage is postponed when a Tyrannosaur kills another Aztec girl. The conquistadores set out on a mission to kill the Tyrannosaurs with cannons and muskets. They succeed in killing the male at the loss of one of their companions. At night Cortez and his soldiers rob the temple of gold and try to escape to the coast. They leave lieutenant Rios and sergeant Mendoza to the mercy of the Aztecs as they had become to friendly with them. In their escape to the coast all but Cortes are devoured by the female Tyrannosaurus. Sergeant Menoza is mortally wounded by the Tyrannosaurus. Rios and shaman Xocozin set out to try to kill the animal but Rios has been secretly drugged by Xocozin who tries to kill him. Xocozin leaves Rios to his fate and heads to the village where he is confronted by the Chief who found out his betrayal. Xocozin and the Chief fight with the latter being mortally wounded. Eventually Rios is found by Ayacoatl and Fra Gria, who marries them. At the altar Xocozin is mortally wounded by Rios. Ayacoatl then cuts out Xovozin's heart to use as bait for the female Tyrannosaurus who then is killed in a gunpowder explosion. Fra Gia and Cortes are picked up by a Spanish ship but are warned by Rios not to return to the valley, which Cortes never did when he conquered the Aztec empire. Fra Gia returned to Spain, became a saint and the inventor of Sangria. Ayacoatl and Rios become rulers of the tribe.

Located at 6415 W Mt Vernon Ave it is on the west side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin in the Bluemound Heights neighborhood. The school building was built in 1932 as the home for Solomon Juneau Business High School which closed down in 2006. The school began in late August 2009 as Montessori International Baccalaureate High School then during 2012–2013, they merged with Edward A. MacDowell Montessori School to now serve as a K3-12 school with an International Baccalaureate curriculum for grades 11–12, while using Montessori education for K3-12. About the School MacDowell Montessori School promotes concentration, practical life, and problem-solving skills as students apply knowledge in all subjects. At the K-8 level, classrooms are multi-age, combining the ages of 3–6, 6–9, 9-12 and 12–14. Students integrate science, history, geography, and the arts through lessons, projects, and community experiences. The high school program combines the Montessori philosophy with the International Baccalaureate program, which provides a rigorous curriculum for college preparation. MacDowell emphasizes the importance of productive community involvement and a humanistic worldview. International Baccalaureate The International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO), is a recognized leader in the field of international education. It is a non-profit, mission-driven foundation that works with 2,600 schools (April 2009). Students are taught to be active learners, well-rounded individuals and engaged citizens, who gain practical experience of being part of an international community. There are various diploma program course offerings at MacDowell Montessori that can be taken during grades 11–12. Montessori Macdowell Montessori is one of many schools that use the Montessori method of education. The importance of developing a love of learning is central to the Montessori method of education. The Montessori method is based on the research of Italian physician and educator Maria Montessori (1870-1952), who developed the educational philosophy after scientifically observing children in learning environments. Dr. Montessori found that children have the effortless ability to absorb knowledge from their surroundings and develop confidence by teaching themselves. She developed educational plans based on the natural behavior of a child, untouched by adult commands, classroom competition or regimented schedules. Dr. Montessori's philosophy remains the foundation of an astounding educational practice today. Athletics and Extra Curricular Activities There are multiple extracurricular activities for grades 1-12, as well as various school occupations for grades 7-12. The Solomon Juneau Business High School athletics program (Juneau Pioneers) is being used by MacDowell Montessori for cross country, girls volleyball, girls & boys basketball, cheerleading, girls & boys golf, and girls & boys tennis under the name Milwaukee Juneau.

Background As Tego Calderón stated, he wasn't too happy about making music on his previous album, The Underdog/El Subestimado, but when he made El Abayarde Contra-Ataca, Tego was really happy about making music. To reflect that, the lyrical style of the album is mostly influenced by African sounds, and other things Tego likes.

They established a blend of religious and secular rule in parts of Yemen from 897. Their imamate endured under varying circumstances until the republican revolution in 1962. Zaidiyyah theology differed from Ismailis or Twelver Shi'ites by stressing the presence of an active and visible imam as leader. The imam was expected to be knowledgeable in religious sciences, and to prove himself a worthy headman of the community, even in battle if this was necessary. A claimant of the imamate would proclaim a \\"call\\" (da'wa), and there were not infrequently more than one claimant.Jane Hathaway, A Tale of Two Factions; Myth, Memory, and identity in Ottoman Egypt and Yemen. New York 2003, pp. 79-81. The historian Ibn Khaldun (d. 1406) mentions the clan that usually provided the imams as the Banu Rassi or Rassids.H.C. Kay, Yaman: Its early medieval history, London 1892, p. 185. In the original Arab sources the term Rassids is otherwise hardly used; in Western literature it usually refers to the Imams of the medieval period, up to the 16th century. The Rassid branch that came to power with imam al-Mansur al-Qasim (r. 1597-1620) is known as Qasimids (Al al-Qasimi). The establishment of the imamate The imams based their legitimacy on descent from the Islamic prophet Muhammad, mostly via the prominent Zaydiyya theologian al-Qasim ar-Rassi (d. 860) - his cognomen refers to ar-Rass, a property in the vicinity of Mecca that he owned.Encyklopädie des Islam, Vol. 3, Leiden 1936, p. 1216. After him, the medieval imams are sometimes known as Rassids. The first of the ruling line, his grandson al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya, was born in Medina. His fame as an intellectual as well as a leader of note, led to his invitation to Yemen. He was summoned to govern the highland tribes in 893 and again in 896-97. Al-Hadi introduced a multitude of policies and practices that evolved into the particular Yemeni Zaidi Shia brand. The efforts of al-Hadi eventually became the basic guidelines for the religious as well as political characteristics of Yemeni Zaydism. Al-Hadi, however, was not able to consolidate his rule in all of Yemen. He could not even create an enduring state in the highlands, due to the strong localism persisting in the region. There were revolts as well as segments of the population that did not accept his and his successors' pretensions to religio-political rule.Cornelis van Arendonk, Les débuts de l'imamat zaidite au Yemen. Leiden 1960 Although he did not succeed in establishing any permanent administrative infrastructure, al-Hadi's descendants became the local aristocracy of the northern highlands, and it is from among them that most of the imams of Yemen were selected for the next one thousand years. Occasionally the imams were drawn from other lines descending from Muhammad.Enzyklopädie des Islam, Vol. III, Leiden 1936, p. 1216 Yemen throughout most of that period was only rarely a unified political entity; in fact, what was included within its frontiers varied widely, and it has not been governed consistently or uniformly by any single set of rulers except for brief periods. It existed as a part of a number of different political systems/ruling dynasties between the ninth and sixteenth centuries, after which it became a part of the Ottoman Empire. Rivalries with other dynasties After Imam al-Hadi's death in 911, his sons took over the imamate in turn, although it was not hereditary but rather elective among the descendants of Muhammad. From the 11th to the early 17th centuries, however, the imams were usually not chosen from the sons of the former imam, but rather circulated among the various Rassid branches. Meanwhile, a multitude of smaller dynasties and families established themselves in the highlands, as well as in Tihama (the low coastal plain) where the imams rarely ruled. Among the better known of these are the Yu'firids (in San'a and Shibam, 847-997), the Sulayhids (in the southern highlands, 1047-1138), the Zuray'ids (in Aden, 1080-1174), and the Hatimids (in San'a, 1098-1174).H.C. Kay, Yaman: Its early medieval history. London 1892 It was during this period, when the Fatimid state was influential, that a portion of the population was converted to Isma'ili Shiʿism. Beginning with the conquest of Yemen by the family of Salah al-Din ibn Ayyub (Saladin) in 1174, a series of dynasties exercised a modicum of control and administration in Yemen for roughly the next 400 years; these are, in chronological sequence, the Ayyubids, from 1173/74 to 1229; the Rasulids, from 1229 to 1454; the Tahirids, from 1454 to 1517; and the Mamluks, from 1517 to 1538, when the Ottoman Empire took the Yemeni Tihama.For the chronology of these, see Peter Truhart, Regents of nations, Vol. 3, München 2003, pp. 1090-1. During most of this period, the dynasties and their rulers were primarily engaged in familial, regional, and occasionally sectarian disputes. Ironically, the Sunni Rasulids, who eventually concentrated their rule in southern Yemen for precisely that reason, were the dynasty under which the region experienced the greatest economic growth and political stability.Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. VIII, Leiden 1995, pp. 455-7. For part of the medieval era the Zaydiyyah imams were eclipsed by the lowland dynasties, and for long periods there would be no imam at all (especially in 1066-1138 and 1171-1187). From the end of the thirteenth century the political fortunes of the Zaydiyya imams revived somewhat. They were able to hold their own against the Rasulids and Tahirids and sometimes expand their territory. Often, however, and especially after 1436, the imamate was split between several contenders. Comparatively little is known about the medieval Zaydi imams and their efforts to establish themselves and develop some form of administration (including tax collection), or their success in promoting Zaydi goals during this period. From the available evidence, there was very little continuity and a great deal of competition among the Zaydi families and clans. For example, in a presumably representative two-hundred-year period from the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries, there appear to have been more than twenty different candidates for the imamate, representing more than ten distinct clans. The Qasimid state The rule of Al-Mutawakkil Isma'il 1675 AD Eventually the Europeans entered the Middle East, specifically the Portuguese and then others, in the effort to control the Red Sea trade. For the Zaydiyya imams, however, the Ottomans constituted the greater external threat. Ottoman expeditions managed to defeat the highland tribesmen in the mid decades of the sixteenth century. From the early 17th century al-Mansur al-Qasim, belonging to one the Rassid branches (later known as the Qasimids), raised the standard of rebellion. His son al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad managed to gather the entire Yemen under his authority, expel the Turks, and establish an independent political entity. For a time, the imams ruled a comprehensive territory, including South Yemen and areas even further to the east. Their economic base was strengthened by the coffee trade of the coastal entrepot Mocha. Unlike in the previous practice, the Qasimids ruled as a hereditary dynasty. The power of the imamate declined in the 18th and 19th century. The territory controlled by the imams shrank after the late 17th century, and the lucrative coffee trade declined with new producers in other parts of the world. Al-Mutawakkil Isma'il expanded the Qasimid state to it' greatest extent. The Qasimid state has been characterized as a \\"quasi-state\\" with an inherent tension between tribes and government, and between tribal culture and learned Islamic morality. The imams themselves adopted the style of Middle East monarchies, becoming increasingly distant figures. As a result, they eventually lost their charismatic and spiritual position among the tribes of Yemen.Vincent Steven Wilhite, Guerilla war, counterinsurgency, and state formation in Ottoman Yemen, PhD Thesis, Ohio State University 2003, p. 130. The imamate was further eclipsed by the second coming of the Turks to lowland Yemen in 1848, and to the highlands in 1872. However, the Ottoman troops were never able to entirely quell resistance against Turkish rule. The occupants were eventually driven out by 1918, by a Qasimid side-branch which inaugurated the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen. Modern history For the next 44 years North Yemen was ruled by two powerful imams. al-Mutawakkil Yahya Muhammad Hamid ad-Din and his son Ahmad bin Yahya created a king-state there much as the kings of England and France had done centuries earlier. The two imams strengthened the state and secured its borders. They used the imamate to insulate Yemen and revitalize its Islamic culture and society at a time when traditional societies around the world were declining under imperial rule. While Yemen under the two imams seemed almost frozen in time, a small but increasing number of Yemenis became aware of the contrast between an autocratic society they saw as stagnant and the political and economic modernization occurring in other parts of the world. This produced an important chain of events: the birth of the nationalist Free Yemeni Movement in the mid-1940s, an aborted 1948 revolution in which Imam Yahya was killed, a failed 1955 coup against Imam Ahmad, and finally, the 1962 takeover in which imam Muhammad al-Badr was deposed by a group of Egyptian supported and financed Sunni officers and the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) was proclaimed under the leadership of Abdullah al-Sallal.Paul Dresch, A history of modern Yemen, Cambridge 2000, pp. 28-88, http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam031/00029266.pdf The first five years of President Al-Sallal's rule, from 1962 to 1967, comprised the first chapter in the history of North Yemen. Marked by the revolution that began it, this period witnessed a lengthy civil war between Yemeni republican forces, based in the cities and supported by Egypt, and the royalist supporters of the deposed imam, backed by Saudi Arabia and Jordan. In 1965 Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser met with King Faisal of Saudi Arabia to consider a possible settlement to the civil war. The meeting resulted in an agreement whereby both countries pledged to end their involvement and allow the people of North Yemen to choose their own government. Subsequent peace conferences were ineffectual, however, and fighting flared up again in 1966.http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/yemen.htm By 1967 the war had reached a stalemate, and the republicans had split into opposing factions concerning relations with Egypt and Saudi Arabia. In late 1967 Al- Sallal’s government was overthrown and he was replaced as president by Abdul Rahman al-Iryani. Fighting continued until 1970, when Saudi Arabia halted its aid to royalists and established diplomatic ties with North Yemen. Al-Iryani effected the long-sought truce between republican and royalist forces, and presided over the adoption of a democratic constitution in 1970. The last ruling Rassid descendant Muhammad al-Badr, greatly disappointed by the Saudi recognition of the republic, emigrated to London where he died in 1996.http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/History/Yemen-history.htm In June 1974 military officers led by Colonel Ibrahim al-Hamdi staged a bloodless coup, claiming that the government of Al-Iryani had become ineffective. The constitution was suspended, and executive power was vested in a command council, dominated by the military. Al-Hamdi chaired the council and attempted to strengthen and restructure politics in North Yemen. Al-Hamdi was assassinated in 1977, and his successor, former Chief of Staff Ahmed Hussein al-Ghashmi, was killed in June 1978.An account of the political history up to the late 1970s can be found in Robert W. Stookey, Yemen: The Politics of the Yemen Arab Republic. Boulder 1978. The lengthy tenure of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who ruled North Yemen from 1978 until it merged with South Yemen in 1990, proved more stable. Saleh strengthened the political system, while an influx of foreign aid and the discovery of oil in North Yemen held out the prospect of economic expansion and development.Paul Dresch, A history of modern Yemen, Cambridge 2000, pp. 151-214.

Spaced Out Bunny is one of four Bugs Bunny cartoons produced during 1979-1980, the first new shorts since 1964's False Hare. Spaced Out Bunny would also be the last Warner Brothers- released short to have Mel Blanc voicing Bugs. Plot While walking in a forest, Bugs Bunny wonders aloud how everyone is out to get everyone else; this is illustrated by hostile behavior as Bugs' interacts with, among other things, a rock and a butterfly. He then sees a carrot and begins to eat it, unaware that it is a trap set by Marvin the Martian. Marvin's purpose for capturing Bugs (with what Marvin explains is an \\"ACME Super Rack and Pinion Tranquilizer Carrot\\") is to provide a playmate for Hugo the Abominable Snowman (from 1961's The Abominable Snow Rabbit). After Bugs awakens and realizes where he is, Marvin explains his rationale before turning Hugo loose on Bugs (\\"Oh no, not again!\\" cries Bugs, remembering his earlier encounter with Hugo). Hugo reprises his lines from Snow Rabbit, including his intention to \\"hug him and squeeze him and name him George.\\" Bugs regains the upper hand on his captors by suggesting to Hugo that he needs a robot; Marvin attempts to make a getaway but Hugo reaches into the spaceship and repeats his \\"I will call him George\\" lines. When an agitated Marvin demands that Hugo cease his behavior, an angry Hugo spanks Marvin. Bugs then whispers in Hugo's ear, suggesting something that he would be good at. The scene cuts to Hugo's wrist, where he proudly displays his new \\"Mickey Martian\\" wristwatch.

Situated north of the Burgh of Kelso, Stichill lies north of the Eden Water and from the English Border at Coldstream. Stichill is mentioned as a manor of Sir Thomas Randolph, later the Earl of Moray, when in 1308 it was considered forfeited to Edward I of England and granted to Adam Gordon.Balfour Paul, Scots Peerage Vol V pp291-2 Stichill is also mentioned in Kenneth Young's biography of Sir Alec Douglas Home. 1513 Flodden Field : Sometimes they fought farther afield but always against the English. One Home was killed in a battle against Henry Percy (Hotspur) at Verneuil in France in 1424 under 'auld alliance' of Scots with Frenchmen. Nearer at hand was Flodden Field, a few miles south across the Tweed from the Home domain near Coldstream. On that drizzling wet day in September 1513 it was doutless true, as Walter Scott wrote, that The Border slogan rent the sky ! A Home ! A Gordon ! was the cry.... but the third Lord Home's actions on the battlefield were open to misinterpretation. After an early successful skirmish against Lord Howard, Lord Home and his men retired from the field laden with spoils, leaving their King and hundreds of Scots to be slain and the battle lost. Home was severely criticized for running out. But did he? ' It is equally probable' his descendant Alec claimed at the annual Flodden commemoration 450 years later, ' that having fought the skirmish, Home interpreted his duty as advance guard to press on and secure for the Scottish army the ford at Coldstream which would guarantee its safety. ' Speech on the 8th August 1968. 'If the descendants of the slain had erected a war memorial in stone the names of honour would be our own, ' he said. Indesputable, however, is the fact that three years later, the third Lord Home and his brother were hanged and their heads displayed on the Tolbooth in Edinburgh. The feuding Scots wrought their vengeance in blood, their hatreds in destruction. In the time of Mary Queen of Scots, one of the Home castles that stood at Stichill, a few miles north west of the Hirsel, was 'destroyit ', and then rebuilt as a rampart against the English, thanks to a gift of 2,000 livres from King of France. The sixth Lord Home, instead of fighting the English, embraced them. King James VI of Scotland was his friend and with him in 1603 he travelled to London and to the throne of England. Home became a Privy Councillor and in March 1604 -5 was created earl as well as Lord Dunglas and Baron of Jedburgh. En deuxieme noces, he married a noble English girl, Marie Sutton, eldest daughter of 9 th Lord of Dudley, so putting the Scottish Homes firmly into the English aristocracy. ( Sir Alec Douglas-Home by Kenneth Young page 8 ). His grandson was not so lucky. He fought for the King in the Civil War and lost his estates to the Cromwellians. They were returned by Charles II in 1660 and the forth Earl of Home a member of his Privy Chamber, marrying Anne Sackville, daughter of one of the king's close friends, the Earl of Dorset. Strangely enough, later earl, the sixth, violently opposed the Act of Union of England and Scotland, and his son was suspected of Jacobitism. A contemporary described him as ' a tall slovenly man endowed with very good parts; is a firm countryman but never would acknowledge King William'. The eighth Earl, however, was a thorough Hanoverian and a professional soldier. He fought against Bonnie Prince Charlie in the '45, and was rewarded by King George II with the Governorship of Gibralter and the rank of Lieutenant- General. He was leas lucky in love. He married a widow, daughter and heiress of a rich Jamaican; but deserted her within a year because, according to one account ' she's a witch, a quean, an old cozening Quean'. ( The Merry Wives of Windsor, IV. iii. 180) Pringles The village lies in the historic territory of the Pringles, a notorious Riding family of Border Reivers. The Pringles of Stichill are a cadet branch of the Pringles of that Ilk. Robert Pringle of Baitingbush purchased the lands of Stichill in 1628, and his grandson, another Robert Pringle, was created 1st Pringle Baronet of Stichill, in the Baronetcy of Nova Scotia, in 1683.

Alexandra Land (, Zemlya Aleksandry) is a large island located in Franz Josef Land, Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russian Federation. Not counting detached and far-lying Victoria Island, it is the westernmost island of the Franz Josef Archipelago. It is the site of a Russian military base that was reopened in 2017. Geography The highest point of the island, , is the summit of Kupol Lunny (Купол Лунный) \\"Dome of the Moon\\", a large ice dome covering most of the western part of the island. At the western end of the western glaciated area lies the Nordenskiöld Glacier; other glaciers in the island are the Worcester Glacier (HMS Worcester Glacier) and the Payer Glacier. The northern part of the island is unglacierized and its eastern end forms a peninsula stretching southwards, the Polyarnykh Letchikov Peninsula. This peninsula is covered by Kupol Kropotkina (Купол Кропоткина), a smaller ice dome. There are three large lakes on the island, including the Utinoye Lake (Duck Lake) and the Ledyanoye Lake (Ice Lake). Dezhnev Bay (Zaliv Dezhneva) lies between the western part of the island and the Polyarnykh Letchikov Peninsula. Cape Thomas (Mys Tomasa) is the southernmost headland of the peninsula. Cambridge Channel (Proliv Kambritch) is a wide sound between Alexandra Land and Zemlya Georga. At the southern end this island has two capes pointing southwestwards in its southernmost coast: Cape Lofley and Cape Ludlow. Cape Mary Harmsworth, the cape pointing westwards is the westernmost point of the Franz Josef Archipelago proper. History and ecology The English explorer Benjamin Leigh Smith, sighted Alexandra Land in 1880, but did not land. He named the area for Alexandra, then Princess of Wales. An alternative account states that the name \\"Alexandra Land\\" commemorates Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna of Russia (1783–1801), who became Archduchess of Austria in 1799 upon her marriage to Archduke Joseph of Austria, Palatine of Hungary (1776-1847). Alexandra Land is home to Nagurskoye military base, Russia's northernmost military base, built in the 1950s. Russian navigator Valerian Albanov of the Svyataya Anna reached Cape Mary Harmsworth in Alexandra Land in 1914 after his ordeal on the polar ice. Cape Mary Harmsworth was named after Alfred Harmsworth's wife Mary. Alfred Harmsworth, fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, was the main sponsor of the 1894 Jackson-Harmsworth Polar Expedition to Franz Josef Land. The polar bear, Ursus maritimus, is found on Alexandra Land. The polar bear population in this region, as in other Arctic subregions, is genetically distinct from other polar bear subpopulations in differing Arctic subregions. During World War II, the Germans established an ill-fated meteorological station on the island, called Schatzgräber (\\"Treasure Hunter\\"). Most of the members were stricken with trichinosis after eating raw polar bear meat. The survivors were removed and the project abandoned. Nagurskoye Nagurskoye is a Russian base located on the island at , on the site of the former meteorological station. It was named after pioneer pilot Jan Nagórski (1888-1976) and served as one of the most important meteorological stations in the archipelago during the Cold War. This base has a snow runway. An Antonov An-72 cargo aircraft crashed while landing at Nagurskoye on 23 December 1996. A major new base, named the \\"Arctic Trefoil\\" (Arkticheskiy trilistnik) for its three-lobed structure, was constructed at Nagurskoye. It can house 150 soldiers for 18 months and has an area of .Russia Builds Second Military base to Support Arctic Ambitions {- valign=\\"top\\" |Original map of the route taken by Nansen and Johansen during their 1895–96 North Pole expedition: The \\"Alexandra\\" southern coast is included in the west. |Alexandra Land in an 1898 map of Franz Josef Land showing the explorations of Frederick G.

Effective refractory period in green. In electrocardiography, during a cardiac cycle, once an action potential is initiated, there is a period of time that a new action potential cannot be initiated. This is termed the effective refractory period (ERP) of the tissue. This period is approximately equal to the absolute refractory period (ARP), it occurs because the fast sodium channels remain closed until the cell fully repolarizes. During this period, depolarization on adjacent cardiac muscles does not produce a new depolarization in the current cell as it has to refract back to phase 4 of the action potential before a new action potential can activate it. ERP acts as a protective mechanism and keeps the heart rate in check and prevents arrhythmias, and it helps coordinates muscle contraction. Anti-arrhythmic agents used for arrhythmias usually prolong the ERP. For the treatment of atrial fibrillation, it is a problem that the prolongation of the ERP by these agents also affects the ventricles, which can induce other types of arrhythmias.

Tegenkamp also ended his 2006 season by getting a bronze medal in the 5000m at the IAAF World Cup in Athletics, with a time of 13:36.83. In 2007, he won the USA Indoor National 3k with a time of 7:46.08. Then, he set a personal and American record in the two-mile run at the Prefontaine Classic with a time of 8:07.07, breaking the existing record set by Alan Webb by more than four seconds. Tegenkamp also finished second behind Bernard Lagat in the 5,000m at the 2007 U.S. Outdoor Track & Field Championships, which earned him the right to compete at the IAAF World Championships in Osaka. At the 2007 IAAF world championships Matt finished fourth in the 5,000m event, missing out on the bronze medal by .03 second, with a time of 13:46.78 to Moses Ndiema Kipsiro of Uganda's 13:46.75. In 2008, Teg earned his first trip to the Olympic Games. As a \\"tune-up\\" for the Olympic Games, he ran the 1500m in 3:37.94 (a facility and state of Wisconsin record) at the UW-Madison McClimon Outdoor Track along with some of his training partners and one pacer for the first 2.75 laps on July 15, 2008. At the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials in Eugene, Oregon, Tegenkamp qualified by finishing second to Lagat in the 5,000-meter run with a time 13:29.68. Soon after the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, Matt and wife Michelle Carson, and Matt's coach began efforts of moving to Portland, Oregon for Nike's Oregon Project along with other professional team members that were training under coach Schumacher at that time in Madison, WI. In 2009, Tegenkamp became one of only 6 non-African runners to break the 13 minute barrier in the 5000 meters with his PR of 12:58.56. This makes him the fifth fastest American of all time over the 5000 metres distance behind Bernard Lagat, Chris Solinsky, Bob Kennedy, & Dathan Ritzenhein. In 2011, Tegenkamp made his first attempt at the 10,000 meter distance. He was once quoted saying, \\"Teg doesn't run no 10k,\\" though he later retracted this statement and made his track 10,000 meter début on May 1, 2011 at the Payton Jordan Cardinal Invitational, running 27:28.22. He finished runner-up at the 2011 USA 10,0000 meter championships, closing the final 800 meters in 1:53. In 2012, he qualified for the Olympics by placing second at the U.S. Olympic Trials. Tegenkamp then went on to compete in the 10,000 meters at the 2012 Summer Olympics, where he finished 19th at 28:18.26.JS Online Ahmed, Tegenkamp left behind in 10,000 August 4 2012 Retrieved on August 6, 2012 On July 4, 2013, Tegenkamp became the US Road 10k Champion at the Peachtree Road Race, finishing with a time of 28:25.

The genus was described in 2005 to encompass species of hippos that were previously grouped in Hexaprotodon. Archaeopotamus means \\"the ancient of the river\\". Of all identified hippos, only Kenyapotamus is older. Kenyapotamus, however, is only known from partial fossils; Archaeopotamus is the oldest well-identified hippo. Characteristics Many prehistoric hippo fossils are known primarily through fossils of the lower jaw. Archaeopotamus, like Hexaprotodon, has three pairs of incisors. Unlike other Hexaprotodon, Archaeopotamus has a highly elongate mandibular symphysis. The informal name \\"narrow muzzled hippos\\" has been suggested for this genus. A. lothagamensis A. lothagamensis is a species whose fossils were discovered at Lothagam, a site southwest of Lake Turkana in Kenya and first described in 2000. When first described, the species was classified as Hexaprotodon lothagamensis, although the significant morphological differences between other Hexaprotodon species, were noted. A. lothagamensis was smaller than the modern hippopotamus and also smaller than A. harvardi and with a more slender skeleton. It was, however, significantly larger than the modern pygmy hippopotamus. A. harvardi A. harvardi is a species of hippo first described in 1977, originally as Hexaprotodon harvardi. Although the proportions of A. harvardi and A. lothagamensis are similar, the former species is significantly smaller. Femurs of A. harvardi are approximately the same size as those of the modern hippopotamus. Another group of fossils, originally described as Hexaprotodon sahabiensis or the Abu Dhabi Hippopotamus, are now considered to belong to A. harvardi or A. lothagamensis. The fossil record for A. harvardi is more extensive than for other Archaeopotamus. A. harvardi is believed to have had a more riparian lifestyle than A. lothagamensis. Distribution Fossils of Archaeopotamus have been unearthed near Lake Turkana, Kenya; near Lake Victoria in Kenya and in Abu Dhabi and thus likely ranged across East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Evolution The immediate ancestor of Archaeopotamus is unknown. Whether Archaeopotamus is descended from Kenyapotamus cannot be determined from the few fossils available. Although Archaeopotamus is more primitive than any member of the genus Hippopotamus, it is likely a sister group of both hippopotamuses and Hexaprotodon. Fossils similar to Archaeopotamus have been dated to as recently as about 2 million years ago, the end of the Pliocene epoch. These fossils are significantly different from those of Hippopotamus and Hexaprotodon of the same time.

A storied member of the New York sailing community, the club is perhaps best known for its contributions to New York sailing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when it featured prominently as one of the leading yacht clubs of its day. The Atlantic Yacht Club's facilities have moved several times over its history: the first facility was located at the foot of Court Street on Gowanus Bay in Gowanus, Brooklyn; it subsequently moved to a site at the foot of 55th Street in the neighborhood that subsequently became known as Sunset Park, Brooklyn. In 1898 it moved to perhaps its most famous club-house, located in Seagate. Seagate is located on the western end of Coney Island, and the club facilities were located on the northern, inland, side of Coney Island facing Gravesend Bay. For many years, the Atlantic Yacht Club was one of the largest and most prestigious yacht clubs in New York City. The club's current location on Gravesend Bay faces out toward its former Sea Gate site. A family oriented sailing club, the Atlantic Yacht Club sponsors an active junior sailing program. History Clubhouse of the Atlantic Yacht Club at Seagate, as it appeared in the 1890s. Photo by John S. Johnston. Atlantic Yacht Club House c 1894 The Atlantic Yacht Club was organized in 1866 by a breakaway group from the earlier Brooklyn Yacht Club. Within five years its membership rolls eclipsed those of the Brooklyn Yacht Club, and the club developed a reputation as an active corinthian sailing organization that attracted many of Long Island's most prominent citizens and soon drew in members from throughout the region, as well as prominent sailors who frequented the active New York sailing season. The Atlantic Yacht Club rapidly developed into one of the most active yacht clubs in New York, hosting regular regattas and competing against the leading yacht clubs in the region. The club's annual Atlantic Race Week and Lipton Cup regatta regularly drew sailors from around the world, competing in multiple classes. The club was also a driving force behind the formation of the United States Power Squadrons in 1914. The club's original clubhouse was a barge that was moored at the foot of Court Street at the end of Gowanus Creek, facing Gowanus Bay. Gowanus Creek, and the Erie Basin in Red Hook, Brooklyn served for several decades as a center of the New York sailing and yachting community, and several important boat yards were located in the area. As time passed, however, increasing industrialization in the area led many to relocate to other sites around New York Harbor and, indeed, locations in Long Island Sound. In the early 1880s, the club acquired a waterfront farm property on 55th Street in Yellow Hook, Brooklyn. The neighborhood subsequently assumed the name of Bay Ridge, a name suggested by club-member, former Commodore and leading Brooklyn florist, James Weir. The converted clubhouse was soon replaced by a larger facility constructed at the end of the club's new pier at the end of 55th Street. A marina and anchorage were established at the same site at that time. Clubhouse of the Atlantic Yacht Club at 55th Street in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, as it appeared in the early 1890s. Photo by John S. Johnston. A new clubhouse at Seagate was designed by Frank Tallman Cornell and built in 1898 on Poplar Avenue overlooking Gravesend Bay (the site of the old clubhouse becoming the main yard of the Morse Dry Dock and Repair Company). The move to the new clubhouse was driven in large part by Commodore George Jay Gould I, the prominent financier and a son of Jay Gould. The club attracted New York socialites and aristocrats, including prominent members of the Auchincloss, Dodge, Elsworth, Fish, Gould, Hoagland, Iselin, Vermilye and Voorhees families, among many others. Sir Thomas Lipton, J.P. Morgan and the Earl of Dunraven (the British challenger for the America's Cup, with his yacht Valkyrie) were among the club's prominent members. Known for corinthian sailing, for many years the club sponsored one of the most active racing programs in New York Harbor, holding races almost weekly through the summer season. Sir Thomas Lipton, a five-time unsuccessful British challenger for the America's Cup, typically stayed at the club during his America's Cup campaigns. His yacht Shamrock docked at the Atlantic Yacht Club during the Cup campaigns. The Atlantic Yacht Club played a major role with respect to the famous Kaiser's Cup transatlantic race of 1905. The race was initially proposed on September 18, 1903 at the Sea Gate club-house during a dinner to commemorate the retirement as club Commodore of Robert E Tod. Initially intended as a snub directed at the New York Yacht Club's largely steam-powered yachting fleet, at Lipton's recommendation the regatta was encharged to the New York Yacht Club. In due course, the regatta was won by the yacht Atlantic, sponsored by the New York Yacht Club, and skippered by Charlie Barr. Barr, a three-time winner of the America's Cup, was one of the leading sailors of his day. The Atlantic sailed to victory in record time, establishing trans- Atlantic mono-hull records that stood for 100 years. The AYC's entry, the yacht Thistle, a schooner built in 1901 by New York's Townsend & Dourney, and owned and skippered by Robert E Tod, finished 10th. Tod, a New York investment banker, was the only owner-skipper in the regatta. The Atlantic Yacht Club's Seagate clubhouse burned down in 1933. The club soldiered on for a number of years thereafter, becoming inactive in the 1950s. The club was revived several decades later, in the early 21st century. Today, the AYC operates as a sailing club based off Bay Parkway, directly across Gravesend Bay from its earlier Sea Gate location, with a social facility in Brooklyn Heights.

The facility has recorded over 1000 albums during the last 25 years. The studio was incorporated as Lions Gate Studios, subsequently changing its name to Vancouver Studios before finally settling on the Greenhouse Studios name. The operation started as a one-room studio in half of an industrial building. A steady stream of clients attracted by the equipment, facilities, location and mostly the people allowed Greenhouse Studios to grow. The original MCI console was replaced by an SSL G series which brought in even bigger projects. A smaller studio was built to handle overdubs and budget conscious artists. When the building next door became available it was incorporated into the operation, Studio 1 would become a stand-alone studio complete with large live and control rooms, separate machine room, bathroom, kitchen and lounge facilities. 2 Edit suites were added to handle the post production work the facility was doing. A penthouse studio and warehouse studio were also created in the 90s. The entire operation would close and move close to downtown Vancouver early in the new century. A large tracking room, an overdub studio and mix room were all created. Currently Greenhouse Studios operates the large tracking room with a Neve console.  Music artists  The careers of international stars k.d. lang, Queensrÿche and Sarah McLachlan were built on songs recorded at Greenhouse Studios. The facility has also recorded for many of Canada's top bands including 54-40, Default, Wide Mouth Mason, Matthew Good Band, Age of Electric, Odds, Spirit of the West, Barney Bentall, Colin James and Pluto. The band Nickelback would record three albums at Greenhouse: The State, Silver Side Up, and The Long Road. The State was recorded and produced by Dale Penner with Dave Ashton assisting. Silver Side Up was recorded by Rick Parashar. The Silver Side Up album would yield the #1 played radio song, \\"How You Remind Me\\" of the decade 2000-2009 according to Neilsen Soundscan. Nickelback would be named the music group of the decade by Billboard Magazine. The third Nickelback album, The Long Road, was produced by Chad Kroeger and Engineered by Joey Moi who would go on to co-produce and engineer all the Nickelback albums until the end of the decade. An unknown torch singer from Alberta started recording at Greenhouse in the late 1980s. k.d. lang would end up recording five different projects with Greenhouse including the Engenue album, the album that gave her international status and won a Grammy Award for engineering for Marc Raemer. It is the only album recorded in Western Canada to achieve this lofty distinction. k.d. lang would be inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame at the 2013 Juno Awards. k.d. lang would collaborate on the projects at Greenhouse Studios with Ben Mink, fiddle player and songwriter extraordinaire. The first client to walk through the doors of Greenhouse Studios was Steven Drake, singer and guitar player of the band the Odds.

Steven Drake would add producing and mixing to his musical skills, he would work on albums by 54-40, The Tragically Hip, Staggered Crossing and Tegan and Sara at the studio. Steven would also be the last client to record at the original facility, his final mix was completed in Studio B control room while the live room was being demolished. Greenhouse Studios has hosted numerous international clients. Roger Daltrey of The Who recorded vocal tracks at the studio. Salt-N-Pepa would record at Greenhouse. Cher would record tracks in Vancouver at the Studio. Akon worked on new tracks following his show at GM Place. Queensrÿche recorded and mixed the Empire album.

The next artist up would be Stigmata comprised on Kevin Lucks and Mark Findler. North Vancouver band Mushroom Trail would record its debut album before unceremoniously disappearing from the music business. The final project for London Smith was the sophomore release of Lowest of the Low produced by Texan Don Was. The first release of Lowest of the Low, Shakespeare My Butt... is considered one of the great Canadian albums. k-os would record and mix part of his 2012 release Black on Blonde. The Mounties would record their first track, \\"Headphones\\", in 2013.  Facility  The main consoles have been SSL G & E series; the studio operated four SSL rooms for a couple of years. Greenhouse Studios owned 7 different SSL consoles including an early B series as well as 3 E series and 3 G series. The studio moved from two-inch analog tape to Pro Tools recording in 2001. RADAR has also been used since the mid 1990s. In 2012, a Neve VR Legend 48 channel console was purchased. The Neve replaced the last SSL G series console which was sold to Charles Allin, Owner of Montana Recording Studio. The initial studio was designed by Westlake Audio. Subsequent studios were designed by the Levens brothers with input and tweaking from several music producer–engineers and studio designers. Studio B is the only music studio in Western Canada to record an album, k.d. lang's Ingenue, that won a Grammy Award for engineering.  People  Engineer Marc Raemer built his career which included a Grammy Award for engineering the k.d. lang album Ingenue. Jason Mauza continued his recording career in LA.

The disease is also found in other soybean production areas of the world. Host and symptoms The soybean is the main host of this pathogen. When the pathogen occurs on soybeans, it causes a small leaf lesions. These lesions, mostly found on upper leaf surfaces, are irregularly circular and consist of red-brown to purple colored borders. The inside of the lesion is often a gray to tan color. When the lesions mature they are paper thin and the leaves that are infected have an appearance of being tattered and weathered. The disease can lead to premature defoliation. The Frogeye leaf spot can also form on the pods and stems of highly susceptible cultivars. Oval and circular lesions that form on the pods and stems have dark-colored margins and light gray to reddish-brown color on the inside. If the pod becomes infected, the seeds can also become infected but may be symptomless. If they do show symptoms, gray blotches form on the seed and a cracked seed coat often occurs. The plant is most susceptible to an infection when the leaves are young and expanding or if the leaves are old and senescing. With this range of susceptibility, the disease can occur several times throughout the plant canopy if the environment is ideal for the pathogen at each leaf layer emergence. This leads to a layered section of disease on one plant. Within a field, the disease often occurs in patches either small or large throughout the field. During Stages R1-R6 in soybeans and after a period of frequent rainfall is the best time to scout for frogeye leaf spot. This disease is typically present mid to late season. Environment Frogeye leaf spot is often found after warm, humid weather conditions. Frequent rainfalls over an extended period of time can also promote the disease to form. The fungus is known to overwinter in infested seeds and crop residue. If a producer has a field with continuous production of soybeans, there is a higher chance of frogeye leaf spot typically present. Generally, lesions take more than one week to develop after the plant has been infected. This causes the disease to not be visible on the younger leaves of the plant until significantly later. Older leaves are not as susceptible to the disease. Management Without proper management there can be various consequences of this disease. Yield loss is a huge impact of this pathogen. If a large amount of lesions are present on the leaves of a soybean there is a loss of leaf area index which in turn results in less photosynthesis. With less photosynthesis, less carbohydrate will be made and the plant will produce less seed. There is also ethylene produced within the leaf spots that stimulates defoliation in the leaves. This will further reduce productivity of the plant. In order to stop yield loss it is important that various methods are used to manage this disease. These include resistance, seed quality, cultural practices and fungicide use. Resistant cultivars exist and can be planted if a producer knows this disease has been a consistent problem. Instead of saving seed, a producer should plant certified disease free seed to reduce the risk of bringing the pathogen into the field. Seed Quality is important and can prevent the survival stage of the disease cycle. Rotation with crops not susceptible to the disease, like corn and small grains, can be a form of cultural control of frogeye leaf spot. This will take away the host in the following season so the survival structure will not have a place to go. Using tillage to disturb the pathogen’s survival structures will also reduce the disease in the future. Fungicides can be applied to the foliar from the R1-R4 stage of soybeans (late flowering to pod-filling stages). This kind of application can reduce the incidence and severity of the disease. Yield and seed quality can also be improved. In the United States, Frogeye leaf spot has been reported to have resistance to Quinone outside inhibitors (strobilurins). Using multiple active ingredients for a fungicide application can help prevent resistance. Seed treatments are a preventative method that can reduce the threat frogeye leaf spot. None of these methods have been proven to be better than others but by using multiple of these management tools a grower will help reduce the amount of inoculum available in the field and assist in protecting the plants from infection.

The practice of slavery was ended through case law; and as an institution it died out in the late 18th century through judicial actions litigated on behalf of slaves seeking manumission. Following England's lead, Lawyer Benjamin Kent represented slaves in court against their masters as early as 1752. He won the first case to liberate a slave in the United States in 1766. Adams’ Minutes of the Argument: Essex Superior Court, Salem, November 1766Legal Papers of John Adams, volume 2Love of Freedom: Black Women in Colonial and Revolutionary New England By Catherine Adams, Elizabeth H. PleckThe Proceedings of the Cambridge Historical Society, Volume 40, 1964-1966 The post-revolutionary court cases, starting in 1781, heard arguments contending that slavery was a violation of Christian principles and also a violation of the constitution of the commonwealth. 1783 saw additional high-profile court cases that began a general trend of slaves winning their emancipation on a case-by-case basis through lawsuit. As slavery dwindled in the last decade of the 18th century in Massachusetts, many of the instances where it remained, the slaveholders sometimes applied semantics of a name change to indentured servitude to maintain their property. The 1790 federal census, however, listed no slaves. Massachusetts was a center for the abolition movement in the 19th century. Legislation was passed that abolished slavery with the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865 was ratified by the state. History  17th century  The exact date of the first African slaves in Massachusetts is unknown, but may have been as early as 1624 by a man named Samuel Maverick. The first confirmed account of slavery in the colony is in 1638, when several Native Americans captured during the Pequot War were exchanged in the West Indies for African slaves. Such exchanges become common in subsequent Massachusetts Indian wars. Most of the 17th century slave trade in New England was based in Massachusetts; however, direct attempts were not successful until the latter half of the century. In 1676, Boston ships began working with slave traders in Madagascar and by 1678 were selling slaves to Virginians. As to slaves imported to Massachusetts, the traders preferred to exchange new arrivals from Africa for more experienced slaves in the West Indies. Some Africans considered unsuitable for work in the West Indies were also brought to Massachusetts and sold. Boston ships were selling slaves to Connecticut by 1680 and Rhode Island by 1696. Law 1641-1703 In 1641, Massachusetts passed its Body of Liberties which gave legal sanction to certain kinds of slavery. > There shall never be any bond slaverie, villinage or captivitie amongst us > unless it be lawfull captives taken in just warres, and such strangers as > willingly selle themselves or are sold to us. And these shall have all the > liberties and Christian usages which the law of God established in Israel > concerning such persons doeth morally require. This exempts none from > servitude who shall be judged thereto by Authoritie. Wiecek notes that the reference to \\"strangers\\" is derived from Leviticus 25: 39–55 and explains that they could be ruled and sold as slaves.Nagl, Dominik (2013). 'The Governmentality of Slavery in Colonial Boston, 1690–1760' in American Studies, 58.1, pp. 5–26. For the Puritans and citizens of the colony, \\"strangers\\" would eventually mean Native Americans and Africans. Even though the Body of Liberties excluded many forms of slavery, it did recognize four legitimate bases of slavery. Slaves could legally be obtained if they were captives resulting from war, sold themselves into slavery, were purchased as slaves from elsewhere, or were sentenced to slavery through the governing authority. This made Massachusetts the first colony to authorize slavery through legislation. In 1670, Massachusetts made it legal for the children of slaves to be sold into bondage.http://www.massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=64 By 1680, the colony had laws restricting the movements of blacks. A 1703 law required owners to post a bond for all slaves to protect towns in the case that a slave became indigent should the master refuse to continue caring for him or her.  18th century  Benjamin Kent The slave population in Massachusetts was under 200 in 1676, 550 in 1708 and 2,000 by 1715. Slaves accounted for 2.2% of the total population from 1755 to 1764, their highest rate. There was a larger free black population, with about 10% of the population of Boston being black in 1752. By the mid-18th century, the enslavement of Africans had become a common practice in Massachusetts. A 1754 census listed nearly 4500 slaves in the colony. However, Abolitionist sentiment was growing, especially when the philosophical underpinnings of independence and democracy became commonly discussed in the colony. While Massachusetts did derive wealth from the Triangle Trade, its merchant and mixed economy was never as dependent on slave labor to the extent of the southern colonies. Within the British Empire, the Massachusetts courts began to follow England when, in 1772, England became the first country in the world to outlaw the slave trade within its borders (see Somerset v Stewart) followed by the Knight v. Wedderburn decision in Scotland in 1778.  Freedom suits  Between 1764 and 1774, seventeen slaves appeared in Massachusetts courts to sue their owners for freedom.p. 34 In 1766, John Adams' colleague Benjamin Kent won the first trial in the United States (and Massachusetts) to free a slave (Slew vs. Whipple).

PleckThe Proceedings of the Cambridge Historical Society, Volume 40, 1964-1966 There were three other trials that are noteworthy, two civil and one criminal. All three took place during the American Revolutionary War, when thoughts about the equality of all people were frequently voiced, and especially after the new Massachusetts constitution was passed in 1780. The civil cases were Jennison v. Caldwell (for \\"deprivation of the benefit of his servant, Walker\\"), apparently heard and decided first, and Quock Walker v. Jennison (for assault and battery), both heard by the Worcester County Court of Common Pleas on June 12, 1781. ;Jennison v. Caldwell A man named Jennison argued that one Caldwell had enticed away his employee Walker. The court found in his favor and awarded Jennison 25 pounds compensation. Chief Justice William Cushing ;Quock Walker v. Jennison This 1781 case involved a slave named Quock Walker in Worcester County Court of Common Pleas. Chief Justice William Cushing instructed the jury: > As to the doctrine of slavery and the right of Christians to hold Africans > in perpetual servitude, and sell and treat them as we do our horses and > cattle, that (it is true) has been heretofore countenanced by the Province > Laws formerly, but nowhere is it expressly enacted or established.

Emancipation in Massachusetts Slavery in the North. > Retrieved 2010-05-22 The Walker case had been opened by the attorney to consider whether a previous master's promise to free Walker gave him a right to freedom after that master had died. Walker's lawyers argued that the concept of slavery was contrary to the Bible and the new Massachusetts Constitution (1780). The jury decided that Walker was a free man under the constitution and awarded him 50 pounds in damages. Both decisions were appealed. Jennison's appeal of Walker's freedom was rejected in September 1781 by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, either because he failed to appear or because his lawyers did not submit the required court papers. The Caldwells won the other appeal; a jury concurred that Walker was a free man, and therefore the defendants were entitled to employ him. ;Commonwealth v. Jennison In September 1781, a third case was filed by the Attorney General against Jennison, Commonwealth v. Jennison, for criminal assault and battery of Walker. In his charge to the jury, Chief Justice William Cushing stated, \\"Without resorting to implication in constructing the constitution, slavery is ... as effectively abolished as it can be by the granting of rights and privileges wholly incompatible and repugnant to its existence.\\" This has been taken as setting the groundwork for the end of slavery in the state.Arthur Zilversmit, The First Emancipation: The Abolition of Slavery in the North (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967), 114 On April 20, 1783, Jennison was found guilty and fined 40 shillings. ;Aftermath of the trials While Chief Justice Cushing's opinion in effect should have ended slavery in Massachusetts, the state never formally abolished slavery until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865. Some possible reasons for this are that state legislators were either unable or unwilling to address slave-owners' concerns about losing their financial \\"investment\\", and non-slave owning white citizens' concerns that if slavery were abolished, the freed slaves could become a burden on the community. Some even feared that escaped slaves from other states would flood Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Supreme Court decisions in Walker v. Jennison and Commonwealth v. Jennison established the basis for ending slavery in Massachusetts on constitutional grounds, but no law or amendment to the state constitution was passed. Instead slavery gradually ended \\"voluntarily\\" in the state over the next decade. The decisions in the Elizabeth Freeman and Quock Walker trials had removed its legal support and slavery was said to end by erosion. Some masters manumitted their slaves formally and arranged to pay them wages for continued labor. Other slaves were \\"freed\\" but were restricted as indentured servants for extended periods. By 1790, the federal census recorded no slaves in the state.

Taylor, published in 2001. It is the fifth and final book of the Logan Family saga started with Song of the Trees (1975). It is a prequel to the whole series that recounts the life of Cassie Logan's grandfather Paul-Edward as he grows from a nine-year-old boy into a man in his mid-twenties. This book won the 2002 Coretta Scott King Author AwardCoretta Scott King Book Award Complete List of Recipients—by Year , American Library Association, retrieved January 19, 2008. and the 2002 Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction. Synopsis \\"The Land\\" follows the life of Paul-Edward Logan. Paul is the child of a white man and a black/Native American woman. Paul has three entries from Paul's journal, after the main story ends. The dialogue uses the Southern dialect from the 1870s and 1880s. Childhood The novel begins with Paul-Edward, as a nine-year-old. \\"The Land\\" describes how Paul's life has been different from that of most freed slaves. The book is narrated from Paul's perspective, and quickly introduces his three brothers, his sister, and Mitchell Thomas, a black boy whose father works for Paul's father and who becomes a vital member of the story-line. In the beginning, Mitchell continually bullies Paul for being multiracial. Paul's father and brothers' only advice for Paul is to \\"use his head,\\" and come up with a solution by himself. In \\"Childhood,\\" Paul's parents are constant reminders of the trials of being born biracial. After several months of incessant bullying, Paul strikes a deal with Mitchell. Their deal states that if Paul teaches Mitchell to \\"read English, write English, and figure,\\" then Mitchell will teach Paul how to fight and to fend for himself; but as he reminded Paul, Mitchell \\"can't teach him how to win.\\" Paul and Mitchell soon grow tired of obeying Edward Logan (Paul's Father). Paul comes across the opportunity to race another man's horse. Edward Logan forbids it, saying that it would be unwise of Paul to ride, let alone race, a horse with whom he is not acquainted. Paul wins the race but has trouble collecting his pay. The owner of the horse will not give Paul his pay. Due to Paul being of mixed heritage, the owner of the horse doesn't even have to give Paul his earned money. If Mitchell hadn't used violent force to ensure that the white man kept his word by paying Paul his money, Paul would have never seen any dime of \\"four times a rider's pay.\\" After this incident, the two flee aboard a train with the help of a white women. Manhood Paul and Mitchell are working in a lumber camp and wish to escape. The pair start their journey together, but they decide to separate to avoid drawing attention to themselves. While they are separated, Mitchell goes to more lumber camps, and Paul's eyes land upon J. T. Hollenbeck's land. Upon seeing this land, Paul knows that this is \\"The Land\\". His land. The book then goes on to describe life in different types of work camps. The story follows Paul as he works at a general store owned by Luke Sawyer, and as a woodworker in a small town called Vicksburg. Eventually, Paul and Mitchell meet a man by the name of Filmore Granger and make a deal to work for the possession of 40 acres. Although it is not The Land, clearing the forty will help Paul obtain the money needed for J.T. Hollenbeck's land. A deal was struck between Paul and Mr. Granger that stated, if Paul could clear the forty within about two years, Paul and Mitchell would own the forty. After a few months of working hard at the forty, Paul realizes that he needs the help of some hired hands. Mitchell suggests Tom Bee, with whom he had worked a lumber camp. A white boy Paul had met before, and a young black boy named Nathan Perry, who later becomes Paul's brother-in-law are also hired hands. For a while, a white boy by the name of Wade Jamison helps Paul clear the forty. Mitchell marries Caroline, who soon becomes pregnant, while Paul continues to work for his land. To disrupt this happiness, Digger Wallace fulfills his promise to get Mitchell back for embarrassing him. One day while Mitchell is working on Filmore Granger's land, the drunken Digger shoots Mitchell from behind. Mitchell was in the middle of felling a tree when shot. Being paralyzed with searing pain, Mitchell is crushed by the tree. When Paul gets back from The Land, he arrives on the scene; Mitchell is almost dead. Mitchell's last request of Paul is that he marry Caroline and take care of their unborn child. After Mitchell dies, Paul tries to hunt down Digger, but is unsuccessful. Later, Digger is found dead, face down in a river, with a bottle of moonshine floating next to him. Later that year, their work of clearing the forty is almost completed and should soon be in Paul's possession, even with all of the extra conditions that Granger adds to the deal in a last-ditch attempt to keep his land. When Granger claims that they cut trees outside of the perimeter, he declares that he wants Paul off of the land; unless he wishes to sharecrop. Cassie, Paul's sister, sends their brother Robert up to deliver an envelope with the money he needs to purchase J. T. Hollenbeck's land. His brother tells Paul of the family's condition and gives Paul the envelope. Enclosed is the money and two letters. Paul's sister explains in her letter that their mother owned the patch of land that they lived on as children, and that ten years after their mother's death, she sold the land to their father for $500, much more than it was worth. This combined with his sister's savings made more than enough money to pay for the land. After burying Mitchell's body, Paul asks Caroline to marry him, and confessing that she too, loves him, Caroline says yes. From this point in the story, Paul purchases the land, moves onto it, and lives the life he wants. Legacy In Legacy, Paul's father was sick when Paul takes his boys back to see his family. He saw Robert, Hammond, Cassie, and Cassie's husband Howard. Though Paul had visited Hammond in his store several times over the years, Paul had never heard from brothers Robert and George. No one had heard from George in years. The day after Paul arrived home, his father died. Paul then bought the other 200 acres of Hollenbeck land, from Wade Jamison.

Various Russian journalists, politicians and politologists put different meanings into this word, as described below. The words \\"nashists\\" and \\"nashism\\" have also been used in reference to Nashi (youth movement), a Russian political movement with the word \\"Ours\\" in its title. Nashism is not Russian nationalism, although the two overlap substantially in that the Siloviki (Chekists) encourage Russian nationalism/chauvinism as a power base and Russian nationalists take pride in Siloviki power. But the core of Nashism is more like organized crime than nationalism in the respect that compatriots can be excluded, and foreigners included, based on their loyalty to, or alignment with, the organization. Nevzorov's \\"Nashi\\" The word was first coined by Alexander Nevzorov, the anchor of the Russian TV program 600 Seconds.Mikhail Geller, \\"Rossiiskie zametki, 1991-1996\\", Moscow, 1998, In January 1991 Nevzorov produced a documentary and a controversial series of TV reports from Vilnius titled Ours (Nashi), about the actions of the Soviet spetsnaz during the January Events, when the Soviet military forces attempted to crush the declared independence of the Lithuania, in which Nevzorov was markedly sympathetic to Soviet actions.ISCIP - Perspective As a freelance journalist Jules Evans wrote, reporting from the Soviet Union: > \\"the journalist Aleksander Nevzorov appeared on TV, standing in front of the > demonstrators in Lithuania holding a Kalashnikov. To the music of Richard > Wagner (a German), Nevzorov declared the birth of a new Idea – ‘Nashi’. > “Nashi is a circle of people – let it be enormous, colossal, multimillions – > to whom one is related by common language, blood, and motherland.”\\"the Hunt > for a National Idea\\" In November 1991 Nevzorov established the People's Liberation Movement \\"Nashi\\", which he defined as \\"a united front of resistance to the anti- national politics of the current administration of Russia and other Union Republics of the former USSR\\". Its badge contained the contour of the USSR with the words \\"НАШИ\\" (ours) within.http://www.rau.su/observer/N21_93/21_06.HTM Of prominent participants in the movement was Viktor Alksnis. Nevzorov's \\"Nashi\\" was short-lived. The naturally coined word \\"Nashists\\" in reference to the supporters of the \\"Nashi\\" movement immediately invoked the rhyme with the word \\"fascists\\", as a hint to the imperial position of the movement in support of the indivisibility of the Soviet Union, in particular, their justification of the use of military force to this end. Youth Movement \\"Nashi\\" \\"Nasha Army\\" youth military troops in Smolensk, near Belarus. The pun \\"nashism/fascism\\" is often used by the political opponents of \\"Nashi\\". In particular, it was liberally used after the anti-Estonian manifestations of \\"Nashi\\" in relation to the events around the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn. A popular anti-Nashi slogan is \\"Nashism Shall Not Pass!\\" (\\"Нашизм не пройдет!\\"\\"Пикет у штаба молодежного движения 'Идущие вместе'\\", Radio Freedom, April 21, 2005 ), an adaptation of the slogan \\"They shall not pass\\". Corporatism Andrei Illarionov describes the emerging corporatism in Russia as power in hands of Silovik power structures, the current incarnation of Chekism, whose ideology he defines by the word \\"nashism\\" (\\"ours-ism\\") in its most general sense: preferential treatment of \\"ours\\". In an article initially printed in Kommersant and then reprinted several times in the West, he writes:Andrei Illarionov, \\"When the state means business\\", International Herald Tribune, January 25, 2006 > \\"Ours-ism\\" does not know national or ethnic boundaries. The former > chancellor of a foreign country [(Gerhard Schröder)] is made a member of the > corporation and becomes \\"our man in Europe.\\" Meanwhile, a Russian > businessman [(Mikhail Khodorkovsky)] who created a company that brought > billions into the national treasury turns out to be an \\"other\\" and is exiled > to the depths of Siberia.

It was released in 1974 by Philips Records.  Themes  The album showcases Ben's interest in theosophy, mysticism, and, above all, alchemy. Its title refers to the Emerald Tablet, a cryptic piece of Hermetica reputed to contain the secret of the prima materia and its transmutation; and its artwork incorporates drawings from Nicholas Flamel, who was historically immortalized as a great alchemist for his work on the philosopher's stone. Mysticism and alchemy are not the only thematic territories into which Ben ventures however. In the style of Fôrça Bruta and África Brasil, Ben continues to explore his Afro-Brazilian identity with songs such as “Zumbi” and “Menina mulher de pele preta”. More simple, anodyne love songs make an appearance here as well with tracks such as “Eu vou torcer” and “Minha teimosia, uma arma pra te conquistar”. Other lyrics reflect Ben's signature fascination with the esoteric; “O homem da gravata florida” describes the details of a man's strikingly beautiful tie, while “O namorado da viúva” is about the lover of a widow. Although tracks such as these stand out as notably singular in their subject matter, “O homem...” is in fact about Paracelsus, while “O namorado…” is yet another reference to Nicholas Flamel.  Critical reception  The record was ranked by Rolling Stone Brazil as the sixth greatest Brazilian album of all time, and has been included in Tom Moon's 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die. Mike Wojciechowski from Tiny Mix Tapes considered it Ben's masterpiece.Wojciechowski, Mike. \\"1974: Jorge Ben Jor - A Tábua de Esmeralda\\", Tiny Mixtapes, Nov. 31, 2011.

He was a friend and ally of Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall. Gilbert acceded to the title of Earl of Pembroke and Lord Marshal on 11 June 1234, on the death of his elder brother Richard who had died childless. Gilbert was married on 1 August 1235 in Berwick-upon-Tweed to Marjorie (120017 November 1244), daughter of King William of Scotland. Their marriage was childless. By an unknown mistress he had one illegitimate daughter, Isabel, who was betrothed to Rhys ap Maelgwn Fychan. In the late 1230s, Maelgwn Fychan (son of Maelgwn ap Rhys) agreed a treaty with Gilbert, whereby Maelgwn Fychan's son, Rhys, would marry Isabel, and receive the cantref of Is-Aeron, except the commote of Is-Hirwen (which contained Cardigan Castle);Law and Government in Medieval England and Normandy: Essays in Honour of Sir James Holt, ed. George Garnett & John Hudson, Cambridge University Press 1994, p. 316 in return Maelgwn Fychan and Rhys would become vassals of Gilbert (so far as it didn't compromise fealty to the king). Gilbert captured Castell Meredydd from Morgan ap Hywel in 1236 during a truce between Llywelyn the Great and King Henry III of England. After Marshal took the castle he seems to have fortified it with a bailey and curtain wall. He was forced to return it to Morgan by the terms of the truce, or \\"for fear of the lord Llywelyn\\". He was accidentally killed on 27 June 1241 while in a tournament at Ware, which King Henry III had expressly forbidden, as he did not want any of his subjects killing one another in sport. Gilbert was thrown from his horse and his foot was caught in the stirrup, thus he was dragged for some distance on the ground and died from the injuries received. He was buried at Temple Church next to his father. His title was passed to his younger brother Walter a year after his death. Walter was not immediately confirmed as Earl of Pembroke and Lord Marshal due to the King's anger at Walter's disobedience of royal orders, as he had also attended the tournament.

was an American cartoonist, best known as the creator and artist of Mister Oswald, a monthly comic strip that ran for more than six decades in the national trade journal now called Hardware Retailing. The strip documents a large portion of the history of American business life, as seen through the eyes of the main character, Oscar S. Oswald, a prominent citizen of the fictional Dippy Center, USA. Although the strip was known primarily to hardware retailers, a book, Forty Years With Mister Oswald, was published in 1968, collecting the comic strips. Biography Johnson was born on a farm outside Gibson City, Illinois. He graduated from Dixon College and Norman School in 1915, whereupon he left small-town life for the big city and a job at Montgomery Ward's in Chicago. As someone who grew up land-locked on a farm in Illinois, Johnson yearned to be out on the high seas, like his favorite comic strip characters, the Katzenjammer Kids, so during World War I he joined the US Navy. Johnson, however, was an excellent marksman from his years of hunting, and was removed from a ship after two weeks, and was made a shooting instructor. He spent the rest of his tour in the Navy on land. While in the Navy, Johnson also began drawing cartoons for Afloat and Ashore, a Naval paper published in Charleston. After the War, he took night classes at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, studying under Billy DeBeck, the creator of Barney Google, and Carl Ed, the creator of Harold Teen. In 1921, Johnson returned to Gibson City to work in his father's hardware store. In addition to his regular work in the store, Johnson drew advertising cartoons for the store's window displays, which appeared every Tuesday. Johnson's aunt saw his cartoons and was able to get him some cartoon work in the local papers. Soon thereafter, Johnson was asked by the editor of Hardware Retailing to draw some cartoons for their magazine. He started contributing work to Hardware Retailing in 1925. Two years later, in October 1927, Mister Oswald was born, appearing in a twelve-panel, Sunday page-format strip, titled \\"It's a Sad Store, Mates.\\" By the early 1930s, Johnson also took assignments from the Armstrong Cork Company, doing strips like Bunker Bunk and the Boys (about wholesalers) and Sellem and Son (about retail salesmen). He additionally made Adam and Steve for The Sporting Goods Dealer, and a full-page monthly strip for the Remington Arms Company. Mister Oswald is a veritable time capsule of one segment of U.S. social history. For those folks who love those old mom-and-pop establishments and mourn their seemingly daily disappearance, Johnson's comic strip preserves a history of what once was. Mister Oswald shows how one sector of retailing, the hardware business, changed over the years. And Johnson knew his stuff, as he ran both a hardware store and a shoe store, all while drawing his cartoons. His ideas were derived from his daily life. Eventually, Johnson dropped his other strips to work exclusively on Mister Oswald. Even after his retirement from retailing in 1963, he continued his strip for many years, finally handing it over to Larry Day in 1989, at the age of 95. Russ Johnson had worked on his strip continuously for 62 years. Even in retirement, Johnson continue to work, trying to peddle a mainstream comic strip about retirees. The strip remained unpublished. He died on September 7, 1995 at the age of 101. Apparently, Johnson was a fan of Life magazine. In April 2016, Bill Purcell of St. John, Indiana purchased an original Life magazine at a local auction sale. The cover features a GI in steel helmet and is the edition from November 8, 1943. The rear is original post stamped to: \\"Russell Johnson Gibson City, Illinois.\\" On the margin of page 41 was discovered two original Johnson character heads pencil drawn.

Life and Church Pietro Boetto was born in Vigone to Antonio and Caterina (née Anghilano) Boetto. One of two brothers and three sisters, he was confirmed by Bishop Filippo Chiesa of Pinerolo in 1883. Boetto attended the diocesan seminary of Giaveno from 1884 to 1888, when he entered the Society of Jesus on February 1. While studying at the novitiate in Chieri, he took his first vows on September 8, 1890. In 1901, he was ordained to the subdiaconate (July 28), diaconate (July 29), and finally priesthood (by Bishop Emiliano Manacorda on July 30). After finishing his studies in theology in 1902, Boetto then served as a professor and the rector of the Genoese \\"Istituto Arecco\\" until 1904. He took his final vows as a Jesuit on February 2, 1906, whilst serving as rector of St. Thomas College in Cuneo (1905–1907). From 1907 to 1916, he was procurator of the Jesuit residence in Turin. Boetto was provincial of the Jesuit Province of Turin before going to Spain to serve as visitor to the Jesuit Provinces of Aragón (1919–1920) and later of Castilla (1920–1921). He also served as Procurator General of the Society of Jesus (1921–1928), provincial of the Roman Province (1928–1930), and Assistant to Italy (1930–1935). Pope Pius XI created Boetto Cardinal Deacon of Sant'Angelo in Pescheria in the consistory of December 16, 1935. On March 17, 1938, he was appointed Archbishop of Genoa. Boetto opted to become a Cardinal Priest (with the same titular church), a day after his appointment to Genoa, on March 18. He received his episcopal consecration on the following April 24, 1938 from Cardinal Gennaro Pignatelli di Belmonte, with Archbishops Giuseppe Migone and Giovanni Vallega serving as co-consecrators, in the church of Sant'Ignazio. Boetto was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1939 papal conclave, which selected Pope Pius XII. During World War II, he was a staunch defender of Genoa and its citizens. He protested against the shelling of the city by British warships, claiming God would assure the triumph of Italy.TIME Magazine. Churchmen & The War February 24, 1941 On December 8, 1945, Genoa awarded its Cardinal with citizenship after he urged all Axis forces near the city into surrender.TIME Magazine. Milestones February 11, 1946 Boetto died from a heart attack at 1:30 a.m. in his archiepiscopal residence, at age 74. His Requiem Mass was celebrated five days later, on February 4, 1946, by Bishop Pasquale Righetti at San Lorenzo Cathedral; Bishop Giuseppe Siri, the auxiliary of Genoa, delivered the funeral oration. Boetto was finally buried in the crypt near the main altar of that same cathedral of Genoa.

Jesse Billingsley's company on February 28, 1836. Vandeveer, a private, was badly wounded in the battle of San Jacinto and was discharged at Mina on June 1, 1836.Texas Treasures - Texan killed and wounded at San Jacinto - Page 1 - Texas State Library His name is inscribed at the San Jacinto Monument.  Ranger, Husband, and Entrepreneur  Logan Vandeveer married Lucinda Mays of Alabama in 1838 or 1839. After his discharge from the army, Vandeveer entered the Texas Rangers and fought Indians throughout the Bastrop area. Receiving tracts of land in what is now Burnet County for his service in the Texas Revolution, he also purchased additional land in the area. In 1849 he secured a contract from the United States government to supply meat and foodstuffs to Fort Croghan and later Fort Mason, fifty miles farther west. The Vandeveers had seven children and are found on the 1850 Census for Travis County with their four surviving daughters. Lucinda died soon after this.  Civic Accomplishments  Mercantile building built by Logan Vandeveer. Still in use as Masonic Lodge. One room school house now located at Ft. Croghan. Logan Vandeveer built this home for his father, William. It was originally located East of Hamilton Creek. Vandeveer was a leader in presenting the petition to the legislature in 1852 to establish Burnet County and was instrumental in having the town of Burnet named the county seat. He was appointed postmaster at Burnet Texas by Samuel D. Hubbard, US Postmaster General, August, 1852.Vandeveer Papers: Vertical Files Herman Brown Free Library of Burnet County In 1853 he opened the first Burnet school, known as the Collegiate School, hiring as teacher William H. Dixon, an Oxford University graduate. A number of subjects, including French, Latin, geography, history, philosophy, mathematics, and elocution were taught in the one room school pictured at right. In 1854 Vandeveer and an associate built the first substantial building in the town; a two story stone building for use as a mercantile building and Masonic Lodge meeting place. It is still in use today for that purpose. A rock house was also built for his family and his father, William, and was located East of Hamilton Creek. His daughter later lived there and the home was continuously occupied for many years. It has since been restored and moved to the grounds of Fort Croghan.  Death  In the summer of 1855, following a severe drought, Vandeveer, his brother Zachary, and three other men took a large herd of cattle to Louisiana. Vandeveer developed yellow fever and died on September 2, 1855, in Plaquemines Parish, where he is buried. His brother Zachary also died of Yellow Fever two days later.Letter to William Vandeveer 1855 His death left a void in the civic leadership of his home state. He had maintained friendly relations with the Comanche Indians in Central Texas. Many depredations occurred afterwards that continued until their final extermination. A section of Burnet known as the Vandeveer addition and a street bear his name. References 1\\\\. Texas Handbook Online http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fva18 2\\\\.

Immaculata Academy was built adjacent to Mercy Hospital facing the shores of Biscayne Bay. A few days later on August 13, 1958, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Miami was created, including 16 southeastern Florida counties, 51 parishes, 81 priests and 185,000 Catholics. The rest of the counties remained part of the Diocese of St. Augustine. On August 15, Sisters Mary Monica, St. George, and Mary Martha, SSJ arrived at Mercy Hospital, where they shared five rooms within the hospital convent. Between August 26 and 28, the first 138 Immaculata Academy students registered for 10th through 12th grades at Mercy Hospital. On August 31, Rev. Thomas Anglim – Immaculata Academy president – conducted the first faculty meeting. Four lay teachers completed the faculty: Mrs. Hortensia San Juan, Mrs. Frank Boscia, Mrs. Frank Kirby, and Mrs. Wilma Pool Knight, who had been at Bishop Kenny High School in Jacksonville, Florida. Mrs. Knight continued to teach Biology and Physical Education at the school for 17 years. Mrs. Knight had also taught Home Economics and Physical Education at Sts. Peter and Paul School in Miami. The school uniform chosen by the faculty was a skirt and blouse of a beige drip- dry material, saddle oxfords, along with a dark brown cardigan for winter months. On September 1, Immaculata Academy was co-founded by Archbishop Joseph P. Hurley of the Diocese of St. Augustine and Rev. Mother Anna Maria, SSJ. The school name \\"Immaculata\\" was chosen to honor the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title of her Immaculate Conception. The school opened in the middle of the modern American civil rights movement and during the emerging of the modern feminist movement. Ivan Meštrović’s Pieta notable sculpture arrived in Miami the same day and was unceremoniously installed facing Biscayne Bay in front of the Immaculata classroom building. When the Diocese of Miami was carved out of the Diocese of St. Augustine, the monument to modern martyrs of Communism, as envisioned and planned by Archbishop Hurley, was never completed. On September 2, 1958, Immaculata Academy opened its doors for the first time with 153 students. Only three classrooms were ready. While the rest of the school was still under construction, classes were held on half-day session. Because the cafetorium was not completed, students had to use a large classroom on the first floor for cold lunches. (School buildings were to be finished by Christmas; the painters were on strike.) On September 15, full-day classes began. On November 28, the school held its first dance – the Sophomore Harvest Hop, in the newly completed cafetorium, and in December the first Christmas Formal dance took place there. On December 5, Mrs. Mable Franzen and Mrs. J. H. Brummitt became the first cafeteria staff hired. On December 17, the first Christmas pageant was presented. On January 28, 1959, Rev. Thomas L. McDermott became the second Immaculata Academy president. On March 14, Immaculata religious community moved into their school convent. On May 1, the first student members were inducted into the Immaculata Chapter of the National Honor Society. On June 4, Immaculata's first graduation class of 26 students received diplomas at the Church of the Little Flower (St. Theresa) in Coral Gables, Florida. On August 15, Sister Marie de Lourdes Ortagus, SSJ was appointed Immaculata convent superior, replacing Sister Mary Damian, SSJ. In September 1960, Charles Belanger was appointed the school's first choir director. Freshman class officers elected that year were: Annette Flink – president, Rita Boerger – vice president, Kathy Netter – secretary, and Barbara Lyden – treasurer. On September 8, Immaculata Academy opened for its second school year with 285 pupils, including St. Theresa school's ninth graders. 1959 was the first year ninth grade students attended the school. Student officers were: Claire Duffy - student body president, Arlene D'Angelo -Senior class president, Christina Montana - Senior class vice president, Ruth Doyle - Senior class secretary, and Veronica Langley - Senior class treasurer. Judith McClesky, member of the Class of 1959, composed the words for the Immaculata Alma Mater. On June 3, 1960, Immaculata Academy graduated 49 seniors from Sts. Peter and Paul Church in Miami. Sources: Journal of Sister Mary Alberta Stark, SSJ and 1961 Immaculata Academy Signum Yearbook On September 6, 1960, Immaculata Academy's third school year opened with 440 pupils and ninth grade female students from feeder parishes Gesu Church - Miami, Church of the Little Flower (St. Theresa) - Coral Gables, Sts. Peter and Paul Church - Miami, St. Michael the Archangel Church - Miami, Church of the Epiphany - South Miami, St. Brendan's Church - Miami, Holy Rosary Church - Perrine, and St. Hugh's Church - Coconut Grove (Miami). Rev. Robert Reardon was appointed supervising principal. On September 11, 1960, Hurricane Donna hit the school and convent with up to -an-hour winds and 11 to waves from Biscayne Bay. When the school was closed for cleanup, blue crabs were found on the second floor of the classroom building, where school books stored in open hallway lockers were damaged and then replaced. Source: Nancy Foye-Cox, ILS 1964 Classmate's oral history On September 28, 1960 Sister Mary Bernadette, SSJ held the first meeting of the Immaculata Drama Club. On November 14, 1960, the Immaculata Academy student body marched en masse to Rickenbacker Causeway to greet U.S. President-elect John F. Kennedy, who was en route to a historical meeting with Vice President Richard Nixon on Key Biscayne. A Christmas pageant was presented by the school in December. The Christmas Formal dance was sponsored by the Immaculata Parent's Auxiliary. During the winter of 1960–1961, the first student Red Cross chapter was formed. Source: Journal of Sister Mary Alberta Stark, SSJ and 1961 Immaculata Academy Signum Yearbook On December 26, 1960, when a dozen Cuban refugee children traveled from Havana, Cuba Airport to Miami International Airport, marked the beginning of \\"Operation Pedro Pan.\\" Rev. Bryan O. Walsh –director of the Diocese of Miami Catholic Services– helped 14,048 children find temporary homes throughout the U.S. in makeshift camps, orphanages, foster homes and delinquent facilities. Many were never reunited with their families. Ultimately 7,000 children relocated without their parents to Dade County, Florida over a 22-month period. On December 30, 1960 ILS classmate Hilda Inclán arrived from Cuba with her two sisters and a friend. On February 14, 1961, the ILS Junior class sponsored \\"The Heart of Fashion\\" show.

Christian Brothers (Brothers of the Christian Schools)  On April 30, 1651, Jean- Baptiste de La Salle (1651–1719) was born to a family of wealth in Reims, France. At age 27, La Salle was ordained a priest after renouncing his family's fortune. He received his doctorate in theology a few years later. LaSalle founded the order in 1680 with the mission of teaching poor boys. Found literally in every part of the world, La Salle founded a teaching order known as the Brothers of the Christian Schools to instruct teachers and create schools for delinquent children. He also founded vocational schools and secondary schools and implemented the use of modern languages, arts and sciences. La Salle dedicated his life to building and developing quality schools throughout France. After his death in 1719, he was canonized a saint of the Roman Catholic Church by Pope Leo XIII. To avoid persecution in France, 70 La Salle Christian Brothers were sent to Canada. On September 10, 1905, 11 Brothers arrived in Cuba and were well received by the Cuba's president and the Bishop of Havana. Immediately they opened two new schools in Havana. Within 56 years, they had opened 23 schools and one university in Cuba. Their schools were available to all children regardless of income, status or race. In 1959, the Communist regime forced students to join the militia. On May 1, 1961, Cuban prime minister Fidel Castro decreed the nationalization of all 350 private schools. Churches were also closed, and all priests and religious, as well as the Christian Brothers, were expelled from Cuba. During the first two years of the Cuban revolution, many Catholic students were sent to prison and were soon joined by many priests and Brothers. They were tortured on a daily basis at the infamous La Cabana prison. They agonized and prayed nightly as they heard students yell \\"Viva Cristo Rey\\" before being shot by a firing squad at the Paredon. On May 25, 1961, 109 Brothers of the Christian Schools - Christian Brothers, arrived at Miami International Airport on a Pan American World Airways flight, which was chartered by the Scoppeta-Arca family. They came to the United States, because Cuban prime minister Fidel Castro closed all Catholic churches, convents, and schools, and expelled all priests and religious orders. Thousands of their former students, who had fled Cuba earlier, were there to greet them. A few days later, six former students (Eduardo R. Arellano de Cardenas, Jose M. Arellano de Cardenas, Bienvenido \\"Benny\\" Benach Costales, Oscar Bustill Guas, Nestor Machado Lopez-Munoz, and Eduardo Sanchez Rionda) visited the Brothers at the Everglades Hotel in downtown Miami and resolved to assist them in establishing another LaSalle school in Miami. These student co-founders of LaSalle High School asked the community for help raising funds and gathering clothing for the Brothers. They met with Bishop Coleman Carroll and Rev. Bryan Walsh, who both agreed to fund a school for the Christian Brothers. The decision was prompt and swift; the school was built in less than six months on the same site as Immaculata Academy. The bishop arranged for the schools to share certain school facilities. Meanwhile, other Christian Brother schools in New York and Pennsylvania sent Brothers to set the curriculum and work with the Cuban Christian Brothers.Jose Arellano - ILS 1962 Classmate, oral history.  LaSalle High School  LaSalle High School is named for St. Jean Baptiste de La Salle - founder of the Brothers of the Christian Schools (the Christian Brothers) and universal patron of teachers. The Christian Brothers is the largest group of men in the Roman Catholic Church devoted exclusively to teaching. In the United States, they mainly teach and administer elementary schools and high schools. On June 3, 1961, 72 Immaculata Academy seniors received diplomas from Bishop Carroll at Church of the Little Flower (St. Theresa) in Coral Gables. On September 5, 1961, Immaculata Academy opened with 490 students and 20 faculty members (10 religious and 10 lay teachers). For the first time, the Immaculata student body had 6 African-American students. 1964 Classmate Antonia \\"Toni\\" Williams was the first African-American student to enroll at Immaculata Academy. This was nearly 10 years before Federal Judge E. Clyde Atkins ordered all Dade County schools to be racially integrated by September on January 22, 1970. Also, Cuban refugee girls soon become Immaculata classmates and were paired with Immaculata students to learn English. Basic Spanish was taught to all students over the school intercom. Source: 1964 ILS Classmate Toni Williams-Gary's oral history Once again, the Sisters of St. Joseph welcomed diverse students to the school as had always been their tradition in America. Although the U.S. Supreme Court 1954 decision in Brown vs. Board of Education made segregated schools illegal, in 1964 only 2% of public schools nationwide were racially integrated. On September 11, 1961, LaSalle High School was officially founded by Bishop Coleman F. Carroll under the direction of the District of Cuba of the Brothers of the Christian Schools (the Christian Brothers). LaSalle opened its doors for the first time in late September with 260 students (grades 7 through 12) with a faculty of 13 Christian Brothers. The majority of students were Cuban refugees. Two American brothers assisted the faculty, and Brother Benjamin Roque, FSC became LaSalle's first principal. Miami parishes served by Immaculata and LaSalle were: Gesu, St. Michael the Archangel, Sts. Peter and Paul, and St. Dominic - Miami; Church of the Little Flower (St. Theresa) - Coral Gables; St. Hugh - Coconut Grove (Miami); Church of the Epiphany and St. Thomas the Apostle - South Miami; Our Lady of the “Holy Rosary” – Perrine; Sacred Heart - Homestead; St. Brendan and St. Timothy - West Miami; and St. Agnes – Key Biscayne. On December 2, 1961, Cuban prime minister Fidel Castro announced he was a Communist. On December 17, the Immaculata Glee Club presented a Christmas concert – “The Gift,” based on Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Ballet, under the direction of Sister Mary Josepha Butterfield, SSJ. In the Spring of 1962, Immaculata and LaSalle presented their first joint student production, the senior class play - “The Sound of Music.” In April, the Immaculata Chorus under the direction of Sister Butterfield, SSJ, presented a Spring Concert - “So Proudly We Sing.” The concert was recorded on a 33 LP record album and sold as a fundraiser. On May 31, 1962 for the first time, 85 Immaculata and 30 LaSalle seniors graduated together at Church of the Little Flower (St. Theresa) in Coral Gables. These seniors were LaSalle's first graduates in America.

Immaculata-LaSalle High School  In September 1962, LaSalle High School was placed under the Christian Brothers of the Baltimore District, and Brother Patrick Ellis, FSC became the school's second principal. Along with Immaculata Academy, LaSalle formed a co- institutional school, which shared facilities but not faculties – Immaculata- LaSalle High School. Rev. Claude E. Brubaker was ILS' first supervising principal. On September 4 when Immaculata opened with 570 students and 25 teachers, there were three portable buildings that provided six extra classrooms. On September 29, 1962, the LaSalle Royals football team played their first game at 3:45 PM at Central Stadium (now a part of Florida International University) against Florida Air Academy of Melbourne, Florida. The Air Academy won that game 6-0. Members of the first LaSalle Royal's football team were: Nick Aguirre, Gaston Arellano, Norman Asmar, Tio Babun, Clement Bezold, Leonard Caraballo, Steve Carruthers, Wilfredo Casanova, ?, Armando Chapelli, Richard Cialona, Juan Cosio, Ramon Diaz, Emilio Dieguez, Peter Dunn, Robert Espin, Jose Gonzalez, Silvano Gonzalez, Nelson Hernandez, Robert Koziol, John LaPlant, Joaquin Leon, Bill Maro, Jack Maro, Luis Martinez, Gerard Maucci, Harley Miller, Gregory Morris, Frank Murray, Robert Nunez, Rafael Parracia, Manuel Pereira, Timothy Quinn, Blas Rodriguez, George Rodriguez, Felipe Sanchez, Ernesto Vidal, and George Wehby. Van Parsons and Daniel Coughlin were the first football coaches. Members of the first LaSalle cheerleaders squad were: Kathleen Brick, Ellen Byrnes, Karen Due, Silvia Fernandez, Anna George, Karen Kawas, M. Kathryn “Kitty” Kleyla (Captain), Marie McCall, Mary Rice, Lynn Richardson, Ruth Rohan, Teresa Russell, Rachel Schneider, and Julia Sheeran. Rosanne Rohan was a junior cheerleader. On April 21, 1963, the Immaculata Glee Club, under Sister Butterfield's direction, presented its annual Spring concert, “From Bach to Bernstein.” On May 27, LaSalle Men's Athletic Association sponsored the First Annual Athletic Awards Night in the school cafetorium. On June 2, 126 Immaculata and 58 LaSalle seniors graduated from Church of the Little Flower (St. Theresa) in Coral Gables, Florida. On September 3, 1963, ILS enrollment was 615. On September 13, 1963, student officers were elected for LaSalle student council: Bob Koziol – president, Roberto Espin – vice president, Luis Alvarez – recording secretary, Emilio Dieguez – corresponding secretary, and Francisco Miro – treasurer. Immaculata student council officers elected: Julia Sheeran – president; and other officers: Nellita Moore, Sandra Page, and Patrice Hurd. Immaculata senior class officers elected: Kathleen “Kathy” Netter – president, Anna George - vice president, Paula Bell – secretary, and Antonia “Toni” Williams – treasurer. LaSalle senior class officers: Gregory Lucas, Rene Diaz, Jorge “George” Pino, and Ramon “Kiki” Diaz. On February 4, 1964, Bishop Caroll dedicated the new Immaculata-LaSalle Science Building. On February 7 and 8, the 1964 Senior Class play - “The Peace Corps” was performed in the cafetorium. The student cast was Luly Alcebo, Carlos Arauz, Fernando Aimandi, Clement Bezold, Kathy Brick, Ed Brownrigg, Carlos Davila, Karen Due, Ronnie Fayad, Silvia Fernandez, Arlene Frank, Karen Kawas, Connie Love, Barbara Lyden, Margarita Mancheno, Vicky Matthews, Louis McNamara, Nellita Moore, Vicky Pando, Priscilla Schepis, James Skelton, Felicia Smith (also student director), Kathleen Sprowl, and Patricia Wolf. Faculty directors were Sister Mary Maurice, SSJ and Brother Gordian Ronan, FSC. On April 24, 1964, the ILS Junior/Senior Prom was held at the DuPont Plaza Hotel in downtown Miami -the first prom to be held off campus. On April 26, ILS Spring Band and Choral Concert was held. On May 31, Immaculata and LaSalle seniors attended a Baccalaureate Mass at St. Hugh's Church in Coconut Grove. On June 1, 117 Immaculata seniors graduated with LaSalle and Christopher Columbus High Schools at Miami Beach Auditorium. It is the last time Immaculata and LaSalle seniors will wear separate class rings. These graduating seniors, most of whom were born in 1946, are the first of the post-war “Baby Boomer” generation to graduate from high school.

In May 1966, ILS Student Council president Marianne Carpentieri and Senior Class president Natalie Folta succeeded in having a traffic light installed on Bayshore Drive - a dangerous traffic intersection at the entrance to the school. This project was the 1966 Class gift to ILS. After attending many City of Miami Commission meetings, the traffic light was finally installed one week after their graduation. Source: Maria Restrepo Forte, ILS 1966 Classmate's oral history. On May 29, 1966, 124 Immaculata seniors and 63 LaSalle seniors attended a Baccalaureate Mass at Sts. Peter and Paul Church in Miami, and graduated with Christopher Columbus’ Seniors at Dade County Auditorium. The address to the graduates was given by Rt. Rev. Theodore E. McCrick - president of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, and Bishop Coleman F. Carroll of Miami presented the Special Awards. On May 24, 1972, the Pieta sculpture was removed from the Immaculata Academy seawall on Biscayne Bay to Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Cemetery to make room for the Shrine of Cuban patron Our Lady of Charity. The official reason given for moving the sculpture was “because salt air produced some green ‘cancers’ on the bronze sculpture.\\" Source: \\"Four-ton bronze pieta finds new home\\" by Marilin A. Moore, MIAMI NEWS, March 8, 1983 In June, Sister Marie Therese Everard, SSJ departed ILS. Sister Everard was the last Sisters of St. Joseph religious to serve in the Immaculata-LaSalle administration as dean of Student Affairs. In January 1974, the Christian Brothers left Immaculata-LaSalle High School. In June 1981, Sister Elizabeth Worley, SSJ was the last Sisters of St. Joseph religious to leave Immaculata-LaSalle High School when the Teresian Association took over school administration. The last school yearbook to display the name Immaculata-LaSalle was the 1981–1982 Signum yearbook.  Teresian Association  The Teresian Association is an international Catholic lay association of men and women whose objective is the human promotion of individuals and the transformation of unjust structures by means of an education and culture imparted from the platform of Christianity. Its members strive to live in the world “after the style of the first Christians” as its founder St. Pedro Poveda desired. In 1911, St. Pedro Poveda opened a Pedagogical Academy in Gijón (Asturias) for all teachers and, concerned as he is with the promotion of women, whose importance and incidence in society he perceives, he also opens a Women's Academy for those ladies studying to become teachers. These constitute the beginning of what later on will become the Teresian Association. In 1924, Pope Pius XI approves the Teresian Association as an international Pious Union of The Faithful. Its aim is to invite men and women to work for a social and human transformation, in accordance with Gospel values, from the platform of their own professions, especially those related to the fields of education and culture. Teresian Association members are involved in education and research, social work, family ministry, pastoral work, social programmes, and civil service. The Association is engaged in different educational, socio-cultural and humanitarian endeavours and is present in 30 countries, with thousands of members and collaborators. During the 1982–1983 school year, the Teresian Association dropped “Immaculata” from the school's name. The Class of 1983–1984 were the last class to wear an Immaculata-LaSalle High School class ring. On March 7, 1983, the Pieta sculpture was moved from Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Cemetery to the Archdiocese of Miami Pastoral Center's Garden of Memories, where it remains. In June 1985, the Salesian Order of St. John Bosco assumed administration of LaSalle High School under the direction of Rev. Frank Wolfram, SDB, as principal Rosemary Kamke departed the school.  Salesian Sisters  The Salesian Sisters of Don Bosco, or Daughters of Mary Help of Christians, are the sister order of the Salesians of Don Bosco. They were founded by Saint Maria Mazzarello in 1872 to work alongside Saint Don Bosco in his teaching projects in Turin and continue to be a teaching order worldwide. On August 5, 1872 in Mornese, Alessandria, Italy, the first Daughters of Mary Help of Christians gathered with Don Bosco and Msgr. Joseph Sciandra, the Bishop of Acqui, to celebrate their admission to the novitiate and the first professions. On that day St. Mary Domenica Mazzarello was also elected the first superior and given the title of “vicar”. A year later their first boarding school and primary school was recognized by the educational authorities of Castelletto d’Orba. On October 8, 1874, the Salesian Sisters were able to open their first house in Borgo San Martino. They carried on the tradition of the Salesian Oratory (a place where young people could gather to enjoy themselves, learn, and grow in their faith, safe from harm), ran workshops to educated young women to help them to be self-sufficient, and taught. The work of the Salesians Sisters was not limited to a schoolroom as they participated in social justice works and teaching trades to young women and girls. St. Mary Mazzarello and her first companions were able to profess their perpetual vows, after studying with the Sisters of St Anne for their religious formation, on August 28, 1875 in the presence of Don Bosco. After many years of revision, discussion and consultation, St. Don Bosco was able to give to the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians the first printed version of their Constitutions on the feast of the Immaculate Conception, December 8, 1878. In 1881, Mother Mazzarello took ill and died on May 14, at age 44. In her stead were left 26 houses and 166 Sisters. Mary Help of Christians saw to it that her Institute grew, and today the order numbers more than 15,000 members in 89 different countries, and on five continents.  Hurricane Andrew  On August 24, 1992 Hurricane Andrew hit South Florida, resulting in 15 deaths, more than 250,000 temporary homeless, and $20 billion in damages. An additional 25 lives were lost indirectly. Hardly any part of South Florida was unaffected and recovery took years. La Salle High School was no different. Both La Salle High School and La Ermita de la Caridad National Shrine awoke to four rather large cabin cruiser boats on several locations on the campus. Although still on summer vacation, many of the students from the class of 1993, 1994 and 1995 participated in an intense two-week cleanup. Without the help of these students the school simply could not have opened on time only two weeks later. Incredibly, even though the storm surge reached the schools second floor, the statue of Mary Help of Christians was untouched according to Jose M. Pazos class of 1995. This statue was located in front of the cafeteria courtyard right next to a 34 ft boat that had landed there during the storm. For months many of the students and parents raised money to repair the school. Many alumni also contributed assistance by way of political influence in order to assist in the cleanup particularly of the mountain of debris located behind the science building. The City of Miami was very gracious in donating the bulk waste machinery needed to clean up the debris. Thankfully under the direction of Father Patrick Angelucci, principal from 1991 -1995, the school was able to come back even stronger than before.  Restoring \\"Immaculata\\" to LaSalle High School's name  In 2002, the first LaSalle High School Alumni Association was formed. 1964 ILS classmate Armando Chapelli proposed to the LaSalle High School Alumni Association to restore the name Immaculata to the school's name and to move the Pieta sculpture back to the campus. On April 24, 2004, the LaSalle High School Alumni Association inducted the following charter members into the school's Hall of Fame: 1964 ILS classmate Antonia “Toni” Williams-Gary and 1962 ILS classmates and LaSalle student founders Eduardo R. Arellano de Cardenas, Jose M. Arellano de Cardenas, Bienvenido “Benny” Benach Costales, Oscar Bustill Guas, Nestor Machado Lopez-Munoz, and Eduardo Sanchez Rionda. Also inducted were former ILS faculty members Sister Mary Josepha Butterfield, SSJ, Sister Elizabeth Worley, SSJ, Brother Malachy Broderick, FSC, and Brother Antonio Ramon, FSC. The 2005 hurricane season devastated the school's campus, which suffered extensive damage. The school cafetorium needed to be reconstructed. A tent was installed on the school property and used as a cafeteria until the reconstruction was completed. Recovery efforts were hastened by the assistance of students, faculty and alumni in the clean-up process. On February 26, 2006, 1966 ILS classmates Marianne Carpentieri Donnell and Maria Restrepo Forte met with LaSalle High School principal - Sister Patricia Roche, FMA to express their concerns and disappointment over the decision to drop \\"Immaculata\\" from the school's name. Sister Roche considered allowing the original school building to be named Immaculata Hall and proposed that a small garden area be turned over to Immaculata graduates as a memorial area for Immaculata. On April 29, Principal Roche issued a declaration naming the original school building Immaculata Hall during the 1966 Class reunion. Source: Nancy Foye-Cox - ILS 1964 Classmate's Oral History In 2006 or 2007, 1966 ILS classmate Maria Restropo Forte joined the LaSalle Alumni Association Board, and the Alumni Association subsequently changed its name to the Immaculata-LaSalle High School Alumni Association. Summer of 2007 Gaston Arellano, son of Jose Maria Arellano, Founding member of the class of 1962 joined the Alumni Board of Directors. On June 1, 2007, LaSalle principal, Sr. Pat, officially solicited support from ILS alumni to restore the name \\"Immaculata\\" to LaSalle High School in commemoration of the upcoming 50th anniversary of the founding of Immaculata Academy on September 1, 1958. On June 8, Miami Archbishop John C. Favalora sent a letter to Sister Roche granting her request to restore “Immaculata” to the school's name. 2007 marked the 45th anniversary of the founding of Immaculata-LaSalle High School. 2006 marked the 45th anniversary of LaSalle High School's founding in Miami, Florida. After nearly 25 years, the name Immaculata was officially restored to the school's name on October 20, 2007 during the school's 50th Anniversary celebration. Tuition fee for 2009–2010 is $8,100. La Salle High School is served by the Miami Metrorail at the Vizcaya Station.

She was one of the members of the first class of wrestlers trained by Chigusa Nagayo when Nagayo formed the GAEA Japan promotion. Uematsu finished her career in 2012, working for the Pro Wrestling Wave promotion. After her retirement, Uematsu continued working as a trainer for Pro Wrestling Wave. Career Toshie Uematsu debuted at the age of 21 on April 15, 1995 at Memorial First Gong, the first show of the GAEA Japan joshi puroresu promotion. In 1997, several GAEA wrestlers, including Uematsu, appeared in World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Uematsu was entered in the inaugural tournament for the newly created women's cruiserweight title. She won the tournament, defeating Malia Hosaka on April 7, 1997 in Hunstville, Alabama to become the first holder of the WCW Women's Cruiserweight Championship. Uematsu lost the belt to Yoshiko Tamura on July 19, 1997 and the belt was abandoned soon afterwards. On February 17, 2004, Uematsu and her partner, Ran Yu-Yu won the AAAW Tag Team Championship for the first time when they beat Chikayo Nagashima and Meiko Satomura by countout (in Japan, a title can change hands on a countout). Uematsu and Yu-Yu were a cunning combo, winning most of their matches by countout after luring their opponents as far away from the ring as they could. They won the belts for the second time on April 3, 2005, defeating Manami Toyota and Carlos Amano. The championship was retired one week later when the GAEA promotion closed; Uematsu and Yu-Yu lost to Sugar Sato and Chikayo Nagashima in a non-title match on the final card. Uematsu has stayed busy since, wrestling as a free-lancer for several joshi promotions. Uematsu returned to the United States on March 12, 2011, when she defeated Madison Eagles at an event promoted by the Chikara promotion. The following day she was defeated by Sara Del Rey at another Chikara event. Uematsu returned to Chikara on December 2, 2011, to take part in the special JoshiMania weekend, losing to Manami Toyota on night one. The following day, Uematsu teamed with GAMI to defeat Cherry and Sawako Shimono in a tag team match. On the third and final night of the tour, Uematsu teamed with The Batiri (Kobald, Kodama and Obariyon) to defeat Cherry and The Colony (Fire Ant, Green Ant and Soldier Ant) in an eight-person tag team match. On April 30, 2012, Uematsu wrestled her retirement match at a Pro Wrestling Wave event, where she and Ran Yu-Yu defeated Moeka Haruhi and Shuu Shibutani in a tag team match. Uematsu made a one-night return to the ring on December 30, 2013, taking part in Gami's retirement match, a 70-person battle royal. Uematsu made another return on March 22, 2014, when she took part in Kaoru's return match at an event produced by Chigusa Nagayo.

Taylor Bernard J. Taylor is a writer and composer of musicals and stage plays. His stage works have been produced around the world and translated into German, Romanian, Polish, Hungarian, Spanish and Italian. He is also the writer of 14 novels and three non-fiction books. Taylor was born and educated in Cape Town, South Africa. His forebears included John Taylor, the first British missionary to southern Africa. He left South Africa for England in 1969 and remained in England until 1998, after which he spent a year in Australia before settling in the United States. He lives in San Antonio, Texas. Music and musicals Taylor has composed numerous musicals. Neighbors And Lovers Taylor's first musical show was Neighbors And Lovers (1987), self-produced at the Oast Theatre, Tonbridge, England. However, Taylor decided to abandon it in favour of creating a musical based on a universally known story. Wuthering Heights Taylor selected Emily Brontë's classic Wuthering Heights, composing the music. A concept album was released in 1991 with a cast of West End musical stars including a former \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\" Dave Willetts, as Heathcliff, Lesley Garrett (Cathy Earnshaw), Bonnie Langford (Isabella Linton), Clive Carter (Hindley Earnshaw), Sharon Campbell (Ellen \\"Nelly\\" Dean) and James Staddon (Edgar Linton). It had its world premier at the Madison Theatre, Illinois, in 1993 and has since been performed in the UK, Germany, Australia, New Zealand,The Netherlands, Poland and Romania. Make Me a Musical Meanwhile, Taylor turned his attention to something entirely different. The show (originally entitled Success! and renamed in 2009) was a backstage musical, loosely based on Faust, and set in New York. Peppered with parody and pastiche, with additional lyrics by Vivian Wadham, its typical, and often cynical, view of the ups and downs of show business was accompanied by a jazzy and sometimes tender score, with Claire Moore, Lon Satton, Kathryn Evans, Jessica Martin and Maurice Clarke forming the CD cast. The musical was revamped in 2006 and retitled \\"Make Me a Musical\\". Pride And Prejudice By the time Success! made its debut at the Civic Theatre, Rotherham, in September 1995, Taylor had returned to the classics, in the form of Jane Austen's Pride And Prejudice. With Claire Moore as Elizabeth Bennett and Peter Karrie in the role of Darcy, the concept album also featured Gay Soper, Janet Mooney, James Staddon and Christopher Biggins as Mr. Collins. Stand-out tracks, according to the Virgin Encyclopedia of Film and Stage Music (VEFSM), were considered to be \\"Through The Eyes Of A Child\\" \\"Good Breeding\\" and \\"Thank God They're Married\\". Pride And Prejudice was introduced to US audiences, complete with five new songs, by the Public Theatre Company of Peoria, Illinois, in January 1995. Taylor's musical interpretation of the Austen novel was considered to be closer to its source than the 1959 Broadway version (see VEFSM), First Impressions (Austen's original title for the book), which starred Hermione Gingold. By 2012 there had been more than 30 productions of the show worldwide in the US, UK, Germany, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Brazil and the USA. Nosferatu the Vampire This production, (with additional lyrics by Eric Vickers), included numbers such as \\"Wild Talk Of Vampires\\", \\"And Sheep Shall Not Safely Graze\\", \\"Worms Feed On My Brains\\" \\"Ship Of The Dead\\" \\"Blasphemy\\" and \\"Somewhere At The Edges Of Creation\\". Once again, the album cast was led by Claire Moore (singer) (as Mina) and Peter Karrie (as Nosferatu), supported by Mario Frangoulis, former pop star Mark Wynter, Barry James, Annalene Beechey and Simon Burke. The world premiere was staged at the Madison Theatre, Peoria, Illinois, in September 1995, and the show had its first European performances a month later in Eastbourne. The work has been translated into German, Spanish and Hungarian. Much Ado Having achieved considerable success with his adaptations on Brontë and Austen, Taylor looked to William Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing, abbreviated to Much Ado (additional lyrics: Vickers). The CD cast included Paul McGann (Benedick), Claire Moore (Beatrice), Simon Burke (Claudio), Janet Mooney (Hero), Barry James (Leonato), David Pendelbury (Dogberry) and Peter Karrie (Don John). Songs included \\"If I Could Write A Sonnet\\", \\"I'll Never Love Again\\", \\"The Sweetest Kiss\\", \\"Now I Hear Symphonies\\" and \\"This Strange Affliction Called Love\\" as well as the humorous \\"The Officers Of The Watch\\" and \\"Never Satisfied\\". It had its world premiere at Stratford on Avon, birthplace of Shakespeare, in 1996, and had its Continental European premiere in Budapest, Hungary, in 2006. The work was translated by Lőrincz Levente, directed by Benkő Péter, and the main roles were played by Udvarias Anna (Beatrice), Lőrincz Levente (Benedick), Bardóczy Attila (Don Pedro), Czakó Ádám (Claudio), Zseni Zsuzsa (Hero), Fekete István (Leonato), Monori Balázs (Dogberry), Cservenák Vilmos (Don John). Millennium Suite As the 1990s drew to a close, Taylor, in collaboration with orchestrator Gareth Price, attempted \\"to portray some of the key developments in the advance of civilization over the past 1,000 years\\" via his Millennium Suite. Performed on CD by the Polish State Philharmonic Orchestra of Latowice, conducted by Jerzy Swoboda, the suite consisted of \\"The Birth Of Chivalry\\" \\"The Age Of Oppression\\" \\"The Enlightenment\\" \\"The Road To Democracy\\" and \\"The Triumph of Democracy\\". Passion's Progress Encouraged by his latest reviews, Taylor composed another symphonic work, Passion's Progress, a suite of ten pieces tracing the development of a romantic relationship. After featuring on the majority of Taylor's concept albums, Claire Moore, who has starred in the West End in shows such as Aspects Of Love and The Phantom Of The Opera, released the solo CDs, \\"Songs From The Musicals Of Bernard J. Taylor\\" and \\"Child Of The Earth\\". Liberty: The Siege of the Alamo The end of the decade saw the creation of Liberty: The Siege of the Alamo, which had its world premiere at the Josephine Theater in San Antonio in 2000. It was translated into Spanish in 2003 by the Mexican playwright Erick Merino, who also translated Nosferatu in 1998. Snow White and The Evil Queen Around 2004 Taylor began work on a series of four comic operas using the music of classical composers whose music was out of copyright. Taylor said he hoped to bring the music of the classical composers to a wider audience through these works. The first of these was \\"Snow White and The Evil Queen\\", which takes the classic fairy tale and gives the \\"Evil Queen\\" a more central role. Instead of a \\"mirror mirror on the wall\\", the story features a masochistic hairdresser who acts as the queen's stylist as well as her vanity mirror. The show uses the music of Beethoven and a section of his Violin Concerto becomes a Snow White song – \\"No More Miss Nice Girl\\" – while his 5th Symphony is used for the song \\"Snow White Must Die\\". A recording of the show was made at the J.B. Sowards Theatre in Ashland, Kentucky, in 2010 and featured on YouTube. The Corporate Pirate of Penzance For this show, completed in 2007, Taylor took a number of the most popular songs of Gilbert and Sullivan and incorporated them into a more modern story of a corporate mogul (a Franchise King, also known as the Corporate Pirate of Penzance) who is hoping his daughter will marry into the British aristocracy, and a penniless young poet who falls in love with the daughter. The show uses music from Pirates of Penzance, H.M.S. Pinafore, The Mikado, Iolanthe, Trial by Jury and The Gondoliers, mixing the music of Arthur Sullivan and the words of W.S. Gilbert with lyrics that reflect the modernized narrative. In 2011 the Texas Light Opera Company was set up by Nicole Erwin, in conjunction with the Josephine Theatre in San Antonio, Texas, to produce the show in 2012 as the first in a series of productions of the comic operas. Cinderella's Christmas Makeover In 2008 Taylor began to revamp the Cinderella fairy tale using the music of Leo Delibes, W.A. Mozart, J.S. Bach, Jules Massenet, Carl Maria von Weber, Antonín Dvořák, Luigi Boccherini, Edvard Grieg, Josef Haydn, Felix Mendelssohn, Frédéric Chopin, Jacques Offenbach, P.I. Tchaikovsky, and Camille St Saens. He also composed four additional pieces of music. In Taylor's version, Cinderella is given a make-over for a reality show and gets to meet a prince who falls immediately in love with her. But Cinderella rejects the prince because she is disturbed by his obsession with whether or not her feet will fit a glass slipper. She falls for a penniless courtier who rescues her from the slave traders to whom her stepmother tries to sell her. The show ends with the couple entering and winning a national talent show. The Marsh King's Daughter One of Hans Christian Andersen's lesser-known fairy tales is considerably expanded and re-worked by Taylor in a comic opera using the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. This was completed in 2010. All four comic operas, plus two plays, were published in Britain by Stagescripts Ltd in 2010. The Road to Madness Completed at the end of 2012, it is a chamber musical about the life of F. Scott Fizgerald and his relationships with Zelda Sayre and Ernest Hemingway. Fitzgerald is interviewed after his death and relives some of the key moments in his life. It has a cast of four. It was produced in San Antonio in 2015. Rock n Roll Cafe Begun in 2012, the libretto and songs were completed at the beginning of 2013. It is about the life of the young in a mid-size town during the heyday of rock n' roll. Backstage at Oz New Guy at School Completed at the beginning of 2013 in tandem with Rock n Roll Cafe, this is an updated version of Tom Brown's Schooldays, the classic 19th Century novel by Thomas Hughes (which created the blueprint for all school stories that followed, including Harry Potter). It features all the main characters from the original novel, but in this version it is set in a modern co-ed school. It was written especially for school productions. Transformation A Christmas Carol Plays Taylor has written numerous plays, mostly between 2010 and 2020. Living with Ghosts This tells the story of an introverted and burned-out writer who ends a hollow relationship with a married woman at the same time as he rents a room in his city apartment to an extrovert out-of-towner named Rachel, a generation younger than himself. He is torn between his attraction to her, his self- consciousness and his fear of involvement. The show was first performed in embryo in San Antonio, Texas, at the beginning of 2012. It has since been extensively revised. Haunted Newlyweds Eddie and Janine buy a house in the country. The house has been untenanted for a few years and the furniture of the previous owner are covered with dust sheets. They learn that the house was owned a couple who are now dead. Then they learn disturbing learn disturbing facts about the house's history. Things come to a head one night when an explosive incident leads to an exposure of the true nature of events. This is also available as a screenplay. Appalachian Ghosts The Lady of Shalott This play with music was published by Stagescripts in the UK as \\"Hear a Song That Echoes. Inspired by the epic poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson, it tells the story of a young literary professor who keeps the world at a distance until she is challenged by the passion of a former student. It received its first try-out in San Antonio in 2015. The Deconstruction of Doctor Gerald Ackerman Completed in 2011, this tells of a prominent psychiatrist who is put through sensory deprivation and \\"deconstructed\\" by a friend of the daughter he abused as a child. It is adapted from a novel that Taylor has subsequently withdrawn from circulation. The Deliverer Adapted from another novel that Taylor has withdrawn from circulation, it is about a man who kills women he meets through the internet in the belief that he is doing them a favor by ending their miserable lives and sending them to a better place. The play was completed early in 2012. The Kindness of Strangers In 2018, solo theatre artist Jade Esteban Estrada starred in the San Antonio production of Taylor's The Kindness of Strangers, a one-person show about the life of Tennessee Williams.Theatre Presents The Kindness of Strangers\\" by Alex Bentleysanantonio.culturemap.com 1/20/18 Playwright Mark Leonard lauded Estrada's \\"brilliant, energetic portrayal of Williams. Both Taylor and Estrada deftly sidestep the cloying cliches to offer a gripping and vastly entertaining hour or so in the company of an American genius bent on self-destruction. Their Tennessee has heart, soul, rage and wit and it is well worth spending an evening entranced and entertained in his company.\\"*M.\\" 2018, January 14facebook.com 1/6/18 Theatre for Scandal Theatre for Scandal is a comedy loosely inspired by Sheridan's School for Scandal. When Anthony Hamilton hears there is a rumor that he is secretly straight, he claims to be outraged by the rumor and threatens to sue. His attention is soon diverted, however, when a female member of the group breaks down after being unceremoniously dumped by her lothario boyfriend, Alfonso, for another woman. Hamilton comes to her aid and promises to teach the jilter a lesson. He investigates the jilter's movement and learns that the lothario meets regularly with his new girlfriend at the Cozy Corner coffee bar. At one of these rendezvous Hamilton appears and accuses Alfonso of two-timing him with a woman. Alfonso is outraged at the suggestion that he and Hamilton (who have never met before) are lovers. He threatens Hamilton, who in turn eggs him on and warns Alfonso that he has a black belt in karate. Horrified by the prospect of losing a physical battle to such an effeminate and smaller person, Alfonso backs off. The play ends with the jilted girlfriend and Hamilton embarking on a new kind of relationship for both of them.

It was formed in March 1955 at Iwakuni, Japan, and equipped with three Douglas C-47 Dakotas and a CAC Wirraway. The flight's main duty was flying a regular courier service between Japan and South Korea in support of Commonwealth military units based on the peninsula. Transport Flight (Japan) ceased operations in June 1956 and disbanded in September that year. History Transport Flight (Japan) traced its lineage to a transport contingent that the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) maintained in Japan prior to the Korean War. When the war broke out in June 1950, No. 77 (Fighter) Squadron was based at Iwakuni as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 222–225 Equipped primarily with North American P-51 Mustangs, the squadron also operated a communications flight of two and two Austers.Wilson, The Brotherhood of Airmen, p. 170Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 29 No. 91 (Composite) Wing was established at Iwakuni in October 1950 to administer all RAAF units during the war.O'Neill, Australia in the Korean War, p. 314 This included No. 77 Squadron, the newly formed No. 391 (Base) Squadron and No. 491 (Maintenance) Squadron, and , formerly the No. 77 Squadron Communications Flight.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 228 It was designated No. 30 Communications Unit in November.RAAF Historical Section, Maritime and Transport Units, p. 150 By then it had a complement of eight Dakotas and two Austers.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 247 No. 30 Communications Unit was redesignated No. 30 Transport Unit in November 1951.RAAF Historical Section, Maritime and Transport Units, p. 152Eather, Odd Jobs, p. 169 By the end of 1952, its strength was eight Dakotas and one CAC Wirraway, and fifty-nine personnel.No. 36 Squadron, Operations Record Book, p. 57 Former prisoners of war board a Dakota of No. 36 Squadron in alt=Uniformed personnel boarding a twin-engined transport plane In March 1953, No. 30 Transport Unit re-formed as No. 36 (Transport) Squadron, which had disbanded the previous day at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales.Roylance, Air Base Richmond, p. 116No. 36 Squadron, Operations Record Book, p. 41 Elements of No. 36 Squadron began returning to Australia in January 1955, and by the end of the month its strength was four Dakotas and one Wirraway, and fifty-eight personnel.O'Neill, Australia in the Korean War, p. 592No. 36 Squadron, Operations Record Book, pp. 315–319 No. 36 Squadron ceased flying on 13 March, after which its remaining strength left Iwakuni for Australia.RAAF Historical Section, Maritime and Transport Units, p. 58 RAAF Transport Flight (Japan) was formed at Iwakuni the next day under the control of No. 91 Wing. The unit was equipped with three Dakotas and one Wirraway, which had been left behind when the last members of No. 36 Squadron departed for Australia. Transport Flight (Japan)'s personnel, consisting of eight officers and sixty-six other ranks by the end of month, were drawn mainly from No. 36 Squadron, including its commanding officer, Squadron Leader G.L. Waller, as well as from No. 391 (Base) Squadron.RAAF Historical Section, Maritime and Transport Units, p. 185RAAF Transport Flight (Japan), Unit History Sheet, 14–31 March 1955 The flight's regular duty consisted of a courier service to Pusan and Kimpo in South Korea five days a week—Wednesdays and Sundays were excluded—to support Commonwealth forces on the peninsula. It became known in the process as \\"Japan–Korea Airlines\\". Generally carrying freight on the outbound journey, the aircraft often ferried casualties back to Iwakuni, and two nurses formerly of No. 391 Squadron were attached to the flight to assist with this task. The unit was also responsible for transporting VIPs. No. 391 Squadron and No. 91 Wing were disbanded at Iwakuni on 30 April 1955. Transport Flight (Japan) flew its last courier missions on 28 June 1956, and shortly after handed over its base facilities to the United States Navy. The flight's last Dakota—the last RAAF aircraft to be based in Japan—took off for Australia from Iwakuni on 8 July. It left behind some ground staff and Flight Lieutenant Raleigh, a small yellow dog that had accompanied No. 81 (Fighter) Wing—parent formation of No. 77 Squadron at the time—to Japan as its mascot in 1945 and had remained with the RAAF contingent at Iwakuni ever since.Eather, Odd Jobs, pp. 4–5 Raleigh, a keen flyer but considered too old to return to Australia, was to be given over to the care of a US service family when the last RAAF personnel departed Iwakuni.

It was first mentioned in the county of Holland on November 3, 1200. They are one of the few original noble families from Holland that has survived to this day. Members of the family carry the title of count or baron. Origin of the name The family was already noble from earliest times (\\"Uradel\\"). According to family legend, the name may be taken from the crescent (wassende) moon on the family coat of arms, borrowed from an Arabian banner that a member of the van Wassenaer family obtained while on a crusade. According to some family archives, Wassenaar means Wasser Herren, Sea Lords/Kings, which had been a traditional title that the invading Romans (under Caligula) had recognized while destituting the kings of Batavia. History of the family Seal of Dirk I (1226) The earliest known member was Philip, who lived in the early 13th century, and owned lands in Wassenaar. He was a vassal of William I, Count of Holland who took part in the Third Crusade and the Fifth Crusade. Philip's son Dirk I founded the branches van Wassenaer, van Cranenburch and van Groenevelt, while Dirk's brother Filips received the Kasteel Duivenvoorde in 1226 and founded the branch van Duvenvoirde (which only in the 17th century resumed the name van Wassenaer). A seal of Dirk I of 1226 shows a different coat-of-arms, but the crescent may have served as crest at the time. The van Wassenaer branch was made Burgraves of Leiden by the Counts of Holland in 1340. Later, in the Hook and Cod wars, they were among the leading aristocratic families to support the \\"Hooks\\". In 1544 the branch extinguished. Polanen Branch Coat of arms of the House of Polanen Philips III van Duivenvoorde (c. 1248 – after 1301) received the fief of Polanen (near Monster, South Holland) in 1295. His son Jan I van Polanen (ca. 1285 – 1342) founded the van Polanen branch. It played an important role, because through the marriage of Johanna van Polanen with Engelbert I of Nassau, the House of Nassau first gained territories in the Netherlands, namely Breda. Much later this fact, among others, led to the House of Orange-Nassau's rise to the ruling dynasty of the country. See: House of Polanen Other branches The Duvenvoirde branch ended with Jacoba Maria van Wassenaar, baroness of Torck (1709–1771) whose descendants in the female line, the barons Schimmelpenninck van der Oye, still today own Kasteel Duivenvoorde.

The branch van Wassenaer Opdam was elevated to the rank of (non-ruling) imperial counts in 1711. This branch extinguished in 1850 with Marie Cornélie van Wassenaer Obdam (1799–1850) who left the castle to her children, barons van Heeckeren van Kell, who took on the name van Heeckeren van Wassenaer. Baroness Marie Amélie van Heeckeren van Wassenaer, née countess van Aldenburg Bentinck (1879–1975), gave the castle to her family foundation in 1953. It is now administrated by the heirs of her grand nephew, count Christian zu Castell-Rüdenhausen (1952–2010). Jacob van Wassenaer, Lord of Voorschoten, Duivenvoorde and Veur (1649–1707), married Jacoba van Lyere, heiress of Katwijk, thus founding the branch van Wassenaer tot Catwijck which is still existing. Furthermore, the castles of Hoekelum and Nederhemert were owned by Wassenaer family members until the late 20th century. At the beginning of the 19th century, all family members were granted the title of baron in the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

Taxonomy Auchenipterichthys was first described by Pieter Bleeker in 1862, who designated A. thoracatus (originally described by Kner in 1857 as Auchenipterus thoracatus) as the type species. There are no derived states that is unique to this genus; however, there is no evidence that has been advanced to indicate that this genus is not monophyletic.  Species  There are currently four described species in this genus: * Auchenipterichthys coracoideus (C. H. Eigenmann & W. R. Allen, 1942) * Auchenipterichthys longimanus (Günther, 1864) * Auchenipterichthys punctatus (Valenciennes, 1840) * Auchenipterichthys thoracatus (Kner, 1858) Description The eyes of these catfish are large and can be seen from both above and below the fish. The anal fin has a long base and at least 18 branched fin rays. The side of the body is decorated with vertical rows of spots above the lateral line. The adipose fin is present. The lateral line has an irregular zigzag pattern. The head is flattened anteriorly with a terminal mouth. There are three pairs of thread- like barbels, one pair maxillary and two pairs mandibular. The dorsal fin and pectoral fins have large spines; the dorsal fin spine has a lower degree of serration than the pectoral fin spines, which is always serrated strongly on the entire length of both margins. Based on similarities, the species fall into two groups. One group consists of A. coracoideus and A. thoracatus which have a coracoid covered by a thin layer of integument (allowing the coracoid to be seen from below) and an obliquely truncated caudal fin. The other includes A. longimanus and A. punctatus which has a thick layer of skin covering the coracoid and an emarginate or symmetrical caudal fin. A. coracoideus typically has 25 or fewer branched anal fin rays, while A. thoracatus typically has 26 or more branched anal-fin rays. A. punctatus has a body with variably sized dark spots scattered over the body and the fins, while A. longimanus does not. Species of Auchenipterichthys are sexually dimorphic. Breeding males of A. coracoideus have an elongated dorsal fin spine. In A. longimanus and A. thoracatus, serrae on the end of the dorsal fin spine are proportionally longer in breeding males than in juveniles and females. Also, females have an enlarged urogenital opening. Males have their urogenital opening located at the end of a tube bound by integument to the anterior margin of the anal fin. The males use their modified anal fin as a means of internal insemination; the female can later lay the eggs in isolation. Ecology Auchenipterichthys species are insectivores. A. longimanus has been reported to feed primarily on terrestrial invertebrates. There is also evidence that A. longimanus is involved in seed dispersal. Auchenipterichthys species are also capable of producing sound.

It is stationed at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. The current commander is Colonel Michael \\"Lou\\" Rawls, who took command in June 2017. The 435 AGOW is the second USAF wing solely dedicated to supporting battlefield airmen. It consolidated the tactical air control party and battlefield weather specialties of the 4th ASOG, the contingency communications support of the 435th Air and Space Communications Group, and the expeditionary support to assess, prepare and operate airfields for air expeditionary forces of the CRG. Both of the groups previously part of the 86th Airlift Wing were transferred to the 435th AGOW. Units The 435 AGOW comprises three groups. Each groups supports a specific portion of the wing's multifaceted mission. * The 4th Air Support Operations Group * The 435th Contingency Response Group : The group is tasked with establishing airfield and aerial port operations and providing force protection at contingency airfields. The unit was activated as the 86th Contingency Response Group at Hangar 3 at Ramstein Air Base on February 26, 1999, and was the first unit of its kind in the Air Force. It incorporates more than 42 different jobs. It is a rapid-deployment unit designed to be a \\"first-in\\" force to secure an airfield and establish and maintain airfield operations. It consists of three subordinate squadrons: :: The CRG's Air Mobility Squadron provides airfield command and control, loads and unloads aircraft and essentially sets up an aerial port where none existed. :: The CRG's Security Forces Squadron provides force protection in the opening stages of a deployment and also provides protection for any follow-on forces. The Security Forces Squadron is capable of overland airlift, air assault, or airborne insertion into crisis situations. :: The CRG's Construction & Training Squadron provides Mission Essential Equipment Training (MEET) concentrates on specialized or unique mission-essential equipment civil engineers do not use in their day-to-day operations. MEET provides hands-on training to students for proper certifications in their CFETP and ACES PR. MEET is SORTS reportable under CAT II training. Individuals will be trained to the proficiency level prescribed in the approved MEET curriculum to set up, operate, troubleshoot, maintain and reconstitute equipment IAW Prime BEEF/Contingency Training Panel-approved objectives. :: The CRG's newly formed Detachment 1 provides an OSS type function with a core capability resting in its Air Advisor Flight. This flight is predominately responsible for military- to-military engagements with partner nations, helping increase relationships in the EUCOM and AFRICOM AORs. * The 435th Air and Space Communications Group History : For additional history and lineage, see 435th Operations Group Reserve operations Curtiss C-46D In June 1949, Continental Air Command (ConAC), which had the responsibility for training reserve units, reorganized its reserve units under the wing base organization system. As part of this reorganization and unit reductions required by President Truman’s reduced 1949 defense budget,Knaack, p. 25 the 435th Troop Carrier Wing was activated at Miami International Airport, and formed its cadre from the inactivating 49th Air Division and 100th Bombardment Group.See Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 171-172 (inactivation of 100th Group at Miami), 393 (inactivation of 49th Division at Miami) The wing was manned at 25% of normal strength but was authorized four squadrons rather than the three of active duty units.Cantwell, p. 74 Korean War mobilization Fairchild C-119G Flying Boxcar At Miami, the wing trained with C-46s under the supervision of the active duty 2585th Air Force Reserve Training Center. The wing was ordered into active service in March 1951 as a result of the Korean War. Along with other reserve units called to active duty, it formed Tactical Air Command's Eighteenth Air Force. The 435th's initial function was to train C-46 aircrews for service in Korea.Citus et Certus, p. 8 The wing also trained with Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcars. Although it remained at Miami, the wing deployed twice while on active duty: to Laurinburg-Maxton Airport, North Carolina from 21 July until 1 September 1951 and to Grenier Air Force Base, New Hampshire from 2 January to 3 March 1952.Citus et Certus, p. 28 It was relieved from active duty and inactivated on 1 December 1952 and its mission, personnel and equipment were transferred to the regular 456th Troop Carrier Wing, which was activated the same day.Ravenstein, pp. 251-252 Troop carrier operations The wing was activated as a reserve unit the same day at the same station, but with the personnel and equipment of the inactivating 482d Troop Carrier Wing.Ravenstein, pp. 267-268 In the reserve, the 435th once again flew Curtiss Commandos under the supervision of the 2585th Center. In the summer of 1956, the wing participated in Operation Sixteen Ton during its two weeks of active duty training. Sixteen Ton was performed entirely by reserve troop carrier units and moved United States Coast Guard equipment From Floyd Bennett Naval Air Station to Isla Grande Airport in Puerto Rico and San Salvador in the Bahamas. After the success of this operation, the wing began to use inactive duty training periods for Operation Swift Lift, transporting high priority cargo for the Air Force and Operation Ready Swap, transporting aircraft engines between Air Materiel Command’s depots.Cantwell, pp. 149-150 In addition, for the first time as a reserve unit, its flying was performed in unit tactical aircraft, rather than in trainers.Cantwell, p. 146 Detached Squadron Concept During the first half of 1955, the Air Force began detaching reserve squadrons to separate locations. The dispersal of separate squadrons to smaller population centers was intended to facilitate recruiting and manning. One of the first three squadrons to move as this policy was implemented was the 78th Troop Carrier Squadron, which was activated at Orlando Air Force Base in April 1955 after having been inactivated at Miami the previous year.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 280-281Cantwell, p. 156 In August 1956, the wing's 77th Troop Carrier Squadron left Miami for Pinellas County Airport, Florida. The squadron's stay in the Tampa Bay area was brief, however, for in November 1957 it moved again, this time to New Orleans Naval Air Station, Louisiana.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 278-279 Only the 76th Squadron remained with group headquarters in Miami.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 276 In 1957, the wing once again received C-119s. In 1958, the 2585th Center was inactivated and some of its personnel were absorbed by the wing. In place of active duty support for reserve units, ConAC adopted the Air Reserve Technician program, in which a cadre of the unit consisted of full-time personnel who were simultaneously civilian employees of the Air Force and also held military rank as members of the reserves.Cantwell, p. 163 Activation of groups under the wing The 435th Troop Carrier Group was inactivated on 14 April 1959 when the 435th Wing adopted the Dual Deputy organization and the group's squadrons were assigned directly to the wing.Citus et Certus, p. 26 In 1960, the wing left busy Miami International Airport and moved south to Homestead Air Force Base, Florida. Although the dispersal of flying units under the Detached Squadron Concept was not a problem when the entire wing was called to active service, mobilizing a single flying squadron and elements to support it proved difficult. This weakness was demonstrated in the partial mobilization of reserve units during the Berlin Crisis of 1961.Cantwell, pp. 189-191 The 77th and 78th Troop Carrier Squadrons converted to the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II in 1961, and were ordered to active service for the crisis, although the 76th Troop Carrier Squadron, which continued to fly the C-119, remained in reserve status. After training to become combat ready, the mobilized wing participated in worldwide airlift and tactical exercises. The wing returned to reserve status in August 1962 and the 76th Squadron was once more assigned. To resolve the mobilization problem, at the start of 1962 ConAC determined to reorganize its reserve wings by establishing groups with support elements for each of its troop carrier squadrons. This reorganization would facilitate mobilization of elements of wings in various combinations when needed. However, as this plan was entering its implementation phase, another partial mobilization occurred for the Cuban Missile Crisis. The formation of troop carrier groups was delayed until January for wings that had not been mobilized. The 915th Troop Carrier Group at Homestead, the 916th Troop Carrier Group at Donaldson Air Force Base, South Carolina and the 917th Troop Carrier Group at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, were all assigned to the wing on 17 January. That spring, the Air Force closed Donaldson and the 916th Group moved to Carswell Air Force Base, Texas and was reassigned. It was replaced by the 908th Troop Carrier Group at Bates Field, Alabama. The wing's other Globemaster group, the 917th, was reassigned in July and the wing once again flew Flying Boxcars as its tactical aircraft. The wing was inactivated in April 1965 and its groups reassigned to other reserve wings. European airlift Reactivated first at RAF High Wycombe, England, 24 December 1968, then moved to Wiesbaden, West Germany on 1 July 1969, the 435th served as a support wing of Military Airlift Command, providing deployed airlift control elements and aircraft maintenance at aerial ports in portions of Europe, the Middle East, Southwest Asia, and Africa. The redesignated 435th Tactical Airlift Wing had host responsibilities for Rhein-Main AB, beginning July 1975, which included operating the busiest U.S. air terminal in Europe and supporting CONUS-based strategic airlift transiting Rhein-Main. While continuing to function as a tactical and support wing, the 435th TAW gained the mission of aeromedical evacuation in Europe and the Middle East. Provided airlift support for United States European Command (EUCOM) and Headquarters, United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), from March 1977 until June 1978. Provided airlift for the theater, first with rotational Lockheed C-130 Hercules forces until early 1978, and afterward with a permanently assigned C-130 airlift squadron. Participated in joint and combined paratroop training and exercises, as well all manner of theater humanitarian airlift, including relief for natural disasters, evacuation of civilians from hostile situations, and aeromedical evacuation from combat areas. During Operation Desert Shield/Storm, the wing's 37th Tactical Airlift Squadron, plus additional wing personnel, deployed to Al Ain, United Arab Emirates, from mid-August 1990 to late March 1991 to provide theater airlift during the Persian Gulf War. On 1 April 1992, the wing was again redesignated as the 435th Airlift Wing and implemented USAF's objective wing concept. With the inactivation of Military Airlift Command in 1992, the wing and Rhein-Main returned to USAFE control, while an Air Mobility Command airlift support group was activated to take over operation of the air terminal and support transiting air mobility (i.e., strategic airlift, theater airlift, and air refueling) aircraft. From July 1992 through September 1994, the wing controlled the massive airlift effort (Operation Provide Promise) to provide airland and airdrop humanitarian airlift to war-torn areas of the former Yugoslavia. On 1 October 1993 the 55 AAS and 58 AS were inactivated as part of the general drawdown of USAF units and installations in Europe at the end of the Cold War. In February 1994, USAF began returning portions of Rhein-Main Air Base to German control and the wing's remaining airlift squadron was reassigned to the 86th Wing (86 WG) at Ramstein Air Base. The 86th Wing was redesignated the 86th Airlift Wing on 1 October 1994. The 435 AW was inactivated effective 1 April 1995 and its responsibilities at Rhein-Main turned over to the 469th Air Base Group under USAFE and the 626th Air Mobility Support Squadron under Air Mobility Command. The last commander of the 435th Airlift Wing was Col Donald A. Philpitt, USAF.Stars and Stripes, European Edition, April 1, 1995; p. 3 Expeditionary status The 435 AW was converted to a provisional expeditionary wing in February 2001, but was never activated as an expeditionary unit. It was returned to regular status in December 2003. Activation at Ramstein In January 2004, the wing was reactivated as the 435th Air Base Wing and assumed the overall host base support responsibilities at Ramstein Air Base, Germany as a non-flying unit. In mid 2009, the 435th Air Base Wing was redesignated the 435th Air Ground Operations Wing, the second wing of its kind in the USAF. The 435th assumed mission areas previously performed by two 86th Airlift Wing units – the contingency response group and the air and space communications group – along with the 4th Air Support Operations Group at Heidelberg, Germany. The 431st Air Base Group was inactivated during an earlier ceremony. The remaining mission areas of the 435th (e.g., base support of Ramstein) were merged back into the 86th Airlift Wing.

Taxonomy and naming The Great basin rattlesnake was first formally named by Laurence Monroe Klauber in 1930 as a subspecies of Crotalus confluentus (now known as Crotalus viridis). It is commonly considered a subspecies of Crotalus oreganus. The type locality is \\"10 miles northwest of Abraham on the Road to Joy, Millard County, Utah.\\" The Grand Canyon rattlesnake (C. abyssus or C. oreganus abyssus) was subsumed within C. lutosus in 2016. Description Adult specimens are in overall length, but rarely exceed .Campbell JA, Lamar WW. 2004. The Venomous Reptiles of the Western Hemisphere. Comstock Publishing Associates, Ithaca and London. 870 pp., 1500 plates. . The males grow larger than the females. On the subject of scalation, one of the more distinctive characteristics of this subspecies is that it has three or more internasal scales - something that it has in common with C. viridis. The color pattern usually consists of a buff, pale gray, pale brown, olive brown or yellowish brown ground color (hence the name, \\"lutosus,\\" meaning \\"muddy\\"), overlaid with a series of 32-49 dorsal blotches. These blotches are dark brown to black in color, with pale centers and pale borders, and are often irregular in shape and wider than they are long. There is also a series of lateral blotches that are indistinct anteriorly, but become more distinct posteriorly and eventually merge with the dorsal blotches to form crossbands. Older specimens sometimes have a faded pattern, or they may have uniformly black blotches, with the dorsum of the head also being black. Distribution and habitat The United States in the Great Basin region. Its range includes Idaho south of lat. 44° North, Utah west of long. 111° West, Arizona west and north of the Colorado River as well as the north rim of the Grand Canyon, the entire state of Nevada (excluding Esmeralda, Nye and Clark counties), California east of the Sierra Nevada from Lower Klamath Lake south to below Lake Mono, Oregon south and east of the line Upper Klamath Lake–Fort Rock–Burns–Council (Idaho).Klauber LM. 1997.

Frank Currier (September 4, 1857 - April 22, 1928) was an American film and stage actor and director of the silent era. Career Similar to Theodore Roberts, Kate Lester, Ida Waterman, and William H. Crane, Currier had a long and successful stage career in the Victorian and Edwardian eras. His youth was spent honing his stagecraft. By the time he started appearing in silent films he was in his 50s and middle-aged. Currier, like Roberts, had a distinctive grandfatherly look as he aged and was respected and beloved by film audiences. Currier appeared in 133 films between 1912 and 1928. He also directed 19 films in 1916. He is memorable in the 1925 film Ben-Hur as the Roman Admiral who adopts Judah Ben-Hur (Ramon Novarro) as his son after Ben-Hur saves his life during a battle at sea.

Though no bodies were found, he was accused by his accomplices of killing several people and suspected by the police to have murdered as many as 60 women from Arizona and New Mexico, while living in Elephant Butte, New Mexico, approximately 7 miles north of Truth or Consequences. He soundproofed a truck trailer that he called his \\"toy box\\", and equipped it with items used for sexual torture. Vernon J. Geberth. Sex-Related Homicide and Death Investigation: Practical and Clinical Perspectives, 2nd ed. (Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, 2010), Chapter 12, pp. 557-98.Michael H. Stone & Gary Brucato. The New Evil: Understanding the Emergence of Modern Violent Crime (Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books, 2019), pp. 203-11. Ray was convicted of kidnapping and torture in 2001, for which he received a lengthy sentence, but he was never convicted of murder. He died of a heart attack about one year after his convictions in two cases (the second of which resulted in a plea deal). Biography During his childhood, Ray and his younger sister Peggy lived with their disciplinarian grandfather. He was sporadically visited by his violent, alcoholic father who would supply him with magazines depicting sadomasochistic pornography. At Mountainair High School, in Mountainair, New Mexico, he was also bullied by his peers for his shyness around girls. His sexual fantasies of raping, torturing, and even murdering women developed during his teenage years. Around this time, his sister discovered his sadomasochistic drawings, as well as pornographic photographs of bondage acts. After completing high school, he received an honorable discharge from the U.S. Army, where his service also included work as a general mechanic. Ray was divorced four times and had two children, including his accomplice, daughter Jessie Ray (born Glenda Jean Ray). Crimes Ray sexually tortured and presumably killed his victims using whips, chains, pulleys, straps, clamps, leg spreader bars, surgical blades, and saws. It is thought that he terrorized many women with these tools for many years, while living in New Mexico, with the help of accomplices, some of whom are alleged to have been several of the women he was dating. Inside the torture room, along with numerous sex toys, torture implements, syringes, and detailed diagrams showing ways of inflicting pain, there was a homemade electrical generator, which was used for torture. A mirror was mounted in the ceiling, above the obstetric table to which he strapped his victims. Ray also put his victims in wooden contraptions that bent them over and immobilized them while he had his dogs and sometimes other friends rape them. He has been said to have wanted his victims to see everything he was doing to them. Ray often had an audio tape recording of his voice played for his victims whenever they regained consciousness. Arrest and investigation Ray posed as an undercover police officer and approached Cynthia Vigil in a parking lot. He told her she was under arrest, for solicitation of prostitution, and handcuffed her. He put her in his trailer and took her to Elephant Butte. After three days of captivity, Vigil escaped from his trailer at Elephant Butte on March 22, 1999. To escape, she waited until Ray had gone to work, and then unlocked her chains. Ray's accomplice, Cindy Hendy, had left the keys on a nearby table before going to another room, where she participated in a telephone call. After Vigil got the keys, Hendy noticed Vigil's attempt to escape and a fight ensued. During the struggle, Hendy broke a lamp on the victim's head, but Vigil unlocked her chains and stabbed Hendy in the neck with an icepick. Hendy fell to the floor and Vigil escaped. She fled while wearing only an iron slave collar and padlocked chains. She ran down the road seeking help, which she got from a nearby homeowner, who took her in, comforted her, and called the police. Her escape led officials to the trailer and instigated the capture of Ray and his accomplices. Police stopped Ray and Hendy, and Ray was taken to jail. After the publicity surrounding the arrest, another victim, Angelica Montano, came forward. She told a similar story and said that she had reported the incident to police, but there had been no follow-up. Ray had a video of another victim, Kelly Garrett (also called Kelly Van Cleave), which dated from 1996. Garrett ultimately was found in Colorado alive, after police identified a tattoo on her ankle. She later testified that she had gotten in a fight with her husband, and decided to spend the night playing pool with friends. On July 24, 1996, Ray's daughter, Jessie, who knew Garrett, took her to the Blu-Water Saloon in Truth Or Consequences, New Mexico, and drugged the beer she was drinking. Garrett had walked to the parking lot when she suffered a blow from behind, which knocked her unconscious. Ray took her to his trailer and attached a dog collar and leash to her neck. Garrett awoke, but blacked out several times during 2 days of torture and drugging. During this time, Ray noticed that she was breathing and slashed her throat open. Thinking that he had killed her, Ray dumped her beside a road near Caballo. She was later treated for her injuries at a local clinic. Neither her husband nor the police believed her story. Her husband believed she had been cheating on him the night she was attacked. He sued for divorce, and Garrett moved to Colorado. She was later interviewed on Cold Case Files about her ordeal. Two other accomplices were uncovered by the investigation: Glenda Jean \\"Jesse\\" Ray (Ray's daughter) and Dennis Yancy. Yancy admitted to strangling his former girlfriend, Marie Parker, after Ray had kidnapped and tortured her. Yancy was convicted of second-degree murder and of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, and was sentenced to two 15-year prison terms. After that murder, Ray allegedly admitted to having had an accomplice named Billy Bowers, a previous business partner, whom Ray also murdered. The Federal Bureau of Investigation sent 100 agents to examine Ray's property and surroundings, but no identifiable human remains were found. To prevent women from reporting the crimes, Ray had drugged them with agents to induce amnesia. He made a tape recording of himself telling one woman that the drugs were \\"sodium pentothal and phenobarbital [sic]\\". One woman remained uncertain that her recollections of the abuse were anything but nightmares until she was contacted by the FBI. After questioning, she came to remember her mistreatment in increasing detail. Trials A decision was made to try the cases involving Ray's attacks in three trials: one for his acts against Cynthia Vigil, one for those against Angelica Montano, and one for those against Kelli Garrett. Trial 1 resulted in a mistrial and retrial, with a conviction in the retrial on all 12 counts. Montano died before trial 2, and there was no conviction. [In trial 3?,] Ray agreed to a plea bargain, in which he was sentenced in 2001 to 224 years in prison for numerous offenses in the abduction and sexual torture of three young women at his Elephant Butte Lake home. Ray's daughter, Glenda Jean \\"Jesse\\" Ray, also was tried on charges of kidnapping; she was sentenced to two and a half years in prison, with an additional five years to be served on probation. In 1999, accomplice Dennis Roy Yancy was convicted of the strangulation murder of Marie Parker in Elephant Butte, which Ray recorded. In 2010, Yancy was paroled after serving 11 years in prison, but the release was delayed by difficulties in negotiating a plan for residence. Three months after his release in 2011, Yancy was charged with violating his parole. He was remanded to custody, where he is to remain until 2021, to serve the rest of his original sentence. In 2000, Cindy Hendy, an accomplice who testified against Ray, received a sentence of 36 years for her role in the crimes. She was scheduled to receive parole in 2017. She was released on July 15, 2019, after serving the 2 years of her parole in prison On May 28, 2002, Ray was taken to the Lea County Correctional Facility, in Hobbs, New Mexico, to be questioned by state police. He died of a heart attack before the interrogation took place.

It operated 15 theaters with 169 screens in seven states: Arkansas, Arizona, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Texas. In October 2014, the chain was purchased by B&B; Theatres. History In 1920, company founder Glen W. Dickinson, Sr quit the family business –a Ford dealership in Brookfield, Missouri specializing in tractors—to purchase a small two-screen theatre in a booming agricultural college town. The Dickinson Marshall Theatre in Manhattan, Kansas was christened in November 1920 as the first of many Dickinson Theatres. After overwhelming success with his first venture in the motion picture exhibition, Dickinson soon added a second market to his circuit. The Dickinson Bowersock Theatre sprung up in a booming college town less than 2 hours away in Lawrence, Kansas. It wasn't long after when a second Lawrence theatre was opened, and within a brief period of time, the fledgling circuit had expanded its size and scope to include theatres in Junction City, Ellsworth, Beloit, and Great Bend, Kansas. He also added a theatre in Springfield, Missouri. By 1931, Dickinson Theatres had grown to parent 26 theatres and continued to expand. It was at that time Dickinson decided to relocate the company office to Lawrence, Kansas. In 1946, the company branched out to introduce its first drive-in theatre. The first Dickinson drive-in opened in Pittsburg, Kansas and was followed in 1948 by the construction of the 81 Drive-In Theatre in Salina, Kansas, the Shawnee Drive- In in Shawnee, Kansas and the Leawood Drive-In Theatre in Leawood, Kansas. Company expansion and diversification continued under the operation of Glen W. Dickinson, Jr. as theatres sprung up in Waterloo, Iowa, Quincy, Illinois, Monroe, Missouri, Noel, Missouri, Anderson, Missouri, and Branson, Missouri. Property was also purchased near a little-known town called Overland Park, Kansas, with contract and the dream to build Dickinson's finest theatre. After more expansion, the company decided to move Dickinson's corporate headquarters to Kansas City's suburban Mission, Kansas. At that time, the small city only included a filling station, barber shop, taxi service and bicycle rental shop. The next ten years became very important for Dickinson Theatres, as the construction of a major motor hotel complex, the Glenwood Manor Motor Hotel, began at 95th and Metcalf, just a short distance away from what would be Dickinson's \\"Flagship\\" Glenwood Theatre, already in construction. In 1966, the Glenwood Theatre opened with the Midwest Premiere of the popular movie \\"Is Paris Burning?\\" The \\"new\\" Glenwood Theatre received instant recognition for movie theatre comfort, quality and design. Its overwhelming popularity with the public and film companies soon warranted the construction of additional screens and expansion to the complex. The decade of the 60's also marked the passing of the company's founder, Glen W. Dickinson, Sr. in 1963. The company was passed on to Glen W. Dickinson, Jr. who would go on to run the theatre chain for the next 20 years. One of the company's most significant milestones occurred in early 1980 when Dickinson Theatres purchased 25 screens from Mann Theatres. The acquisition increased the company's size from 46 screens to 71 screens with operation in 4 states. Glen W. Dickinson, Jr. died in 1983, leaving the leadership of the company to Kent Dickinson, the second of three sons. The other two, Jon Scott Dickinson and Glen Wood Dickinson III assisted as vice presidents for the company. Throughout the 80's under Kent Dickinson's administration, existing theatre properties were refurbished and updated with the latest technology. New luxurious theatre complexes were constructed over the next few years and included major multi-plexes in Kansas City, Kansas, Wichita, Kansas, Springfield, Missouri, and Columbia, Missouri. A change in company direction occurred in October 1992 when Wood Dickinson was named president of Dickinson Theatres. During Wood Dickinson's appointment to office, Dickinson Theatres opened its first 12-screen motion picture entertainment complex, the SouthGlen Theatre in suburban Overland Park, Kansas, as well as the new Plaza Cinema 6 facility in Leavenworth, Kansas. 1995 marked Dickinson Theatres' 75th anniversary and a year of great success. Dickinson introduced the \\"Crown Jewel\\" to the Kansas City area, opening the extraordinary WestGlen 12 Theatre in Shawnee, Kansas. Destined to become Dickinson's most luxurious movie center and model operation for excellence, the WestGlen soared expectations and later expanded to 18 screens. With a minimum addition of 20 new screens during 1995, Dickinson Theatres was operating 168 screens in 39 locations throughout Mid-America. In September 1999, a monumental event propelled the company in a new and exciting direction. Wood Dickinson, the last of the Dickinson family, decided the time was right to leave the theater business and start Renegade Pictures, LLC a feature film production company In his place, a young and motivated team led by John Hartley, head of purchasing for Dickinson Theatres, stepped up and took control of the company. Reviving the company mission to provide the best of family entertainment, the following years show a rebirth of the Dickinson Theatres. In October 2011, Dickinson Theaters added National CineMedia to its network afflitates, which has started on December of that year. In July 2012, John Hartley retired and sold the company to Ron Horton, who, at the time, was Executive Vice President of Film Buying and Marketing. Today, Ron Horton, continues to lead the company into the digital age. The company currently operates 18 theatre locations with 210 screens across 7 states. In October 2014, Liberty, MO-based chain B&B; Theatres purchased Dickinson. All of Dickinson's locations are expected to be re-branded under the B&B; name.

Clagett William Horace Clagett (September 21, 1838 - August 3, 1901) was a nineteenth-century politician and lawyer from various places in the United States. He was the uncle of Samuel B. Pettengill. Born in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, Clagett moved to Keokuk, Iowa with his father in 1850 where he attended the public schools as a child. He studied law in Keokuk and at a law school in Albany, New York and was admitted to the bar in 1858, commencing practice in Keokuk.

Leipzig, 1901 He was taught within the Bach tradition of Silesia. On his first concert tour in Germany he met the organist Christian Heinrich Rinck, with whom he returned to study for six months in 1828-1829: Rinck was a student of Johann Christian Kittel, who in turn was a student of Johann Sebastian Bach. In 1831, he became the principal organist at the Bernhardinerkirche in Breslau.Riemann, Hugo: Geschichte der Musik seit Beethoven, p.657. Leipzig, 1901 Considered one of the most important organists in Germany, his virtuosic playing and agile pedalwork dazzled audiences in Paris, where he played an all-Bach programme—a novelty in France—for the inauguration of the organ at Saint-Eustache in 1844; and in London, where he played at Crystal Palace during the Great Exhibition of 1851. Back in Breslau, he conducted the symphonic concerts of the city's Opera Orchestra. One of Hesse's pupils was the Belgian organist Jacques-Nicolas Lemmens, who would later teach Alexandre Guilmant and Charles-Marie Widor. Works Organ Dates of publication with publisher where known.

Суркис Григорий Михайлович, Информационно-аналитический центр \\"ЛІГА\\"  Criminal investigations  On March 19, 2019 a criminal proceeding №12018110200001859 against former president of the Football Fedration of Ukraine Hryhorii Surkis has been registered in the Single pre-trial investigations register. He is suspected of misappropriation, embezzlement or conversion or property by malversation in especially gross amount, or by an organized group, i.e. Article 191, p.5 of the Criminal code of Ukraine. The criminal proceeding also concerns building of an educational and training base for national teams in the village of Horenychi near Kyiv. In 2003 former president of the FFU Hruhorii Surkis along with FFU vice-president Oleksandr Bandurko announced the beginning of construction works at the new sports base site. An arena and 10 fully equipped football fields should have been built at the area of 40 hectares. The money to finance construction was collected from Ukrainian clubs, which were receiving the “solidarity payments” from the UEFA starting from season 2000/2001 till season 2003/2004. UAH 12 million (EUR 2 million according to 2003 currency exchange rate) have been allocated to finance the construction works in Horenychi. The sports base hasn’t been built.  Corruption scandals  In November 2019 the Ukrainian association of football has addressed the State Bureau of Investigations, Prosecutor General’s Office and the Interior Ministry with an appeal claiming that former FFU president Hruhorii Surkis has committed a EUR 380 million criminal offence. The UAF explains its actions with an investigation by German “Der Spiegel” titled “How did the UEFA payments happen to get to British Virgin Islands” and the results of the internal probe. According to “Der Spiegel”, starting from 1999, for more than 15 years the UEFA has been transferring money (EUR 380 million in total) to a Newport Management Limited offshore company. This money has been assigned for the Football Federation of Ukraine (now Ukrainian Association of Football) and the development of Ukrainian football. The company is registered at British Virgin Island and, according to “Der Spiegel’s” investigation, is controlled by Hryhorii Surkis, who’s been chairing the FFU since 2000 till year 2012. Besides, for more than 10 years – till February, 2019 – he’s been a member of the UEFA Executive committee. Police and the Attorney General's Office are investigating the appropriation of UEFA funds received by the Football Federation of Ukraine under the chairmanship of Grigory Surkis for the offshore intermediary company Newport Management Ltd. This is stated in the resolutions of the Holosiivskyi District Court of Kyiv on January 21. Hryhoriy Surkis was suspected of financially motivating members of the \\"football\\" temporary investigative commission of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, which is investigating the construction of football fields. Even called a specific amount - 1 million UAH.  FootballLeaks-2  German journalists from “Der Spiegel” Rafael Buschmann and Michael Wulzinger published a book titled “Football Leaks – 2” A separate part titled “Ukrainische Bruderschaft” (Ukrainian Brotherhood) describes brothers’ Ihor and Hryhorii Surkis activities in football sphere and their relation to the “Newport” offshore. All FC “Dynamo’s” activities are financed by this company. The authors refer to Football Leaks’ documents. The book tells that starting from 1993 all the financial activities of Kyiv-based FC “Dynamo” have been performed via the company ‘Newport”, controlled by the current club’s boss Ihor Surkis. Having cited the FIFA data, the authors noted that in 2011-2017 the “Newport” has spent USD 324 million to buy 82 players for FC “Dynamo”. The taxes from this sum haven’t been paid in Ukraine.  Crime in Kyiv  On December 18, 2019 the German \\"Kicker\\" has published an article \\"Crime in Kyiv\\", telling how the money allocated by the UEFA for Ukrainian football got to the offshore company, controlled by Surkis brothers.  Fur coats for the referee  In 1995, the Surkis brothers tried to bribe the Spanish Champions League referee Antonio Lopez Nieto before the Dynamo - Panathinaikos match. They offered two mink coats and $30 thousand. For the actions of Surkis, Dynamo was removed from the Champions League and was disqualified for a year.

CoDA held its first National Service Conference the next year with 29 representatives from seven states. CoDA has stabilized at about a thousand meetings in the US, and with meetings active in 60 other countries and several online.

Later research found scores from people completing the Co-Dependents Anonymous Checklist and the Spann-Fischer Codependency Scale were strongly correlated. The checklist cited by Whitfield has subsequently developed into The Patterns and Characteristics of Codependence. At the 2010 CoDA Service Conference (CSC), this list went from 22 items in four Patterns termed Denial, Low Self-Esteem, Compliance and Control, to 55 items divided into the same groups with the addition of Avoidance Patterns.

During the war, the ship operated primarily in New Guinea waters. After war service, the corvette was placed in reserve, but she was recommissioned in 1951 as a training vessel, and was repeatedly moved into and out of reserve. Wagga was decommissioned in 1960, making her the last of the Australian-operated corvettes. Design and construction In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.Stevens, The Australian Corvettes, p. 1Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 103 The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103–4 The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103–5 Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 104 The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the \\"Australian Minesweepers\\" (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as \\"corvettes\\") approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including Wagga) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 105, 148Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 29Stevens et al., The Royal Australian Navy, p. 108 Wagga was laid down by Morts Dock & Engineering Co in Sydney, New South Wales on 8 March 1942. She was launched on 25 July 1942 by Mrs H. E. Gissing, the wife of the mayor of Wagga Wagga, and commissioned into the RAN on 18 December 1942. Operational history World War II Wagga entered service in January 1943, escorting convoys along the eastern Australian coast. Her area of operations extended into New Guinea in March, before the corvette operated in support of Operation Lilliput until June 1943. During the operation, on 14 April 1943, Wagga and several British and Dutch ships were attacked by over 100 Japanese aircraft. Wagga was not damaged, although several other ships were set on fire. Following Lilliput, she returned to convoy duties until the end of 1943. Wagga visited Williamstown, Victoria for refits over December 1943 and January 1944, before spending the rest of the war operating in New Guinea. Wagga fulfilled many roles in this time; escorting convoys, performing anti-submarine patrols, transporting troops and supplies, and bombarding enemy land positions in support of Allied troops. At the conclusion of World War II, Wagga sailed for Hong Kong, arriving on 29 August 1945. She remained there until October 1945, conducting mine sweeping and anti-piracy patrols. The corvette returned to Melbourne on 7 November, and was decommissioned into reserve on 28 November. The corvette's wartime service was recognised with the battle honours \\"Pacific 1943–45\\" and \\"New Guinea 1943–44\\". Training ship The ship was reactivated and recommissioned as a training ship on 12 December 1951. As well as training reservists and National Service trainees, Wagga was called on to tow the cruiser HMAS Hobart to Newcastle in August 1952, perform patrols of New Guinea in 1954 and 1956, and assist in oceanographic surveys. Wagga underwent several refits and modernisations, and was decommissioned and recommissioned at least six times, on one occasion being in commission for only 11 days. Fate Wagga decommissioned for the final time on 28 October 1960, after travelling . She was the last of the Bathurst class to leave Australian service. The corvette was sold to the South Australia Carrying Company for scrapping in March 1962. The White Ensign flown from Wagga was presented to the mayor of Wagga Wagga on 23 April 2011, during the final reunion for the ship's company. The flag is to be preserved and placed on display in the city's Civic Centre.

History Colonial Militia The Maryland National Guard traces its roots through the long-time previous colonial and state militia to March 1634, with the landing of two English militia captains from the two settlement expeditionary ships, the \\"Ark\\" and the \\"Dove\\" off the north shore of the Potomac River near the confluence with Chesapeake Bay at the first provincial capital, St. Mary's City in later St. Mary's County. It has a long and illustrious history. American Revolutionary War During the American Revolution, members of the \\"Maryland Line\\" repeatedly charged a vastly superior British force at the Battle of Long Island, buying time for the Continental Army to escape. It is from this incident that Maryland draws one of its official nicknames, \\"The Old Line State.\\" This was the first time the American Army had used the bayonet in combat. Later in the war, the Maryland militia made a number of additional bayonet charges, including at Cowpens, where their charge turned impending defeat into victory, and at Guilford Courthouse, where they forced the elite British Foot Guards to retreat. War of 1812 During the War of 1812, the Maryland militia held the line at the Battle of North Point in 1814, commanded by Brigadier General John Stricker. There, they held up the British attack for two hours, long enough for the defense of Baltimore to be shored up. The British forces, many of whom were veterans of the Napoleonic Wars took around 300 casualties and, though the Americans retreated from the field at North Point, the British would eventually turn back rather than attempt an assault on the American defenses at Baltimore.* Article on the Maryland Militia at the Battle of North Point, at the National Guard website Not all the militia regiments performed with equal distinction. The 51st, and some members of 39th, broke and ran under fire. However, the 5th and 27th held their ground and were able to retreat in good order having inflicted significant casualties on the advancing enemy.George, Christopher.

Steuart's son commanded one of the Baltimore city militias during the disturbances of April 1861, following which Federal troops occupied the city. In a letter to his father, the younger Steuart wrote: :\\"I found nothing but disgust in my observations along the route and in the place I came to - a large majority of the population are insane on the one idea of loyalty to the Union and the legislature is so diminished and unreliable that I rejoiced to hear that they intended to adjourn...it seems that we are doomed to be trodden on by these troops who have taken military possession of our State, and seem determined to commit all the outrages of an invading army.\\"Mitchell, Charles W., p.102, Maryland Voices of the Civil War.

Steuart moved south for the duration of the American Civil War, and much of the general's property was confiscated by the Federal Government as a consequence. Old Steuart Hall was confiscated by the Union Army and Jarvis Hospital was erected on the estate, to care for Federal wounded.Nelker, p.120 However, many members of the newly formed Maryland Line in the Confederate army would be drawn from the state militia.Goldsborough, p.9 Maryland militia units fought on both sides of the Civil War. At the Battle of Front Royal, the Union 1st Maryland was engaged and defeated by the Confederate 1st Maryland. The lineage of the Confederate 1st Maryland is perpetuated by the 175th Infantry Regiment, whose lineage dates back to 1774. Great Railroad Strike of 1877 Troops of the 6th Regiment fighting their way through Baltimore, Maryland, 20 July 1877 During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, on July 20 Governor Carroll called up the 5th and 6th Regiments from Baltimore to stop strikers in Cumberland from disrupting rail service. While marching from their armories to a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad train at Camden Station, an armed mob attacked the troops. The 6th Regiment fired on the mob, killing 10 and wounding 25, and several members of both regiments were injured by stones and bricks. The troops were then besieged by 15,000 rioters inside Camden Yards until the arrival of federal troops in Baltimore. The building, now part of Camden Yards baseball stadium, still bears bullet holes from rioters firing at troops inside.  Mexican Border raids of 1916  In response to Pancho Villa’s cross-border raids, the Maryland National Guard was called up in 1916 and deployed for seven months to the town of Eagle Pass, Texas, on the Mexican border. World War I During the First World War, most Maryland National Guard troops served as part of the 29th Division, and their campaign credits include Meuse-Argonne. In addition, the 1st Separate Company, an all-black unit, served as part of the 372nd Infantry Regiment, although ostensibly assigned to the 93rd Division, actually fought under French control. One of the Maryland National Guard's longest-mobilized units during the war was the 117th Trench Mortar Battery, which served under the 42nd Division from October 1917 until the end of the war. It was the first Maryland unit to see combat, and participated in all of the AEF's major battles during that period. World War II World War II also saw the mobilization of the Maryland National Guard. Again, most were assigned to the 29th Infantry Division, where they took part in the D-Day landings and fought their way across France and Germany. In 1945, they missed being the first unit to link up with the Soviet Red Army on the Elbe River by a matter of hours. Korean War The Maryland National Guard had very few troops mobilized for the Korean War, but those that were played an important role. The 231st Transportation Truck Battalion was the first National Guard unit to land in Korea, and were immediately put to use keeping supplies flowing within the Pusan Perimeter. Originally a segregated, all-black unit, the 231st was integrated during this service in Korea, only to be again segregated when it returned to state status.  Cold War  Although no Maryland Army National Guard units served in South Vietnam, the Maryland Army Guard played a significant role during the Cold War. Across the state, Nike missile batteries, armed with nuclear warheads, were manned by Maryland National Guardsmen to defend the National Capital area from Soviet bombers from the mid-1950s until the early 1970s. Maryland National Guard troops were also kept busy with riot-control duty in the 1960s and early 1970s, most notably during the Baltimore Riots of 1968, the Salisbury riots of May, 1968, the University of Maryland student riots of 1970-72, and the Cambridge Riots of 1963 and 1967. Persian Gulf War  200th and 290th Military Police Companies and 1229th transportation co November 1990 - April 1991 - deployed to Saudi Arabi near the Iraq border in support of Operations Desert Shield/Storm. Global War on Terrorism Since the September 11 attacks, the Maryland Army National Guard has mobilized a number of units, including the 58th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, for service in Iraq; Afghanistan; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and Kosovo. Guardsmen from the 115th Military Police Battalion were among the first and most heavily called upon, having arrived at the Pentagon on September 12 and subsequently served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay. Maryland elements of the Combat Aviation Brigade, 29th Infantry Division served in Iraq, Maryland elements of the Combat Aviation Brigade, 42nd Infantry Division served in Afghanistan, and Maryland National Guard elements were attached to 44th Medical Brigade/XVIII Airborne Corps for service in Iraq. Maryland is also home to several Special Operations units, most notably Company B, 2nd Battalion, 20th Special Forces Group (Airborne) and Special Operations Detachment, Joint Forces. Members of these units have both been mobilized to serve in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Currently, the Special Operations Detachment, Joint Forces was selected and mobilized to create the Special Operations Command for the newly created United States Africa Command.

He was known for his cutting critique of authoritarianism and for his humorous depiction of Chilean popular culture, from a queer perspective. He was nominated for Chile's National Literature Prize in 2014. He died of cancer of the larynx on 23 January 2015 in Santiago, Chile.A Surreal End for an Unforgettable Queen: Pedro Lemebel, 1952-2015 Life Early career Lemebel was born in El Zanjón de la Aguada, a poor neighborhood in Santiago on the banks of Zanjón de la Aguada, an irrigation canal that flows into the Mapocho river; to the family of Pedro Mardones Paredes and Violeta Lemebel. In the late 1980s, he chose to be identified by his mother's surname, Lemebel, as his choice for surname instead of his father's (Mardones), as is the norm in most Latin American countries. He attended an industrial school of carpentry and metal forging at the Industrial de Hombres de La Legua High School and later studied plastic art at University of Chile's Art School. He subsequently became a high school art teacher but was let go based on the presumption of his homosexuality. Lemebel attended writing workshops to hone his skills and network with other writers, his first writing recognition was in 1982, when he won an award for his short story, Porque el tiempo está cerca. In 1986, he published as his first major work, the book Incontables, a compilation of short stories under the feminist publication label, Ergo Sum. A year later, he co-founded a performance collective that used the tactics of intervention and disruption of events to raise public consciousness about the struggles of minorities in Chile. The disruption and performances of the collective brought Lemebel into public limelight in Chile. In 1986, he disrupted a meeting of Chile's left wing groups opposed to Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. He entered the meeting in high heels and with makeup on his face depicting an hammer and sickle extending from his mouth to his left eyebrow. At the event, he spoke about his manifesto, ‘Manifest: I Speak for my Difference’ criticizing homophobia in left wing politics. Lemebel was widely known as a communist. Being distant from the Communist Party, he was a close friend of its leader, Gladys Marín, until her death in 2005. Yeguas del Apocalipsis In 1987, Lemebel co-founded a group with Francisco Casas, poet, artist and student of literature. The duo called the group \\"The Mares of the Apocalypse,\\"or \\"Yeguas del Apocalipsis,\\" a reference to the biblical \\"Horsemen of the Apocalypse\\" that appear in the New Testament. This performing duo made appearances sabotaging book launches, art expositions and even political discussions. Their appearances were usually surprising, provocative and demonstrated an aspect of counter culture. Around this time he decided to abandon his paternal last name, Mardones, and begin using that of his mother, Lemebel. In an interview the writer would explain his choice of name change as the following, \\"Lemebel is a gesture of femininity, to engrave a maternal last name, to acknowledge my (washer) mother in light of the illegality of homosexual(s) and transvestite(s).\\" The first intervention/performance of \\"The Mares of the Apocalypse\\" was the afternoon of October 22, 1988, during the second installment of the Pablo Neruda prize to poet Raúl Zurita in La Chascona. In the middle of the ceremony, Lemebel and Casas appeared offering Zurita a crown of thorns that the poet did not accept. In 1989, both Lemebel and Casas recreated a series of vignettes under the direction of Mario Vivado. The portraits later became part of an exhibition at the D12 Gallery in Chile.Subero. P. 48 Casas and Lemebel posed as Buster Keaton, Marilyn Monroe, the sisters from Garcia Lorca's La Casa de Bernarda Alba and other icons of the Chilean gay community. In the 1990s, Lemebel returned to writing and published a string of urban chronicles. The next year they appeared in the Cariola theater during a meeting of intellectuals with presidential candidate Patricio Aylwin, whom the following year would be elected the first president of Chile after the restoration of democracy and the end of the dictatorship. Although uninvited, Lemebel and Casas arrived wearing heels and feathers bearing a sign that said \\"Homosexuals for change.\\" In addition to that, Casas rushed over to, at the time candidate for senator and future Chilean president, Ricardo Lagos and kissed him on the mouth. A photograph of this event was included years later in his book Háblame de Amores(2012). Both writers often turned into agents of their own text and created an interpretation from homosexual reality and an interruption of institutional discussions during the age of the dictator. Their work crossed over into performances, transvestism, photography, video and various art installations. With these they would advocate for a place for memory, human rights and sexuality in democratic talks. \\"Maybe the first experiment with plastic, the action of art...was decisive in the move from story to chronicle. It's possible that this corporal exposition in a religious frame was evaporating the generic form of the story...the timeless story to make for oneself and urgent chronicle...\\" explained Lemebel. In 1994, Lemebel participated in the stonewall festival in New York, an LGBT pride festival. In between 1987 and 1995, \\"The Mares of the Apocalypse\\" carried out at lease fifteen public interventions and in total no more than twenty. The majority of these events were in Santiago but some were also in Concepción, Chile. Some of their public demonstrations included dancing the Cueca on broken glass, dressing up as Frida Kahlo and they even dressed up as Lady Godiva and rode around naked on white horses for the art department at the university of Chile. In 1995, Lemebel published (in addition to his first book titled La Esquina es mi corazón) his first collection of Chronicles some of which had their first appearances in newspapers and magazines titled \\"Página Abierta,\\" \\"Punto Final,\\" and \\"La Nación.\\" In these chronicles Lemebel referenced the many marginalized setting of Santiago which he linked to themes of homosexuality, prostitution and poverty, some of which were taboo to talk about at the time. The following year he created the program \\"Cancionero\\" for the radio show \\"Radio Tierra.\\" In this program he would read his chronicles accompanied by sounds or even music. That same year he published \\"Loco afán: Crónicas de si dario,\\" his second book of chronicles that spoke about themes like AIDS and the marginalization of transvestites. In 1997, in some of their final appearances \\"The Mares of the Apocalypse\\" were invited to Bienal de la Habana, in Habana Cuba. In 1998 he published his third book of chronicles titled \\"De Perlas y Cicatrizes\\" which was composed mostly of the stories he told on the radio program. After the arrest of Augusto Pinochet in a London hospital, he created \\"The Clinic\\" whose editor Patricio Ferrández he asked to leave everything in it uncensored. Urban chronicles and other writings right Earlier in his career, Lemebel had attended workshops of the Society of Chilean Writers and gained the friendship of some feminist writers such as Pia Barros who later helped published his first book, Incontables. He returned to writing in the 1990s starting with series of urban chronicles that was published in Chilean newspapers, magazines and read on the radio. In 1995 and 1996, Lemebel wrote two books in a chronicle and hybrid literary style, a combination of reportage, memoir, public address, fiction and socio-political historical analysis. In 1995, he published La Esquina es mi corazón: Crónica urbana (The Corner is My Heart), writing about Chilean history from the perspectives of young adults raised in poor neighborhoods and those who are stigmatized socially. In 1996, he published El Loco Afán: Crónicas de Sidario (Mad Urge: AIDS Chronicles), a piece of 31 short texts and images that detailed the journey of a group of marginalized gay youths in Chile through the period of dictatorship to the outbreak of AIDS. Lemebel was given a Guggenheim Foundation scholarship in 1999 for his literary accomplishments leading to increase appearances in forums and seminars in Chile and US. He gained international recognition with his novel Tengo miedo torero which was the first book translated into English. In 2013, he was given the José Donoso Award. He died of laryngeal cancer in January 2015. International Recognition In 1999, thanks to the influences of his friend, Chilean writer Roberto Bolaño, who had immigrated to Europe from Mexico in 1977 and has since lived in Spain, his book Loco Afán: Crónicas de Sidario was published for the editorial \\"Barcelonesa Anagrama,\\" becoming his first work in the foreigner. Since then, his written work began to attract the interest in various universities and international educational institutions. That same year he also participated in Festival of Guadalajara, Mexico, in replacement of Bolaño who had rejected the offer, and accepted praise for his work of the famous write Carlos Monsiváis. In 2001 he published his first novel Tengo Miedo Torero a difficult story of contextualized love during the attempt on the life of Augusto Pinochet (September 7, 1986). For the presentation of the book, Lemebel arrived in a red dress with a feathered headdress, at a ceremony with many people that was public with politicians, filmmakers, journalists and a few writers. The book would later gain international recognition after being translated into English by Katherine Silver, then French and Italian. In 2003 he continued his work as a journalist, publishing his anthology of Chronicles Zanjón de la Aguada, that spoke of the gay community in neighborhoods of distinctive social classes in Santiago and where appeared some real people like the social leader and president of the Agrupación de Familiares de Detenidos Desaparecidos (AFDD) Sola Sierra. This work was followed a year later by Adios Mariquita Linda, another anthology of chronicles that maintained the same tendencies of his previous works. In 2008 his sixth book of chronicles appeared, titled Serenata Carfiola. In November 29, 2012, Lemebel participated in the \\"Feria del Libro de Guadalajara,\\" publishing his new book of chronicles, titled Háblame de amores, showing a dramatization of his work \\"Susurrucucu Paloma.\\" In September 4, 2013, Lemebel was awarded the \\"Premio José Donoso,\\" which he dedicated to his mother, the deceased Gladys Marín, and his readers belonging to the working class.

(translated as My tender Matador for the film based on his homonymous novel) Unedited Works and Posthumous Publications In an interview in 2013, during the publication of the anthology Poco Hombre , Pedro Lemebel announced he was working on two literary projects that would soon see the light and then, after his death, they were truncated: one of them is Mi Amiga Gladys, a book of chronicles about Gladys Marín, leader and representative of the Communist Party of Chile and was deceased in 2005. Josephina Alemparte, editor of Seal Planet, declared that the book was going to be presented in the book fair of Santiago but for health reasons this was postponed. Finally, the Planet editorial published the book the second of November in the year 2016. At the end of the same month they published Arder, a book that is compiled of images of the homonymous exposure and that extensively gathered his audio visual work. Likewise he also announced the publication of a box set of all his books since La Esquina es mi corazón(1995) and until Háblame de Armores(2012) (possibly including Mi Amiga Gladys(2016) and a documentary addressed to Joanna Reposi, that contains seven years of records. Another book that was found was titled El Éxtesis de Delinquir, that would be his second book since Tengo Miedo Torero (2001). This work centers in the history of Patricio Egaña, who provided drugs to Claudio Spiniak. Since the year 2011 he began to mention in interviews that he was writing a new novel intended for release in 2016 or 2017 to be published by the Planet editorial.

With a poetic prose that is at the same time self-deprecating, consequential, refers to an \\"other\\", irreverent, over elaborate and corny, he mixes reality with fiction, which he uses to denounce the \\"silicone\\" parts of his works. His works are usually tragic-comedies and aggressive, in constant rejection of right wing politics and the Chilean upper class. Mexican writer Carlos Monsiváis associates his aesthetic criticisms with those of Néstor Perlongher, Joaquín Hurtado and to a lesser extent with Reinaldo Arenas, Severo Sarduy and Manuel Puig; with the first three, for their \\"vindicating anger\\", with Sarduy for his \\"radical experimentation\\" and with Puig for his \\"witty incorporation and victory of proscribed sensitivity.\\" For Monsiváis, Lemebel and all these authors, homosexuality is not an artistic identity so much as a literary attitude. Perlongher too shares a style of baroque or over elaborate writing, but Lemebel does not look to confuse anyone. In his related Chronicles about AIDS, he employs a modernist and postmodernist view that is similar to Julián del Casal, Amado Nervo and Enrique Gómez Carrillo. Death Pedro Lemebel died on January 23, 2015 in Santiago, Chile of laryngeal cancer. Once the news went around of his death, countless newspapers paid tribute and condolences. He was well-known and recognized for his extravagant personality and for referring to himself as a \\"queen.\\" Hundreds of people from all walks of life attended his funeral service, from celebrities to politicians. His extensive efforts in breaking the norm through his unique self-expression in his written works and activism have left a lasting impact on society and are part of his legacy. His remains are buried in the Metropolitan Cemetery of Santiago. Influence and Legacy Pedro Lemebel is well known for his influence in the fight for homosexual rights, his work as a writer, and his strong political side. Lemebel was much more than a writer; he was a free man, an artist, a political and popular icon, but more than anything a rebel and a voice for the homosexual community. Lemebel was born as Pedro Mardones Lemebel, but when he decided to take the last name of his mother, was the first big political decision that reaffirmed his commitment towards his homosexual side, a side that was later incorporated into his literary works. Lemebel was able to envisage a hidden reality of homosexuals; he was able to unmask the violence of which homosexuals were victims in Chile. The importance of Pedro Lemebel is not only value for his talent as a writer, but also as a person full of defiance in a conservative and machista country. Óscar Contardo describes Lemebel as a “popular figure: a figure that is supposed to be disgusted in our society, which is the \\"loca\\" (queen), he managed to make that figure as the center, and then transform it into a popular icon.\\" Although Lemebel was never a formal militant, he was a follower of PC (partido comunista/Communist party). Until his death, Lemebel work in his book that revealed his friendship with the deceased Gladys Marin, titled \\"Mi querida Gladys.\\" Daniel Alcaíno, friend of Lemebel, believes that beyond politics, Lemebel's legacy was other. “Beyond the left wing and politics, he was an institution. Pedro was heavily connected with the color red, but not with the red of the political party, but with the red of blood. Blood of the humble and simple people. That is what he is remember for.” He was profiled in the 2019 documentary film Lemebel, by filmmaker Joanna Reposi Garibaldi.Paul O'Callaghan, \\"Berlinale 2019: A Dog Called Money, Lemebel, & Searching Eva\\".

According to the hypothesis, because of the rotation of the earth, erosion occurs mostly on the right banks of rivers in the Northern Hemisphere, and in the Southern Hemisphere on the left banks. The concept was originally introduced by a French physicist Jacques Babinet in 1859 using mathematical deduction and Coriolis force. A more definitive explanation was given by an Estonian scientist Karl Ernst von Baer in 1860. Although it is possible that an aggregate measurement of all rivers would lead to a correlation with the Baer–Babinet law, the Coriolis force is orders of magnitude weaker than the local forces on the river channel from its flow. Therefore, this is unlikely to be important in any given river. Albert Einstein wrote a paper in 1926 explaining the true causes of the phenomenon (see tea leaf paradox).

Miller School of Medicine in Miami, Florida. It currently has around 1,550 licensed beds. It is located in the Miami neighborhood of the Civic Center and is owned and operated by Miami-Dade County through the Public Health Trust, and is supported by Miami-Dade County residents through a half-cent sales tax. In fiscal 2014 the Public Health Trust received $364,431 million in unrestricted funds from Miami-Dade County. In 2013 Miami-Dade voters approved a separate $830 million bonds program for major upgrades to the facility. Jackson Memorial Hospital is directly served by the Metrorail rapid transit system at the Civic Center Station. Located in the Civic Center, in the Northwest quadrant of the intersection of I-95 and SR 836, the hospital is the center of a thriving medical center that includes the Miami VA Medical Center, the University of Miami Hospital (formerly Cedars of Lebanon Medical Center), and the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, with its numerous research affiliates and laboratories - including the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, the UM/Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute and Anne Bates Leach Eye Hospital, the Diabetes Research Foundation and the National Parkinson Foundation. The Miami- Dade Justice Center and Miami-Dade County Jail are also within a few blocks of the hospital. It is readily accessible via the Civic Center Station of the Miami Metrorail. Jackson Memorial Hospital's Miami Transplant Institute is the largest transplant center in the United States, performing more transplants in 2019 than any US center has ever performed in a single year. It is the only hospital in Florida to perform every kind of organ transplant for both adult and pediatric patients, It is among the world's largest hospitals; it is the third-largest public hospital and third-largest teaching hospital in the United States. With more than 1,550 beds, it is a referral center, a magnet for research and home to the Ryder Trauma Center - the only Level 1 Adult and Pediatric trauma center in Miami-Dade. Jackson Memorial is the centerpiece of the Jackson Health System, operated by the Miami-Dade County Public Health Trust. Rankings and awards In 2015 Jackson Memorial Hospital received one star out of a possible best of five stars according to the Medicare.Gov Hospital Compare survey. In 2007, four University of Miami specialties Jackson Memorial Hospital were ranked among the best in the country by U.S. News & World Report. The University of Miami Bascom Palmer Eye Institute was ranked as the best Ophthalmologic center in the U.S. Jackson Memorial's Ear, Nose and Throat was ranked 17th, while the digestive disorders and kidney disease programs were ranked 32nd. JMH is home to Holtz Children's Hospital, which has 254 licensed beds and cares for children—newborn to 21 years old—with everything from common ailments to multi-organ transplants. Holtz was ranked among the top hospitals in treating child kidney disorders. The UM/Jackson Memorial Burn Center is a regional referral center. Denial of partner access In 2007, Jackson denied a lesbian, Janice Langbehn, access to her partner of 17 years as she was dying of an aneurysm. Langbehn also claimed that Jackson refused to take medical information about her partner from Langbehn, and ignored a power of attorney sent via fax to the hospital's trauma center. A lawsuit was filed against the hospital as a result. Jackson stated that, \\"it has no obligation to allow their patients' visitors nor any obligation whatsoever to their patients’ families, healthcare surrogates, and visitors.\\" The presiding judge, Adalberto Jordan, dismissed the case, stating that Langbehn had no relief under Florida law. Jordan found that Langbehn had not been \\"denied the right to make any medical decision on behalf of\\" her partner. Two days after Jackson's announcement, in part as a result of Langbehn's story, President Barack Obama issued a memorandum ordering hospitals receiving Medicare and Medicaid funding to allow patients to decide who can visit them and prohibit discrimination, including sexual orientation and gender identity. President Obama also called Ms. Langbehn on the same day, expressing his sorrow for the events. The rule went into effect in January 2011. According to Langbehn, the hospital has not apologized for the denial of visitation.

Its larvae develop in hazel nuts Corylus avellana, being a serious pest in hazelnut orchards. It occurs in most of Europe, from south Sweden, Finland and Great Britain to the Mediterranean. Description This weevil ranges from 6 to 8.5 mm. http://www.kerbtier.de/ The female's snout is as long as the rest of the body, with a reddish end. The male snout is about 1/3 shorter. The body cover is usually light brown, similar to the colour of mature hazelnuts. This species is often confused with another commonly occurring weevil of the same genera – the gland weevil, Curculio glandium, which lives on oaks. Despite overall similarity, the weevils differ in some morphological details. Curculio nucum has broader segments of flagellum and the segments are covered with semi-erect hairs which in C. glandium are adpressed. http://coleoptera.ksib.pl/search.php?l=en http://www.colpolon.biol.uni.wroc.pl/curculio%20nucum.htm left Curculio glandium is considered as closely related to C. nucum and as C. undulatus, all of which are grouped together in the \\"glandium clade\\". C. cameliae from Japan is also related to this group. Other similar species in Europe that live on oaks, such as Curculio pellitus, C. venosus and C. elephas are gathered in the \\"elephas clade\\". Species in the elephas clade have convex elytra and a dense vestiture hiding the line of the first ventral segment, whereas the glandium clade weevils have flattened elytra and the first ventral segment clearly visible through the sparse scales. Tribe Curculionini differes from other weevils, and from other Coleoptera, by the unique cone-shaped mandibles that move vertically instead of horizontally.LeConte, J.L. & Horn, G.H. 1876. The Rhynchophora of America, North of Mexico. Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society,15: i-xvi, 1-455 Life cycle Development takes place mostly within a two-year life cycle. Adult beetles emerge in the spring from the soil where they have been overwintering as adult. They feed on hazel buds and leaves. The adults can be found from May to the end of August. Females oviposit within maturing hazelnuts, laying a single, yolk-rich egg per nut, around the end of July/beginning of August. One female can lay up to 20-30 eggs. One week after egg deposition the larvae hatch, and start to feed inside a nut. They spend around one month there, eating most of the nut content. By the end of the summer, mature larvae leave the nuts by round holes then burrow into the ground where they build individual cells. After overwintering, most larvae diapause for the whole season and undergo metamorphosis in the next summer. Newly formed adults then mainly overwinter in their pupal cases before emerging in the spring of the following year. Adult females are reproductively immature at emergence and ovarian development is only attained from 1 to 2 months later, after the feeding period. Small numbers of individuals delay metamorphosis spending more than one winter in the soil. This alternative life story of individuals overwintering more than once may confer additional benefits over a single-year life cycle, such as surviving bad conditions (like lack of host objects). On the other hand, it may increase exposure to predators. Moreover, adult overwintering diapause could be energetically more costly than larval diapause, but could in turn allow adults to be better synchronized with their host plants. M. C. Bel-Venner et all. 2008. Ecophysiological attributes of adult overwintering in insects: insights from a field study of the nut weevil, Curculio nucum. Physiological Entomology Infestation and control Inside an infested nut, a cream/white larva with a brown head surrounded by excrement may be found. A hole in a nut shell is a sign that the larvae has already finished feeding, and left the nut, substantially eaten out. Basic control of this weevil is spraying the orchards with insecticides (containing for example methomyl, thiaclopride, deltamethrine). However, countries producing the greatest crop of nuts, such as Turkey, Italy, France and Spain, are working on alternative methods of control. Some research suggests that it may be possible to use entomopathogenic nematodes such as Heterorhabditis indica. A. Peters. Control of the hazel nut weevil Curculio nucum with entomopathogenic nematodes. This nematode is deadly to full-grown larvae that inhabit the soil under the tree canopy. The fungus Beauveria bassiana may also be helpful as a control agent. Research in Italy proved that this fungus, if applied into the soil well, kills almost all the larvae. This fungus should be applied when the larvae start to burrow into the soil. B. Paparatti , S. Speranza. Biological Control of Hazelnut Weevil (Curculio nucum L., Coleoptera, Curculionidae) Using the Entomopathogenic Fungus Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuill. (Deuteromycotina, Hyphomycetes). VI International Congress on Hazelnut 686, 2004 - actahort.org According to some investigations, shell thickness is not correlated with the level of weevil damage, but nuts whose shells harden rapidly may be resistant to weevil attack to some extent.

Started in the mid-2000s, the band's name was initially just a pseudonym for its leader and main songwriter, Justin Remer. After 2005, Elastic No-No Band's line-up also included pianist Herb Scher and multi- instrumentalist Preston Spurlock. In 2005 and 2006, the band would perform sporadically with Clint Scheibner, who would play a bass drum attached to his chest, as though he were in a marching band. In 2007, the band added drummer Doug Johnson (who plays a standard drum kit) as a regular member. During the recording sessions for the band's 2010 album, Fustercluck!!!, electric guitarist John Mulcahy was also added. Remer did a solo US tour as Elastic No- No Band during spring of 2008.  Film Music  Remer initially used the name Elastic No-No Band as a personal pseudonym when he wrote and performed songs and film scores for some of his short films. These films include In Defense of Lemmings (2004) and Loved and/or Laid (2006). Remer also contributed songs to the Troma films Tales from the Crapper (2004) and Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead (2007) as Elastic No-No Band.  Lo-fi/home recordings  While he was studying film at New York University, Remer used the facilities intended for recording voice-over for film projects to create four lo-fi solo albums. These albums were Songs from a Poorly-Soundproofed Room (2004) (the title is a parody of Leonard Cohen's Songs from a Room), More Songs About Cowboys and Moisture (2004) (the title is a parody of Talking Heads' More Songs About Buildings and Food), an album of Elvis Costello covers called Every Elvis Has His Army: ENB Does EC (2005), and (Previously Otherwise) Uncollected Songs (2005). These albums were initially distributed using the CD-R format, then were made available as a free music download from Elastic No-No Band's website. When the website was shut down at the end of 2011, Remer compiled the website tracks into a two-volume compilation, collectively titled Not Like Most Folkies. Remer began performing at the Anti-hootenanny open mic run by Lach at the Sidewalk Cafe (the center of New York's East Village anti- folk scene). This is where he met Scher, Spurlock, and Scheibner. The men performed shows together and made home recordings of some of their rehearsals. Five of these rehearsal recordings, featuring the trio of Remer, Scher, and Spurlock are featured on Elastic No-No Band's first official CD release, The Very Best of Elastic No-No Band So Far (2006). Scheibner is credited on the release with \\"silent drumming.\\" The remainder of the CD consists of songs from the four CD-R albums Remer recorded alone and a newer solo recording titled \\"Run-DMC.\\" In 2007, the band issued No-No's (Leftovers and Live Songs), which consists of previously unreleased material, live performances, and previously issued one-off recordings from compilations. According to Remer, the songs are called \\"leftovers\\" instead of \\"B-sides\\" or \\"rarities\\" because they're no rarer than any of the band's other songs. This CD includes the first recorded live performances with the band's second drummer, Doug Johnson.  My 3 Addictions  This new quartet line-up created Elastic No-No Band's first studio album, titled My 3 Addictions. It was produced by Major Matt Mason USA. It was released on October 16, 2007. Justin Remer set up a blog in advance of the album's release called \\"My 3 Addictions: An interactive album\\". Starting September 3, 2007, Remer posted a new entry every other day, including an audio stream of one of the album's songs. Since September 23, 2007, all eleven songs have been available for listening from the blog. Fustercluck!!! Elastic No-No Band released their second studio album, a double album called Fustercluck!!! in January 2010. It featured numerous guest appearances from other antifolk acts, like Toby Goodshank of The Moldy Peaches, Nan Turner of Schwervon!, and Brook Pridemore. The album also marked the addition of electric guitarist John Mulcahy to the band. It would turn out to be their last proper studio album, as the band dissolved in late 2011. A final \\"leftovers\\" compilation, Black No-No's was scheduled to be released in May 2012.  Pop culture references  Many of Elastic No-No Band's songs feature humorous lyrics based on pop culture references. \\"Run-DMC\\" mentions the titular hip-hop group, as well as fellow hip-hoppers Eric B. & Rakim, R&B; singer Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland, and actor Mr. T. \\"I Am Klaus Kinski (And This Is My Song)\\" is told from the point of view of the famed German actor and mentions his squabbles with his frequent collaborator, the German film director Werner Herzog. \\"A Modest Proposal (For Laura Cantrell)\\" has Remer proposing marriage to the country music singer Laura Cantrell and mentioning past romantic crushes on female musicians like Liz Phair, Juliana Hatfield, and Meg White. \\"Woody Allen Surrogate (Kenneth Branagh's Blues)\\" is from the point of view of British actor and director Kenneth Branagh, who starred in Woody Allen's film Celebrity. The song discusses actors who have played the \\"Woody Allen part\\" in movies that Allen has directed but not starred in, such as John Cusack (in Bullets Over Broadway) and Jason Biggs (in Anything Else). Sean Penn is noted in the song for \\"avoiding it\\" in his performance in Sweet and Lowdown.

Historical usage  The earliest evidence of the name Oregon has Spanish origins. The term \\"orejón\\" comes from the historical chronicle Relación de la Alta y Baja California (1598) written by Rodrigo Montezuma, a man of New Spain. His work made reference to the Columbia River when the Spanish explorers penetrated into the actual North American territory that became part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. This chronicle is the first topographical and linguistic source with respect to the place name Oregon. There are also two other sources with Spanish origins, such as the word oregano, referring to a plant which grows in the southern part of the region. It is possible that the American territory was named by the Spaniards, as there is a stream in Spain called the \\"Arroyo del Oregón\\" (which is located in the province of Ciudad Real); it is also possible that the \\"j\\" in the Spanish phrase \\"El Orejón\\" was later corrupted into a \\"g\\". Most scholarship ascribes the earliest known use of the name \\"Oregon\\" to a 1765 petition by Major Robert Rogers to the Kingdom of Great Britain, seeking money to finance an expedition in search of the Northwest Passage. The petition read \\"the rout... is from the Great Lakes towards the Head of the Mississippi, and from thence to the River called by the Indians Ouragon....\\"Oregon Almanac Thus, the early Oregon Country and now the present day state of Oregon took their names from the river now known as the Columbia River.Article on Oregon State in the Catholic Encyclopedia of 1910. Retrieved 10 March 2012 In 1766, Rogers commissioned Jonathan Carver to lead such an expedition and in 1778, Carver used Oregon to label the Great River of the West in his book Travels Through the Interior Parts of North America. \\"Jonathan Carver's source for the name Oregon,\\" in: Oregon Historical Quarterly, Vol. XXIII (1922), pp. 58-69 The poet William Cullen Bryant took the name from Carver's book and used it in his poem Thanatopsis, published in 1817, to refer to the recent discoveries of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which helped establish the name in modern use.Rees, p. 326 Other theories suggest that Rogers appropriated the Abenaki name for the Ohio River, Waregan, or found the name Ourican on a highly speculative 1715 French map.Did this 1715 map influence the first appearance of the name Oregon? Geographicus.com.  Possible origins  Why Rogers used the name has led to many theories, which include these: * George R. Stewart argued in a 1944 American Speech article that the name came from an engraver's error in a French map published in the early 18th century on which the Ouisiconsink (Wisconsin River) was spelled \\"Ouaricon-sint\\", broken into two lines with the -sint below, so that there appeared to be a river flowing to the west named \\"Ouaricon\\". The theory was endorsed in Oregon Geographic Names as \\"the most plausible explanation\\". * In a 2004 article for the Oregon Historical Quarterly, Professor Thomas Love and Smithsonian linguist Ives Goddard argue that Rogers chose the word based on exposure to either of the Algonquian words ' and ', both meaning \\"good and beautiful (river)\\", but in Rogers' day referring to the Ohio River.Goddard and Love, par. 7 According to their theory, Rogers was inspired by a reference to a \\"Belle Rivière,\\" or \\"Beautiful River\\" (which could have arguably stood for the river in question) in Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz's Histoire de la Louisiane, published in 1758.Goddard and Love, par. 33 Le Page du Pratz also referred to an alleged Indian origin for this name but did not supply an Indian word for it. Goddard and Love then surmise that Rogers substituted his bastardization of the Mohegan pidgin word wauregan for Le Page du Pratz's \\"translation\\" Belle Rivière.Goddard and Love, pars. 34-41 * John E. Rees in a 1920 article for the Oregon Historical Quarterly also ascribed the first use to Jonathan Carver, but hypothesized that the word derived from two Shoshone words, Ogwa (river) and Pe-On (west) which Carver had heard on his visits to Sioux Indians (where the Sioux pronounced gwa as an r). In other words, the word \\"Oregon\\" would mean something like \\"River of the West\\" in Shoshone. He does not trace the word back to Col. Rogers. *T.C. Elliott described the theory that the name was a corruption of the French word ouragan (hurricane, windstorm, or tornado), which was applied to the River of the West based on Native American tales of powerful Chinook winds on the lower Columbia River, or perhaps from firsthand French experience with the Chinook winds of the Great Plains. At the time, the River of the West was thought to rise in western Minnesota and flow west through the Great Plains. * One theory suggests that \\"Oregon\\" is a corruption of the French origan (oregano), a theory dismissed by Harvey W. Scott, a historian and early editor of The Oregonian. According to Scott, it was \\"a mere conjecture absolutely without support. More than this, it is completely disproved by all that is known of the name.\\" Beaver State. * In 2001, archaeologist Scott Byram and David G. Lewis published an article in the Oregon Historical Quarterly arguing that the name Oregon came from a Western Cree pronunciation of the Chinook Jargon word oolighan (see eulachon), referring to grease made from fish, a highly prized food source for Native Americans of the region. Allegedly, the trade routes brought the term eastward. * In 1863, Archbishop François Norbert Blanchet advanced the theory that the name derives from early Spanish settlers who referred to the big, ornamented ears of the region's native people by the name \\"Orejon.\\" * Joaquin Miller explained in Sunset magazine, in 1904, that \\"The name, Oregon, is rounded down phonetically, from Ouve água—Oragua, Or-a-gon, Oregon—given probably by the same Portuguese navigator that named the Farallones after his first officer, and it literally, in a large way, means cascades: 'Hear the waters.' You should steam up the Columbia and hear and feel the waters falling out of the clouds of Mount Hood to understand entirely the full meaning of the name Ouve a água, Oregon.\\" *According to the Oregon Tourism Commission, present-day Oregonians pronounce the state's name as \\"or-uh-gun, never or-ee- gone\\". After being drafted by the Detroit Lions in 2002, former Oregon Ducks quarterback Joey Harrington distributed \\"Orygun\\" stickers to members of the media as a reminder of how to pronounce the name of his home state.Banks, Don (April 21, 2002). \\"Harrington confident about Detroit QB challenge\\".

Others have speculated \\"The early explorations and the origin of the name of the Oregon country,\\" in: Oregon Historical Quarterly, Vol. XXI, No. 4 (Dec. 1920), pp. 332-340. Galvani tries to debunk the ascription to Carver and alleges an earlier use of the name on Spanish maps, citing one Gabriel Franchere. that the name is related to the kingdom of Aragon: the major part of the Spanish soldiers who conquered the West Coast from California to Vancouver Island in the 18th century were in fact from Catalonia, a principality of the ancient Crown of Aragon in Spain. The name might also be derived from the Spanish last name Obregón, which in turn is related to a Spanish place name \\"Obregon\\" in Santander, Spain, on the north coast.

The supporting cast includes Alec Guinness, Moira Lister and Hugh Griffith. Plot Two Welsh coal miners from (fictional) Hafoduwchbenceubwllymarchogcoch, David 'Dai Number 9' Jones (Donald Houston) and Thomas 'Twm' Jones (Meredith Edwards), win a contest run by the Echo newspaper. The prize is £100 each, plus the best seats for an important rugby union match between England and Wales at Twickenham. For the naive Welshmen, this is their first trip to England. They are supposed to be met at Paddington station by Whimple (Alec Guinness), a gardening columnist on the paper, but nobody told them. Then the two miners become separated when Dai is picked up by attractive con artist Jo (Moira Lister) after she overhears them talking about the prize money. At Jo's suggestion, she and Dai go to the newspaper to collect the money. The editor makes Whimple responsible for showing Dai around, but Jo soon manages to lose him. Whimple hears about Jo's criminal methods from a fellow reporter and runs out in search of them. As they spend time together, Dai begins to fall in love with Jo, though he already has a girlfriend back in Wales: Bronwen, the boss's secretary. Meanwhile, Twm recognizes a familiar face: Huw Price (Hugh Griffith), a down-on-his-luck harpist and traditional Chief Singer with whom he had once won the grand prize at an important Welsh music festival. They go looking for Dai (between drinks at various pubs). By the time they arrive at the Echo to collect Twm's share of the prize, they're sopping drunk. Not knowing who Twm is, the editor has the pair kicked out. Eventually, Twm and Huw give up and go to the rugby match, getting there just as it ends (Wales wins). There, they meet up with Whimple. Jo takes Dai shopping for a diamond ring for Bronwen; her confederate Barney (Leslie Perrins) tries to cheat him, but Dai changes his mind about which ring he wants and ends up getting a fair deal. Jo takes him back to her flat so Barney can sneak in and steal Dai's money. Dai proposes that she move to Wales and offers to give her money to pay for the fare, but then he remembers Bronwen and changes his mind. Disappointed more than she expected, she steals his money. Just then, Whimple shows up and tells Dai the truth about the woman, but she runs off. A chase ensues. Dai gets Jo's purse, with the money in it, and runs to catch the train back to Wales, where he is reunited with Twm and Huw. Jo and Barney bring a policeman and accuse Dai of being a thief; to avoid trouble, Dai gives back the purse. As the train pulls out though, Jo throws him back his money, much to Barney's disgust.

The beginning of the continuous settlement of Estonian Swedes in these areas (known as Aiboland) dates back to the 13th and 14th centuries, when their Swedish-speaking ancestors arrived in Estonia from what is now Sweden and Finland. Almost all of Estonia's Swedish-speaking minority fled to Sweden during World War II, and only the descendants of a few individuals who stayed behind are permanently resident in Estonia today.  History  Traditional Swedish Sprachraum, with dialects marked.  Early history  The Swedish-speaking population in Estonia persisted for about 650 years. The first written mention of the Swedish population in Estonia comes from 1294, in the laws of the town of Haapsalu. Further early mentions of Swedes in Estonia came in 1341 and 1345 (when an Estonian monastery in Padise sold \\"the Laoküla Estate\\" and Suur-Pakri Island to a group of Swedes). Based on some of the place names it's possible that there was a Swedish presence in Estonia even earlier. During the 13th through 15th centuries, large numbers of Swedes arrived in coastal Estonia from Swedish-speaking parts of Finland, which was part of the Kingdom of Sweden (and would remain so until 1809), often settling on Church-owned land. The first documented record of the island of Ruhnu (), and of its Swedish population, is also a 1341 letter sent by the Bishop of Courland which confirmed the islanders' right to reside and manage their property in accordance with Swedish law.  Swedish Estonia  The Swedish Empire in 1658, including the Dominion of Swedish Estonia and the Dominion of Swedish Livonia (now southern Estonia). In 1561, Sweden established the Dominion of Swedish Estonia, which it would hold until 1710 (formally until 1721, when the territory was ceded to Russia under the Treaty of Nystad). The Estonia-Swedes prospered during this period. Swedish, along with German and Estonian, was one of the official languages.  Russian rule  After the Teutonic Order lost much of its power in the 16th century and the Dominion of Swedish Estonia was lost to Russia following the Great Northern War (1700–1721), conditions worsened for Swedes in Estonia: the lands they had settled were often confiscated from the Church and given to local nobility, and taxes increased. This situation remained the same during Russian rule, and the Estonian Swedes' suffering continued as, for example, the Agrarian reforms which liberated the land of Estonian serfs in 1816, did not apply to Estonian (mostly non-serf) Swedes.  Forced emigrations  At certain times during Russian Estonia period, groups of Estonian Swedes were forced to leave Estonia for other parts of the Russian Empire. Most notably, Empress Catherine II of Russia forced the 1,000 Swedes of Hiiumaa (), to move to Southern Russia (today littoral Ukraine) in 1781, where they established the community of Gammalsvenskby (today within Kherson Oblast).  Conditions improve  The Estonian Swedes' positions improved during the 1850s and 1860s, due to further agrarian reforms, but discrimination remained during the rest of the period of Tsarist rule in Estonia. After the First World War and the Russian Revolution, the independent Republic of Estonia was created in 1918. The constitution of independent Estonia granted the ethnic minority groups the control over their language of education, the right to form institutions for their national and social rights, the right to use their native language in official capacities where they formed majorities of the population, and the choice of nationality. Swedes, Baltic Germans, Russians, and Jews all had ministers in the new national government. Svenska Folkförbundet, a Swedish political organization, was formed. In 1925, a new law giving more cultural autonomy was passed, although the Russians and Swedes in Estonia did not take advantage of these new freedoms, mainly for economic reasons.  World War II  In 1939, the Soviet Union forced Estonia to sign a treaty concerning military bases. Many of the islands upon which Estonian Swedes lived were confiscated, bases were built on them, and their inhabitants were forced to leave their homes. A year later, Estonia was occupied by, and annexed into, the Soviet Union, and their voice in government was lost. Estonian Swedish men were conscripted into the Red Army and, during the German occupation, into the German armed forces. Most of the remaining Estonian Swedes fled to Sweden prior to the second invasion of Estonia by the Soviet army in 1944. On June 8, 1945, there were 6,554 Estonian Swedes and 21,815 ethnic Estonian refugees in Sweden.Seppo Zerterberg: Viro, Historia, kansa, kulttuuri. Helsinki: Suomalaisen kirjallisuuden seura, 1995,  Today  Maria Murman (1911-2004), an Estonian Swede who remained in Estonia after the Second World War, in Vormsi (Ormsö), 1994. Today, small groups of remaining Estonian Swedes are regrouping and re-establishing their heritage, by studying Swedish language and culture. They are led by the Estonian Swedish Council, which is backed by the Estonian government. In 2000, Swedes were the 21st largest ethnic group in Estonia, numbering only 300. There are however many Estonian Swedes and descendants of Estonian Swedes residing in Sweden.  Areas of population and demographics  An older Swedish map of the West Estonian archipelago, in which the Estonian Swedish population was concentrated. Population figures during the early centuries of Swedish settlement are not available. At the end of the Teutonic period, there were probably around 1,000 Estonian Swedish families, with some 1,500 Swedes in the capital Tallinn (), giving a total population of roughly 5-7 thousand, some 2-3% of the population of what is now Estonia at the time. The 1897 Russian Census gives a total Swedish population of 5,768 or 1,39% in the Governorate of Estonia. The majority of the Swedes lived in the Wiek County where they formed a minority of 5,6%. Russian Imperial Census 1897 The 1922 census gives Estonia a total population of 1,107,059 of which Estonia-Swedes made up only 0.7%, some 7,850 people, who made up majorities in some places, such as Ruhnu (), Vormsi (), Riguldi (). It dropped slightly to 7,641 in 1934. By the time of the Second World War, the population was nearly 10,000, and roughly 9,000 of these people fled to Sweden. Towns with large pre-war Swedish populations include Haapsalu () and Tallinn (). After World War II the numbers stayed fairly stable: there were 435 Estonian Swedes in 1970, 254 in 1979 and 297 in 1989, when they placed 26th on the list of Estonia's minority groups (before the Second World War, they were third in number, after Russians and Germans). The 2000 census shows a number of 300, placing Swedes at 20th on the list of Estonia's minority groups. However, only 211 of them are Estonian citizens. Since all do not claim their real ethnic background, some have estimated the real number of Estonian Swedes in Estonia to be about 1,000.Estlandssvenskarna i Estland - har upprättat kulturellt självstyre  Language  There was not a unified Estonian-Swedish dialect, but several. The Estonian Swedish dialects are subdivisions of the Eastern varieties of Standard Swedish. Ruhnu had its own dialect, the Vormsi-Noarootsi-Riguldi dialect was spoken on those islands, and there was also a Pakri-Vihterpalu variety.

The Saint Paul River is a river of western Africa. Its headwaters are in southeastern Guinea. Its upper portion in Guinea is known as the Diani River or Niandi River, and forms part of the boundary between Guinea and Liberia. The river then enters Liberia about north of Gbarnga and crosses Liberia in a southwesterly direction. It empties into the Atlantic Ocean at Cape Mesurado in Monrovia near Bushrod Island, separating Monrovia from its suburb Brewerville.  History  The river was named by Portuguese navigators in the 15th century, who first sighted the river on St. Paul's feast day. The river became important for the slave trade: Robert Bostock established a factory here. Because the soil around Monrovia, Liberia was poor and the coastal areas were covered in dense jungle, many early African-American emigrants to Liberia in the 19th century moved up to the nearby St. Paul River, where they found land suitable for agriculture.Library Of Congress, \\"Personal Stories and ACS New Directions\\" There they established small settlements. Also, American Lutheran missionaries set up the Muhlenberg Mission Station along the river, where they taught children various academics, technical/agricultural skills (especially the cultivation of coffee), and catechism. David Day (missionary) introduced a steam ship to the river for the purposes of commerce and travel. The students at the school built it.Harold Vink Whetstone, Lutheran Mission in Liberia, (Board of Foreign Missions of the United Lutheran Church in America, 1955), pp. 24-51; George Scholl, D.D., \\"David A.

He was the Chief of Staff of the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) until 2007. He was a prominent figure in the 2007 Zimbabwean coup d'état attempt. In December 2017 he was promoted from major general to lieutenant general upon retirement and admitted into ZANU-PF. History He was born in Charamba village, located in the district of Bikita, Zimbabwe. Rugeje is also an heir of the Charamba family. The Charamba family belong to the Zimbabwean Duma clan which, in turn, traces its origins back to the Rozvi kingdom. Rugeje was educated at Silveira Mission where he excelled. Military service He joined the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) as a teenager at the age of 16, serving as a partisan. Taking the moniker of \\"Sunbat\\", he rose within the ranks of ZANLA to become a member of the movement's general staff. After the end of the Rhodesian Bush War, Rugeje was offered the rank of major in the new Zimbabwe Defence Forces. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1983, and was made a colonel in 1987. Rugeje led a portion of the Zimbabwean military to quash the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) rebellion in Matabeleland from 1983 to 1987. This was whilst he was the commander at Inkomo Barracks (the primary unit under his command being the First Mechanised Battalion). Rugeje ultimately led ZNA forces to victory over the ZIPRA. Rugeje was also successful in leading missions against the Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) when he was commander of One Commando Battalion (currently known as One Commando Regiment or simply \\"One Commando\\"). Around 1984, under Rugeje's leadership, One Commando assisted other elements of the Zimbabwean military in defeating most elements of the RENAMO. In 1990 he was promoted to brigadier general and became quartermaster of the ZNA. In the mid to late 1990s he was actively involved in the Democratic Republic of Congo mission, in which he led successful counter insurgency missions. Rugeje graduated from Lancaster University with both a Master of Defence & Strategic Studies degree, and a Master of Laws degree. Major General Rugeje also holds a Master of Business Administration degree from Harvard University. In 2000 he was promoted to major general, becoming the fourth in command of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces. On October 24, 2006 he praised cooperation between the military of Zimbabwe and the Chinese People's Liberation Army.Tightening the noose around China's bloggers; World Bank criticizes Chinese lending practices American Foreign Policy Council On 18 December 2017, Rugeje was promoted to lieutenant general upon retirement by President Emmerson Mnangagwa.

Zimbabwe Independent. Retrieved 2015-01-11. As of July 2014, Rugeje had still not vacated all (if any) of the aforementioned seized land. The Zimbabwean government began placing pressure on Rugeje, by denying him a hunting license. The particular type of hunting license he had requested would have allowed him to permit hunters, particularly foreign trophy-hunters, to hunt on and around the land he had seized. Ostensibly, Rugeje could make a profit through this, by charging for the right to hunt on the land, or by other related means. The Zimbabwean government took such an action as to make the land less profitable for Rugeje, thereby enticing him to abandon said land. At the time of this writing (January 2015) it is not known whether the pressure by the Zimbabwe government has encouraged Rugeje to leave the seized land.Bolder, Peter (Published on 2 July 2014).

Early life Varzaly was born October 6, 1890 in the village of Fulianka, Austria-Hungary (now Slovakia) and studied at the Greek Catholic Seminary in Prešov. Varzaly married Anna Ilona Kristof. The couple had 7 children. Eugene Varzaly, Stephen Varzaly, Jr.; George Varzaly; Adela Varzaly Matiak; Dolores Varzaly Amman; Martha Varzaly Gaydos; Maria Louisa Varzaly Lazor. He was ordained November 7, 1915 and served in several Rusyn parishes during World War I. In 1920 Varzaly was offered his choice of assignment to the cathedral in Budapest or of a church in New Castle, Pennsylvania. In 1920 he emigrated to the United States on assignment to St. Nicholas Greek Catholic Church in New Castle, Pennsylvania. In 1921 his wife and three children (Eugene, Stephen and Adela who were born in Fulianka) followed. He moved in 1932 to the parish of Saint Michael's Greek Catholic Church in Rankin, Pennsylvania. Controversy over married clergy Greek Rite Catholicism in the United States, which began in the 1880s with large-scale emigration from Eastern Europe, was until 1914 administered by the American Roman Catholic hierarchy, which instituted a subtle campaign to Latinize its conduct. Fearing that married Greek Catholic priests might cause envy among celibate Roman Catholic priests, Pope Pius X in 1907 issued an apostolic letter enjoining celibacy upon all Catholic priests in the U.S. Many Greek Catholics argued that by the 1646 Union of Uzhhorod their clergy had been granted the right to marry before ordination, and the decree was unenforced. The Holy See issued a second decree in 1929 entitled Cum Data Fuerit, which reiterated Rome's previous position that the Greek Catholic clergy in America must be celibate. Basil Takach (1879–1948), the first bishop of the Byzantine Catholic Metropolitan Church of Pittsburgh, the American branch of the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church, opposed the new decree, but his appeals were rebuffed by Rome. Varzaly as journalist and dissident From 1930 to 1937 Varzaly served as editor-in-chief of Amerikansky Russky Viestnik (1892—1952), the longest-running Rusyn-American newspaper in America and the official publication of the Greek Catholic Union of Rusyn Brotherhoods, a fraternal benefit society based in Pennsylvania. Many Carpatho-Rusyns, including Varzaly, believed clerical celibacy to be so inherently unnatural as to lead inevitably to promiscuity and sexual abuse. During the celibacy conflict Varzaly used the newspaper to argue against Cum Data Fuerit and for continuation of a traditional married clergy within the Church. He joined, eventually, with other clergy and laity to formally fight the Pope's decree, and they all were suspended from the Church. American Carpatho-Rusyn Diocese Varzaly backed the 1936 formation of the American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese, but by 1949 left to support a newly created Carpatho-Russian People's Church under the jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church in North America. In 1937, Varzaly—by then stationed for six years at St. Michael Greek Catholic Church in Rankin, Pennsylvania, in Pittsburgh's Monongahela Valley—joined three dozen other Byzantine rite priests to form a Carpatho- Rusyn diocese independent of Rome and the Latin rite bishops of the United States. The first bishop, Orestes Chornock, was elected by his fellow priests and consecrated the following year by Orthodox bishops of the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople. Varzaly served as treasurer for the new diocese. He took his role seriously as guardian of the funds contributed by the largely impoverished faithful, refusing to sign checks for expenditures he believed inappropriate. This sparked controversy and lawsuits, but Varzaly prevailed in each. Varzaly did not believe a juridical break with Rome to be sufficient, however. On the pages of his newsletter Vistnik (\\"The Messenger\\") and in diocesan councils he argued for the elimination of Latinizations in the liturgy and popular devotions that had become part of the Eastern Church's practice over the course of centuries living alongside Western Catholics. The touchstone for authentic Eastern practice was held to be that of the Russian Orthodox Church. Varzaly and others argued that the preservation of Eastern tradition demanded an end to devotions of western origin such as the Stations of the Cross and the rosary. Gradually, devotions of western origin disappeared from Orthodox practice; their standing remains the subject of debate among Byzantine Catholics to this day. Changes to Divine Liturgy, although less dramatic than those made at roughly the same time by Orthodox Ukrainians, moved Carpatho-Rusyn practice closer to that of the Russian Orthodox Church. In contrast to the earlier split led by Father Alexis Toth—who led his flock into the Russian Church in both jurisdiction and practice—distinctive Rusyn elements remained in the liturgy. This search for a liturgical and devotional life shorn of Western accretions led Rev. Varzaly to re-examine his earlier positions about the proper standing of the new Carpatho-Rusyn diocese within worldwide Orthodoxy. Once an advocate of submission \\"neither to Rome nor Moscow,\\" by 1950 he was making the case that since it was to the Patriarchate of Moscow to which the people turned for the pure form of the Eastern liturgy, the independent Carpatho-Rusyn church ought to look to Moscow, the \\"Third Rome\\" rather than to the remnant of ethnic Greeks representing the ancient patriarchates of Constantinople and Antioch in a modern Turkey that seemed no longer remotely hospitable to Christians. This was a controversial position among the Carpatho-Rusyns. While none disputed that their people were Slavs, the Carpatho-Rus had been largely untouched by the pan-Slav movement of the previous century. Constantinople, moreover, was the Mother Church of the East, an imperial city when Moscow was a collection of mud huts on the banks of the Moskva River. By turning to the Ecumenical Patriarch in Constantinople, moreover, they could legitimize their position as an Orthodox church with little chance that they would be prevented from running their own affairs. 1950 was not the most auspicious time for a naturalized American to be arguing in favor of submission to guidance, much less instruction, from Moscow. Rev. Varzaly's rivals in the church were not slow to capitalize on that and in short order, the FBI surveilled him as a pro-Russian and pro-Communist sympathizer during the Red Scare of the 1950s and he ultimately testified before Congress about his activities. Nothing came of the charges. A review of two years' of his writings not only found nothing \\"subversive\\", even by the somewhat hysterical standards of the day, but prompted a letter of apology from the federal government for its being drawn into an internal and essentially religious dispute. Varzaly died June 3, 1957 in Pittsburgh's Montefiore Hospital. He is interred in Homewood Cemetery, a nonsectarian burial ground in Pittsburgh.

It is based on the teleplay by Hillman Taylor and Buchanan. It is a low-budget 16mm film color remake of Roger Corman's It Conquered the World (1956), which also featured an alien invader from Venus. Plot Zontar, the Thing from Venus At a dinner party with their wives, NASA scientist Dr. Keith Ritchie (Tony Huston) reveals to his colleague Dr. Curt Taylor (John Agar) that he has secretly been in communication with an alien from Venus named Zontar who he claims is coming to Earth to solve all of the world's problems. However, as soon as Zontar arrives on Earth via a fallen laser satellite it quickly becomes obvious that the three-eyed, bat-winged, skeletal black creature has a hidden agenda, as it begins causing local power outages that stop telephones, automobiles and even running water from working, and it starts taking control of people's minds using flying lobster-like \\"injecto-pods\\" that sprout from its wings. Only after his wife is killed does Ritchie finally realize that Zontar has come not as a savior but as a conqueror, and he goes to confront the hideous alien in the sulfur spring- heated cave that it has made its secret base. Reception In a review for AllMovie, Paul Gaita wrote \\"For experienced cult movie watchers, Zontar is the cinematic equivalent of a car accident, an unpleasant spectacle from which one cannot look away\\". Chris Eggerston of Bloody Disgusting criticized the alien in the film for resembling \\"a human-sized shit-monster with wings\\", but felt that it looked better than the alien from It Conquered the World.

He is a public advocate for the Christian faith and is highly regarded for his ability to unpack complex ideas in a straightforward and accessible way for the modern skeptic. In the 1980s and 1990s, he was a singer-songwriter in the Christian rock band In The Silence. With an Honours degree in Theology and a PhD in Ancient History, John was made an Honorary Fellow of the Department of Ancient History at Macquarie University. He also teaches a course on the Historical Jesus for the Department of Jewish Studies at the University of Sydney, is a Visiting Academic of the Faculty of Classics at Oxford University in the United Kingdom, and in 2019 was appointment as the Distinguished Fellow and Senior Lecturer in Public Christianity at Ridley College in Melbourne. In 2012, Dickson wrote Hearing Her Voice: A Case for Women Giving Sermons. In it, he argued that 1 Timothy 2:12 (\\"I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man\\") does not mean that women cannot give sermons today, since the \\"teaching\\" referred to meant \\"preserving and laying down the traditions handed on by the apostles\\", and that does not happen in most sermons today. Matthias Media published a volume of essays in response to Dickson's book: Women, Sermons and the Bible: Essays interacting with John Dickson's Hearing Her Voice. On 6 May 2015, Dickson's book A Sneaking Suspicion (1995) was banned from state schools by the New South Wales Department of Education and Communities on the basis of a \\"potential risk to students in the delivery of this material, if not taught sensitively and in an age appropriate manner.\\" The ban was lifted 18 May 2015.  Early Life  Dickson was educated at Mosman High School in what he describes as “a typical Aussie home”. His family, like so many in modern Australia, were not ‘religious’ and rarely discussed spiritual matters. John claims he had “never been inside a church before he was sixteen”. Despite the limited exposure to any formal religious tradition, Dickson’s interest in existential thought started at a young age. On 12 October 1976, John’s father died in the Indian Airlines Flight 171 crash at Bombay Airport. John was 9 years old at the time. He is recounted to have asked his mother in the following days, “Why did God let Dad’s plane crash?” This is a question that John freely admits shaped his curiosity for life’s ultimate questions and consequently his career and public advocacy. This experience has allowed John to be sympathetic to both the sorrows and questions of our world. In high school, Dickson was a self- professed \\"low performer\\". He attended Christian Scripture Class (SRE) in the pursuit of a \\"pleasant way to pass half an hour\\" and to \\"ask questions to make the volunteers look stupid\\". At the age of 15, however, John became intrigued by the Christian faith through these classes, and was especially influenced by a teacher who \\"presented Jesus in an articulate, funny and intelligent way\\". Through asking questions and hearing the historical accounts of Jesus Christ, John found himself first becoming a “fan of Jesus, and then at 16 a follower of Jesus”. Almost immediately, Dickson felt \\"the need to tell other people about the person of Jesus\\", who he had only recently discovered himself. Career Dickson's career has included:  Music  Dickson was the lead singer of the band In The Silence through the late 1980s and early 90s and would play up to six shows a week. The band's objective was to \\"play in pubs and clubs and talk about our faith between songs\\". Although their lengthy song introductions were not always well received, people would \\"generally just put up with their Christian spiels\\". On some occasions, Dickson would speak for 10 minutes between songs. The band received extensive amounts of mail, having to devote a day out of every week just to respond. Most of these letters were people inquiring about the points the band raised during their sermon-like introductions, such as \\"When you said this about God in that introduction, what did you mean?\\" Three of the band members and two of the crew went to theological college.

Kienmayer joined the army of the Habsburg Monarchy and fought against the Kingdom of Prussia and Ottoman Turkey. During the French Revolutionary Wars, he continued to make his reputation in the cavalry and became a general officer. In the War of the Second Coalition and the Napoleonic Wars he commanded both divisions and corps. He was appointed Proprietor (Inhaber) of an Austrian cavalry regiment in 1802 and held this honor until his death. Later he was the governor of Galicia, Transylvania, and Moravia. Early career Kienmayer began his military career in 1774 as a cadet in the imperial Austrian Puebla de Portugalo Infantry Regiment # 26. In 1775 he was promoted second lieutenant in the Jung-Modena Dragoon Regiment # 8. As a member of the Barco Hussar Regiment # 35, he participated in the War of the Bavarian Succession in 1778.Smith-Kudrna, Kienmayer During the Austro-Turkish War, Kienmayer excelled in a skirmish against a force of Turks that attacked the Austrian outposts in April 1788. Later that year, he served under Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld in the siege of Khotyn Fortress and was promoted major in November. He fought in the Battle of Focșani on 21 July 1789 and received promotion to Oberst-Leutnant in recognition of a successful raid carried out afterward. After the Battle of Rymnik in September, Coburg sent Kienmayer to carry the victory dispatch to Emperor Joseph II. He quickly returned to the front and executed another successful cavalry raid in November, capturing a senior Turkish officer. Promoted to Oberst (colonel), he assumed command of the Levenehr Dragoon Regiment # 19. He was also awarded the Military Order of Maria Theresa, Austria's highest honor for valor, on 21 December 1789 for bravery in the face of the enemy. French Revolutionary Wars War of the First Coalition Reassigned to the Barco Hussars, Kienmayer led the regiment in the Flanders Campaign in the War of the First Coalition beginning in April 1792. He fought under Franz Kaunitz-Rietberg in the Battle of Rouvroy on 13 May 1794. The Austrians turned back Louis Charbonnier's attempt to advance north of the Sambre River. During the action, Kienmayer led his hussars in a charge that rode down a column of 6,000 Frenchmen. He was promoted General-Major on 11 June for outstanding achievement. At the beginning of summer campaign of 1796 in southern Germany, Kienmayer led a brigade in the Army of the Lower Rhine under first Archduke Charles and later Wilhelm von Wartensleben. Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's Army of Sambre-et-Meuse surprised his force of 4,500 soldiers at Giessen on 8 July. The French hustled his troops out of the town, but his losses were light.Smith, pp 116-117 He fought in Pál Kray's division at Sulzbach-Rosenberg on 17 August.Smith, p 120 This action came shortly before the Battle of Amberg when Archduke Charles re-assumed command of the army. He led an infantry- cavalry brigade in Friedrich von Hotze's division at the Battle of Würzburg on 3 September.Smith, p 122 The following day he led a brilliant cavalry raid, capturing a large supply depot at Wertheim am Main and a small flotilla of munitions boats. War of the Second Coalition At the start of the War of the Second Coalition, Kienmayer fought at the Battle of Ostrach on 20–21 March 1799. Four days later, he led his cavalry brigade in Friedrich Nauendorf's division at the First Battle of Stockach. On 24 May, he defended Andelfingen, Switzerland, where he held off a much superior force under Michel Ney for many hours and escaped with his soldiers. For this exploit, he became a Feldmarschal-Leutnant on 6 March 1800. He fought in a clash at Bühl in April and at the Battle of Biberach on 9 May. After the summer truce, Kienmayer was appointed to command the Right column of Archduke John's army. His 16,000-strong corps included the divisions of Archduke Ferdinand and Prince Karl Schwarzenberg.Arnold, Hohenlinden, p 276 His column formed the northern wing of an attempted thrust at Jean Moreau's left flank. Events compelled Archduke John to convert the plan into a direct advance on Munich.Arnold, Hohenlinden, pp 213-214 At the Battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December 1800, Kienmayer's corps formed the Austrian right flank. His troops drove in the French outposts and soon found themselves grappling with Paul Grenier's three divisions. His troops, particularly those led by Schwarzenberg, pushed forward aggressively. However, the leader of the Right-Center column, Ludwig Baillet de Latour, only gave weak support to Kienmayer's wing.Arnold, Hohenlinden, pp 233-234 Meanwhile, Moreau's generals pulled off an envelopment of Johann Kollowrat's Left-Center column. After Kollowrat's luckless corps was crushed, Moreau turned on the Austrian Right column, which still battled valiantly in the northern sector. Kienmayer gave orders to retreat, and he and his generals brought their troops off intact, though Archduke Ferdinand lost 500 prisoners.Arnold, Hohenlinden, pp 248-249 During the chaotic retreat after Hohenlinden, Antoine Richepanse mauled Kienmayer's rear guard at Frankenmarkt on 17 December, inflicting 2,650 casualties on the Austrians.Smith, p 191 In 1802, he became proprietor of Kienmayer Hussar Regiment # 8 and held the position during his lifetime. Napoleonic Wars Penzing War of the Third Coalition In 1805, he served in the War of the Third Coalition as a corps commander in the army of Archduke Fredinand and Karl Mack. Since his force was deployed east of the main army, he successfully extricated his corps from Emperor Napoleon's attempt at encirclement and he avoided the fate of Mack's army in the Ulm Campaign. He soon joined Mikhail Kutuzov's Russian army in its retreat into Moravia. At the Battle of Austerlitz, Kienmayer led the advance guard of Friedrich Buxhowden's Allied left wing. His 6,780-strong command formed the uniquely Austrian unit known as a light division, comprising both cavalry and light infantry elements. His brigade commanders were Georg Symon de Carneville (five Grenz infantry battalions), Moritz Liechtenstein (8 squadrons of hussars plus 1,000 Cossacks), Karl Wilhelm von Stutterheim (8 squadrons of light cavalry), and Johann Nostitz-Rieneck (6 squadrons of hussars plus 100 uhlans). There were 12 light cannon attached to the division.Duffy, p 182 The battle plan called for Kienmayer to clear Tellnitz village of French troops and grab the high ground to the west of the Goldbach stream. First, the Austrians encountered 300 French skirmishers on a vineyard-covered knoll at 8:00 am. Stout resistance forced Kienmayer to commit both battalions of the 2nd Szekler Grenz Infantry Regiment before the knoll fell. Utilizing the vineyards, ditches, and rough ground around Tellnitz, the 1,000 men of the 3rd Line Infantry Regiment fought all five Austrian infantry battalions to a standstill. At last, the Russian 7th Jägers charged in column and cleared the French from the village. By this time French reinforcements arrived on the scene and the 108th Line recaptured the village. However, the French carried their luck too far and a few squadrons of the numerous Austrian hussars charged. After losing several hundred casualties, including many prisoners, the French abandoned Tellnitz and retreated across the Goldbach. At 9:30 am, Buxhowden's Austro-Russians were finally able to deploy across the Goldbach.Arnold, Austerlitz, pp 14-17 One historian writes, > Had they [the Allies] been able to rapidly dislodge the 3rd Line from > Tellnitz, the story of Austerlitz would have been somewhat different. > Instead, the gallant resistance of the French badly snarled the Allied > advance, and made them vulnerable to the French counterattack on the Pratzen > ... Certainly the Austrian tactics contributed to the French success at > Tellnitz. While the spirit of the soldiers cannot be questioned, an > examination of the casualties suffered in the attacks against Tellnitz > satisfies this point, their piecemeal attacks can be justly > criticized.Arnold, Austerlitz, p 17 Later in the battle, Kienmayer stubbornly covered Buxhowden's withdrawal after the French breakthrough on the Pratzen Heights forced the Allies into a disorganized retreat. War of the Fifth Coalition Kienmayer led the II Reserve Corps in the War of the Fifth Coalition in 1809. This 9,000-man formation comprised five battalions of grenadiers and 12 squadrons each of cuirassiers and heavy dragoons.Bowden & Tarbox, pp 72-73. This work cites a total of 3,915 infantry and 1,415 cavalry, but notes that returns for one- third of the infantry and one-half of the cavalry were not reported. A reasonable estimate of the missing soldiers gives a total of 6,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry. His troops fought under Johann von Hiller's orders at the Battle of Landshut on 21 April. During the retreat, he also led his corps at the Battle of Ebersberg on 3 May. After rejoining the main army, Archduke Charles merged Kienmayer's command with the I Reserve Corps and reassigned him. He fought with distinction at the Battle of Aspern-Essling on 21–22 May, where he commanded 5,770 troopers and 24 artillery pieces of a reserve cavalry division.Bowden & Tarbox, p 92 While the main armies battled on the Danube, light Austrian forces raided the French-allied Kingdom of Saxony, provoking King Jérôme Bonaparte to bring his Kingdom of Westphalia army into the field. In June, Archduke Charles appointed Kienmayer to form the XI Corps from the raiding forces plus reinforcements. The French tried to catch Kienmayer in a pincer, with Jérôme advancing from Leipzig and Jean-Andoche Junot moving from Frankfurt am Main. Kienmayer outmaneuvered them, defeating Junot at the Battle of Gefrees on 8 July. He then turned on Jérôme, who beat a hasty retreat, evacuating Saxony altogether. This notable success was negated by Napoleon's victory at the Battle of Wagram on 5–6 July. For his victory, Kienmayer was elevated to the rank of General of Cavalry on 3 August 1809. Further recognition came in April 1810, when the emperor bestowed upon him the Commander's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa. He served as deputy to the commander in Hungary from 1809 to 1813. He did not hold an active command in the campaigns of 1813 and 1814. Instead, he commanded the province of Galicia. From 1814 to 1820, he held military authority over Transylvania. He commanded Moravia from 1820 to 1826, when he retired from the army. He died in Vienna on 28 October 1828.

The show attempts to approach broad, difficult topics such as \\"time\\" and \\"morality\\" in an accessible and light-hearted manner and with a distinctive audio production style. Radiolab received a 2007 National Academies Communication Award \\"for their imaginative use of radio to make science accessible to broad audiences\\". The program has received two Peabody Awards; first in 2010 and again in 2014. In 2011, Abumrad received the MacArthur grant. Although Radiolab is a \\"limited run series\\", numerous seasons of five to ten episodes each have been produced.Transcribed from the introduction in the \\"Musical Language\\" MP3 podcast. \\"From WNYC, New York Public Radio, this is Radiolab. This is one of five episodes from Season Two. Radiolab is a limited run series.\\" History Having majored in experimental music composition and production at Oberlin College, Jad Abumrad worked for New York City Pacifica affiliate WBAI before landing a job freelancing for National Public Radio (NPR). In 2002 he produced a series of post-9/11 radio documentaries called 24 Hours at the Edge of Ground Zero, and regularly contributed material to Studio 360, both for WNYC. The first weekly episodes of Radiolab aired in May 2002, and each compiled two hours' worth of NPR stories around a particular theme with between-story commentary from Jad Abumrad. These themes were not necessarily science-related, but tackled issues such as the death penalty, religious fundamentalism and politics in Africa and the Middle East. In 2003 Abumrad was given an assignment to interview ABC News science reporter Robert Krulwich and the two men discovered they had a lot in common: both were alumni of Oberlin College (though 25 years apart), and both had worked at WBAI before moving on to WNYC and NPR. They became fast friends and began collaborating on experimental radio pieces, the first of which they sent to Ira Glass for a proposed Flag Day episode of This American Life. \\"It was horrible\\", Glass said of the tape in an interview with Abumrad and Krulwich. \\"It's just amazing that you were able to put together such a wonderful program after that.\\"Radiolab: \\"Jad and Robert: The Early Years\\" . WNYC, May 6, 2008. Retrieved 2010-8-6. Not to be dissuaded, Abumrad and Krulwich continued to collaborate. By 2004 Radiolab had become an hour-long, science-themed program characterized by Abumrad's unique sound design style, and Robert Krulwich appeared as a \\"guest host\\" on a program about time in early June.Radiolab: \\"Time\\" . WNYC, June 4, 2004. Retrieved 2010-8-6. By the following episode (\\"Space\\", aired two weeks later), they were co-hosts, launching into the program's first official season in 2005.Radiolab: \\"Who Am I?\\" . WNYC, February 4, 2005. Retrieved 2010-8-6. Formerly distributed nationally by NPR, WNYC began distributing the show in 2015. The change was noticeably marked by the omission of NPR's name in the show's opening audio sequence after the tagline, \\"You're listening to Radiolab...from WNYC.\\" Format Radiolab is aired on over 300 radio stations across the U.S. Each episode is one hour long and tackles various philosophical and scientific topics. However, the show began in 2002 as a three-hour weekly show on New York City radio station WNYC's AM signal. It wasn't until 2004 that Krulwich began appearing as a regular guest and eventually as a co-host. Each Radiolab episode is elaborately stylized. For instance, thematic—and often dissonant and atonal—music accompanies much of the commentary. In an April 2011 interview with The New York Times, Abumrad explained the choice in music: \\"I put a lot of jaggedy sounds, little plurps and things, strange staccato, percussive things.\\" In addition, previously recorded interview segments are interspersed in the show's live dialogue, adding a layered, call-and-response effect to the questions posed by the hosts. These recordings are often unedited and the interviewee's asides appear in the final product. In the same New York Times interview, Abumrad said, \\"You're trying to capture the rhythms and the movements, the messiness of the actual experience.... It sounds like life.\\" And unlike traditional journalism, in which the reader is given only access to the final article, not the interview, Abumrad added that Radiolabs process is more transparent. As of June 15, 2009, the podcast offers full, hour-long episodes on a regular schedule with a variable number of podcasts in between \\"that follow some detour or left turn, explore music we love, take you to live events, and generally try to shake up your universe\\". These extra podcasts, referred to as \\"Shorts\\", are occasionally combined into full-length compilation episodes. In the UK, episodes are broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra on Sunday evenings. Response Radiolab has been widely acclaimed among listeners and critics alike. Around 1.8 million listeners tune in to the show, though most of them access it via podcasts. It has been hailed, along with This American Life, as one of the most innovative shows on American radio.Bottomley, Andrew (January 11, 2012). On Radio: Radiolab and the Art of the Modern Radio Feature . Antenna: Responses to Media & Culture. In a 2007–2008 study by Multimedia Research (sponsored by the National Science Foundation), it was determined that over 95 percent of listeners reported that the science-based material featured on Radiolab was accessible. Additionally, upwards of 80 percent of listeners reported that the program's pace was exciting, and over 80 percent reported that the layering of interviews was engaging.Flagg, Barbara (May 19, 2009). Listeners' Evaluation of Radiolab: Choice . InformalScience. Radiolab has won several awards, including two Peabody Awards for broadcast excellence.70th Annual Peabody Awards , May 2011. In spring 2011, Krulwich and Abumrad took the show on a live, national tour, selling out in cities such as New York, Seattle, and Los Angeles. In April 2015, the podcast titled \\"60 Words\\" (aired on April 18, 2014) garnered a second Peabody Award for Radiolab. Controversy On September 24, 2012, in a podcast titled \\"The Fact of the Matter\\", the program ran a segment about the yellow rain incidents in Laos and surrounding countries in the 1970s. Included in the story was an interview with Hmong veteran and refugee Eng Yang, with his niece Kao Kalia Yang serving as translator. After hearing the segment, Kao Kalia Yang and others complained that her uncle's viewpoints had been dismissed or edited out, that interviewer Robert Krulwich had treated them callously, and that the overall approach to the story had been racist. The complaints prompted several rounds of allegation, apology, rebuttal, and edits to the podcast, as well as commentary in various sources such as the public radio newspaper Current. On August 12, 2017, Radiolab removed an episode titled \\"Truth Trolls\\" about the attacks on LaBeouf, Rönkkö & Turner's HEWILLNOTDIVIDE.US art project by trolls. The program had been criticized for appearing to condone the actions of extremist groups, with Turner condemning the reporting as \\"abhorrent and irresponsible\\" for describing the vandalism and harassment they had been subjected to as \\"a really encouraging story\\" and \\"comforting.\\" Abumrad issued an apology for giving the impression that they \\"essentially condoned some pretty despicable ideology and behavior,\\" while WNYC stated that they supported Radiolab's decision to remove the podcast, adding that \\"Radiolab unambiguously rejects the beliefs and actions of the trolls, and deeply regrets doing anything that would imply differently.\\" Radiolab episodes Through stories, interviews, and thought experiments, each hour-long episode usually deals with a specific topic and investigates it from several different angles. Sound design (not a common practice in modern radio programming), rapid dialog edits and sound effects are used to build a soundscape constructing an expository conversation, and usually feature brief, seemingly unscripted tangents. The episode credits are generally read by people who were interviewed or featured on the show, rather than by the hosts, while the program credits are read by listeners. Radiolab live Episode 3 of Season 12, titled \\"Apocalyptical – Live from the Paramount in Seattle\\", was recorded at one of the live show tour locations that Radiolab performed. Unlike most shows, this show was recorded both visually and auditorily, and can be viewed on their official website. The tour covered 21 cities and primarily focused on a speculative fringe theory regarding the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that has not been published in a peer- reviewed journal. The fundamental new idea surrounding this theory is that when a large asteroid impacted the Earth, the asteroid driving into the ground caused the rock to become heated so extremely that it became gaseous. This \\"rock-gas\\" was then ejected outside the Earth's atmosphere and into space. The rock-gas, after cooling into many tiny glass particles, was pulled back in by Earth's gravity. The majority of this \\"glass-rain\\" burned up in the Earth's atmosphere upon re-entry, causing the Earth's atmosphere to become superheated, killing most of the species living on the surface of the Earth within a matter of hours. The episode did not include any discussion of the problems with the theory or that it has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.  More Perfect  In June 2016, Radiolab launched their first \\"spinoff series\\" entitled More Perfect. The series examines controversial and historic cases in the Supreme Court of the United States. The show's title comes from the US Constitution which begins \\"We the people, in order to form a more perfect Union\\". The show's first season launched on June 1, 2016, and ran for six episodes.

José Ferrer Esteve de Fujadas (in 19th-century France known as \\"Joseph Ferrer\\") (13 March 1835 – 7 March 1916) was a Spanish guitarist and composer.Josef Zuth: Handbuch der Laute und Gitarre (Vienna, 1926–8), p. 96; Józef Powroźniak: Gitarren-Lexikon (Berlin, 1979; 3rd edition, 1986), p. 73. Life Ferrer was born in Torroella de Montgrí, Girona, and studied guitar with his father, a guitarist and collector of sheet music, before continuing his studies with José Brocá. In 1882, he left Spain for Paris in order to teach at the Institut Rudy and at the Académie Internationale de Musique, also becoming the official guitarist of the Comédie Française, and remained in Paris for 16 years. Ferrer gave regular performances as a soloist. He taught at the Conservatori Superior de Música del Liceu in Barcelona from 1898 to 1901. Following a period of moving between Barcelona and Paris, he settled permanently in Barcelona in 1905, where he died. Music Most of Ferrer's compositions were written for guitar but, being a deeply religious man,David Burden: Introduction to José Ferrer: Minuet & Vals for Guitar Duo (Heidelberg: Chanterelle, 1992). he also wrote some sacred music. His works for guitar solo and duo resemble the fashionable salon music of his time, bearing titles such as Le Charme de la nuit (\\"Charm of the Night\\") and La Danse des Naïades (\\"Dance of the Naiads\\"). One of his most popular pieces was his opus 1, Recuerdos de Montgri.J. Powroźniak (1986), as above. He dedicated a number of pieces to his pupils, especially to the females. About half the number of his c.100 compositions were published during his lifetime, mainly by Vidal of Barcelona, Dupont and Pisa of Paris and latterly by Union Musical Española of Madrid. He also wrote an unpublished method for guitar as well as duos for guitar and flute, and songs. His method \\"shows his great knowledge and understanding of the guitar's history and technique\\".D.

There can be different rules for players on different lists, and the details vary between sports. NFL *Active list *Inactive list *Injured reserve list *Reserve- military list *Physically Unable to Perform list *Reserve-retired *Reserve/Suspended MLB *Active list - Also called the active roster, the 25-man is composed of 25 players who are playing for their Major League team. They are the starting eight position players, pitchers, and reserve players on the team. Players on the active roster are also on the 40-man roster. These players are generally the only ones who dress in uniform and are the only ones who may take the field in a game at any time. Typically, only players on the 25-man roster, and players who are on the injured list but were on the 25-man roster, travel on road trips with the Major League team. *Reserved list - Defined in Major League Rule 2, the 40-man roster is also known as the Major League Reserve List. This name hearkens back to baseball's past when teams reserved the rights to a number of their players, making it impossible for any other team to sign those individuals. In time, a team's reserve list was expanded to all players under contract to that team until the player was released (potentially never). In the 1970s, free agency allowed players achieving certain conditions the opportunity to leave their original team. The system has undergone further changes since then, but there are still players under reserve from year to year on each team. Those players include most minor leaguers and players on the Major League Reserve List. *Bereavement list - Major League players may be placed on the bereavement list due to severe illness or death of that player's or his spouse's immediate family. Minimum period is 3 days, maximum 7 days. Players on this list are counted towards the Reserve List Limit but not the Active List Limit. *Designated List - When the Active or Reserve List Limit has been reached for a particular club, and the club desires to add an additional player, one player from that club must be designated, meaning giving notice to the Commissioner to release or assign that player within 10 days. Such players do not count towards the player limits, but cannot participate until release or assigned. *Injured list - 10-Day: The player must remain off the active roster for a minimum of 10 calendar days, starting on the day following the player's last game. 60-Day: Same rules apply, however, this may only be used when the team's 40-man roster is full. Any player placed on the 60-day injured list after August 1 may not play for the remainder of the season, including any post-season game. *Emergency Injured list - Maximum number of players on list at one time-no limit. Minimum period of inactivity-sixty (60) calendar days. Players placed on this list after August 1 shall remain there for the balance of the season. This list may only be used when a club is at the maximum limit of 40 players. *Disqualified list - Players who violate their player contract. Players on this list do not count towards the Reserved List or Active List limits. A player may remain on this list for two consecutive years before he is removed. A player who is \\"Disqualified\\" is deemed \\"suspended\\" on the official MLB transaction report. *Ineligible list - Players found guilty of serious misconduct (gambling, tanking, bribery, violence to umpires). Players on this list do not count towards the Reserved List or Active List limits. A player may remain on this list for two consecutive years before he is removed. *Military list - Players with definite orders to report for military service. Players on this list do not count towards the Reserved List or Active List limits. Upon learning that a player has separated from military service, a team must immediately notify the Commissioner. *Restricted list - Players who fail to report within 10 days of the season, or who fail to come to a contract with the team prior to that time. Players on this list do not count towards the Reserved List or Active List limits. A player may remain on this list for two consecutive years before he is removed. Often, placing a player on the Restricted List is akin to releasing him without fully relinquishing his rights. *Suspended list - Player may be suspended by his club or the league for insubordination, misconduct, or failure to report in playing condition. A player on this lists counts both towards the Reserve List and the Active List limits. *Temporarily inactive list - Players not able to render active service due to: (1) necessary temporary absence due to family member's illness; (2) absence excused for personal obligations; or (3) awaiting release for the purpose of allowing the player to sign with a foreign league. Minimum placement is 3 days. Players on the TIA count towards the Reserve List limit but not the Active List limit. *Voluntarily retired list - Player under contract who retires is placed on the Voluntarily Retired List. If a player desires to return, he may not be reinstated until 60 days after the season in which he retired. He may also not play baseball elsewhere without obtaining consent from the club owning his rights. Players on this list do not count towards the Reserved List or Active List limits. A player may remain on this list for two consecutive years before he is removed.

His mother was Elizabeth Caird Lindsay (born Glasgow, Scotland 1845, died Cape Town, South Africa,1927). John Macmillan served with the Free Church of Scotland mission in India and was a founder with the Reverend William Miller of the Free Church College in Madras, India, now the Madras Christian College. William Macmillan travelled to South Africa in 1891 with his mother and five elder siblings to join his father, who was working at the Victoria College, Stellenbosch, now the University of Stellenbosch. He attended the Boys High School, Stellenbosch, and did the first two years of the BA degree at the Victoria College, matriculating in 1901 and passing the intermediate exams in 1903. Following the death of Cecil Rhodes in 1902, Macmillan was in 1903 one of the first group of Rhodes Scholars at Oxford University in England. Macmillan studied modern history at Merton College and graduated in 1906. He enrolled for the divinity course at the Free Church College in Aberdeen, and also studied divinity in Glasgow, but he did not proceed to the ministry. An important influence on Macmillan's later work was the semester that he spent at the Kaiser Wilhelm University in Berlin in 1910. He was fluent in German (as well as Dutch and Afrikaans) and attended the lectures of the ecclesiastical historian, Adolf von Harnack, the economic historian Gustav Schmoller, and the pioneer sociologist, Franz Oppenheimer. Macmillan joined the Fabian Society in 1911 and remained an evolutionary socialist or social democrat for most of his life, reverting to liberalism in old age. Career in South Africa Macmillan returned to South Africa in 1911 to become a lecturer in history and economics at Rhodes University College, Grahamstown, South Africa, where he remained until 1917, when he became the first professor of history at the Johannesburg School of Mines (later the University of the Witwatersrand). While in Grahamstown, Macmillan did pioneering work on poverty among white South Africans. He was the only English-speaking delegate at the Dutch Reformed Church congress on White Poverty, which was held at Cradock, Eastern Cape in 1916. Macmillan's first published work appeared anonymously as a pamphlet, Sanitary Reform for Grahamstown in 1915. This was followed in the same year by Economic Conditions in a Non-industrial South African Town. In 1918, Macmillan did substantial fieldwork on white poverty in rural areas, resulting in lectures and a book, The South African Agrarian Problem and its Historical Development, published in Johannesburg in 1919. In 1920, the family of Dr John Philip entrusted Macmillan with his papers. Philip was the superintendent of the London Missionary Society in South Africa in the first half of the 19th century. In the following decade, Macmillan produced two important books, The Cape Colour Question (1927) and Bantu, Boer and Briton: The Making of the South African Native Problem. These books rewrote the history of South Africa in the first half of the nineteenth century, introducing a new emphasis on the history of South Africa as the history of all its people. The third volume of a trilogy, Complex South Africa (1930), brought together his early work on white poverty with work done in the 1920s on African poverty, including his pioneering work on the economics of the reserves, and his 'sample survey' of the Herschel district in Eastern Cape. Macmillan was one of the first people to articulate a vision of South African as a single society. This view brought him into conflict with the segregationist government of the day as well as with liberal segregationists. He became chairman of the Johannesburg Joint Council of Europeans and Natives and was involved in 1932 with public clashes with the ministers of Native Affairs and of Justice – the latter was Oswald Pirow. After the University of Witwatersrand sought to gag Macmillan, he went on sabbatical leave at the end of 1932, but he did not return to the university. He resigned in September 1933. Work on Colonial Africa and the West Indies After the completion of his work on Dr John Philip in 1929, Macmillan began traveling in Central, East, and West Africa. At this time, he began work on issues of governance in Colonial Africa. He published this work as Africa Emergent in 1938. Macmillan was a major critic of colonial rule and an advocate of a gradual democratisation of colonial rule through the introduction of representative, as opposed to 'traditional', systems of local government. He was at the same time critical of the colonial doctrine of financial self-sufficiency and became an advocate of aid. Macmillan had travelled to the United States and the West Indies in 1934-5 and was shocked by the neglect of the West Indian islands. His critique of colonial rule in these territories was published as Warning from the West Indies in 1936 - it was republished as a Penguin special in 1938. Following his return to the United Kingdom in 1932, Macmillan was unable to secure academic employment and remained self-employed until after the outbreak of World War II. He was, however, active in a number of pressure groups including the Friends of Africa, the Anti-Slavery Society, the British Labour Party's committee on Imperial Questions, and with the Trade Union Congress. Wartime work After the outbreak of the Second World War he became a member of the Colonial Office Advisory Committee on Education and was a member of the Channon sub-committee on Higher Education. This drew up the guidelines for the postwar expansion of university education in Africa and the West Indies. He was also a signatory of the report on Mass Education which recommended the extension of primary and adult education in the colonies. From 1941-3 he worked as director of Empire Intelligence for the BBC. In that capacity, Macmillan helped lay the foundations of the World and Africa Services of the BBC. From 1943-6 Macmillan was Senior Representative of the British Council in West Africa. He was based at Accra in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), but was also responsible for the inauguration of the council's work in Nigeria, Sierra Leone and the Gambia, including libraries and scholarship schemes. Postwar career After the war, the postwar Labour government supported Macmillan's appointment as director of Colonial Studies at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. He returned to South Africa for the first time in seventeen years to give the Hoernle Memorial lecture in Durban in 1949. In 1951 the British government sent Macmillan on a three-man observer mission to Bechuanaland to advise on the status of Tshekedi Khama who had been excluded from the Bamangwato Reserve in the wake of the crisis over the marriage of Seretse and Ruth Khama. Macmillan retired from St Andrews in 1954 and served for one year, 1954-5, as acting professor of History at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica. After his wartime experience in West Africa, he became skeptical about the claims of African Nationalism and was broadly supportive of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which the British government saw as a bulwark against the spread of Afrikaner nationalism from the south and African nationalism from the north. Family He married firstly in 1913 Jean Sutherland, daughter of the Reverend John Sutherland of Uitenhague, South Africa, and, secondly, Mona Constance Mary Tweedie, daughter of Admiral Sir Hugh Tweedie, KCB, and his wife, Constance Marion (Mona) Crossman. He acknowledged the help of his first wife in the production of his first four books and of his second wife in the production of his later works. He met Mona Tweedie in 1931 and was married to her after divorce from his first wife in 1936. Mona Macmillan became an author in her own right, publishing Introducing East Africa in 1952, The Land of Look Behind: A Study of Jamaica (1957), Mediator and Moderator: The life of Sir Henry Barkly (1969), Champion of Africa: W.M. Macmillan, the second phase (1985), and a memoir, Mona's Story, posthumously, in 2008. She also edited the writings of the controversial Zambian archbishop, Emmanuel Milingo, and, with her daughter, Catriona, the correspondence of the Pratt family. She died in Oxfordshire in 2003 at the age of 95. There were no children from the first marriage and four children from the second marriage. His elder son, the eminent art historian and writer Duncan Macmillan FRSA FRSE HRSA, is Emeritus Professor of Art History at the University of Edinburgh and was curator of the university's Talbot Rice Gallery. He is the author of books including Scottish Art, 1460-2000, Painting in Scotland: The Golden Age, Painting in Scotland in the Twentieth Century and Scotland's Shrine: The Scottish National War Memorial. He is the art critic of The Scotsman. His younger son, Hugh Macmillan, has worked at universities in Swaziland, Zambia and South Africa, and is currently a research associate at the African Studies Centre, University of Oxford. He is the author of The Lusaka Years: The ANC in Exile in Zambia, 1963–94 (2013); An African Trading Empire: The story of Susman Brothers & Wulfsohn (2005), and of Zion in Africa: The Jews of Zambia (1999, with Frank Shapiro). He has also written pocket biographies of Chris Hani, Jack Simons and Oliver Tambo and is the co-editor with Shula Marks of Africa and Empire: W.M. Macmillan, historian and social critic (1989). His elder daughter, Lindsay, married Alexander Arthur Dow, and had a career as a teacher in Zambia and Scotland. His younger daughter, Catriona, married Colonel Alistair Miller, Queen's Royal Irish Hussars, and had a career as a hotelier in Dorset. She edited, with her mother, Exiles of Empire, the nineteenth century correspondence of the Pratt family between Scotland, India and Australia. Honours Macmillan was awarded honorary degrees of D.Litt. by Oxford University in 1957, University of Natal in 1962, and Edinburgh University in 1974.

On its easternmost tongue, it ends at a glacial tarn, or small ice-choked lake above High Camp. The glacier has decreased in surface area by 47% between 1904 and 2006. In 1901, when Mount Adams was being mapped and its glaciers named by Harry Fielding Reid, Reid's companion and guide, Claude Ewing Rusk, wanted to name the glacier Reid Glacier in honor of Reid; however, Reid insisted that it should be named something else because he thought it improper to place his own name on the map that he was making and the Mazamas were trying to name a glacier on Mount Hood after him. This eventually persuaded Rusk and he conceded to name the glacier Adams Glacier.

Opened in 1993, it is one of four traditional high schools in the Lake Washington School District, serving its eastern portion. Eastlake shares its campus with the Renaissance School of Art and Reasoning, located in portables. Cafeteria, Eastlake High School, Sammamish, Washington Eastlake is one of three high schools on the Sammamish Plateau, all close in proximity along 228th Avenue. Skyline High School, in the Issaquah School District, opened in 1997 and is about south of Eastlake. Between the two public high schools is Eastside Catholic, a private secondary school that relocated to Sammamish in 2008. In the fall of 2012, Lake Washington School District converted its four senior high schools (grades 10-12) to four-year schools (grades 9-12), moving the freshman class for the first time from the Jr. High to the district's High School. In preparation for the expansion of Eastlake's student body, a new wing (E wing) and the gym was built during the summer of 2012. This shift of grades between schools subsequently also resulted in the moving of most 6th Grade classes from the Elementary schools to the now Middle Schools. Academics Eastlake offers honors and Advanced Placement (AP) academic programs to prepare students for upper-division and college-level courses. Foreign languages offered at Eastlake High School include Spanish, French, Japanese, and American Sign Language. Eastlake participates in the Running Start program. Eastlake students in the 11th or 12th grade can enroll in college-level courses at Bellevue College, CWU Sammamish, Cascadia College, or Lake Washington Institute of Technology and earn high school and college credit concurrently. The Lake Washington School District pays the college tuition for a specified number of credits taken; students are usually responsible for fees, books, and transportation. 63% of 2005 graduates attended 4-year colleges and 23% attended 2-year colleges. 97.7% of seniors in the class of 2017 graduated. Extracurricular Athletics EHS is well known for its decent football program. They share tradition in sports with Skyline High School and play for one of the most popular rivalry games in the state, the \\"Battle on the Plateau.\\" They also pride themselves on having a devoted and large fan-base that is considered one of the best in the state. Eastlake High School competes in athletics in WIAA Class 4A in the KingCo 4A conference, and has won many regional and state championships. Completed in January 2006, the school has a multi-purpose sports facility. It features two lighted synthetic surface fields operated by the city of Sammamish in cooperation with the school district. The 400-ft by 350-ft field accommodates baseball, softball, Frisbee, lacrosse, and soccer activities for adults and students year-round. Non- athletics Students at Eastlake have earned a number of awards for activities not related to athletics. Eastlake students received Presidential Scholar awards in 2003, 2008, and 2010. Eastlake High School has a number of clubs and student organizations. These include a number of honor societies such as Computer Science Honor Society, Physics Honor Society, National Honor Society, Math Honor Society, French Honor Society, Spanish Honor Society and Science National Honor Society, as well as career and technical organizations (CTSOs) like TSA, DECA and HOSA, whose chapters send a number of competitors to internationals every year. During the 2018-19 school year, 29 students competed at DECA's ICDC, while 25 students competed at HOSA's ILC.https://ehs.lwsd.org/quicklinks/wolves-weekly-update-newsletter In 2020, Eastlake High School students were elected to represent Washington State at TSA and HOSA. Eastlake was the only school in the district to have a FIRST Robotics Competition robotics team (in 2016 a team at Lake Washington High School was founded). The team, officially known as Top Gun (1294), started in 2004. It has won many runner up awards at various regional events. They qualified for the first time to go to the World Championship in 2014. Again, they qualified and competed to the quarterfinals of the Newton division in 2017. Eastlake's Drama Club has notably augmented under Director Kate Wold, being nominated and honorably mentioned for multiple 5th Avenue Awards. The Drama Program has been mentioned in high honors for Outstanding Chorus two times in the span of three years. In 2018, the orchestra was nominated for Outstanding Performance by an Orchestra for Mary Poppins, having been led by Music Director Chelsee Moe.

In Vietnam the equivalent game is known as Tứ sắc.  History  The game is similar to various Chinese draw-and-discard card games played since the 18th century. The deck for this particular game originated in the 19th century based on Xiangqi pieces on which the names of said pieces are printed on the cards. The cards were typically used by the lower class to play gambling games, and were intended to be easy and cheap to make because, as gambling was illegal in China, there was a need for cards that could be disposed of easily. Also because of the Chinese revolution and lower class connections, written rules for the game are rarely found. Hence there can be many versions of the official rules depending on the region and the household.  Deck  A standard deck consists of 112 cards, divided into four colors, 28 cards each, depicting the seven Chinese chess pieces. In each color there are cards printed with each of the seven pieces of xiangqi, repeated four times each, like in mahjong. Four Color Cards in Fuzhou. Four Color Cards in Taiwan. * General （帥 shuài or 將 jiàng in Chinese） * Advisor (仕 or 士, pinyin: shì) * Elephant (像 or 相, pinyin: xiàng) * Chariot (車 or 俥, pinyin: jū ) * Horseman (馬 or 傌, mǎ) * Cannon (炮 or 包 or 砲, all read pào) * Soldier (兵 bīng or 卒 zú)  Objective  The objective of this game is very similar to mahjong, which is to achieve a winning hand consisting of melds of the following arrangements. Each player has 25 cards in his hand at the start of the game, and a winning hand has 26 cards with a minimum of 20 points, and can go up to 42 points at maximum (almost impossible). Note that each winning hand has to have an odd number of points in the range from 19 to 41. Hence this can be a rough guide for players to check in case they are short of cards or have extra cards.  Setup  Typically, each deck can be played by 2 to 3 players. If there are more players, an extra card set is added for each additional player. For example, for 4 players, a deck (112 cards) and an extra card set (28 cards) is used. For the first game, a dealer is chosen by an arbitrary method. A typical method is for everyone to draw randomly one card from a face down pile to compare ranks, with the highest rank being the dealer. For subsequent games, the winner of the previous game will be the dealer, and the player to the left of the winner will do the job of mixing the played cards to set up the draw pile. The dealer is in charge of the cards getting shuffled and a hand of 20 cards dealt to each player. This is not as easy as it sounds; the cards can't really be riffle-shuffled and have a tendency to fly out of the hand when attempting to overhand shuffle. In general, the cards from the previous game are all rearranged in the center, moved around a bit, and face-up cards are turned over a la mahjong. Special care must be taken so that no card gets bent during the process. The dealer then collects all cards into a nice little stack, does a few overhand cuts, then metes out the hands in packets of 5. Alternatively, the dealer gives himself 6 cards on the first packet, so that he can discard the first card to start the game. The rest of the cards are called the Draw Pile, and is placed in a central location, usually fanned a bit to the side instead of stacked neatly. Future draws are always taken from one end of the Draw Pile. A player holds their cards in a fan. Inexperienced players are usually discouraged from the difficulty of holding the long and slim cards, but sometimes they are allowed to put their cards face down on the ground. Some players take pre- existing melds that they do not plan to touch and put them in one big facedown stack next to them.  The play  Most turns consist of the following sequences of steps, described in detail below.: *1. Draw. *2. Meld. *3. Discard.  1. Draw  The player takes the top card of the Draw Pile and flips it over in front of him for all to see. The player does not take the card into his hand.  2. Meld  The player (or other players) may, if he wishes, bring out cards from his hand to meld (create a meld) with the drawn card. He may bring out any number of cards up to three and including zero as long as exactly one meld is created that includes the drawn card. Determining who gets to meld the card is done by comparing the priority conditions as described below. The meld is left face up on the table. The player cannot use cards that are not in his hand to meld. Specifically, he cannot use previously opened melds, but he can break up or use melds in his hand. If, after a meld, a player's hand consists completely of melds or is empty, the player can declare that he has won, and display his hand. The current game is then over and the hand is scored (see below).  3. Discard  If the player decided to meld the drawn, he may then discard any card he wishes. It is laid face-up on his right hand side so that all players may see it, especially the player on his right hand side. If the player decided not to or was unable to meld the draw, he must discard the draw. In practice, Generals are never discarded (due to their one-meld nature giving 1 point), and it is reasonable to make a ruling that Generals cannot be discarded. If, after a discard, a player's hand consists completely of melds or is empty, the player has NOT won, since he has only 20 cards. He needs another One-card meld to win. After the Discard, the next player, sitting to the right (anti-clockwise), begins his turn. This is the basic sequence of play. However, there are two other modifications to play that can change this sequence, specifically, * Melding another's Draw; and * Melding another's Discard. The modification is quite simple; under certain conditions, a player can meld another player's draw or discard card. Play immediately shifts to the player who claimed the card, who then treats the situation as if he had just melded a card, and then discards a card. Play then proceeds to the right of that person, as normal. As a consequence of this, players in between may lose their turn, and a player may even lose the chance to meld his own draw. When in conflict, a lower number takes priority over a higher number. Note that 1 and 4 are not really stealing someone else's draw but rather using one's own draw. *1. A person winning on his own draw takes priority over anything below. He should call \\"zhimo\\". *2. If the card is needed to win immediately by completing any type of meld, the player calls \\"hu\\", and can meld the other person's card to win. If several players call \\"hu\\", the player whose turn would come first in normal order gets priority. Any player may call \\"hu\\". *3. If the card is needed to finish a Quad (not a Four-Footman Group), the player calls \\"gan\\", and can meld the other person's card. If the card is needed to finish a Triple, the player calls \\"pong\\", and can meld the other person's card. Any player may call \\"gan\\" or \\"pong\\". *4. If the card is needed to finish a Group (Command, Field, Three-Footman, or Four- Footman) or a One-card meld (but not a Pair, a player may claim it when he himself has just drawn that card. *5. If the card is needed to finish a Group (Command, Field, Three-Footman, or Four-Footman), a player may claim it when the previous player (and no other) has just drawn or discarded that card. The player should call \\"chi\\". Note that a player may not complete a one card meld (namely the one card General meld) from another player's draw or discard unless it is for a win. Naturally, this means that if a player draws up a General card, he has to discard another card from his hand and not discard the drawn General card, unless another player has a Triple of the said General card and wishes to make a Quad (to get more points).  Melds & Scoring   One-card meld  *Hidden (1 point) *Exposed (1 point) This meld can only be formed using the General card. Thus every General card is a one-card meld by itself unless combining them together allows the player to get more points as shown in the following cases. Every one-card meld scores one point, whether it is exposed or in the player's hand.  Two-card meld  *Hidden (0 points) *Exposed (0 points) This meld can only be formed with any two identical cards (same character and color). However, this meld scores no points and therefore, two General cards are almost always treated separately as one-card melds to score one point each for a total of two points. For the non-General cards, players often aim to complete a three-card meld by calling \\"Pong\\" when a third identical card is drawn by oneself or the opponent. It is important to note that cards with identical characters but different colours cannot be used to form two-card melds.  Three-card Meld  There are a couple of types for three-card melds:  Command group  *Hidden (1 point) *Exposed (1 point) This meld consists of a General, Advisor, and Elephant in the same suit (colour). This scores one point whether it is exposed or in the player's hand. Thus there is no reason for the General card to be used in this way unless it is to achieve the winning hand quickly and the player has enough points from other melds.  Field group  *Hidden (1 point) *Exposed (1 point) This meld consists of a Chariot, Horseman, and Cannon in the same suit (colour). This scores one point whether it is exposed or in the player's hand.  Triple  *Hidden (3 points) *Exposed (1 point) Analogous to the pong in mahjong, this meld is formed by three identical cards (in both suit and rank). This scores one point when it is exposed and three points when in the player's hand (with the exception of the General card). A triple of the General card scores three points whether it is exposed or in the player's hand (treat each General card as a one-card meld).  Three different colour group  *Hidden (1 point) *Exposed (1 point) This meld consists of three identical cards in rank but in different colours. It scores one point whether it is exposed or in the player's hand.  Four-card Meld  There are a couple of types for four-card melds:  Quadruple  *Hidden (8 points) *Exposed (6 points) Analogous to the kong in mahjong, this meld is formed by four identical cards (in both suit and rank). This scores six points when it is exposed and eight points when in the player's hand. This is the only scenario where the General card should not be treated separately as one-card melds since a quadruple scores more points than the four points of the four one-card melds.  Complete color group  *Hidden (4 points) *Exposed (4 points) This meld consists of four identical cards in rank but in different colors. It scores four points whether it is exposed or in the player's hand.  Reshuffling  A player is entitled to declare the current round void and redeal all hands if his starting hand does not have at least one of the following: * One-card Meld of the General (1 point) * Three-card Meld of the Triple (3 points) * Four-card Meld of the Quadruple (8 points) or Complete Color Group (4 points)  Etiquette  Players are expected to call out drawn cards and discards as they are shown. It is considered poor etiquette to: * delay a call just to see what the player will do with his draw. * refuse a player's priority call on your drawn card, even if you have already melded it—players should meld their drawn cards only after everyone has had a chance to see it, but if they don't, it's their own fault. * make a call on a draw or discard after the next draw or discard has been made, i.e., no retroactive calls.

Playing career Swift was born in Oakengates, Shropshire and spent his early club career with Stoke and Crewe Alexandra, before he joined Football League club Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1891. He made his Wolves debut on 14 September 1891 in a 5–0 win over Accrington, one of four appearances that season. He was an ever-present in the 1892–93 season, which included the club winning their first ever FA Cup when they defeated Everton in the final. He moved to Loughborough after the subsequent season and later played at Leicester Fosse, Notts County and Leeds City before retiring in 1906. He represented England against Ireland in the Inter-League match at the Victoria Ground, Stoke-on-Trent, in November 1895. Coaching and management career Chesterfield After retiring from playing, he became trainer at Leeds City where he stayed for two seasons. Swift had a good deal of influence on onfield activities and gave manager Gilbert Gillies great support before taking the post of manager at Chesterfield in summer 1907. He spent three years at Chesterfield, with no conspicuous success. In his first season in charge, Chesterfield finished second from bottom of Football League Second Division but were re-elected. The following season (1908–09) they finished in the same position but this time failed to be re-elected. There then followed a season in the Midland League, where Chesterfield were champions at the end of the 1909–10 season. Swift left Chesterfield in May 1910 before moving south to become secretary-manager at The Dell in April 1911. Southampton Prior to Swift's appointment, the Saints had been \\"managed\\" by the board under the company secretary, Ernest Arnfield, with Bill Dawson as trainer. The board had made a concerted effort to find a manager who could end the team's dreadful run of form (which had seen them drop to 17th place in the Southern League at the end of the 1910–11 season), and interviewed 140 applicants. Following the appointment of Swift, Dawson (who had been trainer for seventeen years) resigned and Arnfield moved to financial secretary. In the first six weeks of Swift's brief reign he spent £820 recruiting eleven new players. Unfortunately, the appointment of a full-time manager failed to stop the rot and the 1911–12 season was another disappointment with the team finishing in 16th place, resulting in Swift's resignation.

It allows potentially hundreds of users to collaborate live, sharing all or part of their persistent workspace and all data contained therein. It is the core platform for the Army's Command Post of the Future, USTRANSCOM's TransViz software, and Array BioPharma's Discovery product. CoMotion builds substantially on earlier work developed at Carnegie Mellon University, MAYA Design Inc., and DARPA. Data visualization in software often uses a selected Model (as in Model–View–Controller) to organize the information. CoMotion treats the model and the view as data, so that the underlying information can be seen through different models or different views simultaneously. In CoMotion jargon this is known as a \\"blueprint\\" of how a visualization is seen. The \\"frame\\", or view, can be shared amongst different users of the software. Even with the same underlying information, it's possible for two users to interact around different blueprints or different frames. All data is stored in \\"u-forms\\", which are a universal property list (name-value pairs) that can contain basic types, arrays, and links to other u-forms. This directed graph of u-forms forms the basis for all data in the system, including visualized data, blueprints, as well as the frame locations and clipping states. Until the commercialization of CoMotion, no enterprise software products existed that allowed for this interaction. Prior, all systems either collaborated on the data itself, or only on the view of that data.

Captain Weymouth's expedition in Penobscot Bay in Maine Voyages George Weymouth (c. 1585-c. 1612) was a native of Cockington, Devon, who spent his youth studying shipbuilding and mathematics. In 1602 Weymouth was hired to seek a northwest passage to India by the recently formed East India Company.Dunbabin, Thomas \\"Waymouth, George\\", Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 1, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003–, accessed November 5, 2015 He sailed the ship Discovery 300 miles into Hudson StraitGlyn Williams,\\"Arctic Labyrinth\\",2009, p. 45 but turned back on July 26, as the year was far spent and many men were ill. Weymouth reached Dartmouth on September 5, 1602. 1605 expedition In March 1605 Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour and Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton sent Captain Weymouth to found a colony in Virginia under the ruse of searching again for a northwest passage.Akrigg, G.P.V. (1968) Weymouth sailed from England on March 31, 1605 on the ship ArchangelDrake, Samuel Adams. The Pine-tree Coast, (Estes & Lauriat, 1890), 218. and landed near Monhegan off the coast of Maine on May 17, 1605. A report of the voyage, written by James Rosier (hired by Arundell to make detailed observations), was published soon after the expedition's return. The pamphlet described the physical resources available to settlers on the islands and coast of Maine (harbors, rivers, soil, trees, wild fruit and vegetables, and so forth). James Rosier, would write that Monhegan was \\"woody, growen with Firre, Birch, Oke and Beech, as farre as we say along the shore; and so likely to be within. On the verge grow Gooseberries, Strawberries, Wild pease, and Wilde rose bushes.\\"\\" Rosier's Relation of George Weymouth's 1605 Voyage\\", in Ronald F. Banks, Ed., 1969, A History of Maine: A Collection of Readings on the History of Maine 1600 - 1974, Third Edition, scanned online by Davistown Museum, accessed 20 Oct 2009 The compelling part of the story, however, is the crew's encounters with the Natives, which began eleven days after the Archangel first moored among the Georges Islands, on May 30, 1605, as the ship was anchored in Muscongus Bay and the captain and 13 men had gone off in the shallop to explore. The report tells how the remaining crew had a chance encounter that afternoon with a hunting party, developed a sign language with them, and over several days encouraged their trust with gifts and then trade. Pemaquid, Maine with a sword he magnetized by means of a lodestone. On his return, Weymouth joined in the hospitality, offering the Natives bread and peas which they were unfamiliar with and amazing them with a sword magnetized with a lodestone.http://www.kellscraft.com/StoriesOfMaine/StoriesOfMaineCh03.html \\"Stories of Main\\" After three days of hospitality and trading, Rosier suggested that the crew visit their homes to trade. Rosier wrote that cultivating their trust was part of the plan to colonize once they had decided that the land was prime for European settlement. On June 3, as they themselves had suggested, the English set out to visit their homes. They became skittish when a large assembly came to escort them and decided not to go. Rosier claimed that they then decided to kidnap a number of Natives, from their belief that the Natives intended mischief. > These things considered, we began to joyne them in the ranke of other > Salvages, who have beene by travellers in most discoveries found very > trecherous; never attempting mischiefe, until by some remisnesse, fit > opportunity affordeth them certain ability to execute the same. Wherefore > after good advise taken we determined so soone as we could to take some of > them, least (being suspicious we had discovered their plots) they should > absent themselves from us. reprinted at . So the next day they abducted five Natives, three by duplicity and two by violence. In discussing the violence necessary to grab hold of two Natives, Rosier lets fall that the kidnapping had been long planned, saying that they would have risked greater violence to secure their victims because the capture of Natives was \\"a matter of great importance for the full accomplement of our voyage\\". reprinted at . The idea was undoubtedly conceived by the entrepreneurs back in England as a way to become familiar with the land and inhabitants that they intended to conquer. The plan operated, however, at cross-purposes with their attempt to create good will. Not long after Weymouth's crew had left, Champlain, sailing from the north, met a man named Anaffon, a minor trader in furs, at Monhegan Island on July 31. The Native told Champlain of the English who had been there fishing not long before and \\"under cover of friendship\\" had murdered five Natives of the area. The English had not hidden their perfidy; instead, they were thought to have committed worse crimes than they did. Weymouth returned to England in mid June.\\"Annual Report of the Director, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, to the Secretary of Commerce\\", U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, 1885 All five hostages were taken to England. They were Amoret, Tahanedo, sagamore Manedo, Sketwarroes, and Saffacomoit, a servant; Weymouth presented the latter three to Sir Ferdinando Gorges, governor of Plymouth Fort, piquing his interest in exploration.\\"The Plymouth Company\\", Report and Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science, Literature, and Art, Vol. 14, Devon, England, 1882, pg. 342 Gorges was an investor in the Weymouth voyage and became the chief promoter of the scheme when Arundell withdrew from the project. reprinted at . In a book published in 1658, a decade after Gorges had died, and presumably written when Gorges was quite old, Gorges wrote of his delight in Weymouth's kidnapping, and named Squanto as one of the three given over to him. > Captain George Weymouth, having failed at finding a Northwest Passage, > happened into a River on the Coast of America, called Pemmaquid, from whence > he brought five of the Natives, three of whose names were Manida, > Sellwarroes, and Tasquantum, whom I seized upon, they were all of one > Nation, but of severall parts, and severall Families; This accident must be > acknowledged the meanes under God of putting on foote, and giving life to > all our Plantations .... reprinted at . Circumstantial evidence makes nearly impossible the claim that it was Squanto among the three taken by Gorges, and no modern historian entertains this as fact. The abductions were an intentional policy of the English entrepreneurs. The abduction of Natives became a regular feature of the English colonial enterprise. Gorges, chief among the entrepreneurs, wanted to impress on the Natives the superiority of the English technology and military might that would back colonists, and the colonial entrepreneurs wanted to learn as much as they could from their captives about the lands and peoples of the New World. And they displayed their victims prominently to attract financing and public support for their commercial project. It is more difficult to understand how they continued the policy after the experience with these first captives. Two of the captives, Manedo and Sassacomit, were sent back with Captain Henry Chollons in 1606, but the ship was intercepted by the Spanish. Manedo was lost, but Sassacomit, seriously injured, was lodged in a Spanish prison. reprinted in . See also . Sassacomit was forced to escape his bondage in Spain and make his way to England before he could be returned to his home in what is now Maine. Two other of the kidnapped Abenaki were returned to Maine in connection with Gorges's plan to found a trading colony there. His idea was that the returned Abenaki would act as liaison between the English settlers and the local population. Instead of providing a safe entrée for the English escorting him, however, one of the two, Skidwarres, had to be forced to identify himself so that the Natives would stop the attack they made on the English. Skidwarres once home, did not persuade the Abenaki to trade with the English but instead warned them to be wary of them. The conduct of Skidwarres and fellow abductee Tahanedo, nurtured the mistrust that would eventually doom the Sagadahoc colony. This experience did not deter Gorges or other English entrepreneurs from continuing the practice of abducting local men to be transported to England. In fact it would be used in the Cape Cod area as well. Weymouth named the island Saint George after the patron saint of England.

Although staffed disproportionately by women, since the 1960s, nursing has gradually become more gender-inclusive. Males make up around 10% of the taskforce in the UK, 6.4% of nurses in Canada, and 23% of nurses in Iran. In 2011 in the United States, there were approximately 3.5 million nurses, with approximately 330,000 (9%) of those being male. History While the current structure of the medical field, including nursing care, does not directly translate to historical provision of care, there is a history of male presence in caring for the sick and infirmed. The term nosocomial originates from the latin nosocomi, the name given to male caregivers, meaning that men were prominent in Ancient Rome. Years later, during the plagues that swept through Europe, male nurses were also the primary caregivers. In the 3rd century, men in the Parabolani created a hospital and provided nursing care. The Codex Theodosianus of 416 (xvi, 2, 42) restricted the enrollment on male nurses in Alexandria to 500.Parabolani: from Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913. In the 14th century, the Alexian brothers existed as a Christian religious congregation with strong emphasis on care for the infirmed. Later, John of God, following a conversion to Christianity, provided care for both the physically and mentally ill and notably challenged the stigmas associated with Mental Illness. Later, he founded the Brothers Hospitallers of Saint John of God which continues to work with the poor and infirmed to this day. Reasons for low representation There are several reasons suggested for a low rates of nursing by males: stereotypes of nursing, lack of male interest in the profession, low pay, nursing job titles such as Sister and Matron, and the perception that male nurses will have difficulty in the workplace carrying out their duties. It is argued by the Chief Executive of the Royal College of Nursing that the \\"continuing stereotyping\\" of male nurses is the main reason for low intake. Selected studies have showed that low representation of male’s nurses due to concerns that their touch when providing care would be misinterpreted and result in accusations of sexual inappropriateness. Another reason as to why there’s low rates of male nurses is due to lack of encouragement to pursue this occupation. One reason being that men aren’t being encouraged by another male nurse or nursing student because there’s too few of them. Men also report that there are no other men in nursing classes, and at times they’re discouraged from participating in all student activities.  Efforts to increase representations  Unlike the campaigns and groups set up to increase and promote women's opportunities in medicine surgery, engineering and computer science there have been no comparable campaigns to increase the number of males in nursing. One way to increase male nurses’ rate could be for nurse educators and nursing curriculum developers to enhance and promote a gender-neutral stance in nursing practice which reduces men in nursing being seen as unique. Another strategy could be to consider a professional title that is mutually accepted by both women and men in nursing, which can lead to reducing men as a gendered minority. Another way could be for schools to implement educational programs that increase cultural sensitivity, decrease stereotyping, develop skills for working in multicultural environments, and compare and contrast male and female communication styles. In Northern Ireland, a campaign ran by Queen's University has been aimed at getting more males interested in nursing, with varying levels of success. Professional life Whilst there are low numbers of male nurses, there is no indication that they suffer in their career. Pay disparity results in male nurses earning more than their female counterparts, mainly from taking on more shifts and working overtime. Anecdotal evidence suggests that male nurses are more likely to be fast-tracked into management positions. Furthermore, a report into the role of men in nursing found there to be more focus on human caring amongst male nurses. In a nationwide sample 4,126 women and 395 men, men earned an average of $79,688 a year compared to an average of $73,090 for female nurses. This shows that there’s nearly a $6,000 difference in pay between male and female nurses. Timelines United Kingdom The Society of Registered Male Nurses merged with the RCN (Royal College of Nursing) in 1941. After the Second World War, large numbers of male nurses moved into the workforce as they were demobilised after the war and had gained medical experience. In 1951 the male nurses joined the main nursing register. In 2004 the percentage of male nurses was 10.63% and has increased to 10.69% in 2008, then to 11.4% in 2016. In 2015 there were 103 male midwives on the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) nursing register, compared to 31,189 women. United States In 2008, of the 3,063,163 licensed registered nurses in the United States only 6.6% of were men. Men make up only 13% of all new nursing students. Nursing schools for men were common in the United States until the early 1900s. More than half of those offering paid nursing services to the ill and injured were men. Yet by 1930, men constituted fewer than 1% of Registered Nurses (RNs) in the United States. As they found other, more lucrative occupations, they left nursing behind.Occupational Segregation and the Devaluation of Women's Work across U.S. Labor Markets, Cohen, Philip N., Huffman, Matt L., Social Forces, Volume 81, Number 3, March 2003, pp. 881-908, The University of North Carolina Press. In 1955, the United States Congress revised the Army-Navy Nurses Act of 1947 to allow for the commissioning of men into military nursing corps. The American Assembly for Men in Nursing was founded in 1971. The purpose of the AAMN is to provide a framework for nurses as a group to meet, discuss, and influence factors that affect men as nurses. In Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718 (1982), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5–4 that Mississippi University for Women's single sex admissions policy for its nursing school violated the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the landmark opinion. In popular culture Many nurses portrayed in U.S. television and film are female, and equality advocates complain about the frequency with which nurses are used for sexual interest, are invisible to the story, or when heroic male doctors are portrayed performing functions that would realistically be performed by a nurse. A 2012 study of 13 male nurse characters in films found most were portrayed as incompetent, corrupt, effeminate, or homosexual. * Joey Henderson (Shortland Street) * Jack McFarland (Will & Grace) * Peter Petrelli (Heroes) * Charlie Fairhead (Casualty) * Paul Flowers (Scrubs) * Gaylord \\"Greg\\" Focker (Meet the Parents, Meet the Fockers), criticized by many inclusion advocates as particularly unhelpfulMale Nurses Break Through Barriers to Diversify Profession\\"Forget About the Stigma\\": Male Nurses Explain Why Nursing Is a Job of the Future for Men * Sam, Mohammed de la Cruz, and Thor Lundgren (Nurse Jackie) * Morgan Tookers (The Mindy Project) * Rory Williams (Doctor Who) Notable men in nursing Walt Whitman and his male nurse Fritzenger (July 1890). * Chris Colvin: First Male Nurse * Tom Ahrens: an American nurse, researcher and educator at Barnes-Jewish Hospital specializing in critical care nursing. * Justus A.

It was built as a New Deal project from 1935 to 1937. With In 1995 the auditorium was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its local significance in the themes of architecture, politics/government, and social history. It was nominated for being an exemplary multipurpose municipal building funded by the New Deal, as well as Minnesota's largest project by the State Emergency Relief Administration, and a longstanding venue for community events. Description The Deerwood Auditorium is a large, rectangular, two-story building. It features reinforced concrete walls faced with split fieldstone and Moderne-style cast stone trim. A medium-pitch gable roof completes the building. The facility became home to Deerfield's city council, public library, fire equipment, and later the police department. A gymnasium with a stage on the north end doubles as an auditorium. The second floor contains a balcony on either side of the auditorium, while the first floor also houses a kitchen and locker rooms. These spaces allowed the building to be used for a variety of purposes. Sporting events, community meetings, plays, and banquets have all been held in the building. Other events have included lectures, company meetings, exhibits, fraternal gatherings, and graduations. Origin Village officials had been discussing building a community hall in 1933, but during the Great Depression, the town was strapped for cash. Beriah Magoffin Jr., a local resident, secured an option on a lot occupied by the Hilyar Oil Station. He donated it to the village for the auditorium. He had also bought a building from the Evergreen Mining Company located at the Meacham Mine. The structure could be dismantled and its materials used for a new building. There was however still a need for funds to actually build the structure. Fortunately President Franklin D. Roosevelt had launched federal programs to build lasting infrastructure improvements while providing employment and economic relief. In a special session on October 9, 1934, the Deerfield Village Council met with Fred Pfeifer, the supervising architect of the State Emergency Relief Administration (SERA), to discuss the construction of the building. The auditorium was designed by Carl H. Buetow, who had worked for a while under Clarence H. Johnston, Sr., a notable civic architect in Minnesota. Many local materials were used in an effort to save on costs. In particular, local men collected nearly 800 tons of fieldstone for the facing of the building. Some material, such as brick, was salvaged from the old Meacham Mine building. Construction Deerwood's community hall project was built by local funds and relief labor at a cost of $43,000 (). In early March 1935 a crew of 25 men began hauling the stone to the site. By mid-month about one-third of the rock had been transported. Most of it was gathered from the Cuyuna Country Club golf grounds. By early April excavation for the basement and trenches for the foundation footings had begun. On August 2, 1935, construction was stopped with only a portion of the walls completed. The work programs of SERA had been cancelled and transferred to the Works Progress Administration (WPA). However, all current SERA projects had to be resubmitted to the WPA for approval before work could resume. In late August, Victor Christgau, the state WPA administrator, announced that the project had been approved, and work continued. However, in August 1936 it was announced that work on the auditorium would cease because funds had been depleted. It was necessary to wait for a new appropriation. The workers were assigned to other WPA projects, but five stayed on to complete the auditorium's roof. By early September the walls were complete. It was hoped that interior work would be finished by November for the town's annual lutefisk dinner. Additional funds for the building were approved by the WPA in early October 1936. Work on the building resumed with a full crew. When the lutefisk dinner was held in late October, attendance was estimated at 1,000. The Deerwood Enterprise noted that \\"The new municipal auditorium thus received its initiation as a community center for Deerwood activities.\\" By February 1, 1937, the village council was meeting in the new building. Significance The Deerwood Auditorium is a prime example of a modern municipal facility made possible by the relief programs of the New Deal. It provided local residents with an auditorium and gymnasium space, council chambers, a library, and a fire hall. The building expanded the range of services available to the residents of Deerwood and enhanced their quality of life. The exterior of the auditorium was renovated in 2010 to preserve its historic appearance. As of the early 21st century it remains the town's most prominent building.

In the , Pimpama had a population of 9,396 people. Geography leftPimpama is located on the Pacific Motorway north of Surfers Paradise. The township of Pimpama is the last remaining rural town on the Pacific Motorway between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. It has a large area of undeveloped land. With the urban development of the region, Pimpama's population has had rapid growth, increasing by 92%.Australian Bureau of Statistics, Regional Population Growth, Australia (cat. no. 3218.0) The Pimpama River marks the northern boundary of the suburb, which flows from the Darlington Range at Kingsholme down to Moreton Bay. Hotham Creek also flows through the suburb and meets with Pimpama River to the north-east of the suburb.  History  Pimpama State School, 1878 Arrowroot crop, 1897 Yugembah (also known as Yugumbir, Jugambel, Jugambeir, Jugumbir, Jukam, Jukamba) is one of the Australian Aboriginal languages in areas that include the Beenleigh, Beaudesert, Gold Coast, Logan, Scenic Rim, Albert River, Coolangatta, Coomera, Logan River, Pimpama, Tamborine and Tweed River Valley, within the local government boundaries of the City of Gold Coast, City of Logan, Scenic Rim Regional Council and the Tweed River Valley. The name Pimpama is reportedly derived from Bundjalung language (Yugumbir dialect), pim pim ba or bim bim ba, meaning place of soldier (mickey) birds. Much of the Pimpama district had been taken up in the 1850s by William Duckett White of Beau Desert Station, who leased between the Logan and Coomera Rivers, including upper Hotham Creek (a tributary of Pimpama River), as Pimpama run. A small settlement was established on Pimpama River c1860, but the site was abandoned within a few years in preference to Hotham Creek. Much of Pimpama run was thrown open for selection from April 1869, and White forfeited his remaining leasehold on Pimpama from 1 January 1870. The private subdivision and sale in February 1870 of town and farm lots at the junction of the Pimpama River and Hotham Creek, consolidated Pimpama township and initiated a small farming community of mostly Irish settlers. In the 1860s, farmers along the Pimpama River experimented firstly with cotton growing, then with sugar, both of which initially were dependent on South Pacific Islands labour. The first sawmill in South East Queensland was built at Pimpama in 1863 by Jesse Daniells. Irish-born settlers William Doherty and his wife Eliza Fannon had arrived in Queensland by September 1867. It appears that they were Residents in Brisbane until November 1869 at least, but had moved to the Pimpama district by August 1870, when William Doherty signed a local petition calling for a provisional school to be established in the area. It is not known where in Pimpama the Doherty family lived at this period, but William Doherty worked on a number of local sugar plantations and farms before taking up his own selections in the mid-1870s. From about 1868 Pimpama was the terminus of Cobb & Co Coach services from Brisbane. As a result of this, two hotels were built on either side of Hotham Creek, neither of which remain today. The route was extended to Nerang in 1882. The first commercial arrowroot in Pimpama was grown in the late 1860s, and the Lahey family, who moved to Pimpama in 1870 and eventually took up Sunnyside, adjoining William Doherty on Hotham Creek, went into arrowroot cultivation on a large scale, inventing a mechanical processing method which revolutionised the production of arrowroot, and marketing arrowroot under their own brand. The Pimpama selectors of the 1870s, searching for a new commercial crop, discovered that the climate, soil, and abundance of pure water in the Pimpama district were ideal for the cultivation and manufacture of arrowroot. Arrowroot gave about the same return as maize or potatoes, but was more frost, drought and flood resistant. By 1884, arrowroot was widely grown in the Pimpama and Coomera districts, and a number of new manufacturing plants were being established. Most of the selections along upper Hotham Creek were surveyed in 1871, but not proclaimed for selection until August 1874. In the interim, many farmers were 'squatting' on these selections, with no guarantee that they would ultimately secure the land as leasehold. Pimpama State School opened on 15 April 1872. In October 1874, Doherty selected portion 21, parish of Pimpama ( of second class pastoral land on Hotham Creek, on which Laurel Hill Farmhouse was later built). The block already contained some improvements, including a slab barn and a small humpy, and about of scrub cleared and partly under cultivation, for which Doherty paid £20, and was issued with a conditional lease on the property for 10 years from 1 January 1875. At the same time he selected the adjoining portion 31 [135 acres], on which existing improvements comprised a bark-roofed barn, a small slab house, some cleared scrub and a small stockyard. It appears that the Dohertys resided on portion 31 from October 1874 until mid-1879, when they moved to portion 21. In 1879, Doherty also acquired the lease to portion 151, an block which abutted the eastern boundary of portion 21. By December 1876 the main Pimpama sugar plantations (Ormeau, Malungmavel, Pimpama and Yahwulpah) had ceased production, and were devoted either to cattle or arrowroot, but some smaller farms in the district continued with sugar growing for several decades. Podinga Provisional School opened on 5 August 1878. In 1892 it was renamed Ormeau Provisional School. On 1 January it became Ormeau State School. Laurel Hill Farmhouse, a single- storeyed timber farm house with attic, was erected in 1883-84 for Pimpama arrowroot grower and manufacturer, William Doherty. Laurel Hill Farmhouse was one of the finest residences in the area, being photographed in 1897 by the Queensland Lands Department as a model example of a Queensland home on a selection. The builder was Alexander Fortune of Coomera who had himself been granted 880 acres of crown land for pastoral use. In January 1884 he obtained title to portions 21 & 31, and embarked on substantial improvements to the property, which he had named Laurel Hill. A fine new house, erected for the Dohertys by Coomera builder Alexander Fortune, was completed by late January 1884. [This is understood to be the existing Laurel Hill Farmhouse.] Fortune, resident in the Coomera district by 1872, was a carpenter by trade, and had erected Coomera State School and an Anglican church at upper Coomera. At Laurel Hill, William Doherty raised cattle and grew various crops. By 1884 he had between 40 and under arrowroot, and erected his own factory in the first half of the year. Remnants of this mill survive. Before the turn of the century, he purchased Pimpama Plantation at Ormeau, [approximately which he used for grazing purposes], and c1901 acquired Sunnyside, the Lahey family's substantial arrowroot plantation adjacent to Laurel Hill on Hotham Creek. Following William Doherty's death in 1904, the properties were divided between his three sons: Laurel Hill went to William Alexander [Alex], Sunnyside [renamed Willowvale by the Dohertys] to Thomas, and Pimpama to Robert. On 24 January 1889 the old South Coast railway line opened from Beenleigh to Southport. Pimpama was served by Pimpama railway station (). The line and the station closed on 30 June 1964. By 1908, Queensland farmers on about a dozen farms in the Yatala, Pimpama, Ormeau and Nerang districts, were supplying almost the whole of the arrowroot used in Australia. Doherty Brothers of Hotham Creek and Robert Doherty of Ormeau, with together approximately under arrowroot [or 50% of the total under arrowroot in these districts], were among the largest arrowroot growers/producers in Australia. The Willowvale arrowroot mill was moved further downstream on Hotham Creek, closer to the Pacific Highway at Pimpama, and continued production until the mid-1930s. Alex Doherty at Laurel Hill turned to dairying in the early 1920s before retiring to the Gold Coast c1947. Subsequently, the property was purchased by the Miles family of Pimpama, with title to Laurel Hill transferred in 1950. Members of this family resided in the house until mid-October 1997. The Doherty family were prominent members of the local community, involved in church and civic affairs. William Doherty was a trustee of Pimpama School of Arts and served as a councillor on Coomera Divisional Board from c1887 to c1889. His son Thomas later became chairman of Coomera Shire. Some changes to the farmhouse were made during the Doherty family's occupation. There is evidence of minor re- arrangement of internal partition walls, and the staircase to the attic has been removed and the stairwell enclosed, possibly in the 1920s. The ceiling linings in several of the rooms may date to the 1920s also. The original kitchen wing reputedly burnt down in the late 1920s, and was replaced with the present kitchen building. From 1930 onwards there was a move toward dairy farming in the Pimpama/Willow Vale region; more recently these farms were used for fattening cattle. Lutheran Ormeau Rivers District School opened on 23 January 2006. Pimpama State Secondary College opened 1 January 2013. Pimpama State Primary College opened 1 January 2015. King's Christian College opened its second campus in Pimpama in 2015; their first campus opened at Reedy Creek in 1980 and their third campus opened in Chambers Flat in 2020. In the , Pimpama had a population of 9,396 people. Heritage listings Pimpama has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 246 Creek Street (former Pacific Highway): Pimpama & Ormeau War MemorialGold Coast Local Heritage Register - N to Z, pp. 95-96 * 193 Rifle Range Road: former Pimpama Rifle Range * Ruffles Road, Willow Vale: Laurel Hill Farmhouse (the farmhouse is now within the modern suburb of Willow Vale but was historically in Pimpama)  Urban planning  For the twenty years prior to 2010 most of the population of Pimpama was concentrated in the Canowindra estate, located in the north of the suburb. This estate, first developed in the 1980s is often referred to as a suburb itself. Hawthorne Woods, an estate built since 2000 across the motorway from the township also contained a large portion of the population. At this time the hamlet of Pimpama consisted of a general store surrounded by a handful of homes. Some employment was offered by a large sawmill and hardware business, and by the ambulance training station serving the Pacific Motorway. The owners of the general store, Jenny Houston and her son Robert, had enlarged the property to include a bar and a small restaurant. Extensive and intensive urban development came to Pimpama in the first decade of the 21st century, as a result of planning that had started ten years earlier. In 1995 the City of Gold Coast Council (GCCC) and the Queensland Government collaborated in staging \\"The Coomera Charrette Planning Study\\". By that year, there was general agreement between the Commonwealth Government, the Queensland Government, and the GCCC that in the northern part of the territory administered by the GCCC a new urban area should be created, involving a new city centre based at Coomera, in what had previously been mainly rural land. This proposal bore similarities to the earlier Robina project in the south, and a justification was that in large parts of the Pimpama/Coomera area there had been rural subdivisions in the 1970s that had created wide many 2-5 hectare parcels, thought to be useless for anything except further subdivision into much smaller lots. The innovative Charrette method, never before used in Queensland, assembled everyone who at that time had an interest in the development of the area. Participants included local residents and landowners; clubs and associations; land developers; state and federal officials representing road and railway authorities; GCCC personnel involved in planning, sewerage, water, traffic and so on, and many others. The intention was that this diverse group would be put into a ‘pressure cooker’ environment for a week, charged with coming up with overall concept plans for further consideration by the various authorities. It was purely a study, with no executive power. The Charrette zone straddled the Pacific Highway, with its northern boundary on Hotham Creek and southern boundary on the Coomera river. The total area was over 5,000 hectares, comprising at the time 1207 separate rateable properties in 603 different ownerships. The GCCC Local Area Plans that flowed eventually from the Charrette - pretty closely following its recommendations - comprised one of the largest re-zonings in south-east Queensland, intended to house 66,000 people. It was held during the week of 28 June to 3 July 1995. The Charrette leader was Professor Paul Murrain, a highly regarded English urban planning consultant who was imported for the occasion and proved an inspirational speaker. The Charrette process sent a signal to anyone who was paying attention that in due course there would indeed be large-scale rezoning in the Pimpama district. Land developers (the word speculator is also applicable) moved in and a great many properties changed hands before any official rezoning took place, in many cases leading to the consolidation of large parcels. One of the leading developers to emerge in Pimpama was Mirvac Ltd., who acquired a very large tract running along the northern side of Yawalpah Road practically for its entire length (at the time) including the Gainsborough Greens golf course and several farms. Ormeau railway station is the closest rail station Significant construction works moved ahead in and around Coomera (which had sewerage connections to the existing Coombabah facility) but similar activity in Pimpama had to await environmental studies associated with the construction of the Pimpama Waste Water Treatment Plant, which was not begun until 2006. The completion of Stage 1 late in 2008, with associated trunk sewers, signalled the launch of a spate of housing subdivisions.  Tourism  Ormeau state school, 2014 Pimpama is home to a few tourist attractions. The Strawberry Farm is a working farm located in the township. It is home to a variety of animals, as well as a kiosk. The Le Mans complex contains Australia's only Zorb course, as well as a go-kart track. Gainsborough Greens, a golf course is also located in the suburb. Another golf course, Pacific Springs was partly demolished to make way for the Pacific Motorway upgrade in the early 2000s. Remains of the course, as well as the street formerly accessing the course still exist, west of the Hotham Creek crossing of the motorway.

Pirates from Morocco and Algeria, under the command of Dutch pirate Murat Reis, raided the village of Grindavík on the southwestern coast, Berufjörður and Breiðdalur in the Eastern Region (the East Fjords), and Vestmannaeyjar (islands off the south coast); they captured an estimated 400–800 prisoners to sell into slavery.  Raids  In 1627 Barbary corsairs from Algiers and Salé descended on Iceland in two separate raids, taking around 400–900 prisoners (Iceland's population at the time has been estimated to have been about 60,000). This event is popularly known in Iceland as Tyrkjaránið (the \\"Turkish Raid\\"), as it was launched from areas under Ottoman sovereignty, although no North African Turks are known to have been involved. Most pirates were Arabs and Berbers, a large part - the Dutch and other Europeans, who converted to Islam.Vilhjálmur Þ. Gíslason, Bessastaðir: Þættir úr sögu höfuðbóls. Akureyri. 1947 Four ships attacked the eastern and southern coast as well as the Vestmannaeyjar (\\"Westman Islands\\"). Ten years later 27 captives made it back to Iceland; a few had come home earlier.  Grindavík  The leader of one of the raids was Jan Janszoon, also known as Murat Reis the younger, a Dutch pirate who operated from Salé. In 1627 he rented a Danish slave (most likely a crew member captured on a Danish ship taken as a pirate prize) to pilot him and his men to Iceland, where they raided the fishing village of Grindavík. Their takings were meagre, some salted fish and a few hides. They captured between 12 and 15 Icelanders and some Danish and Dutch sailors, whom they could sell as slaves. The Icelanders were seriously wounded. As they were leaving Grindavík, they managed to trick and capture a Danish merchant ship by flying a false flag. The ships sailed to Bessastaðir (Danish governor of Iceland), to raid but were unable to make a landing. It is said they were thwarted by cannon fire from the local fortifications (Bessastaðaskans) and a quickly mustered group of lancers from the Southern Peninsula. They sailed home and sold their captives at the slave market of Salé. Eastfjords The second group of raiders came to Hvalnes in southeastern Iceland on July 4 and raided the fjords north of there for a week, capturing livestock, silver and other goods, in addition to 110 Icelanders. They captured a Danish merchant ship and sank it. North of Fáskrúðsfjörður, they hit strong winds and decided to turn around and sail along the south coast of Iceland. Around that time, another pirate ship joined them, and they also captured an English fishing vessel.  Vestmannaeyjar  As there were no harbors or landing sites along the south coast, the three ships eventually came on July 16 to Vestmannaeyjar, a group of islands off the coast, where there was a fishing village of the same name. They raided the village and the home island for three days, capturing 234 people and killing 34, including one of the ministers of the island. The other minister, Ólafur Egilsson, was initially enslaved by the pirates and brought to Algiers. He was sent back to Copenhagen to plead for ransom funds from the King of Denmark to redeem his Icelandic subjects still in Algiers.Egilsson, Ólafur (2016). The Travels of Reverend Ólafur Egilsson: The Story of the Barbary Corsair Raid on Iceland in 1627. Translated from the original Icelandic text and edited by Karl Smári Hreinsson and Adam Nichols. Washington, D.C.: Catholic University of America Press. . Those offering resistance were killed, as were some of the old and infirm people.Peter Madsen, \\"Danish slaves in Barbary\\" , Islam in European Literature Conference, Denmark On July 19 the ships left Vestmannaeyjar and sailed back to Algiers. Ólafur later wrote a detailed account of his experience, one of a number of captivity narratives published in these years. It was translated and published in English in 2008.  Slaves in Barbary  Those captured were sold into slavery on the Barbary Coast. All Icelandic accounts agree the number of captives was below 400. French nobleman Emanuel d'Aranda says in his book, Relation de la captivité et la liberté du sieur (1666), about his time as a slave of the Barbary pirate Ali Bitchin, that an Icelandic fellow captive in Algiers told him 800 people had been enslaved. That number does not agree with any Icelandic sources. It is also found in D'Aranda, Emanuel (1666), The History of Algiers and Its Slavery with Many Remarkable Particularities of Africk. London: John Starkey, p. 248. A few letters written by captives reached Iceland. Together with other accounts, they indicate that the captives were treated very differently according to their masters. Guttormur Hallsson, a captive from Eastern Region, said in a letter written in Barbary in 1631: \\"There is a great difference here between masters. Some captive slaves get good, gentle, or in-between masters, but some unfortunates find themselves with savage, cruel, hardhearted tyrants, who never stop treating them badly, and who force them to labour and toil with scanty clothing and little food, bound in iron fetters, from morning till night.\\"Letter written by Guttormur Hallsson One of the most notable captives was Guðríður Símonardóttir. She was sold as a sex slave in Ottoman Algeria and was among the few Icelanders who were redeemed nearly a decade later by King Christian IV of Denmark. She returned to Iceland and is known for having later married Hallgrímur Pétursson, who became a Lutheran minister and one of Iceland's most famous poets.

Although many variations exist, the basic idea is that players sit opposite one another with a beer can at their feet, and take turns to throw a dart at their opponent's can. If said dart punctures or makes contact with the can, various actions take place as detailed in the rules. Rules The game is best played with two players, and such a game requires two seats, some lightweight metal darts and several cans of beer, two to be placed as targets. Seats are placed apart (or half that distance if playing at night), facing each other. Each player sits, and an unopened can of beer is placed at their feet. Players then take turns to throw a dart at their opponent's beer. Consequences are: # If a dart grazes a player's can but does not puncture it, that player must take one sip of beer. # If a dart punctures a player's can, that player must drink beer from the can to at least the hole. # If a can is punctured three times, or if a dart enters the mouth of an opened can, that beer must be fully consumed and the game is over. # If a dart strikes a player, the thrower must consume their own beer. Variations ; Classic : Two players, one can each, with or without a mat or B-Team. ; Team: The game can be played in teams, by adding further chairs. ; Party beerdarts : Many players seated in a circle, one can each, with or without a B-Team. In large groups, four or more, it is often established that shooting at a direct neighbor is prohibited, at least at first. ; Double beerdarts : Same rules as Classic beerdarts except two cans are stacked on top of each other. If the bottom can is punctured, the top can must be completely consumed before the bottom can is consumed down to the puncture. ; Team beerdarts : Four or more players, all using mats, one side forms a team to play against the other side. ; Engineering beerdarts : Four players, two per team. One shaken, unopened beer between each team. If the can is not punctured, the beer is not drank, and is reset if tipped. When the can is punctured, the beer must be shotgunned or otherwise drank as quickly as possible. Games typically go to 7. ; Missoula Beerdarts : Developed in Missoula, Montana. A water noodle is looped into a circle around the can of beer on the ground. A dart that sticks in the noodle is worth one point. A dart that lands on the ground inside the noodle is worth two points. A dart that punctures the can must be shotgunned. Play is to either 11 or 21 with two players on each side, with teammates on opposing sides (similar to horseshoes). Typically played at night with a spotlight, which requires a neutral person operating the light. ; Onlooker questions: Asking how the game went and not participating requires the person that asks to drink two units of alcohol.

It is one of the most prominent historical sites in the port city of Sidon, Lebanon. History The city of Sidon is located on the Mediterranean coast of Lebanon. This ancient Phoenician city has been of great religious, political and commercial value; it is said to be inhabited since 4000 B.C. In AD 1228, the Crusaders built Sidon's Sea Castle as a fortress on a small island connected to the mainland by a narrow 80m long roadway. The island was formerly the site of a temple to Melqart, the Phoenician version of Heracles. The beauty of the Castle can be seen in old illustrations of it; however, after bearing several wars, it has been damaged and renovated several times. It was partially destroyed by the Mamluks when they took over the city from the Crusaders, but they subsequently rebuilt it and added the long causeway. The castle later fell into disuse, but was again restored in the 17th century by Emir Fakhreddine II, only to suffer great damage.MiddeEast Interactive U.S.A.1995-2011.http://www.middleeast.com/sidon.htm There is a possibility that the island on which the castle is built was, in fact, the location of the Phoenician King's palace and several other Phoenician monuments which were destroyed by Esarhaddon and then by natural earthquakes. This island has also served as a shelter from inside attacks on the city.Almashriq. Retrieved from: http://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/900/910/919/saida1/history.html Great Sidon, Little Sidon, powerful fortresses, pastures, cisterns and fortifications are all mentioned in the Assyrian king Sennacherib's recordings of his attacks on Sidon and nearby cities. Description Today, the castle consists primarily of two towers connected by a wall. In the outer walls, Roman columns were used as horizontal reinforcements, a feature often seen in fortifications built on or near former Roman sites. The rectangular west tower to the left of the entrance is the better preserved of the two. There is a large vaulted room scattered with old carved capitals and rusting cannonballs. A winding staircase leads up to the roof, where there is a small, domed Ottoman-era mosque. From the roof, there is a view across the old city and fishing harbor. The east tower isn't as well preserved and was built in two phases; the lower part dates to the Crusader period, while the upper level was built by the Mamluks. There has also been evidence of the old Phoenician city being buried under the sea in the area surrounding the castle: structures of walls, columns, stairways, remains of buildings, statues and cisterns.

Professional career Bachmeier was born in Romania but spent his playing career in Chicago. He played as either a defender or defensive midfielder for the Chicago Kickers of the National Soccer League of Chicago beginning in the 1950s. In 1965, Bachmeier was honored as the Sepp Herberger German-American Illinois soccer player of the year. In 1966 and 1968, the Kickers won the National Amateur Cup. In 1968, he joined the Chicago Mustangs of the North American Soccer League (NASL). Bachmeier and the Mustangs spent only a single season in the NASL. In 1969, he returned to the Kickers, winning the National Amateur Cup a third time with them in 1970. National team Bachmeier earned his first caps with the U.S. national team in a crushing 8-1 loss to England on May 28, 1959. That was the only U.S. game in 1959 and Bachmeier was not called up for either of the U.S. games in 1960. However, he returned to the lineup in 1961 for the only U.S. game that year, a loss to Colombia. Once again, Bachmeier had a multi-year lay off from the national team. His next appearance came in a March 7, 1965, tie with Mexico. He earned two more caps that year, but the U.S. team was inactive in 1966 and 1967.

Later that year, Barber ran for and was elected to represent Dodge County's 2nd district in the 1849 session of the Wisconsin State Assembly. In 1876, Barber ran for the United States House of Representatives as a Republican in the 5th district, but was defeated by Samuel D. Burchard. His son was Hiram Barber, Jr., who served in the United States House of Representatives from Illinois.

Simocyon, which was about the size of a mountain lion, lived in the late Miocene and early Pliocene epochs, and has been found in Europe, Asia, and rarely, North America (Peigné et al., 2005) and Africa. Classification Reconstructed skull and head The relationship of Simocyon to other carnivores has been controversial, but studies of the structure of its ear, teeth, and ankle now indicate that its closest living relative is the red panda, Ailurus (Wang, 1997; Peigné et al., 2005), although it is different enough to be classified in a separate subfamily (Simocyoninae) along with related genera Alopecocyon and Actiocyon. While the red panda is primarily herbivorous, the teeth and skull of Simocyon indicate that it was carnivorous, and it may have engaged in some bone crushing, like living hyenas (Peigné et al., 2005). The skeleton of Simocyon indicates that, like the red panda, it could climb trees, although it probably also spent considerable time on the ground (Salesa et al., 2008). Simocyon and Ailurus both have a radial sesamoid, an unusual bone in the wrist that acts like a false thumb (Salesa et al., 2006). Its competitors during its time period were tremarctine bears, nimravid false cats, and early canids and felids. References * Peigné, S., M. Salesa, M. Antón, and J. Morales.

He went to Madras in 1846, organizing schools and churches in Madras, Arcot, Vellore, Coonoor and Ootacamund (Udhagamandalam). In 1850, Henry founded a mission at Arcot for the board of the Dutch Reformed Church; the following year, he opened the Wallajapet dispensary. Henry practiced medicine, and moved the dispensary to Ranipet in 1853 because of its better location. The dispensary closed the following year due to his illness, and he went to the hills to recuperate. In 1856, Madurai joined the other American Tamil missions in appointing Henry their representative to a Madras convention to plan a new Tamil version of the Bible. He prepared religious books and tracts in Sanskrit, Tamil, and Telugu.

Asked by the Arcot Mission and his brothers to begin medical work in Ranipet, in 1860 he went to India as a medical missionary and settled in Arcot. Silas founded a dispensary and hospital which were supported by English and native residents. With a large native outdoor practice, some of his patients were high-caste Hindu women who had been reluctant to see an American doctor. Ranipet Hospital opened on March 17 1866. Due to its high medical standard, the Madras government closed its own dispensary and turned over its resources to Silas. All treatment and medicines were free of charge.

County, more than 1,600 member companies and more than 722,430 employees. Mission By being the voice of business, helping its members grow and promoting collaboration, the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce seeks full prosperity for the Los Angeles region. As a trustee for the current and future welfare of the region, the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce champions economic prosperity and quality of life. History The L.A. Area Chamber's early focus promoted the region's abundance of opportunities in agriculture and international trade. These early members successfully advocated for a deep water port and secured water resources for the city. As Los Angeles matured into a major metropolitan center, the Chamber transitioned its focus into civic and political activities. These activities include International Trade, Education, Environment, Transportation, Advocacy, and Arts and Culture. The Chamber has demonstrated a long-standing leadership role in the Los Angeles community on these issues. Early history Los Angeles experienced dramatic population losses during the late 1880s. 1,000 people each month left the city, which caused the cities population to fall from an 1880 high of 70,000 to nearly 50,000. This exodus generated significant effects on the local economy, and there was sudden realization of the need for an effective agency to dismiss doubts and reinvigorate the courage of the citizens. On October 10, 1888, a group of men joined together to formulate plans for overcoming the reverses the city had suffered. The founding officers of the new Chamber of Commerce were business leaders Maj. Edward W. Jones, William W. Workman, Col. Harrison G. Otis, Samuel B. Lewis, J.I. Redick and Thomas A. Lewis. Early Chamber members formulated two objectives: stimulate migration and to market the area's products in other parts of the country. They decided to attract Midwestern farmers to Los Angeles because of their proven agricultural expertise. The Chamber undertook an ambitious expedition called “California on Wheels.” A railroad car outfitted with agricultural products of the state visited every town of importance in the Midwest and South. During its two-year tour, over a million passed through the exhibit doors and took home materials created by the chamber. Frank Wiggins, the superintendent of events, conceived of the idea and pushed to feature California agricultural products at large national and international exhibitions; attracting nationwide fame to Los Angeles. Wiggins conceived of larger than life sized walnut elephant for the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. 850 pounds of unusually large California walnuts covered a wire framework to create the animal. It achieved lasting fame for the city and the Chamber. Displays like the elephant demonstrated that Southern California offered more than climate, but that it produced a variety of marketable items. In addition to exhibitions, the Chamber encouraged grass roots investments in several manufacturing enterprises. Beet sugar manufacture benefited from technological advancements that encouraged its growth. By the end of the 20th century local factories produced 15,000 tons of sugar per year valued at $1,300,000. These industries received a boost with the discovery of oil and the introduction of electric power generated from water. The chamber attracted aircraft manufacturing in 1920 through its support of international air meets at Dominguez field and communication of meteorological information that made flights safer for pilots. The local livestock market received a boost when the Chamber collaborated with Chicago entrepreneurs in 1921 to create an area called the Central Manufacturing District and Los Angeles Junction Railway. After World War II, the Chamber transitioned from organization that sought to attract new business to Los Angeles County into one that now worked to address modern issues associated with a major metropolitan center. The organization converted from a county-sponsored organization to a private business organization funded solely by its members. Its advocacy efforts started to include issues that also affected the four other surrounding counties. In 1967, the Chamber changed its name to the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. Advocacy The Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce takes up key issues that affect the business community in Los Angeles. These issues include affordable Health Care, Affordable Housing, Disaster Preparedness, Economic Development, Education & Workforce Development, Homeland Security, Improving L.A.'s Business Climate, Industrial Land Use, LAX Modernization, and Reducing Traffic Congestion. Access advocacy series Each year, the L.A. Area Chamber's Access advocacy series connects L.A. businesses with policymakers and elected officials at the local, state and federal levels. The Chamber's advocacy trips to the state's and nation's capitols date back to the 1890s when the organization led delegations to secure regulatory approval and funding to construct the L.A. Aqueduct and L.A. Harbor. Programs and alliances Mobility 21 Mobility 21 is a regional effort involving five counties dedicated to the development of solutions to the transportation issues facing Southern California. Mobility 21 was created in 2002 to bring together elected officials, transportation providers, businesses, local municipalities, labor and community leaders to develop solutions to the transportation issues facing Los Angeles County. This initiative, led by the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) in partnership with the Automobile Club of Southern California, was kicked off at the first Mobility 21 transportation summit on November 18, 2002. Southern California Leadership Network In 2007, the Leadership L.A. Foundation and the Southern California Leadership Network merged and continued its partnership with the L.A. Area Chamber. The two programs- Leadership L.A. and Leadership Southern California- have long been the premier providers of community leadership develop in Southern California. United at the Chamber, these programs are further strengthening and expanding their networks of leaders. The Southern California Leadership Network's envisions a more dynamic and prosperous region and state led by informed, collaborative, inspired, diverse and capable leaders. SCLN advances the region and the state by inspiring, preparing and connecting leaders to drive change. Thirty years of inspiring leaders and driving change had culminated in more than 3,000 alumni that serve in the most influential business, government and social sector settings across California. Cash for College The Cash for College College and Career Convention features colleges and universities throughout California and the U.S., speakers and exhibits on college life, interactive career demonstrations, and information about scholarships and other financial aid- all designed to help students understand the importance of college. On Cash for College Day, students and their families have an opportunity to complete the required financial aid and CalGrant forms necessary to receive financial aid assistance to pursue their college endeavors. World Trade Week World trade significantly contributes to the nation's economy and has developed a vast new horizon for America's businesses. The success of globalization and the expansion of world trade have benefited no region more than Southern California. Yet, even among the communities that have gained the most from trade, there remains a lack of understanding about how trade works and why our 21st century lifestyle would be impossible without it. For more than 80 years, the education and outreach activities of World Trade Week, held each May, have highlighted the importance of international trade to the region and to educate the community about its benefits.

The church was known under the Greek name of Myrelaion ().The identification of the church could be done thanks to the precise description given by Petrus Gillius in his topographic work about Constantinople. Striker (1981), p. 3. Location The beautiful Byzantine structure is today rather incongruously choked on three sides by modern apartment blocks. It stands in Istanbul, in the district of Fatih, in the neighbourhood of Laleli, one kilometre west of the ruins of the Great Palace of Constantinople. History The mosque in 1877 Some years before 922, possibly during the wars against Simeon I's Bulgaria, the drungarius Romanos Lekapenos bought a house in the ninth region of Constantinople, not far from the Sea of Marmara, in the place called Myrelaion (\\"the place of myrrh\\" in Greek).The seller was one Kraterios. Striker (1981), p. 6. After his accession to the throne this building became the nucleus of a new imperial palace, intended to challenge the neighbouring Great Palace of Constantinople, and the family shrine of the Lekapenos family.The Cambridge Medieval History (1995), p. 563. The palace of Myrelaion was built on top of a giant fifth century rotunda which, with an external diameter of , was the second largest, after the Roman Pantheon, in the ancient world.The denomination of this edifice is still unknown. Striker (1981), p. 13. In the tenth century the rotunda was not used anymore, and then it was converted - possibly by Romanos himself - into a cistern by covering its interior with a vaulted system carried by at least 70 columns.Striker (1981), p. 13. Near the palace the Emperor built a church, which he intended from the beginning to use as burial place for his family.The emperor brought three marble sarcophagi belonging to the Emperor Maurice and his sons from the church of St. Mamas. Striker (1981), p. 6. The first person to be buried there was his wife Theodora, in December 922, followed by his eldest son and co-emperor Christopher, who died in 931.Striker (1981), p. 6. By doing so, Romanos interrupted a six-century old tradition, whereby almost all the Byzantine emperors since Constantine I were buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles. Later the Emperor converted his palace into a nunnery and, after his deposition and death in exile as monk in the island of Prote in June 948, he too was buried in the church.In addition, his daughter Helena, widow of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitos and the only legitimate link of Romanos to the Empire, was buried in the Myrelaion, instead of the Holy Apostles, beside her husband. Striker (1981), p. 6. Plan of the building, one of the first examples of a cross-in-square church. The shrine was ravaged by fire in 1203,Most probably this happened on 18 August 1203, when a group of Flemish soldiers, aided by Pisan and Venetian sailors, started a major fire in the southern part of Constantinople to cover their retreat. Striker (1981), p. 29. during the Fourth Crusade.During the archaeological excavation near the mosque a fragment of foot of the group of the Tetrarchs was found, thus confirming the tradition that this group (now fixed in the wall of St Mark's Basilica in Venice) had been stolen from the city (possibly from the Philadelphion square) by the Venetians in 1204. Striker (1981), p. 29. Abandoned during the Latin occupation of Constantinople (1204–1261), the building was repaired at the end of the thirteenth century, during the period of the Palaiologan restoration. After the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the Myrelaion was converted into a mosque by Grand Vizier Mesih Paşa around the year 1500, during the reign of Bayezid II. The mosque was named after its substructure (the meaning of the Turkish word bodrum is \\"subterranean vault\\", \\"basement\\"), but was also known under the name of its founder. The edifice was damaged again by fires in 1784 and 1911, when it was abandoned. In 1930, an excavation led by David Talbot Rice discovered the round cistern. In 1964-1965, a radical restoration led by the Archaeological Museum of Istanbul replaced almost all the external masonry of the edifice, and was then interrupted.The \\"restoration\\" replaced 90% of the original masonry with new concrete bricks, which revised windows and door lines, erased masonry joints, and eliminated the delicate saw-toothed courses which had originally defined the original lines of the building. Mathews (1976), p. 209. In 1965, two parallel excavations led by art historian Cecil L. Striker and by R. Naumann focused respectively on the substructure and on the imperial palace. The building was finally restored in 1986 when it was reopened as mosque. In 1990, the cistern was restored too, and it has hosted a shopping mall for a few years. Now the cistern is used by the women to pray. Architecture The south wall of the mosque. In the foreground the base of the minaret can be seen. Building The building, whose masonry consists entirely of bricks, is built on a foundation structure made of alternated courses of bricks and stone, and has a cross-in-square (or quincunx) plan, with a nine meter long side.Krautheimer (1986), p. 403. The central nave (naos) is surmounted by an umbrella dome, with a drum interrupted by arched windows, which gives to the structure an undulating rhythmus. The four side naves are covered by barrel vaults. The edifice has a narthex to the west and a sanctuary to the east. The central bay of the narthex is covered by a dome, the two side bays by cross vaults. The nave is partitioned by four piers, which substituted in the Ottoman period the original columns.The same happened in many other byzantine churches. Many openings – windows, oeil-de-boeufs and arches – give light to the structure. The exterior of the building is characterized by the half cylindrical buttresses which articulate its façades.Striker (1981), p. 17. Originally an exonarthex existed too, but in the Ottoman period it was replaced by a wooden portico. The building has three polygonal apses. The central one belongs to the sanctuary (bema), while the lateral are parts of two clover-shaped side chapels (pastophoria), prothesis and diakonikon. The Ottomans built a stone minaret close to the narthex. The building was originally decorated with a marble revetment and mosaics, which disappeared totally. As a whole, Bodrum mosque shows strong analogies with the north church of the Fenari Isa complex.Krautheimer (1986), p. 404. Substructure The substructure, in contrast with the building, has an austere and rough aspect. Originally its purpose was only that of bringing the church to the same level of the palace of Lekapenos. After the restoration in the Palaiologan period it was used as burial chapel.During the excavation in the substructure have been found the remains of a fresco representing a female donor making an offering to the Theotokos Hodegetria. Striker (1981), p. 31. This edifice is the first example of a private burial church of a Byzantine emperor, starting so a tradition typical of the later Komnenian and Palaiologan periods.Other examples are the complex of the Pantokrator and the church of Saint John the Baptist at Lips. Moreover, the building represents a beautiful example of the cross-in-square type church, the new architectural type of the middle Byzantine architecture.Striker (1981), p. 35.

Signs and symptoms A thyroid adenoma may be clinically silent (\\"cold\\" adenoma), or it may be a functional tumor, producing excessive thyroid hormone (\\"warm\\" or \\"hot\\" adenoma). In this case, it may result in symptomatic hyperthyroidism, and may be referred to as a toxic thyroid adenoma. Diagnosis Morphology Thyroid follicular adenoma ranges in diameter from 3 cm on an average, but sometimes is larger (up to 10 cm) or smaller. The typical thyroid adenoma is solitary, spherical and encapsulated lesion that is well demarcated from the surrounding parenchyma. The color ranges from gray-white to red- brown, depending upon # the cellularity of the adenoma # the colloid content. Areas of hemorrhage, fibrosis, calcification, and cystic change, similar to what is found in multinodular goiters, are common in thyroid (follicular) adenoma, particularly in larger lesions. Types Almost all thyroid adenomas are follicular adenomas. Follicular adenomas can be described as \\"cold\\", \\"warm\\" or \\"hot\\" depending on their level of function. Histopathologically, follicular adenomas can be classified according to their cellular architecture and relative amounts of cellularity and colloid into the following types: *Fetal (microfollicular) - these have the potential for microinvasion.

Updated: Oct 17, 2008 Differential diagnosis A thyroid adenoma is distinguished from a multinodular goiter of the thyroid in that an adenoma is typically solitary, and is a neoplasm resulting from a genetic mutation (or other genetic abnormality) in a single precursor cell. In contrast, a multinodular goiter is usually thought to result from a hyperplastic response of the entire thyroid gland to a stimulus, such as iodine deficiency. Careful pathological examination may be necessary to distinguish a thyroid adenoma from a minimally invasive follicular thyroid carcinoma. Management Most patients with thyroid adenoma can be managed by watchful waiting (without surgical excision) with regular monitoring. However, some patients still choose surgery after being fully informed of the risks. Regular monitoring mainly consists of watching for changes in nodule size and symptoms, and repeat ultrasonography or needle aspiration biopsy if the nodule grows.Treatment section in: References  External links  Category:Thyroid cancer ","title":"Thyroid adenoma"},{"id":"11707612","text":"Bogd is a Mongolian word meaning \\"saint, holy, sacred\\" and also a place name which may refer to *Bogd, Bayankhongor,a sum (district) of Bayankhongor Province *Bogd, Övörkhangai, a sum (district) of Övörkhangai Province *Bogd Khan, title of the eighth Jebtsundamba Khutughtu after Mongolia' declaration of independence in 1911 *Bogd Khan Mountain, a mountain in central Mongolia *Aj Bogd, a mountain in the Altai mountains range *Ikh Bogd, a mountain in the Altai mountains range *Shiliin Bogd, an extinct volcano in eastern Mongolia ","title":"Bogd"},{"id":"11707622","text":"Penstemon strictus, the Rocky Mountain penstemon, is a penstemon (common name beardtongue) with showy blue flowers.

The ultimate goal of these policies was the dissolution of Belgium into separate Walloon and Flemish components. The German authorities aimed to exploit the longstanding linguistic problems in Belgium, particularly the systematic discrimination towards the Dutch language that existed before World War I. The policy was also based on Pan-Germanism. Kossmann concludes that the German policy of fostering separatism in Flanders was a failure well before the German surrender because it did not win popular support.E.H. Kossmann, The Low Countries: 1780-1940 (1978) p 528  World War I  In the beginning, Flamenpolitik consisted only of an effort to translate the laws of Germany into the languages of Belgium. However, in 1916, a new plan was developed with the idea that Belgium should never again be an obstacle to German advancement and that Germany should be surrounded by weak buffer states open to German influence. This plan required a separate Flemish state not subject to Walloon influence, and thus necessitated much more radical measures than had yet been taken.F.L. Carsten, The Rise of Fascism (London: Methuen & Co, 1974), pp. 205-9 The first solely Dutch-speaking university (Von Bissing University) was established in Ghent, named after the German military governor Moritz von Bissing. German Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg encouraged Flemish nationalist leaders to declare independence and to integrate into the German sphere; at the same time, the German occupying forces were helped and encouraged by Walloon and Flemish nationalist movements. Von Bissing convened a commission to organise the division of the country, and in a decree issued on March 21, 1917, separated Belgium into two administrative areas: Flanders and Wallonia. A Flemish government, known as the Raad van Vlaanderen or RVV, was established. Taking into account the 1912 decision by Walloon nationalists to recognize Namur as the most central city of Wallonia, he established the Walloon administration there. Wallonia then consisted of four southern Belgian provinces and one part of the province of Brabant: the district of Nivelles, realizing also another revendication of the Walloon movement: the creation of the Walloon Brabant. The Flemish region had Brussels as its capital, and was made up of the four northern provinces of Belgium, as well as the districts of Brussels and Leuven. This was the first attempt at dividing Belgium along linguistic lines. The geographical basis for the country's division was largely inspired by the federalist goals of the Flemish and Walloon nationalist movements, and divisions along similar lines were advanced later by the same movements. In the present day, after the federalisation of Belgium, the Flemish Community and Wallonia have the same capitals and almost the same territory as the administrative entities of Flamenpolitik.  World War II  Adolf Hitler pursued a similar policy aimed at the dissolution of Belgium; however, this version of Flamenpolitik also aimed at the Aryanization of the Belgian territories. As part of this policy, the German authorities decided to release all Flemish NCOs and reservists who were made prisoners of war after the Belgian surrender. Any soldier of these categories who passed a linguistic test was theoretically entitled to an Entlassungschein, allowing him to return home. However, in practice this was extended preferentially to Flemish soldiers, while Walloon soldiers frequently remained in POW camps until the end of the war. That policy was intended to exacerbate internal Belgian conflicts and foster support for the German occupiers in the north of Belgium. Implementation was made easier by the fact that in 1938 the Belgian army had been divided into Flemish and Walloon regiments. The German regime decided to take the next step for the wartime Flamenpolitik in 1944 by initiating the total annexation of both the Flemish and Walloon sections of Belgium as full-fledged provinces of the German Reich: the Reichsgaue Flandern and Wallonien. The bicultural capital of Brussels was maintained as special district under the authority of a Reichskommissar.

The society was originally started by Phil Dunn, and the proprietors of Navwar and Skytrex. Originally, society games were held in Chessington, and in later years moving to North Holmwood. 1994 saw the merger between the NWS and the \\"Battleship club\\", which was also started by Phil Dunn. The merger saw the NWS expand, with regional groups being established in Kent(Ashford), Thames Valley(Mortimer), Wessex(Trowbridge) and Surrey (North Holmwood), as well as a group (the \\"6th Battle Squadron\\") in the US. In recognition of the society's goal to promote naval wargaming, and to act as a forum for the exchange of information, it produces two publications: a journal called \\"Battlefleet\\" published approximately once a quarter, and a monthly newsletter, \\"All Guns Blazing\\". Not only does the society encourage their members to write articles about wargaming and maritime history, but it also encourages member participation by frequently holding multiplayer naval wargames. As well as these games, the Regional groups of the society sometimes represent NWS at gaming conventions, an example of this is the Lissa game run by the North Hull Wargames group. Another feature of the NWS has been the organisation of a number of naval wargames \\"holidays\\". These have included groups despatched to the United States (Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana), Germany, Poland, Greece and to places of interest in the UK including Scapa Flow. The aim of these trips is to visit as many places of interest, historic ships, naval museums (and book and model shops) as possible. The NWS also ran its own wargames show called \\"Flagship\\". This was held at Fort Brockhurst in Gosport, UK until 1997. Since 2012 a new event, the Naval Wargames Weekend, has held at the Explosion Museum of Naval Firepower in Gosport; this event concentrates purely on wargaming rather than the trade aspect common at many wargames shows. In recent years the NWS has staged a series of events on board , starting with a recreation of the Battle of North Cape on the 60th anniversary of that battle. Other notable events have included a 90th anniversary refight of the Battle of Jutland at the national Maritime Museum, bicentenary refights of the Battle of Kamperduin at the maritime museum in Rotterdam, and of Trafalgar at various locations in 2005, and a refight of the Battle of Lissa on the 150th anniversary, which took place on the Croatian island of Vis, the scene of the battle.

Wilbert was a priest in Cologne Cathedral when archbishop Gunther was excommunicated and deposed. Charles the Bald, king of West Francia, tried to install his own palatine cleric, Hilduin, as archbishop. He failed when Louis the German, king of East Francia, sent Liutbert, archbishop of Mainz, to consecrate the priest Wilbert instead. On 7 January 870, Wilbert was acclaimed by Liutbert with the consent of the clergy and people of the diocese, with Odilbald of Utrecht assisting the consecration. Pope Hadrian II sent an embassy under Wibod, bishop of Parma, carrying his letters of acceptance. His appointment was made rapidly in order to foil any attempt by Louis's rival, Charles the Bald, to fill the vacant see with a candidate favourable to him. Charles did succeed in placing Bertulf in power in the archdiocese of Trier. Wilbert received the contested pallium from Pope Hadrian in 875. He extended the cathedral for use in holding synods, held the first provincial synod of his province there in 887, and was the first archbishop buried in the cathedral in 889. On 26 September 870, a German synod, attended by Liutbert and Bertulf, was held in Cologne with all the bishops of Saxony. The cathedral, desecrated by Gunther, was reconsecrated to Saint Peter. On 4 July 876, Wilbert led an embassy of German bishops to Charles the Bald's synod at Ponthion to claim for Louis the German a part in the inheritance of the late Emperor Louis II of Italy. The synod rebuffed them, since Pope John VIII was a strong supporter of Charles, and forced them to take an oath of fidelity to Ansegis, one of Charles's churchmen, whom the pope had appointed legate for all Europe north of the Alps. After Louis the German's death, Charles the Bald disputed the right of the former's heir, Louis the Younger, to receive Louis's share of Lotharingia. On 7 October 876, Charles was preparing a surprise attach on Louis the Younger, when Wilbert discovered the plot and warned Louis. The ensuing battle was a defeat for Charles. Cologne was pillaged and razed by Vikings in 881-882, but Liutbert of Mainz assisted in rebuilding it. Wilbert and Henry of Franconia met the Viking leader Godfrid, Duke of Frisia, at Herespich, an island in the confluence of the Rhine and the Waal. At the meeting, Godfrid was killed and Wilbert persuaded Gisela, his wife, to leave the island and pursue a policy of peace.

It is a short-tailed stocky parrot found in forest and woodland in north-western South America. Description Pet parrot It is mainly dark with a whitish chin patch and its upper chest is speckled with pink feathers. It has short red undertail feathers. The rump, tail and wings are dark blue with lighter blue underwings. The head is dark blue-green; the mantle, back and underparts are dark bronze-green with some blue tipped feathers and sometimes scattered red feathers. Its beak is pale yellow. In adults the ring of bare skin around the eyes is pink. Juveniles have whitish eyerings and their underparts are brownish. Taxonomy Today most authorities consider this species as monotypic, but some continue to recognize two subspecies: * P. c. chalcopterus: west Venezuela, and north and central Colombia. * P. b. cyanescens: south-west Colombia, west Ecuador, and north- west Peru. Reputedly with broader blue margins on feathers, chin patch and surrounding ring smaller and less distinct. Range and habitat Side view The bronze-winged parrot is found in far western Venezuela, western and central Colombia, western Ecuador and far north-western Peru. In Venezuela it mainly occurs at altitudes of 900–1400 m, in Colombia it mainly occurs at altitudes of 1400–2400 m (occasionally as high as 2800 m), in Ecuador mainly below 1400 m, and in Peru below 800 m. It generally prefers the canopy of forest and woodland (both humid and semi-deciduous), but also occurs in adjacent habitats with tall trees. It appears to be rather nomadic in parts of its range, but the movements (possibly only in response to the availability of food) are generally poorly understood. Behavior It is typically seen in pairs of small groups of up to ten birds. The bronze-winged parrot nests in tree cavities. The eggs are white and there are usually three to four in a clutch. The female incubates the eggs for about 26 days and the chicks leave the nest about 70 days after hatching.

Born in Chicago on December 30, 1947, Kahn received a degree in medical studies from the University of Chicago. His post- graduate training, specializing in Emergency Medicine, was completed at USC–LA County Hospital and UCLA. His original work includes three novels in the New World series: World Enough, and Time (1980), Time's Dark Laughter (1982), and Timefall (1987). As well as Return of the Jedi, he wrote the novelizations of the films Poltergeist and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. He has also written for well-known television series such as Melrose Place and Star Trek: The Next Generation. He was the producer of Melrose Place from 1996 to 1998. Early life James Kahn was born in Chicago in 1947, and began playing the guitar at age 12. He graduated from Maine Township High School West in 1965; then attended the University of Chicago, where he majored in Biology, drew a draft lottery number of 3, became involved in the anti-Vietnam War movement, participated in the 1968 Democratic Convention riots, and studied with the Byronic scholar Jerome McGann. When, during his fifth year in the college, his short story, \\"The Box\\", won second place in a U. of C. contest, one of the judges, Daryl Hine, sent Kahn's story to Playboy magazine, which bought it and published it in March 1971 – marking Kahn’s debut as a professional writer. Career Kahn went to medical school at the University of Chicago, as well, graduating in 1974. In 1973 he had another short story, \\"Mobius Trip,\\" published in the short-lived, Chicago-based magazine Gallery. He did a medical internship at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, then took a year-long hiatus during which he wrote his first novel, Diagnosis: Murder, which was later published by Carlyle Press, now defunct. He proceeded to do the first year of a Residency in Emergency Medicine at L.A.County Hospital/USC then took off another year in his training program to work various emergency departments around Los Angeles. He finished his Residency training at UCLA, where he helped create the residency program in Emergency Medicine, and subsequently became part of the group of specialists who created and then ran the emergency department at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, California. It was during this period that he wrote his science fiction trilogy – World Enough, and Time; Time's Dark Laughter; and Timefall – the first two published by Del Rey Publishing, the third by St. Martin's Press, which later published his medical thriller, The Echo Vector. While working at St. John's Hospital, he and others in the emergency department there were contacted by Kathleen Kennedy and Melissa Matheson soliciting technical assistance in the resuscitation of an alien. Kahn and others were invited to join the cast and crew in the production of the Steven Spielberg film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (at that time tentatively titled A Boy's Life). In the film, Kahn plays the doctor who confirms E.T.'s death. While on the set, Kahn gave a copy of his novel, World Enough, and Time, to Spielberg – which resulted in Kahn getting the assignment to novelize the movie Poltergeist, then in post-production. Kahn did several more novelizations after that – Return of the Jedi, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, The Goonies and Poltergeist II. During this period he also began to get television work, writing first for St. Elsewhere, and later, E/R – a sitcom about an emergency department starring Elliott Gould and Mary MacDonald, in which Kahn created the character of a teen orderly named Ace, played by a young George Clooney. Kahn wrote primarily for television for the next 20 years. Among the series he worked on were Family Medical Center, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Beyond Reality, TekWar (created by William Shatner), Medicine Ball, Xena: Warrior Princess, Melrose Place (which he also co-executive produced in its last years), Star Trek: Voyager (also Supervising Producer) and All My Children (for which he and the writing staff were Emmy- nominated). Later, under the tutelage of singer-songwriter Kate Wallace, and music producer/multi-instrumentalist David West, he focused more on writing music, releasing the Americana/folk CD Waterline in 2011, followed by the music video/short film Dolores Quits Dancing, the first song from his second album, Roadhouse Full of Blues (set for release in 2012).

Multitasking can result in time wasted due to human context switching and becoming prone to errors due to insufficient attention. If one becomes proficient at two tasks it is possible to rapidly shift attention between the tasks and perform the tasks well. Etymology The first published use of the word \\"multitask\\" appeared in an IBM paper describing the capabilities of the IBM System/360 in 1965.IBM Operating System/360 Concepts and Facilities - Witt, Bernard I. & Lambert, Ward The term has since been applied to human tasks. Research Since the 1960s, psychologists have conducted experiments on the nature and limits of human multitasking. The simplest experimental design used to investigate human multitasking is the so- called psychological refractory period effect. Here, people are asked to make separate responses to each of two stimuli presented close together in time. An extremely general finding is a slowing in responses to the second-appearing stimulus. Researchers have long suggested that there appears to be a processing bottleneck preventing the brain from working on certain key aspects of both tasks at the same time (e.g., ). Bottlenecking refers to the idea that because people only have a limited amount of attentional resources, the most important information is kept. Many researchers believe that the cognitive function subject to the most severe form of bottlenecking is the planning of actions and retrieval of information from memory. Psychiatrist Edward M. HallowellHallowell, Edward M.. Crazy Busy: Overstretched, Overbooked, and About to Snap! Strategies for Handling Your Fast-Paced Life. 2007. Ballantine Books. has gone so far as to describe multitasking as a \\"mythical activity in which people believe they can perform two or more tasks simultaneously as effectively as one.\\" Others have researched multitasking in the area of learning. Richard E Mayer and Moreno[6] studied the phenomenon of cognitive load in multimedia learning and concluded that it is difficult, if not impossible, to learn new information while engaging in multitasking. Reynol Junco and Shelia R Cotten examined how multitasking affects academic success and found that students who engaged in high levels of multitasking reported significant issues with their academic work.[7] A more recent study on the effects of multitasking on academic performance showed that using Facebook and text messaging while studying were negatively related to student grades, while online searching and emailing were not.[8] Some experiments have been done that demonstrate that it is possible to divide one's attention among several tasks, how successfully depends on several factors such as how much practice one has with it or the difficulty of the task. Walter Schneider and Robert Shiffrin performed an experiment in which they presented the participants with a memory set, which consists of target stimuli such as the number three. After being presented with the memory set they were rapidly shown 20 test frames which contained distractor stimuli. One of the slides they were shown contained one of the target stimuli from the memory set. With each trial a new memory set and new test frames were presented. At the start of the experiment participants averaged 55% in correctly identifying the target stimuli from the memory set. After 900 trials the participants were able to bring the average up to 90%. They reported that after about 600 trials the task became automatic and they were able to respond without thinking about it. The brain's role Because the brain cannot fully focus when multitasking, people take longer to complete tasks and are predisposed to error. When people attempt to complete many tasks at one time, “or [alternate] rapidly between them, errors go way up, and it takes far longer—often double the time or more—to get the jobs done than if they were done sequentially,” states Meyer. This is largely because \\"the brain is compelled to restart and refocus\\". A study by Meyer and David Kieras found that in the interim between each exchange, the brain makes no progress whatsoever. Therefore, multitasking people not only perform each task less suitably, but lose time in the process. According to a study done by Jordan Grafman, chief of the cognitive neuroscience section at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, \\"the most anterior part [of the brain] allows [a person] to leave something when it's incomplete and return to the same place and continue from there,\\" while Brodmann Area 10, a part of the brain's frontal lobes, is important for establishing and attaining long-term goals. Focusing on multiple dissimilar tasks at once forces the brain to process all activity in its anterior. Though the brain is complex and can perform myriad tasks, it cannot multitask well. Another study by René Marois, a psychologist at Vanderbilt University, discovered that the brain exhibits a \\"response selection bottleneck\\" when asked to perform several tasks at once. The brain must then decide which activity is most important, thereby taking more time. Psychologist David Meyer, of the University of Michigan, claims that instead of a \\"bottleneck,\\" the brain experiences \\"adaptive executive control\\" which places priorities on each activity. These viewpoints differ in that while bottlenecking attempts to force many thoughts through the brain at once, adaptive executive control prioritizes tasks to maintain a semblance of order. The brain better understands this order and, as psychologists such as Dr. Meyer believe, can, therefore, be trained to multitask. It is not known exactly how the brain processes input and reacts to overstimulation. Some research suggests that the human brain can be trained to multitask. A study published in Child Development by Monica Luciana, associate professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota, discovered that the brain's capability of categorizing competing information continues to develop until ages sixteen and seventeen. A study by Vanderbilt University found that multitasking is largely limited by \\"the speed with which our prefrontal cortex processes information.\\" Paul E. Dux, the co-author of the study, believes that this process can become faster through proper training. The study trained seven people to perform two simple tasks, either separately or together and conducted brain scans of the participants. The individuals multitasked poorly at first but, with training, were able to adeptly perform the tasks simultaneously. Brain scans of the participants indicate that the prefrontal cortex quickened its ability to process the information, enabling the individuals to multitask more efficiently. However, the study also suggests that the brain is incapable of performing multiple tasks at one time, even after extensive training. This study further indicates that, while the brain can become adept at processing and responding to certain information, it cannot truly multitask. People have a limited ability to retain information, which worsens when the amount of information increases. For this reason, people alter information to make it more memorable, such as separating a ten- digit phone number into three smaller groups or dividing the alphabet into sets of three to five letters, a phenomenon known as chunking. George Miller, former psychologist at Harvard University, believes the limits to the human brain's capacity centers around \\"the number seven, plus or minus two.\\" An illustrative example of this is a test in which a person must repeat numbers read aloud. While two or three numbers are easily repeated, fifteen numbers become more difficult. The person would, on average, repeat seven correctly. Brains are only capable of storing a limited amount of information in their short-term memories. Laboratory-based studies of multi-tasking indicate that one motivation for switching between tasks is to increase the time spent on the task that produces the most reward (Payne, Duggan & Neth, 2007). This reward could be progress towards an overall task goal, or it could simply be the opportunity to pursue a more interesting or fun activity. Payne, Duggan, and Neth (2007) found that decisions to switch task reflected either the reward provided by the current task or the availability of a suitable opportunity to switch (i.e. the completion of a subgoal). A French fMRI study published in 2010 indicated preliminary support for the hypothesis that the brain can pursue at most two goals simultaneously, one for each frontal lobe (which has a goal-oriented area). When studying the costs of multitasking there are typically two designs for or types of multitasking that are examined, task switching and dual tasking. Task switching involves shifting one’s attention from one thing to another. Dual tasking, on the other hand, is when attention is divided among multiple things at once. Studies have been done to specifically examine the brain when one is engaged in either type of multitasking. Through the use of MRI brain scans researchers have found that frontoparietal regions are activated which would include the inferior frontal junction and the posterior parietal cortex. They also found that while each type of tasking uses different mechanisms there are also some underlying mechanisms and resources that they share. Sex differences Although the idea that women are better multitaskers than men has been popular in the media as well in conventional thought, there is little data available to support claims of a real sex difference. Most studies that do show any sex differences tend to find that the differences are small and inconsistent. For example, a Swedish study found that men outperformed women at handling multiple tasks simultaneously, with the performance gap being correlated to the female menstrual cycle. Or in 2018, a study in Norway tested everyday scenarios via videogames and found that \\"none of the multitasking measures (accuracy, total time, total distance covered by the avatar, a prospective memory score, and a distractor management score) showed any sex differences.\\" Controversial discussion continues as the lack of data available to support the popular belief does not prove it to be wrong. There have been attempts to produce evolutionary explanations for the popular belief. One theory that proposes an explanation for why there may be gender differences in multitasking is the hunter-gatherer theory proposed by Silverman and Eals in accordance with a multitasking experiment they conducted in 1992. Their hypothesis says that natural selection favored hunting-related skills and resulted in a difference in task performance for genders. (IOW, their theory states that men and women's cognitive abilities evolved differently based on the hunter-gatherer tasks they performed in the past.) Men focused on one task, hunting, while women were gatherers and took care of the children at home. The idea is that over time there was a natural selection for women who could multitask. We no longer have such rigid labor division, but the natural selection that took place in primitive societies is thought to have made modern females superior multitaskers. In a study that looked at sex differences in spatial abilities in 40 countries they found that men scored higher on tests of multidimensional mental rotations and women scored higher in object location memory, as the experimenters predicted. In 2013, a brain connectivity study from Penn Medicine, funded by in part by the National Institutes of Mental Health, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found major differences in men and women's neural wiring that is leading researchers to believe in popular belief that sex plays a role in multitasking skills. It is believed that \\"[On] average, men are more likely better at learning and performing a single task at hand, like cycling or navigating directions, whereas women have superior memory and social cognition skills, making them more equipped for multitasking and creating solutions that work for a group.\\" The full text of the study can be found on the PNAS website. However, this study has been widely criticized because the differences could easily have been caused by increased head movement. Moreover, the link between the DTI data and behavioral performance is speculative. Importantly, this study contains no such evidence of any superiority in multitasking in women. Continuous partial attention Author Steven Berlin Johnson describes one kind of multitasking: “It usually involves skimming the surface of the incoming data, picking out the relevant details, and moving on to the next stream. You’re paying attention, but only partially. That lets you cast a wider net, but it also runs the risk of keeping you from really studying the fish.\\"Everything Bad Is Good for You: How Today's Popular Culture Is Actually Making Us Smarter by Steven Berlin Johnson, p.61 Multimedia pioneer Linda Stone coined the phrase \\"continuous partial attention\\" for this kind of processing. Continuous partial attention is multitasking where things do not get studied in depth. Rapidly increasing technology fosters multitasking because it promotes multiple sources of input at a given time. Instead of exchanging old equipment like TV, print, and music, for new equipment such as computers, the Internet, and video games, children and teens combine forms of media and continually increase sources of input. According to studies by the Kaiser Family Foundation, in 1999 only 16 percent of time spent using media such as Internet, television, video games, telephones, text-messaging, or e-mail was combined. In 2005, 26 percent of the time these media were used together. This increase in simultaneous media usage decreases the amount of attention paid to each device. In 2005 it was found that 82 percent of American youth use the Internet by the seventh grade in school. A 2005 survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that, while their usage of media continued at a constant 6.5 hours per day, Americans ages 8 to 18 were crowding roughly 8.5 hours’ worth of media into their days due to multitasking. The survey showed that one quarter to one-third of the participants have more than one input “most of the time” while watching television, listening to music, or reading. The 2007 Harvard Business Review featured Linda Stone's idea of “continuous partial attention,” or, “constantly scanning for opportunities and staying on top of contacts, events, and activities in an effort to miss nothing”. As technology provides more distractions, attention is spread among tasks more thinly. A prevalent example of this inattention to detail due to multitasking is apparent when people talk on cell phones while driving. One study found that having an accident is four times more likely when using a cell phone while driving. Another study compared reaction times for experienced drivers during a number of tasks, and found that the subjects reacted more slowly to brake lights and stop signs during phone conversations than during other simultaneous tasks. A 2006 study showed that drivers talking on cell phones were more involved in rear-end collisions and sped up slower than intoxicated drivers. When talking, people must withdraw their attention from the road in order to formulate responses. Because the brain cannot focus on two sources of input at one time, driving and listening or talking, constantly changing input provided by cell phones distracts the brain and increases the likelihood of accidents.  Supertasker  In 2010, a scientific study found that a small percent of the population appeared to be much better at multitasking than others, and these people were subsequently labeled \\"supertaskers\\". In 2015, another study supported the idea of supertaskers. This particular study showed that they tested people by making them drive on a driving simulator while at the same time memorizing words and solving math problems. As expected, most of the participants did much worse than their individual task test scores. The supertaskers, however, were able to multitask without major effects to their performance. Popular commentary on practical multitasking Barry Schwartz has noted that, given the media-rich landscape of the Internet era, it is tempting to get into a habit of dwelling in a constant sea of information with too many choices, which has been noted to have a negative effect on human happiness. S.a.:The Paradox of Choice Observers of youth in modern society often comment upon the apparently advanced multitasking capabilities of the youngest generations of humans (Generation Y and Generation Z). While it is true that contemporary researchers find that youths in today's world exhibit high levels of multitasking, most experts believe that members of the Net Generation are not any better at multitasking than members of older generations.Carrier, L Mark, Cheever, Nancy A, Rosen, Larry D, Benitez, Sandra, & Chang, Jennifer (2009). \\"Multitasking across generations: Multitasking choices and difficulty ratings in three generations of Americans\\", Computers in Human Behavior, Volume 25, p483–489. However, recent studies by Bardhi, Rohm, and Sultan argue that Generation Y is becoming better at media multitasking. Media multitasking is when media consumers view several media platforms at the same time; such as watching TV while browsing the internet. This is evidenced by the fact that they are gaining control over deciding which messages they pay attention to or not. Nonetheless, while there is a great deal of evidence showing the negative effects of multitasking on cognitive tasks,Wood, N., & Cowan, N. (1995). The cocktail party phenomenon revisited. How frequent are attention shifts to one’s name in an irrelevant auditory channel. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 21(1), 255–260. there is no evidence showing that multitasking has a positive or neutral effect on these tasks. Many studies, literature, articles, and worldwide consulting firms, stress the fact that multitasking of any kind reduces the productivity and/or increases rate of errors, thus generating unnecessary frustrations. In 2008, it was estimated that $650 billion a year is wasted in US businesses due to multitasking.

Lithograph by Josef Kriehuber Johann Vesque von Püttlingen (pseudonym Johann Hoven) (23 July 1803 – 29 October 1883), born J. Vesque de Puttelange, was an Austrian lawyer, diplomat, author, composer and singer. His full name and title in German was Johann Vesque, Freiherr von Püttlingen. Early life He was born in the Lubomirski Palace (pl:Pałac Lubomirskich) in Opole Lubelskie (at the time located in West Galicia, a province of the Holy Roman Empire in eastern Poland, now in Lublin Voivodship). ;Background His father, Jean Vesque de Puttelange, born in Brussels, was a state official (civil servant) in Brussels, at the time in the Duchy of Brabant, a region of the Austrian Netherlands, themselves part of the Holy Roman Empire. Jean Vesque had to leave in a hurry after the French invasion of the Low Countries in 1793, but found himself banned (with the other Belgian officials of the late Brussels administration) from Vienna, where there were enough civil servants already; having rejected a French offer of citizenship of the new greater France - now including southern Belgium and Luxembourg - his estates were confiscated and he found himself stateless. His birthplace, Lubomirski Palace in Opole Lubelskie, designed c.1770 by i.a. Domenico Merlini After many years of wandering in Europe, often on foot, Jean Vesque obtained a position c1801 at the palace of Prince Alexander Lubomirsky in Opole Lubelskie, where he worked as librarian and tutor to his daughter Alexandra Francis Lubomirska, and where his son, also Johann Vesque (later von Püttlingen), was born in 1803. West Galicia had recently come under Habsburg control after the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. The ban on Austro-Belgian officials settling in Vienna was lifted the following year, 1804, and the family moved to Vienna. The subsequent life of the infant Johann Vesque divides into two intertwining careers, that of a government official, and that of a composer. Civil service career After schooling - including some musical training - he entered the University of Vienna in 1822 to study law, gaining his LLD (Dr. jur.) with honours in 1827. He then became a civil servant, entering the Lower Austrian legal service (or magistracy) as an 'Auscultant' or probationer (Anwärter auf das Richteramt), rising to become chief administrative officer of Salzburg by 1872. He moved to the Austrian diplomatic service, making his way to head of section in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in 1866 he was elevated to the barony (Freiherrenstand). In 1876 he became a Privy Councillor of the Imperial Council. He was one of Austria's leading lawyers and was also active as a writer in this field: among other things he published a ground-breaking work on \\"The rights of the musical author\\" (1864); a description of the law relating to foreign citizens in Austria; and a review of Austria's agreements with foreign states. Musical career Aged 13, he had started piano lessons with :de:Maximilian Josef Leidesdorf, a well-known pianist who was a friend (and publisher) of Schubert and Beethoven. He studied composition with Eduard von Lannoy, who came from Brussels like Johann's father, Jean Vesque; he got to know Schubert in 1827-8, and through him had singing lessons with the renowned baritone Johann Vogl. The critic Eduard Hanslick described his well-trained tenor voice: \\"The witty, lightly emphasised, almost French 'breathy' tone, which Vesque - especially in his recital of his humoristic lieder - was aware of putting on, was quite unique.\\"„Der geistreiche, leicht pointierende, fast französisch angehauchte Ton, den Vesque in den Vortrag namentlich seiner humoristischen Lieder zu legen wusste, war ganz einzig\\". Starting in 1828, he published a number of his own compositions under the name 'J. Hoven', or later 'Johann van Hoven'. many of which - like the rest of his oeuvre - were contributions to the lyric vocal repertoire; over 100 of his songs were settings of Heinrich Heine. In total he composed over 330 lieder, notably the Ironischen Lieder; six operas, including Turandot (1838) and Jeanne d'Arc (1840); and about twenty quartets, in both sacred and secular settings. Among his contacts were numbered Robert and Clara Schumann, Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt, Carl Loewe, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Felix Mendelssohn and Otto Nicolai. Four of his six operas were successfully produced at the Kärntnertortheater: Turandot 1838, Johanna d’Arc 1840, Liebeszauber 1845, Ein Abenteuer Carl des Zweiten 1850. He helped to reconstruct the threatened Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, and was its vice- president 1851/52, while continuing on the building of the Conservatory of the GdM, whose director he was. He organised performances of Mendelssohn's oratorios in Vienna, and directed the musical festivals in the Royal winter Spanish Riding School. He was a member of the Royal Commission for the World Fair 1873, and also collected autographs. Vesque de Püttlingen, Johann Freiherr (Pseud. Johann Hoven) Oesterreichisches Musiklexikon online ed.

Description It is a fairly large, spreading, attractive plant which bears strongly reflexed, nectar-rich red or orange-red flowers and toothed, downy leaves. It is native to the West Coast and Southwestern United States and Baja California, and is generally found at low elevation in moist areas. Occasional populations of yellow-flowered Erythranthe cardinalis (which lack anthocyanin pigments in their corollas) are found in the wild.Vickery 1992 Cultivation Erythranthe cardinalis is cultivated in the horticulture trade and widely available as an ornamental plant for: traditional gardens; natural landscape, native plant, and habitat gardens; and various types of municipal, commercial, and agency sustainable landscape projects. Cultivars come in a range of colors between yellow and red, including the \\"Santa Cruz Island Gold\\" variety, originally collected from Santa Cruz Island off the coast of California.

It is concentrated around King Street West between University Avenue and Spadina Avenue. It is home to theatres and performing arts centres, three of Toronto's major-league sports teams, and an array of cultural and family attractions. The area is also home to most of the nightclubs in downtown Toronto. History Garment District In the first half of the 20th century, the original name of the neighbourhood was the Garment District and it was almost wholly industrial. The railways controlled a huge amount of land along the Lake Ontario waterfront, and to the north many firms took advantage of the easy access to rail and the harbour. The most important industry was textiles and fashion, and the area had few residents. Much of the area was built after the 1904 fire, which forced many businesses to move west of the Bay Street and Front area. The Royal Alexandra Theatre (left) during the Toronto International Film Festival. Opened in 1907, the theatre is the oldest continuously operating theatre in North America. Among the industry, the area was home to the Royal Alexandra Theatre. Opened in 1907, the Beaux-Arts styled proscenium-stage theatre is the oldest continuously operating legitimate theatre in North America. The theatre was later purchased by the Mirvish family in 1962. Manufacturing industry began to vacate the area in the 1970s, leaving behind an array of heritage warehouses and factories that began to be converted to other uses. Meanwhile from 1976, the newly-opened CN Tower brought many tourists to the neighbourhood. Still, the most notable arrival was nightclubs that began opening sporadically in the early 1980s before becoming the area's staple and most recognizable feature from early 1990s onward. 1980s: Arrival of first nightclubs In January 1980, the Trinidad-born and Brooklyn-raised Assoon brothers (David, Albert, Tony and Michael) together with Luis Collaco and Bromely Vassell opened The Twilight Zone, Toronto's first large dance nightclub, at 185 Richmond Street West between Simcoe and Duncan Streets. Modeled after New York City's famous Paradise Garage club,Back To The Zone the Twilight Zone quickly became popular with the Toronto youth, showcasing an adventurous mix of musical styles including underground disco, house, hip-hop, and techno thus giving the city its first taste of the kind of underground clubbing experience that had already been popular in New York City for years. Though located in a raw, gritty, and frugal space of a mostly unfurnished former industrial warehouse, the Twilight Zone still featured an extravagantly designed US$100,000 state- of-the-art sound system courtesy of New York City sound engineer Richard Long. Paid for with a sizable bank loan the Assoons took out by putting their father's house as collateral, its thumping bass could be heard miles away, flooding the deserted neighborhood with noise. Operating without a liquor licence, thus not serving any alcohol throughout its run, the club initially made a name via its Saturday night parties that went until the Sunday morning dawn featuring owners Tony and Albert Assoon spinning underground disco, funk, and freestyle tunes. Furthermore on Saturday nights, they introduced a practice of bringing international DJs, mostly from New York City and Chicago, such as David Morales, Johnny Dynell, Frankie Knuckles, David DePino, and Kenny Carpenter. Many of these early bookings were done through Judy Weinstein, New York based businesswoman and Morales' manager, who ran her own record pool that the Assoons were able to access for DJ bookings as well as vinyl material. In addition to attracting diverse general crowds, the club also became frequented by touring performers showing up unannounced just to hang out and party such as Detroit DJs Derrick May and Alton Miller who got brought into the DJ booth for impromptu performances. Performers booked on Saturdays went beyond DJs so that acts like LL Cool J, Sly Fox, The S.O.S. Band, D Train, Divine, Eartha Kitt, Spoons, Jermaine Stewart, and Anne Clark also played the club. Roy Thomson Hall is home to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. The concert hall was opened in 1982. In 1982 Roy Thomson Hall opened at King and Simcoe, becoming the new home of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra thus expanding entertainment options in the neighbourhood beyond partying at the Twilight Zone. With the arrival of early house music out of Chicago in 1984, the Twilight Zone was among the first venues anywhere, alongside clubs in Chicago and New York City, to embrace the new sound, playing it heavily throughout its Saturdays club nights — the very first club in Toronto to do so. The Assoon brothers' business relationship with Weinstein and her 'For the Record' music pool benefited the club in this regard, enabling it to obtain and play new tracks and records long before they were available to the general public. Within two years, following the increased availability of house records in stores, the genre spread to other Toronto clubs such as the Copa in the Yorkville neighbourhood and the Diamond on Sherbourne Street that dedicated specific club nights to house. Into the mid-1980s, as the popularity of the Twilight Zone grew continuously, its offering expanded to other nights of the week. First to Fridays featuring Don Cochrane, a DJ from Scotland, playing new wave as part of a UK dance party theme and then Wednesdays, promoted as 'Pariah Wednesdays', featuring local DJs Siobhan O'Flynn and Stephen Scott who played a blend of alternative rock, UK pop, disco, and psychedelia. In May 1985, the Beastie Boys, in town as the opening act on Madonna's The Virgin Tour, were booked for an after-show party at the Zone courtesy of Jonathan Gross, a writer for Rolling Stone and music critic for the Toronto Sun, who also handled some of the booking for the club. According to Gross, they got paid $1,500 and a case of Molson's for the club gig. Their chaotic appearance became part of the Twilight Zone's lore as the trio began essentially vandalizing the club's interior by spray painting its walls, however, instead of stopping them, owner Michael Assoon urged them to resume and their graffiti was kept as a badge of honour of sorts for the remainder of the club's run. Furthermore, the day before their scheduled paid appearance, they also showed up at the club during its Pariah Wednesdays night, reportedly visibly intoxicated, and tried to gain access to the DJ booth Resident DJ Siobhan O'Flynn politely declined. It wasn't until late 1987 that the still mostly deserted area got another nightclub — Stilife was opened by 25-year-old Charles Khabouth at the corner of Richmond West and Duncan. Its young owner quickly managed to monetize it by attracting affluent Toronto crowds, a business success that would in a few years bring many new nightclubs to the area. The railway lands to the south were also converted to other uses. The SkyDome sports arena opened in 1989, bringing thousands of fans of the Toronto Blue Jays and the Toronto Argonauts as well as fans of big musical acts to the area. 1990s: Birth of the Entertainment District Khabouth's success with Stilife made other entrepreneurs take notice and despite the Twilight Zone's 1989 closure, numerous new clubs began appearing from 1990 onward, attracted by the developing nightlife scene and still relatively cheap rent. Most notable among this sudden influx of clubs were: *Go-Go, a three- level superclub opened by the Ballinger brothers in 1990 across the street from Stilife at the north-west corner of Richmond West & Duncan, *23 Hop, a minimalist all-ages club opened by Wesley Thuro during summer 1990 at 318 Richmond West (a warehouse down the street from Stilife) that would soon become a catalyst for the Toronto rave scene, *Klub Max, a huge venue launched in 1990 by Nick DiDonato and Angelo Belluz in a heritage building on Peter Street just south of King Street West that previously housed DiDonato's P.M. Toronto sports bar and restaurant, and *LimeLight, a stylish club opened in 1993 by businessman Zisi Konstantinou at 250 Adelaide Street West near the corner with Duncan Street. This trend continued at such a rate that the area by mid-1990s became home to one of the largest concentrations of nightclubs in North America.Benjamin Boles. \\"What killed the club district?\\" Now Magazine. January 13–20, 2011 Along with the nightclubs many bars and restaurants opened to serve these crowds. The Princess of Wales Theatre was built in 1993 by Mirvish Productions. Given the success of the Royal Alexandra Theatre, in 1993 the Mirvish family built the new 2,000-seat Princess of Wales Theatre a block over. Alternative theatres were also already in existence in this area with Theatre Passe Muraille owning a former warehouse and the Factory Theatre in a former manse. Toronto has emerged as the world's third-largest centre for English-language theatre, behind only London (West End theatre) and New York (Broadway theatre).\\"David Gardner, \\"Theatre, English-Language — Current Trends\\" in The Canadian Encyclopedia, 2009, retrieved 6 July 2009. Canada's Walk of Fame got established in 1998, right in front of the two Mirvish-owned theaters on King St. West between Simcoe and John streets, acknowledging the achievements of successful Canadians. In 1999, Festival Hall opened at the southwest corner of Richmond West & John, containing the flagship Paramount Theatre Toronto that has since been re-branded as Scotiabank Theatre Toronto. 2000s: Condo boom and population spike In 2001, twenty-one-year-old local hospitality entrepreneur and former minor league hockey player Travis AgrestiAgresti @ HockeyDB.com opened Inside at 218 Richmond Street West,Inside Nightclub a three-level nightclub that would become notable due to its association with the Raptors' basketball superstar Vince Carter who within two years decided to invest in the huge venue, becoming its co-owner. The two had reportedly met during late 1990s at nearby Fluid nightclub where Agresti worked as venue manager before deciding to launch his own nightclub down the street. Carter reportedly came to Inside's opening night and liking what he saw eventually decided to invest in the club. Though not involved in day-to- day running of the venue, Carter's high media profile nevertheless attracted a long list of visiting athletes, musicians, and entertainers to Inside such as Jason Kidd, Antawn Jamison, Barry Bonds, Prince, Nelly Furtado, NSYNC, Kanye West, Paris Hilton, Chris Rock, Jessica Alba, Elisha Cuthbert, etc.Inside Nightclub Even with Carter getting traded from the Raptors in late 2004, the club continued to thrive as a partnership between him and Agresti, expanding and opening additional lounges within the complex. However, the operation soured in the late 2000s due to the financial crisis and suddenly folded. By 2010, the space got turned into day care for the kids of employees working in the nearby Financial District. Simultaneously, all throughout the early 2000s, the Toronto condo boom began to transform the area. The abandoned warehouses began to be transformed into lofts, or demolished to make way for condominium towers. The core of the Entertainment District had only 750 residents in 1996, but this had gone up to 7,500 by 2005.Benjamin Boles. \\"A breakdown of the clubland numbers\\" Now Magazine. January 13–20, 2011 The crowds, noise, and occasional crime especially associated with the clubs caused conflict with the new homeowners. Festival Tower is a cultural centre, condominium, and headquarters for the Toronto International Film Festival. The building was one of several condos built in the area during Toronto's 2000s condo boom. The trend of the area being turned into a residential neighbourhood continued even more rapidly in the second half of the decade. Nightclubs still opened, including CiRCA launching in October 2007 on John St. between Richmond West and Adelaide West inside the RioCan Hall (formerly Festival Hall), perhaps the most ambitious club ever in Toronto due to its sheer size of 53,000 square feet and the money spent before opening. Further adding to its mystique was the fact that the man behind it was Peter Gatien, legendary former New York City nightclub czar who owned 1980s and 1990s hotspots such as The Limelight and Tunnel before being deported back to Canada. However, CiRCA's financial implosion less than 3 years later only served to underscore the neighbourhood's shift and was seen by many as the definitive symbol of the death of Toronto's clubland. Greater restrictions on venues in the area resulted in loss of jobs ; by 2011, the number of clubs had decreased substantially, from 60-100 in the period between 2000 and 2006 to 30 in 2013. On May 10, 2016, Toronto City Council voted unanimously in favour of naming a public laneway in honour of the Twilight Zone nightclub, after a successful online petition. Future development This neighbourhood is rapidly changing with new hotel and condominium apartment developments. Bisha Hotel and Residences opened its doors in October 2017. Robert De Niro Nobu Hotel's Residences, an international luxury hotel chain, started sales of their first Nobu Condos in Toronto in the summer of 2017 which was extremely well received. It is located at 15-35 Mercer St, Toronto and will be built by Madison Homes. Nobu Condos is expected to be completed by July 2022. Great Gulf Homes is developing the 357 King West condos at 357 King Street West. It will be a 42-story building that will have a mix of 1 bedroom, 1+Den, 2 bedrooms and 3 bedrooms units. This condo project is expected to be completed by summer 2022. Plazacorp's Theatre District development at 8-20 Widmer St. is scheduled for completion in late 2021. Empire Developments will develop Empire Maverick Condos, a 49 Storeys new condominiums at 323 King St West, Toronto. Its estimated completion is fall 2022. Pemberton Group will develop 543 Richmond at 543 Richmond Street West on the corner of Portland. While details of the scope of the project have not yet been revealed, an early drawing from the city shows that the multi-phase project will have 476 units and 15 storeys per phase. A podium terrace will hold outdoor amenities which are yet to be determined. Toronto architecture firm Quadrangle will be responsible for the build.

Gunther was a scion of the Ekkeharding noble family first recorded around Naumburg, which may be affiliated with the Ottonian dynasty. In 962, he was already regarded as a margrave in the newly created Diocese of Magdeburg, alongside Count Wigger of Bilstein and Wigbert. He was appointed to the newly created Merseburger march by Emperor Otto I following the death of Margrave Gero the Great in 965, after which the Marca Geronis was split in several smaller parts. The establishment of the march was followed by the Merseburg diocese under Bishop Boso in 968. Gunther supported Duke Henry II the Quarrelsome of Bavaria in his revolt against Emperor Otto II and was therefore deposed as margrave and banished in 976, while his march fell to Thietmar of Meissen. Gunther nevertheless became reconciled with Otto II and after Thietmar's death in 979 was reinstalled as margrave. He joined Otto's campaign in Calabria in 982 and died there in the Battle of Stilo against the Saracens.Reuter, 177. He was succeeded by Rikdag, who then united the marches of Meissen, Merseburg and Zeitz under his rule. According to chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg, Gunther may have been married to Dobrawa, daughter of Duke Boleslaus the Cruel of Bohemia and consort of Duke Mieszko I of Poland from 965. He left three sons: Eckard I, who succeededed Rikdag as Margrave of Meissen in 985; Gunzelin of Kuckenburg, who followed his brother in 1002, and Bruno, who defended Meissen against the troops of duke Bolesław I Chrobry of Poland in 1009.

The shading technique on the shield and other elements is pronounced and creates a sense of depth. Black-and-gray (also black-and-grey, black and grey/gray) is a style of tattooing that uses only black ink in varying shades. This tattooing style is thought to have originated from prisons in the 1970s and 1980s and was later popularized in tattoo parlors. Origin Black-and- gray is sometimes referred to as \\"jailhouse\\" or \\"joint style\\" and is thought to have originated in prisons where inmates had limited access to different materials; they resorted to using guitar strings for needles and used cigarette ashes or pen ink to produce tattoos. Inmates would construct makeshift tattoo machines that were powered using the small motors available in tape players. Prisons generally prohibit inmates from tattooing, so these were likely to be done in secret. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, jailhouse then became popularized in tattoo parlors outside of prison and was renamed \\"black and gray\\". Black-and-gray is also thought to have originated from the Chicano or cholo culture in Los Angeles. Technique Typically, black-and-gray tattoo work is produced by diluting the black ink with distilled water in varying proportions to create a \\"wash\\" that results in lighter shades. Gray shades can also be produced by mixing small amounts of black ink with white ink, which produces a thicker but brighter result and requires a slower application. Shading is typically an important component for these types of tattoos as they will fade over a period of years without strong black tones, which provide contrast and allows the tattoo to stand out. Subtle kinds of shading in black-and-gray are considered to require a high level of skill and illustrates professionalism in the industry. Common usage Example of an irezumi tattoo depicting rising koi. Black-and-gray techniques are often employed for a variety of tattoos. Japanese irezumi, such as the rising koi, are traditionally done using black-and-gray, although colored irezumi sometimes use black-and-gray backgrounds in a manner similar to sumi-e brushwork. Classic Chicano tattoos — which include a broad range of imagery such as icons in Catholicism or the Mexican flag and partially originated from prison life — are also normally done in black-and-gray. Photo-realistic portraits are also commonly done in black-and-gray, and typically resist deterioration better than color portraits. In some color tattoos, artists can use black-and-gray initially to provide a foundation for the subsequent shading using colors. The colored ink can be added directly above the black- and-gray portions of the tattoo. Examples File:A045 afferni tattoo ritratto portrait.jpg File:Mlght13.jpg File:Man with a full back tattoo.

He picked up his first major league win on June 10, , in a game against the Florida Marlins. Sonnanstine demonstrated strikeout potential in 2007 when, through seven innings of work against the Marlins, he struck out ten batters, including a franchise-record seven in a row, while allowing two runs on seven hits. He also went 2-for-3 as a batter, scored his first run and drove in his first career run.

Sonnanstine went 1 for 3 with an RBI double and ended up winning the game despite the lineup error and giving up five runs. In 2009, through July 1 Sonnanstine had the highest ERA of any major league pitcher (6.61). After the Rays traded Scott Kazmir to the Los Angeles Angels, Sonnanstine was recalled from Triple-A Durham to fill the hole in the starting rotation. In his first game since the beginning of the season against the rival Boston Red Sox, he posted a loss, giving up 3 earned runs, 2 home runs, 8 hits and 5 total runs in 4 innings with a pitch count of 91 (55s-36b).

This angle of incidence where the angle of deviation in a prism is minimum is called the Minimum Deviation Position of the prism and that very deviation angle is known as the Minimum Angle of Deviation (denoted by \\\\delta_{min}, D_{\\\\lambda} or D_{m}). Light is deflected as it enters a material with refractive index > 1\\\\. A ray of light is deflected twice in a prism. The sum of these deflections is the deviation angle. When the entrance and exit angles are equal, the deviation angle of a ray passing through a prism will be minimal. In Minimum Deviation, the refracted ray in the prism is parallel to its base. In other words, the light ray is symmetrical about the axis of symmetry of the prism. Also, the angles of refractions are equal i.e. r_1 = r_2. And, the angle of incidence and angle of emergence equal each other ( i = e). This is clearly visible in the graph in the next section. Formula and Graph The formula for minimum deviation can be derived by exploiting the geometry in the prism. The approach involves replacing the variables in Snell's Law in terms of the Deviation and Prism Angles by making the use of the above properties. File: Minimum Deviation.jpg From the Angle Sum of \\\\triangle OPQ, A + \\\\angle OPQ + \\\\angle OQP = 180^\\\\circ \\\\implies A = 180^\\\\circ - (90 - r) - (90 - r) \\\\implies r = \\\\frac{A}{2} Using the Exterior Angle Theorem in \\\\triangle PQR, D_{m} = \\\\angle RPQ + \\\\angle RQP \\\\implies D_{m} = i - r + i - r \\\\implies 2r + D_{m}= 2i \\\\implies A + D_{m} = 2i \\\\implies i = \\\\frac{A + D_{m}} {2} This can also be derived by putting i = e in the Prism Formula: i + e = A + \\\\delta From Snell's law, n_{21} = \\\\dfrac{\\\\sin i}{\\\\sin r} \\\\therefore n_{21} = \\\\dfrac{\\\\sin \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{A + D_{m}}{2}\\\\right)}{\\\\sin \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{A}{2}\\\\right)} \\\\therefore D_m = 2 \\\\sin^{-1} \\\\left(n \\\\sin \\\\left(\\\\frac{A}{2}\\\\right)\\\\right) - A (where n is the refractive index, A is the Angle of Prism and D_{m} is the Minimum Angle of Deviation.) This is a convenient way used to measure the refractive index of a material(liquid or gas) by directing a light ray through a prism of negligible thickness at minimum deviation filled with the material or in a glass prism dipped in it. Worked out examples: Ans.: 37^\\\\circ, 49^\\\\circ Sol.: Here, A = 60^\\\\circ , n = 1.5 Plugging them in the above formula, \\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\left(\\\\frac{60 + \\\\delta}{2} \\\\right)}{\\\\sin \\\\left(\\\\frac{60}{2} \\\\right)}= 1.5 \\\\implies \\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\left(30 + \\\\frac{\\\\delta}{2} \\\\right)}{\\\\sin(30)}= 1.5 \\\\implies \\\\sin \\\\left(30 + \\\\frac{\\\\delta}{2} \\\\right) = 1.5 \\\\times 0.5 \\\\implies 30 + \\\\frac{\\\\delta}{2} = \\\\sin^{-1}(0.75) \\\\implies \\\\frac{\\\\delta}{2} = 48.6 - 30 \\\\implies \\\\delta = 2 \\\\times 18.6 \\\\therefore \\\\delta \\\\approx 37^\\\\circ Also, i = \\\\frac{(A + \\\\delta)}{2} = \\\\frac{60 + 2 \\\\times 18.6}{2} \\\\approx 49^\\\\circ This is also apparent in the graph below. Ans.: 60^\\\\circ Sol.: Here, \\\\delta = r \\\\implies \\\\delta = \\\\frac{A}{2} Using the above formula, \\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\left(\\\\frac{A + \\\\frac{A}{2}}{2}\\\\right)}{\\\\sin \\\\left(\\\\frac{A}{2} \\\\right)}= 1.4 \\\\implies \\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\left(\\\\frac{3A}{4} \\\\right)}{\\\\sin \\\\left(\\\\frac{A}{2} \\\\right)}= \\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{2}}{ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt 2}} \\\\implies \\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\left(\\\\frac{3A}{4} \\\\right)}{\\\\sin \\\\left(\\\\frac{A}{2} \\\\right)}= \\\\frac{\\\\sin 45^\\\\circ}{\\\\sin 30^\\\\circ} \\\\therefore A = 60^\\\\circ Also, the variation of the angle of deviation with an arbitrary angle of incidence can be encapsulated into a single equation by expressing e in terms of i in the Prism Formula using Snell's Law: \\\\delta = i - A + \\\\sin^{-1} \\\\left(n \\\\cdot \\\\sin\\\\left(A - \\\\sin^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sin i}{n}\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\right) Finding the minima of this equation will also give the same relation for minimum deviation as above. In this graph of the Angle of Deviation vs the Angle of Incidence, δ corresponds to two values of i and e(i'). For Minimum Deviation, however, i equals e. For Thin Prism In a thin or small angle prism, as the angles become very small, the sine of the angle nearly equals the angle itself and this yields many useful results. \\\\because D_m and A are very small, \\\\implies n \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\frac{A + D_{m}}{2}\\\\right)}{\\\\left(\\\\frac{A}{2}\\\\right)} \\\\implies n = \\\\frac{A + D_m}{A} \\\\implies An - A = D_m \\\\therefore D_{m} = A(n - 1) Interestingly, using a similar approach with the Snell's Law and the Prism Formula for an in general thin-prism ends up in the very same result ofr the Deviation Angle. \\\\because i, e and r are small, n \\\\approx \\\\frac{i}{r_1} , and n \\\\approx \\\\frac{e}{r_2} From the Prism Formula, \\\\delta = i + e - A = nr_1 + nr_2 - A = n(r_1 + r_2) - A = nA - A = A(n - 1) Thus, it can be said that a Thin Prism is always in Minimum Deviation. Exprimental Determination Minimum Deviation can be found Manually or with Spectrometer. Either the prism is kept fixed and the incidence angle is adjusted or the prism is rotated keeping the light source fixed. File:Experiment setup.svg Minimum Angle of Dispersion The Minimum Angle of Dispersion for white light is the difference in minimum deviation angle between red and violet rays of a light ray through a prism. The Angle of Dispersion in a Prism Applications Drawing radii to the points of interference reveals that the angles of refraction are equal, thereby proving minimum deviation. One of the factors that causes a rainbow is the bunching of light rays at the minimum deviation angle that is close to the rainbow angle(42°). thumb It is also responsible for phenomena like halos and sundogs, produced by the deviation of sunlight in mini prisms of hexagonal ice crystals in the air bending light with a minimum deviation of 22°.

Fremantle was the only ship of the class not constructed in Australia, and it is claimed that her delivery voyage was the longest ever made by a patrol boat. Design  Starting in the late 1960s, planning began for a new class of patrol boat to replace the Attack class, with designs calling for improved seakeeping capability, and updated weapons and equipment.Mitchell, Farewell to the Fremantle class In 1976, Brooke Marine of the United Kingdom won the contract to produce the lead ship. The Fremantles had a full load displacement of , were long overall, had a beam of , and a maximum draught of .Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946, p. 89 Main propulsion machinery consisted of two MTU series 538 diesel engines, which supplied to the two propeller shafts. Exhaust was not expelled through a funnel, like most ships, but through vents below the waterline. The patrol boat could reach a maximum speed of , and had a maximum range of at . The ship's company consisted of 22 personnel. Each patrol boat was armed with a single 40 mm Bofors gun as main armament, supplemented by two .50 cal Browning machine guns and an 81-mm mortar, although the mortar was removed from all ships sometime in the late 1990s. The main weapon was originally to be two 30-mm guns on a twin-mount, but the reconditioned Bofors were selected to keep costs down; provision was made to install an updated weapon later in the class' service life, but this did not eventuate.Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946, p. 88Jones, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 222 Construction Construction of Fremantle began on 11 November 1977, and she was launched on 15 February 1979.Moore, Jane's Fighting Ships 1985–86, p. 26 During sea trials, Fremantle was revealed to be 20 tons over the contract's proscribed weight, leading to unpopularity in the media. However, the design proved its worth when it was diverted from trial to successfully rescue a British sailor thrown from a fishing trawler. Because of the sea trials, Fremantle was not commissioned until 17 March 1980. Delivery of previous Brooke Marine patrol boats to the client nations was normally done by loading the craft on a heavy lift ship.Thomas, Halfway Around the World in Eighty Days, p. 2 It was instead decided in 1979 to sail Fremantle to Australia; the Royal Australian Navy wanted to learn as much about the capabilities of the new design as quickly as possible, and the loss of an Omani Navy patrol vessel from a heavy lift ship during a storm was a cause of concern. On 7 June 1980, Fremantle left Lowestoft, England on the delivery voyage to Australia. The voyage took 82 days, 48 spent at sea. During this voyage, Fremantle travelled through the Mediterranean Sea, Suez Canal, Red Sea, along the coast of India, through Maritime Southeast Asia, then down the east coast of Australia to Sydney.Thomas, Halfway Around the World in Eighty Days, p. 3 During this voyage, Fremantle was tested to limits; encountering windstorms reaching Force 6, a sandstorm in the Red Sea, high-temperature and -humidity conditions, and a monsoon. By the time Fremantle arrived in Australia on 27 August 1980, she had already sailed . This is claimed to be the longest voyage undertaken by a single patrol boat. Operational history During her career, Fremantle was primarily involved in operations against illegal fishing and illegal immigration, and supporting Australian Coastwatch and the Australian Customs Service.HMAS Fremantle (II), Royal Australian Navy Decommissioning and fate On 11 August 2006, HMAS Fremantle was decommissioned at HMAS Coonawarra, Darwin.Sun finally sets on HMAS Fremantle Fremantle was the eighth ship of her class to be decommissioned. Fremantle was in service for 26 years, and travelled a distance of from commissioning. The patrol boat was broken up for scrap in Darwin during 2006 and 2007, at a cost of $450,000 to the Australian government.

After a cult following built over many years, music royalties enticed Fox to semi-reluctantly return to music in 2007. He released a third solo album in 2012. Early career Bill Fox was the lead singer and guitarist of the three-piece Cleveland, Ohio garage pop band The Mice from 1984 to 1988. The band released one single, one EP and one LP before Fox unexpectedly and suddenly exited the band, much to the dismay of his brother and bandmate Tommy Fox. The band was one of the most successful indie bands on the burgeoning Ohio power pop scene at the time, and has been cited as an influence by the Dayton, Ohio band Guided by Voices. Solo career and exit from music In the 1990s, Fox released two solo folk albums. The Lo-fi recordings on these albums were often made in his apartment using a 4-track cassette recorder using a microphone box or his thigh as percussion instruments. After a brief West Coast tour for his second album, Fox promptly quit the music business and remained intentionally disconnected from all media contacts regarding his music for nearly a decade. Return to music Fox was the subject of a lengthy article by Joe Hagan in the June/July 2007 issue of The Believer, in which he is referred to as \\"one of America’s greatest contemporary songwriters.\\" Hagan set out to make contact with Fox and get an answer to the question \\"Why Did Bill Fox Stop Playing Music?\\" Though he did not meet Fox, he did get his answer. Hagan's article made a large impact on past and present fans of Fox to rediscover his music. Reportedly the article prompted some iTunes royalties that have inspired Fox to both allow the reissue of his solo albums and begin performing again. On April 3, 2008, Scat Records announced Fox had agreed to allow them to re-release both of his albums on vinyl and CD. Robert Griffin, owner of Scat Records, told cleveland.com what Fox thinks of the reissues: \\"He just thinks they're music, and God, if some of these weird people still want to buy 'em, OK, let's print some more up.\\" The reissue of Shelter from the Smoke was released late 2009, adding three tracks from Fox's short-lived early 1990s group The Radio Flyers, as well as both songs from the 1995 Bird of the World 7\\" single. A reissue of Transit Byzantium has yet to appear. In 2009, Fox began to perform again in his native Cleveland and surrounding areas. In May 2010, he headlined at the 16th anniversary concerts of Kelp Records, based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Fox headlined anniversary performances in Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa. On June 8, 2010, alternative rock band Nada Surf released a cover of Fox's song \\"Electrocution\\" on an album titled if i had a hifi. On October 20, 2011, a video entitled \\"An Anthem For Occupy Wall Street\\" was uploaded to YouTube. It contains images of the Occupy Wall Street events of that year along with a previously unreleased song by Bill Fox, entitled \\"Men Who Are Guilty of Crimes.\\" Bill Fox approved the song's use in the video, discussing it in a November 2011 interview. In 2012, Fox released his first album of new music in 14 years titled One Thought Revealed. He continues to play occasional shows. In 2016, Fox released his first single since 1995, a split seven inch with Forgotten Souls of Antiquity. In 2017 a re-issue of his cassette-only album 'Before I Went to Harvard' was pressed onto 12\\" vinyl through Eleventh Hour Recording Company and a previously unreleased song entitled \\"Mole in the Ground was included on Sound Asleep Records' \\"Hit the Hay Vol. 9\\" compilation.

He served as the Secretary of the territory and from 1873 to 1874, he was the Governor of the Colorado Territory. He was a justice of the Colorado Supreme Court from 1876 to 1888 and was Chief Justice from 1879 to 1882. He was married to Josephine Evans, the daughter of Territorial Governor John Evans. She died of tuberculosis following the birth and death of her only child; the Evans Memorial Chapel was built by her father in her memory. Early life and education Samuel Hitt Elbert was born in Logan County, Ohio. His parents were Achsa Hitt, the daughter of Rev. Samuel Hitt, and John Downs Elbert, a physician and surgeon. He descends from early colonists and Huguenots. His great-grandfather, Dr. John Lodman Elbert, was a surgeon during the American Revolution. He moved with his family to the Iowa Territory in 1840. He attended public school, where the curriculum included agriculture. He studied at Ohio Wesleyan University where he was a member of Beta Theta Pi. He graduated in 1854 and continued to study law at a leading law firm in Dayton, Ohio for two years. He was then admitted to the bar in Ohio in 1856. He moved to Plattsmouth in the Nebraska Territory in the spring of 1857 to practice law. Career In Nebraska, Elbert became active in the newly formed Republican Party. He attended the Republican National Convention in 1860 in Chicago, where Abraham Lincoln was nominated for president. He became acquainted with John Evans and Lincoln at the convention. He later also attended the 1864 National Union National Convention where Lincoln was renominated. He left Nebraska for Colorado in 1862. Elbert was appointed Secretary of the Colorado Territory that year by Abraham Lincoln. He occasionally stood in for Governor Evans when needed. He served from 1862 until 1867 under Governors John Evans and Alexander Cummings. He dealt with hostilities between settlers and Native Americans. During the Civil War, he helped form and then mobilized the 2nd and 3rd Colorado regiments for the war effort. He helped organize the Republican Party in the Colorado Territory. He formed the law firm Charles & Elbert with J. Q. Charles. He was elected to the territorial legislature in 1869. He was made secretary one year later. He became the chairman of the Republican central committee for Colorado in 1872. Elbert was appointed as the sixth Governor of the Colorado Territory by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1873. President Grant became the first U.S. President to visit Colorado that summer. The President stayed at Governor Elbert's home. Elbert and Grant visited Central City, and met with a group of Ute leaders to create a treaty (Brunot Treaty of 1873) that would allow some of the Ute's land to be accessible to railroad and mining companies. As governor, he promoted irrigation methods and founded the Western Irrigation Conference, which wrote water laws to ensure viable agriculture industries in Colorado. Governor Elbert served until his predecessor, Edward M. McCook, was reappointed Governor in the spring of 1874, but was not confirmed by Congress until July. Elbert spent a year in Europe, during which he became aware of the political and social conditions there. Colorado became a state in 1876. Elbert was elected to the Colorado Supreme Court in 1876 and served until 1888. During that time, he served as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court from 1879 to 1883. He resigned in 1888 due to his poor health, and went abroad. He received an honorary LLD from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1880. Personal life After a two-year courtship, Elbert married 18 year old Josephine Evans in June 1865. She was the daughter of Territorial Governor John Evans and Hannah Pedrick Canby. They were married by Bishop Matthew Simpson. George Armstrong Custer was the best man. Evans Memorial Chapel built by John Evans after the death of his daughter, Josephine The Elberts lived in a red brick house on E Street, now 14th Street. Josephine gave birth to their only child, John Evans Elbert about late March 1868. He died on August 10, 1868. Josephine, who had consumption (tuberculosis), died on October 1868. Her father built the Evans Memorial Chapel in her memory in 1878. It is located at the University of Denver campus. After having been in failing health for some time, Elbert died on November 27, 1899 in Galveston, Texas and is buried at Riverside Cemetery in Denver, as are Josephine and their son John. Legacy Elbert County, Colorado; Elbert, Colorado; and Mount Elbert, the highest peak in the Rocky Mountains, are named in honor of Elbert. Grateful miners named Mount Elbert after the governor because he facilitated a treaty with the Ute tribe, which opened up more than of Indian reservation to mining and railroad activity.

She had a small, devoted following, but did not reach a mass audience during her lifetime. She rose to sudden literary fame eleven years after her death, in August 2015, with Farrar, Straus and Giroux's publication of a volume of selected stories, A Manual for Cleaning Women, edited by Stephen Emerson. It hit The New York Times bestseller list in its second week, and within a few weeks, had outsold all her previous books combined.  Early life  Berlin was born in Juneau, Alaska, and spent her childhood on the move, following her father's career as a mining engineer. The family lived in mining camps in Idaho, Montana and Arizona, and Chile, where Lucia spent most of her youth. As an adult, she lived in New Mexico, Mexico, New York City, Northern and Southern California, and Colorado.  Career  Berlin began publishing relatively late in life, under the encouragement and sometimes tutelage of poet Ed Dorn. Her first small collection, Angels Laundromat, was published in 1981, but her published stories were written as early as 1960. She published seventy-six stories in her lifetime. Several of her stories appeared in magazines such as The Atlantic and Saul Bellow's The Noble Savage. Berlin published six collections of short stories, but most of her work can be found in three later volumes from Black Sparrow Books: Homesick: New and Selected Stories (1990), So Long: Stories 1987-92 (1993) and Where I Live Now: Stories 1993-98 (1999). Berlin was never a bestseller, but was widely influential within the literary community. She has been compared to Raymond Carver and Richard Yates. Her one-page story \\"My Jockey\\", consisting of five paragraphs, won the Jack London Short Prize for 1985. Berlin also won an American Book Award in 1991 for Homesick, and was awarded a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. In 2015, a compendium of her short story work was released under the title, A Manual for Cleaning Women: Short Stories. It debuted at #18 on the New York Times bestseller list its first week, and rose to #15 on the regular list the following week. The collection was ineligible for most of the year-end awards (either because she was deceased, or it was recollected material), but was named to a large number of year-end lists, including the New York Times Book Reviews \\"10 Best Books of 2015.\\". It debuted at #14 on the ABA's Indie bestseller list and #5 on the LA Times' list. It was also a finalist for the Kirkus Prize.  Influences and teaching  Throughout her life, Berlin earned a living through a series of working class jobs, reflected in story titles like \\"A Manual for Cleaning Women,\\" \\"Emergency Room Notebook, 1977,\\" and \\"Private Branch Exchange\\" (referring to telephone switchboards and their operators). Up through the early 1990s, Berlin taught creative writing in a number of venues, including the San Francisco County Jail and the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University. She also took oral histories from elderly patients at Mt. Zion Hospital. In the fall of 1994, Berlin began a two-year teaching position as Visiting Writer at University of Colorado, Boulder. Near the end of her term, she was one of four campus faculty awarded the Student Organization for Alumni Relations Award for Teaching Excellence. \\"To win a teaching award after two years is unheard of,\\" the English Chair Katherine Eggert said later in an obituary. Berlin was asked to stay on at the end of her two-year term. She was named associate professor, and continued teaching there until 2000.  Critical praise  Berlin has been called one of America's best kept secrets. \\"I would place her somewhere in the same arena as Alice Munro, Grace Paley, maybe Tillie Olsen. In common with them, she writes with a guiding intelligent compassion about family, love, work; in a style that is direct, plain, clear, and non-judgmental; with a sense of humor and a gift for the gestures and the words that reveal character, the images that reveal the nature of a place.\\" —Lydia Davis, New Ohio Review, on the story A Manual for Cleaning Women \\"[The stories] are told in a conversational voice and they move with a swift and often lyrical economy. They capture and communicate moments of grace and cast a lovely, lazy light that lasts. Berlin is one of our finest writers and here she is at the height of her powers.\\" —Molly Giles, San Francisco Chronicle, on So Long \\"Berlin's literary model is Chekhov, but there are extra-literary models too, including the extended jazz solo, with its surges, convolutions, and asides. This is writing of a very high order.\\" —August Kleinzahler, London Review of Books, on Where I Live Now \\"In the field of short fiction, Lucia Berlin is one of America's best kept secrets. That's it. Flat out. No mitigating conditions. End of review. Well, not quite… [It is] characteristic of all Berlin's stories, a buoyancy: however grim and 'unworthy' her characters, she enters and explores their lives with unfailing high spirits.... A drug rehab center in New Mexico; a story called 'Electric Car, El Paso' ('It was very tall and short, like a car in a cartoon that had run into a wall. A car with its hair standing on end.')... The Christmas party at the dialysis center. 'The machine makes a humming sucking sound with an occasional slurp.' Hundreds of bubble lights on the Christmas tree that gurgle and flow. The man who had had a cadaver transplant. The man who looks like a sweaty manatee. The girl who looks like an albino dinosaur, or an anorexic whippet.... And it goes on, relentless. We're in the West Oakland detox, the residents in the TV pit, watching Leave It to Beaver.... Dust to Dust: 'There are things people just don't talk about. I don't mean the hard things, like love, but the awkward ones, like how funerals are fun sometimes....' In more ways than one, this book is Lucia Berlin.\\" —Paul Metcalf, Conjunctions: 14, on Safe & Sound \\"This remarkable collection occasionally put me in mind of Annie Proulx's Accordion Crimes, with its sweep of American origins and places. Berlin is our Scheherazade, continually surprising her readers with a startling variety of voices, vividly drawn characters, and settings alive with sight and sound.\\" —Barbara Barnard, American Book Review, on Where I Live Now  Personal life  Berlin was married three times and had four sons. Berlin was plagued by health problems, including double scoliosis. Her crooked spine punctured one of her lungs, and she was never seen without an oxygen tank beside her from 1994 until her death. She retired when her condition grew too severe to work, and she later developed lung cancer. She struggled with radiation therapy, which she said felt like having one's bones ground to dust. As her health and finances deteriorated, Berlin moved into a trailer park on the edge of Boulder, and later, a converted garage behind her son's house outside Los Angeles. The move allowed her to be closer to her sons, and made breathing easier (Boulder's elevation had exacerbated her lung problems). Lucia died in her home in Marina del Rey, on her 68th birthday, with one of her favorite books in her hands.  Works and publications   Bibliography  * A Manual for Cleaning Ladies.

It is known as a bleach activator for active oxygen sources, allowing formulas containing hydrogen peroxide releasing chemicals (specifically sodium perborate, sodium percarbonate, sodium perphosphate, sodium persulfate, and urea peroxide) to effect bleaching at lower temperatures. Synthesis NOBS is formed by the reaction of nonanoic acid (or its esters) with phenol followed by aromatic sulfonation using SO3 to form a sulfonic acid at the para-position. Bleach activation NOBS was developed by Procter & Gamble in 1983 and was first used in American laundry detergents in 1988. NOBS is the main bleach activator used in the U.S.A. and Japan. Compared to TAED, which is the predominant bleach activator used in Europe, NOBS is efficient at much lower temperatures. At 20 °C NOBS is 100 times more soluble than TAED in water. When attacked by the perhydroxyl anion (from hydrogen peroxide), NOBS forms the peroxy acid peroxynonanoic acid and releases the leaving group sodium 4-hydroxybenzene sulfonate, which is an inert by-product.

Life and work Castellanos Moya was born in 1957 in Tegucigalpa, Honduras to a Honduran mother and a Salvadoran father. His family moved to El Salvador when he was four years old. He lived there until 1979 when he left to attend York University in Toronto. On a visit home, he witnessed a demonstration of unarmed students and workers in which twenty-one people were killed by government snipers. He left El Salvador that March, but did not go back to Canada for school. Instead, he traveled to Costa Rica and Mexico, where he found work as a journalist. He wrote sympathetically about the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, a political party that formed following the 1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre. He soon, however, grew disillusioned by violent fighting within the party. In 1991 Castellanos Moya returned to El Salvador to write for a monthly cultural magazine, Tendencias. In 1995 he contributed to the founding of the weekly publication Primera Plana and worked there until 1996. Over the next few years he wrote and published several novels, including Senselessness, The She-Devil in the Mirror, and Revulsion: Thomas Bernhard in San Salvador. The protagonist in Revulsion is a Thomas Bernhard-esque character who returns to El Salvador after eighteen years to deliver a 119-page diatribe against the country. The novel enraged some Salvadorans with some calling for a book ban and others throwing the book into fires. Castellanos Moya’s mother received death threats against her son and in 1997 Castellanos Moya fled El Salvador. Starting in 2002 he lived in Mexico City in self-imposed exile for ten years. He began writing a new novel called Guatemale: Nunca mas! (Never Again!). It was published as Insensatez in 2004. In 2008 the novel became his first work to be translated into English. Castellanos Moya was granted residencies in a program supported by the Frankfurt International Book Fair (2004-2006) and as a Writer-in-Residence at City of Asylum/Pittsburgh (2006-2008). In 2009, he was a guest researcher at the University of Tokyo.

The Zocalo is the largest plaza in Latin America. It can hold up to nearly 100,000 people. This section of the capital lies in the municipal borough of Cuauhtémoc, has just over nine square km and occupies 668 blocks. It contains 9,000 buildings, 1,550 of which have been declared of historical importance. Most of these historic buildings were constructed between the 16th and 20th centuries. It is divided into two zones for preservation purposes. Zone A encompasses the pre- Hispanic city and its expansion from the Viceroy period until Independence. Zone B covers the areas all other constructions to the end of the 19th century that are considered indispensable to the preservation of the area's architectural and cultural heritage. This is where the Spaniards began to build what is now modern Mexico City in the 16th century on the ruins of the conquered Tenochtitlan, capital of the Aztec Empire. As the centre of the ancient Aztec Empire and the seat of power for the Spanish colony of New Spain, the Centro Historico contains most of the city's historic sites from both eras as well as a large number of museums. This has made it a World Heritage Site. History Fountain with busts honoring Alonso Garcia Bravo, who laid out post-Conquest Mexico City conserving much of the original Aztec infrastructure. Located off Merced Street between Jesus María and Talavera, east of the Zocalo. What is now the historic downtown of Mexico City roughly correlates with the ancient Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, which was founded around 1325. During the prehispanic era, the city developed in a planned fashion, with streets and canals aligned with the cardinal directions, leading to orderly square blocks. The island that the city was founded on was divided into four calpullis or neighborhoods that were divided by the main north-south roads leading to Tepeyac and Iztapalapa respectively and the west-east road that lead to Tacuba and to a dike into the lake, respectively. The calpullis were named Cuepopan, Atzacualco, Moyotla and Zoquipan, which had subdivisions and a \\"tecpan\\" or district council each. The intersection of these roads was the center of the city and of the Aztec world. Here were the Templo Mayor, the palaces of the tlatoani or emperors, palaces of nobles such as the \\"House of the Demons\\" and the \\"House of the Flowers\\". Also located here were the two most renowned Aztec schools: the Telpuchcalli for secular studies and the Calmecac for priestly training. When the Spaniards arrived, the city had aqueducts built by Moctezuma Ilhuicamina and Ahuizotl as well as a large dike constructed to the east of the city. After the Spanish conquest, this design remained largely intact, mostly due to the efforts of Alonso Garcia Bravo, who supervised much of the rebuilding of the city. This reconstruction conserved many of the main thoroughfares such as Tenayuca, renamed Vallejo; Tlacopan, renamed México Tacuba, and Tepeyac, now called the Calzada de los Misterios. They also kept major divisions of the city adding Christian prefixes to the names such as San Juan Moyotla, Santa María Tlaquechiuacan, San Sebastián Atzacualco and San Pedro Teopan. In fact, most of the centro historicos is built with the rubble of the destroyed Aztec city. A number of people during this time, all Spaniards, accumulated vast wealth mostly through mining and commerce in the 17th and 18th centuries. This wealth is reflected in the various mansions scattered in the centro such as the Palace of Iturbide and Casa de Azulejos (House of Tiles). This house was built in the 16th century in Arab style but its namesake tiles were added in 1747 when the Count of the Valley of Orizaba ordered the Talavera tiles from Puebla. In the early part of the 20th century, as a result of the Latin American posture of then-Minister of Public Education José Vasconcelos, many of the streets to the north and west of the Zocalo were renamed after Latin American countries. The Zócalo and surrounding sites The National Palace in Mexico City Historically, the Zócalo, or main plaza, has been a venue for fine and popular cultural events. Some example of events held here recently are Spencer Tunick's photo shoot, the Ashes and Snow Nomadic museum and a skateboarding/BMX event that drew 50,000 young people on 24 August 2008. The Festival de México is an annual event with programs dedicated to art (popular and high) and academia. In 2008, was the 24th Festival with 254 performances and shows from over 20 countries in 65 plazas and other locations in this section of the city. It is central to national level protests such as those staged by Lopez Obrador after the 2006 Presidential Elections and the nationwide protest against crime held on August 30, 2008. National Monte de Piedad Just off the Zócalo are the Palacio Nacional, the Cathedral Metropolitana, the Templo Mayor with its adjoining museum, and Nacional Monte de Piedad building. The Palacio Nacional borders the entire east side of the Zocalo and contains the offices of the President of Mexico, the Federal Treasury, the National Archives as well as murals depicting pre-Hispanic life and a large mural filling the central stairway depicting the entire history of the Mexican nation from the Conquest on. This palace was built on the ruins of Moctezuma II's palace beginning in 1521, using the same tezontle stone used to build the Aztec palace. It was originally in the Hernán Cortés family until the king of Spain bought it to house the viceroys of New Spain and remained so (despite being destroyed and rebuilt again in 1692) until Mexican independence. Facing the Zócalo above a central balcony is the Campana (Bell) of Dolores, which is rung by the president each 15th of Sept to celebrate Independence. Mexico City Cathedral The Metropolitan Cathedral, dedicated to the Assumption of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary, occupies the north end of the Zócalo. The site originally was part of the Aztec Sacred Precinct (called the Teocalli) and contained the main tzompantli, or rack for the skulls of sacrifice victims. The first church was erected between 1524 or 1526 and 1532 and was elevated to the rank of cathedral on 2 September 1530 by Pope Clement VII. The foundations for a new cathedral were begun in 1562 and the foundation stone was laid in 1573 in the time of Archbishop Pedro Moya de Contreras and of the 4th Viceroy.Castellanos, Montiel Martín, Metropolitan Cathedral of Mexico City, Editorial Octavio Antonio Colmenares y Vargas, Mexico City (2012), pp.15-20 Although the works had not been concluded, the cathedral received its first dedication on 2 February 1656.Toussaint, Manuel, La Catedral de México, Porrúa, México (1973), p.43. The completion in 1813 of the neo-classical additions designed by Manuel Tolsa was celebrated on 15 August 2013 by Cardinal Carrera who opened and entered through the Holy Door in the center of the façade prior to celebrating Pontifical High Mass in the cathedral.See the program of events on the cathedral's official website accessed 28 March 2015. Between 1989 and 2000 extensive engineering works were conducted to arrest and rectify damage and distortions caused to the structure by the uneven rate and extent of the sinking of the building provoked by the continuous settlement of the ground on which it stands. This began with the drainage of the lake of the Valley of Mexico initiated in 1607 and has continued with the reduction of the water- table caused by the pumping of water for use by Mexico City's rapidly expanding population. The last of the temporary props which had disfigured the interior of the building during the engineering works were removed on 28 November 2000.For a description of the works see Castellanos, Montiel Martín, Metropolitan Cathedral of Mexico City, Editorial Octavio Antonio Colmenares y Vargas, Mexico City (2012), pp.141-150. A view of the ruins of the Templo Mayor with museum in background The Templo Mayor archeological site and museum, is the center of the ancient teocalli, located now just northeast of the Zócalo. It was demolished by Hernán Cortés in the 1520s and its location forgotten. The exact site was determined in the beginning of the 20th century, but the decision to excavate was not made until 1978, when electrical workers chanced upon an eight-ton stone disk depicting the Aztec goddess Coyolxauhqui. Excavation unearthed a pyramid built in multiple layers. This is the spot where, according to legend, the Aztecs saw their sign to settle from their wanderings, an eagle perched on a nopal cactus with a snake in its beak, which is still the symbol of Mexico today. The Nacional Monte de Piedad building is the national pawn shop, founded in 1775 and one of the largest second-hand shops in the world. On this site were houses that belonged to the last Aztec ruler, Moctezuma II, which Hernán Cortés took for his own after the Conquest. These houses originally stretched from modern-day Isabel la Catolica, Madero, Tacuba and Monte de Piedad streets, prompting one chronicler, Cervantes de Salazar to comment that the residence was not a palace but rather another city. Notable sites north of the Zócalo Facade of the Church of Santo Domingo. Santo Domingo refers to the Church of Santo Domingo and the adjoining plaza. Both are located three blocks north of the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral following Republica de Brasil Street with Belisario Dominguez Street separating the two. Officially known as the Señor de la Expiación Chapel, the church is located on the north side of Belisario Dominguez and faces the plaza. It is all that is left from the first convent to be established in New Spain. To the south of the church is Plaza San Domingo. It is flanked to the west by the Portal de Evangelistas, which is a Tuscan colonnade with round arches. Scribes with typewriters and antique printing machines work in this Portal. Scribes offer their services to illiterate clients, often offering services similar to that of lawyers, counselors, and financial consultants. A statue of Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez, a heroine of the Mexican War of Independence stands in a fountain in the middle of the plaza. Quetzalcoatl head on the corner of the Museum of the City of Mexico. The San Ildefonso College currently is a museum and cultural center considered to be the birthplace of the Mexican muralism movement. San Ildefonso began as a prestigious Jesuit boarding school, and after the Reform War, it gained educational prestige again as National Preparatory School. This school and the building closed completely in 1978, then reopened as a museum and cultural center in 1994. The museum has permanent and temporary art and archeological exhibitions in addition to the many murals painted on its walls by José Clemente Orozco, Diego Rivera and others. The complex is located between San Ildefonso Street and Justo Sierra Street in the historic center of Mexico City. * Secretaría de Educación Pública at Calle Argentina * Centro Cultural de España (Cultural Center of Spain), located on Republica de Guatemala street just north of the Mexico City Cathedral * Museum Archive of Photography, located at the corner of Republica de Guatemala and Republica de Argentina Street * Lirico Theatre, located on Republica de Cuba street * Antigua Escuela de Economía (Old School of Economics), located on Republica de Cuba Street * Colegio Nacional, located on The Colegio Nacional Building, located on Luis Gonzalez Obregon Street * Old Customs building, on Republica de Brasil just off the Plaza Santo Domingo * Palace of the Inquisition (Museum of Mexican Medicine) located on Republica de Brasil Notable sites south of the Zócalo The Supreme Court building Saint Augustine House The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation is located just off the main plaza of Mexico City on the corners of Pino Suárez and Carranza Streets. It was built between 1935 and 1941 by Antonio Muñoz Garcia. Prior to the Conquest, this site was reserved for the ritual known as \\"Dance of the Flyers\\" which is still practiced today in Papantla. Its ownership was in dispute during much of the colonial period, eventually becoming the site of a very large market known as El Volador. The interior of the building contains four panels painted in 1941 by José Clemente Orozco, two of which are named \\"The Social Labor Movement\\" and \\"National Wealth.\\" There is also one mural done by American artist George Biddle entitled \\"War and Peace\\" at the entrance to the library. * Temple of Saint Augustine Located on Avenida Republica de El Salvador * The original El Palacio de Hierro store located on Carranza and 20 de noviembre streets * The original Liverpool department store on Carranza and 20 de noviembre streets * Saint Augustine House Located on Republica de Uruguay and 5 de Febrero streets * The Chapel of the Most Holy Conception of Tlaxcoaque, one of the oldest churches in Mexico City on Fray Servando de Mier * Church of San Bernardo off the Zocalo Notable sites west of the Zocalo Facade of Palace of Iturbide The Palace of Iturbide - this large palatial home, located in the historic center of Mexico City on Madero Street #17 was built by the Count of San Mateo Valparaíso in the 18th century as a wedding gift for his daughter. It gained the name \\"Palace of Iturbide\\" because Agustín de Iturbide lived and accepted the crown as Mexico's first emperor there after independence from Spain. Today, the restored building houses the Fomento Cultural Banamex and has been renamed the Palacio de Cultura Banamex. Torre Latinoamericana The Torre Latinoamericana - This is one of the best-known skyscrapers in Latin America. It was begun in 1948 and completed in 1956 and is 182 meters tall, antennae included. It is located on the corner of Eje Central and Juarez Streets. It was the tallest tower in Mexico prior to the construction of Torre Pemex. The building has survived two major earthquakes since it was built, one in 1957 and the other in 1985. Museo Nacional de Arte The Museo Nacional de Arte (MUNAL) is the Mexican National Art Museum, located in the historical center of Mexico City. The museum is housed in a neoclassical building at No. 8 Tacuba, Col. Centro, Mexico City. It houses a collection representing the history of Mexican art from the late pre-Hispanic era to the early 20th century. It is recognizable by Manuel Tolsá's large equestrian statue of Charles IV of Spain who was the monarch just before Mexico gained its Independence. It was originally in the Zocalo but it was moved to several locations, not out of deference to the king but rather to conserve a piece of art, according to the plaque at the base. It arrived to its final location in 1979. View of the Palacio de Correos The Palacio de Correos de Mexico (Postal Palace of Mexico City) also known as the \\"Correo Mayor\\" (Main Post Office) is located in the historic center of Mexico City, on the Eje Central (Lazaro Cardenas) near the Palacio de Bellas Artes.

It is housed in what was the Palacio del Arzobispado (Palace of the Archbishopric), built in 1530 under Friar Juan de Zumárraga on the base of the destroyed pyramid dedicated to the Aztec god Tezcatlipoca. It remained the archbishphoric until 1867 when the Finance Ministry Accountancy Department was established there. The modern museum houses an exhibit dedicated to this god as well as a large art collection. Facade of La Santísima La Santísima Church is located at the corner of La Santísima and Emiliano Zapata streets. Its full name is Temple and Hospital of the Most Holy Trinity (Templo y Antiguo Hospital de la Santisíma Trinidad). The church was built between 1755 and 1783 as a temple for the adjoining hospital/hospice for priests. The church still retains its original function but the adjoining hospital and office sites have since moved into private hands with only parts of the original structures still intact and preserved. The church is also noted for the fact that it has sunk almost three meters since it was built. Courtyard of the José Luis Cuevas Museum with \\"La Giganta\\" The José Luis Cuevas Museum is located just off the main plaza, or Zocalo of Mexico City in a building that was the convent for the neighboring Church of Santa Ines (Agnes of Rome). This convent was founded in 1600 by Don Diego Caballero and his wife Doña Inés de Velasco. The convent existed until 1861, when, due to the Nationalization of Church Property Act, all convents and monasteries in the country were disbanded. The convent's church and residence hall where separated and the Church of Santa Inés still maintains its original function. The residence hall became private property, functioning mostly as tenements until artist José Luis Cuevas bought the property with the intention to restoring it and establishing the current museum dedicated to his art and art of contemporary Latin America. The House of the First Print Shop in the Americas at the corner of Moneda and Licenciado Primo Verdad streets was the home of the first printing press/print shop in the New World. The house was originally constructed by Gerónimo de Aguilar in 1524 and is located on the outer edge of what was the sacred precinct of the Templo Mayor prior to the Conquest. * Cathedral Nuestra Señora de Balvanera and Sanctuary of San Charbel, built in the 17th century located at Rep Uruguay and Correo Mayor. * Palacio de la Autonomia de UNAM, (Palace of UNAM's Autonomy) located off of Moneda Street. * Departamento de Estadistica Nacional (Dept. of National Statistics) building on Correo Mayor Around the Alameda Central Northwest entrance to the Alameda Central Alameda Central is a public park in downtown Mexico City, adjacent to the Palacio de Bellas Artes, between Juarez Avenue and Hidalgo Avenue. It is a green garden with paved paths and decorative fountains and statues, and is frequently the center of civic events. The area used to be an Aztec marketplace and after the Conquest, the Catholic Church used the area for the burning of heretics and witches. The park was created in 1592, when Viceroy Luis de Velasco decided to create green space here as a public park. The name comes from the Spanish word álamo, which means poplar tree, which were planted here. By the late 19th century, the park included a bandstand and gas (now electric) lamps. On the south side of the park, facing toward the street is the Hemiciclo a Juárez, which is a large white semi- circular monument to Benito Juárez, who is one of Mexico's most beloved presidents. * Palacio de Bellas Artes on Juárez Street * Teatro Hidalgo on Hidalgo Street north of the Alameda Central * Parish of Santa Cruz, Mexico City on Hidalgo Street * Museo Nacional de la Estampa (National Print Museum) located on Hidalgo Street * Franz Mayer Museum on Hidalgo Street * Parish of La Santa Vera Cruz de San Juan de Dios on Hidalgo Street * Ex Temple of Corpus Christi on Juarez Street Barrio Chino Entering Barrio Chino on Dolores Street. Palacio de Bellas Artes. Mexico City's Chinatown, known locally as \\"Barrio Chino\\", is located on two blocks of Dolores Street, just south of the Palacio de Bellas Artes. It is very small, consisting only of a number of restaurants and businesses that import goods. Its diminished size is because most descendants of Chinese immigrants to Mexico in the late 19th and early 20th centuries either intermarried with the local Mexican population and/or were expelled from the country in the 1930s. Despite this, it is considered the nucleus of the approximately 3,000 families with Chinese heritage in Mexico City. Architecture Colonial era noble house in the calle Vizcaínas Even though Spanish colonial buildings make up most of Centro histórico there are examples of different architectural styles *Baroque: Palacio de Iturbide, Casa de los Azulejos, Palacio Nacional and Palacio de los Condes de Valparaíso *Neoclassical: Palacio de Mineria *Italiante style: Palacio de Correos *Art Nouveau Palacio de Bellas Artes *Beaux-Arts: Museo Nacional de Arte, Banco de México *Art Deco Banco de Mexico, Interior of Palacio de Bellas Artes *Functionalist: Torre Latinoamericana Education Primary and secondary schools: * Colegio de San Ignacio de Loyola Vizcaínas 20th and 21st centuries Deterioration of the area From Aztec times, the Centro Historico used to be where the wealthy and elite lived. However, in the early 20th century, these classes began to move to areas west and southwest of the Centro, to neighbourhoods such as Colonia Juárez, Colonia Cuauhtémoc, Colonia Roma and Colonia Condesa. The Centro remained the commercial, political and intellectual center through the mid 20th century although it was around this time that UNAM moved most of its facilities to the new Ciudad Universitaria. The reason for the decline of the city center was partly man-made and partly natural. In the 1940s, the city government froze rents so that until 1998 when the government repealed the law, tenants were still paying 1950's-level rents. With no financial incentive to keep up their properties, landlords let their buildings disintegrate. The 1985 earthquake took its toll on a number of these structures, which were never fixed or rebuilt, leading to slums and garbage- strewn vacant lots. The result was the loss of about 100,000 residents of the \\"Colonia Centro\\", leaving the area almost deserted at night. By the 1980s, so many had fled the Centro that many of its former mansions were either abandoned or turned into tenements for the poor, and its sidewalks and streets taken over by pickpockets and milling vendors. For many people, especially international visitors, Mexico City's reputation for pollution, traffic and crime has made the city someplace to \\"get into and out of as fast as you can\\", seeing it as little more than an airport through which to make their connecting flights to resort areas like Cozumel. Until recently, many of the restaurants in the area, even the best, would close early to allow employees time to get home because the area was not particularly safe at night. Deterioration of religious buildings Church of San Lorenzo Many of historic churches in the oldest parts of the city are in serious disrepair and are in danger of being lost. Efforts to save these churches are hampered by disagreements between the Church and the federal government. Because these churches are both active religious institutions and historical landmarks, their legal situation is complicated. By law, religious institutions cannot appeal to the government for financial help, but agencies like the National Council for Culture and Arts (CONACULTA) do have say in how these places are maintained because of their historic value. Some of the disagreement is over the extent of the deterioration. Conaculta does not believe that any of the 68 religious buildings in the oldest part of city are in imminent danger of collapse. However the Archdiocese of Mexico believes that the structural problems noted constitute a grave danger to both people and to the \\"incalculable artistic and historic value of the buildings.\\" One of the churches in imminent danger is called San Lorenzo Diácono y Mártir, with Our Lady of Loreto, La Santísima Trinidad and La Santa Cruz also requiring prompt attention to avoid collapse. The San Lorenzo and Loreto churches both have had incidences where large pieces of the building, a stone and a window respectively, have fallen, causing damage but no injuries. Despite efforts by the archdiocese to demonstrate the extent of the damage of many of the churches, Conaculta still maintains that none of the buildings are in danger of coming down. Another problem is that the depopulation of the historic center, which leaves these churches fairly empty and the diocese unable to fund restoration work. Revitalization Double-decker tour bus near the Zocalo Starting in the early 2000s, the government has infused 500 million Mexican pesos (US$55 million) into the Historic Center Trust and entered into a partnership with the Fundación Centro Histórico, an organization established by Carlos Slim, to buy dozens of centuries-old buildings for rehabilitation. The significance of this effort was recognized when, in 2006, the Historic Center was included in the 2006 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund.World Monuments Fund - Mexico City Historic Center Work began with the beautification of 34 blocks just north of the Zócalo, digging up the antiquated drainage system and improving water supply. An architect was put in charge of each of the thirteen main streets to restore the facades of more than 500 buildings. The latest infrastructure projects of this type have focused on the southwest portions of the area, on República de El Salvador, Talavera, Correo Mayor, Mesones and Pino Suárez streets, mostly focusing on repaving and improving the outdated drainage systems. In the process, artifacts dating from as early as the pre-Hispanic period have been unearthed. All over the historic center, streets have been pedestrianized, buildings have been restored, and new museums opened. In the 1990s, after many years of controversy, protests and even riots, most street vendors were evicted to other parts of the city. The impetus to bring things back to the city center included the construction of the new mayoral residence just off the Zócalo. The government has buried electric and telephone cables in the area, and replaced old asphalt with paving stones. It has also installed nearly 100 security cameras to help with crime issues. This paved the way for the opening of upscale eateries, bars and fashionable stores. Also, young people are moving into downtown lofts. To attract more tourists, there are new red double-decker buses. As of 2004, investment in the city center has climbed to over 5 billion pesos or 438 million U.S. dollars. According to the Historic Center of Mexico City Trust, this has led to the creation of 15,000 jobs and property owners in the area are showing interest in improving on their investments here. It has also attracted outside investment into the area.

Named after Singaporean hotelier, Khoo Teck Puat, the hospital is part of an integrated development together with the adjoining Yishun Community Hospital. The hospital was officially opened by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew on 15 November 2010, but began seeing outpatients and day surgery patients on 28 March 2010. Spanning over in the Yishun Central Area overlooking the scenic Yishun Pond. The hospital offers an extensive range of medical services and healthcare options for residents living in the north. As of October 2017, KTPH merged with the National Healthcare Group and is now known as Yishun Health, together with Yishun Community Hospital and Admiralty Medical Centre. History A bust of Khoo Teck Puat in the lobby of Goodwood Park Hotel In 2001, plans were announced that a new hospital, the Jurong General Hospital, will be built and will replace the current Alexandra Hospital. The hospital was slated to be completed by 2006. However, in 2004, the plan was scrapped. Instead, the next new public hospital will be built in the north at Yishun and be completed by 28 March 2010.The Straits Times, 23 March 2004, 400-bed hospital for the north in Yishun Central On 28 November 2006, Alexandra Hospital marked the first milestone for its new hospital with a groundbreaking ceremony at the new hospital site. The guest-of-honor was then Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan. An exhibition titled \\"Metamorphosis: From Old to New\\" was held at the same time, showcasing photographs depicting the transformation of the existing hospital building in Alexandra Road from pre- and post-independence years to the present times. 3-dimensional models and perspectives of the new hospital building were also on display. On 16 May 2007, Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan, while attending the HIMSS AsiaPac 2007 conference, announced that the new general hospital in Yishun has been named Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.Channel NewsAsia, 17 May 2007, New hospital in Yishun named Khoo Teck Puat HospitalThe Straits Times, 17 May 2007, New Yishun hospital named after tycoon Khoo Teck Puat In acknowledgement of the S$125 million donation made by the late hotelier's Khoo Teck Puat family towards building and funding of the hospital, instead of the previously planned name Alexandra @ Yishun. On 30 September 2007, Health Minister Khaw, at a community event in Yishun, noted that additional land parcels set aside around the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital could be used for construction of further, more specialised health-care facilities. Beyond 2020, this might eventually create a health-care cluster similar to the diverse facilities now in the vicinity of Singapore General Hospital, providing high-quality healthcare services to the growing population in the north. Possible inclusions in the cluster are a community hospital and medical-tourist hotels. The hospital's specialist outpatient clinics and day surgery operating theatres opened on 29 March 2010. The initial timeline was delayed by about three months because of the Indonesian sand ban and disruption to granite supplies. This forced contractors to bring in more equipment and workers to make up for the time lost. The facility's inpatient wards and acute care and emergency department began operation on 28 June 2010. Charges A Class A single bedded room in a general ward in 2019 starts from S$450 a night.  Key facilities  * 761 beds * 24 wards consisting: 23 general wards and 1 isolation ward * 2 intensive care units * 88 consultation rooms * 8 operating rooms * 6 day surgery operation rooms * 4 endoscopy suites * Other amenities such as family-friendly restrooms, handicapped-friendly restrooms, retail mall, food court and café  Services  * Acute and Emergency Care * Anaesthesia * Cardiology * Dental Surgery * Diabetes Clinic * Diagnostic Radiology * Endocrinology * Eye/Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences * Family and community medicine * Facial Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic * Gastroenterology and Hepatology * General Medicine * Laboratory Medicine Design See Also: Biophilic Design The Khoo Teck Puat Hospital was designed by CPG Consultants in collaboration with RMJM to be patient-friendly. The 10-bedded \\"C\\"-class wards is divided into two sections, each with its own toilet and shower facilities. There is only one drop-off point for the hospital and the distance from it to the emergency department is only 20 metres, while the distance to the specialist clinics is between 20 and 40 metres. There are no protruding sinks or cupboards in the wards so patients are less likely to hurt themselves. The hospital also incorporates environmentally friendly features. The building uses 30% less energy than other older hospitals such as Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Changi General Hospital and Kandang Kerbau Women's and Children's Hospital, a savings of more than S$1 million a year on utilities costs. \\"Fins\\" along the building's walls are designed to channel the prevailing north-east winds into the building. Wind tunnel tests conducted at the National University of Singapore found that the \\"fins\\" would enhance the air flow by 20 to 30%. Sunshades over the windows protect patients from the direct glare of sunlight. The shades also re-direct light towards the ceiling to enhance the brightness of the wards and save on the use of energy. Large fans in public areas are powered by solar panels on the roof. The air-conditioning system draws supply air from its internal courtyards, where the air is cooler, hence reducing the cooling loads. Incident Known as the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) shooting, it is another rare case involving a policeman's revolver being snatched. 24-year-old Muhammad Iskandar Sa’at was arrested on 19 June 2015 for theft of motor vehicle and was escorted to KTPH by two policemen when he claimed to have chest pain. His grip restraints were loosened on his left arm and right wrist for blood drawing and minimising discomfort respectively. While one of the policeman left the examination room to break fast, 31-year-old Staff Sergeant (SSG) Muhammad Sadli Razali was on his mobile phone. Iskandar out of a sudden assaulted SSG Sadli and attempted to escape. As SSG Sadli held on to his legs, Iskandar snatched SSG Sadli's revolver. Even when Iskandar was pinned to the ground, he fired three shots at SSG Sadli. Iskandar was eventually subdued. SSG Sadli suffered gunshot wounds on his left thumb and right root. Iskandar was charged on 22 June 2015 for an unlawful discharge of a firearm under the Arms Offences Act, which carries the mandatory death penalty. Eventually, the charge against Iskandar was reduced to one of an unlawful possession of a firearm for causing hurt to a public servant (this particular offence under the Arms Offences Act warrants a mandatory life sentence, with the offender liable to caning between 6 to 24 strokes of the cane). Iskandar pleaded guilty to the reduced charge, and on 19 March 2018, he was sentenced to life imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane.

Interferometric microscopy allows enhancement of resolution of optical microscopy due to interferometric (holographic) registration of several partial images (amplitude and phase) and the numerical combining. Combining of partial images In interferometric microscopy, the image of a micro-object is synthesized numerically as a coherent combination of partial images with registered amplitude and phase. For registration of partial images, a conventional holographic set-up is used with a reference wave, as is usual in optical holography. Capturing multiple exposures allows the numerical emulation of a large numerical aperture objective from images obtained with an objective lens with smaller-value numerical aperture. Similar techniques allows scanning and precise detection of small particles. As the combined image keeps both amplitude and phase information, the interferometric microscopy can be especially efficient for the phase objects, allowing detection of light variations of index of refraction, which cause the phase shift or the light passing through for a small fraction of a radian. Non- optical waves Although the Interferometric microscopy has been demonstrated only for optical images (visible light), this technique may find application in high resolution atom optics, or optics of neutral atom beams (see Atomic de Broglie microscope), where the Numerical aperture is usually very limited .

Copeland House is a home located in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois, United States. In 1909 the home underwent a remodeling designed by famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The original Italianate home was built in the 1870s. Dr. William H. Copeland commissioned Wright for the remodel and Wright's original vision of the project proposed a three-story Prairie house. That version was rejected and the result was the more subdued, less severely Prairie, William H. Copeland House. On the exterior the most significant alteration by Wright was the addition of a low- pitched hip roof. The house has been listed as a contributing property to a U.S. Registered Historic District since 1973. History The William Copeland House was first constructed around 1873 for William H. Harman. The large, Italianate home represented a microcosm of the general character of homes in Oak Park before Wright began designing buildings. Homes of this style, \\"classically tinged\\" and \\"robust,\\" dotted the landscape of small towns across the United States. In 1909 the then-owner, Dr. William Copeland, a prominent surgeon with offices in Chicago and Cleveland, commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to remodel the home.\\"William H. Copeland House,\\" Oak Park Tourist, excerpted from: Sprague, Paul E. Guide to Frank Lloyd Wright & Prarire School Architecture in Oak Park Oak Park Bicentennial Commission of the American Revolution and Oak Park Landmarks Commission, Village of Oak Park: 1986, (). Retrieved 11 June 2007. It was the second commission for Wright from Copeland; in 1908 the architect had designed a garage for Copeland at the residence.O'Gorman, Thomas J. Frank Lloyd Wright's Chicago, Thunder Bay Press, San Diego: 2004, pp. 270-71, (). Architecture The Copeland House was designed around 1873 by an unknown architect and cast in the Italianate style. Wright's 1909 remodel work included exterior and interior alterations. A new tile roof was added above the decorative brick work; the roof was removed in the 1950s because of its maintenance expenses. The work fused Wright's Prairie style with the traditional Italiante style through the building's exterior lines. The new low-pitched hip roof that Wright designed, along with the wrap- around porch and overhanging eaves are all elements found in the Copeland House which can be found on other Prairie style homes Wright designed. The remodeling work also replaced the original doors with doors, frame, sidelights and a transom window all of Wright's own design. Wright's original plan called for the Copeland House to be remodeled into a three-story Prairie house but that plan was rejected. The result was that the Wright-designed remodel was not as ambitious as it had been planned to be originally. Of the exterior work Wright designed, the new roof was the most substantial. In addition to the expansive exterior work Wright remodeled the main rooms on the ground floor to adhere to his Prairie style. Also inside he designed the dining room sideboard, table and chairs. Significance The Copeland House is an example of Wright's remodeling design work. It is listed as a contributing property to the Frank Lloyd Wright-Prairie School of Architecture Historic District.\\"Frank Lloyd Wright-Prairie School of Architecture Historic District,\\" Property Information Report, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. Retrieved 11 June 2007. The historic district joined the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The William Copeland House is one of three homes in Oak Park that Wright was commissioned to remodel. The other two are the 1906 Peter A. Beachy House and the Hills-DeCaro House, also on Forest Avenue.\\"Hills-DeCaro House,\\" (PDF), Oak Park Landmark Nomination Form, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. Retrieved 11 June 2007. Wright also added a large brick fireplace to the library. However, as evidenced by the sagging cantilevers at Fallingwater and the sagging second floor of the Heurtley House, Wright's use of available materials occasionally exceeded their structural capacity: the mantle of the fireplace is a large stone that cracked under the weight of the bricks, as did steps in the front stairway. The center wall of the coach house also sank due to inadequacy of the center foundation. References * Storrer, William Allin. The Frank Lloyd Wright Companion.

Statesman vehicles were sold through Holden dealerships, and were initially based on the mainstream Holden HQ station wagon platform, thereby providing more interior room and generally more luxurious features than their Holden sedan siblings. Production ceased with the last of the WB series cars in 1984. GM Holden reintroduced the range in 1990 with two long-wheelbase sedans; however, the cars were no longer marketed as Statesman by brand name, but instead as the Holden Statesman and the Holden Caprice. In September 2010 with the \\"Series II\\" updating of the WM series, use of the long-serving Statesman name was discontinued. From 2011 to 2015 Holden's long wheelbase contenders were branded as the Holden Caprice and Holden Caprice V. From the 2016 model year, the Caprice was discontinued leaving the Caprice V as the last remaining Australian build long-wheelbase sedan. The Caprice V was discontinued in October of 2017 as Holden shut down Australian manufacturing operations.  HQ  Chevrolet 350 (New Zealand) Statesman de Ville (HQ) Statesman de Ville (HQ) The original Statesman HQ long-wheelbase sedans were released on 22 July 1971 as a replacement for the HG series Holden Brougham, although drawings exist of an HQ Brougham, albeit in short-wheelbase guise.Wright (1998), p. 209 The first Statesmans were based on these short- wheelbase Holden HQ variants. Statesman was initially offered in two specifications, an upmarket Statesman de Ville and a basic Statesman Custom. Engines ranged from a Red six-cylinder, a the metric designation given to the 253 was always the 4.2 V8, a V8 and a Chevrolet small-block V8, but the de Ville featured the 308 engine as standard equipment. Compared to the short- wheelbase Holden HQ models, the Statesman featured a wheelbase extended by , totalling , in common with the HQ range of Holden station wagons. The extra length was incorporated behind the rear doors to allow for additional rear seat legroom. The Statesman was intended as a rival for Ford Australia's successful FairlaneTony Davis, 1971 GM-H Statesman, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 121 which had debuted in Australian-designed form as the ZA series in March 1967.Ewan Kennedy, Ford Falcon, 2nd Edition, April 2004, pages 29 & 30 The Fairlane had created a new and exclusive category of Australian-made prestige cars. It was derived from the Falcon, with an extended wheelbase and unique front-end and rear-end styling to differentiate the car's appearance. At the time, this category of vehicle proved to be very profitable, in that the sale price was significantly higher than the base car from which the prestige model was derived, and the additional costs of production were only moderate. GM-H went to some length to set the new luxury Statesman marque apart from the Holden equivalent in their sales literature. for the new models, totally avoiding the presence of the name \\"Holden\\", even to the extent of using the term \\"General Motors\\" in lieu of \\"General Motors-Holden's\\". Advertisements in newspapers among other media followed the same format. Statesman HQ models were marketed in South Africa as the Chevrolet Constantia and the Chevrolet de VilleAustralian Muscle Car, Issue 33, pages 84–861972 De Ville and Kommando Article Retrieved from www.moby302.co.za on 25 August 2009 The Constantia was fitted with a locally assembled five-litre V8 or 4.1-litre inline-six and was considered locally built. The Chevrolet de Ville, however, used an imported 5.7-litre V8 as fitted to the Corvette and was priced 33 percent higher than a comparable Constantia V8. The de Ville received praise for being considerably more nimble, lighter, more compact and better handling than the American models it replaced without any loss in accommodation. Power for the 350 V8 was claimed at , SAE and net figures respectively.CAR (November 1972), p. 40 The Statesman was also exported to many other countries as the Chevrolet 350. From 1973 to 1976, HQ models were exported to Japan as the Isuzu Statesman De Ville.Bedwell (2009), p. 199. Isuzu sold 246 De Villes between late 1973 and 1976.  HJ  Statesman de Ville (HJ) Statesman de Ville (HJ) Statesman Caprice (HJ) General Motors–Holden's updated the range in 1974 to create the Statesman HJ, retaining the Statesman de Ville whilst creating a new flagship in the Statesman Caprice, replete with standard luxury features such as air- conditioning and leather seating. Statesman Custom was discontinued with the HJ series and engine availability was restricted to the V8 engine. Statesman Caprice was the most luxurious car offered by General Motors in Australia at that point, with air conditioning, leather seats, electric locking, power windows, and no fewer than 13 interior lamps all featuring on the standard equipment list. The Caprice was visually distinctive with a specific radiator grille, Cadillac-style front bumper overriders, lavish fluted hubcaps, whitewall tyres, and a bonnet ornament borrowed from the Chevrolet Caprice. Once again, the Caprice was General Motors−Holden's response to a new Ford car. In 1973, Ford upped the ante in the Australian prestige car stakes when they unveiled the LTD. This was a Fairlane which had the wheelbase extended again – to – making it the only Australian car which fitted into the US full- size category. The LTD was a significant success for Ford, both in terms of sales and profits, as well as making a statement regarding their prowess as a manufacturer. From March 1976, late in the HJ series, an electromechanical rear drum anti-lock braking system (ABS) was made available on the Caprice. This system, a Delco-Moraine unit, carried over to the subsequent Statesman HX models, but after the introduction of rear disc brakes on the Statesman HZ series, ABS was not seen on another Statesman or Holden model until the Holden Calibra coupe and Holden VQ Caprice in 1991. This new ABS system was the electronic Bosch patent system operating on all four-wheel discs. HJ Statesman de Ville and the HJ Statesman Caprices were sold in South Africa as the AJ series Chevrolet Constantia sedan1976 Chevrolet Constantia brochure and the Chevrolet Caprice Classic,South African 1976 General Motors Chevrolet Caprice Classic Brochure respectively.  HX  The Statesman HX de Ville and Caprice models were released in July 1976.Norm Darwin, 100 years of GM in Australia, 2002, page 265 A more formal grille was adopted and emissions' regulations saw a re-tuned 5.0-litre V8.

However, it had a significant engineering upgrade, along with the rest of the GMH range, involving the adoption of Radial Tuned Suspension, giving the Statesman better handling. 4-wheel disc brakes were now fitted to all Statesman models. The previous Director of GMH Engineering, George Roberts had insisted that the Statesman have a high standard of ride comfort (at the expense of ultimate roadholding). (Roberts previously had been the Chief Engineer of the GM Cadillac Division). Prior to HZ, the Statesman's Cadillac style of ride was not to everyone's taste. The Statesman de Ville and Caprice were supplemented in 1979 by an intermediate model – the SL/E, which was launched with a different \\"eggcrate\\" grille.

Released in May 1980,Green Book Price & Model Guide, March – April 1984, pages 79 & 80 the WB series was offered in Statesman de Ville and Statesman Caprice models. As with previous Statesmans, GMH did not use the Holden name in the badging or the official sales literature. The WB had a six-light body, with a longer, squared-off roofline. The design was by GMH's Chief Stylist, Leo Pruneau. The styling of the WB Statesman was a compromise between achieving a fresh appearance and minimising the cost of redesign, by using panels from the antecedent HZ model. Production comprised 5,450 de Villes and 3,055 Caprices.Norm Darwin, 100 Years of GM in Australia, 2002, page 271 WB Series II models were released in September 1983 with fundamentally cosmetic changes, except for the introduction of a front bench seat (six-passenger) option for De Ville buyers.Tony Davis, 1980 GM-H Statesman WB, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 162 In late 1984 General Motors-Holden's announced that it intended to vacate the big-car market to concentrate on production of luxury versions of the Holden Commodore. Series II production comprised 4,269 de Villes and 1,153 Caprices. In addition to the Statesman WB, a range of Holden WB passenger vehicles were prototyped along the lines of pre-existing HZ series vehicles, but only the commercial models (ute, panel van and cab-chassis \\"One Tonner\\") actually went into production from 1980 through 1984.

One of the many Polish churches on Chicago's Northwest Side, it is considered to be one of the more architecturally significant religious edifices in the Portage Park area, as well as one of the key agents in the neighborhood's historical growth and development. History Founded in 1914 as a Polish parish in a still rural area that had been annexed to the city in 1889 in advance of the World's Columbian Exposition. The Polish term for the surrounding area, Władysławowo derives from the Polish name for the church's patron, St. Ladislaus. Originally a mission of St. Wenceslaus, the first church, a combination church and school building, was already in place by August 1915, an impressive feat given that the parish still only numbered about 100 families in 1920. The parish was key in spurring growth in the Portage Park area as it drew in Polish immigrants from the tenements west of the city center concentrated in the Polish Downtown area of West Town. Nearby Chopin Park stands as a testament to this, named after Poland's most famous pianist and composer of the infamous Funeral March. With this development, the original pastor's residence above the Hupka (now Kopec) Funeral Chapel at 5259 W. Roscoe at the time of the building of the first church gave way to the parish plant typical of Polish parishes in the Chicago area, as first the school was enlarged and a convent as well as a rectory were bought. The cost of all these improvements totalled nearly $76,000. Rapid growth of the Portage Park area had led to rapid growth of St. Ladislaus in the same way the parish served as a magnet for this development. By the time St. Ladislaus celebrated its silver jubilee, the parish had paid off all its debt, and a building fund for the new church had already been started. However construction was delayed by the outbreak of World War II. Finally, on November 17, 1952, ground was broken for the church at the northwest corner of Long and Henderson. The cornerstone was laid on April 12, 1953, and the imposing brick edifice was opened on June 12, 1955, for its first Mass. Today the parish numbers about 1500 families and still retains its original Polish character. Architecture The church was designed by the firm of Leo Strelka who designed Providence of God in Pilsen and St. Bronislava on Chicago's Southeast Side The church, not completed until 1955 is a simplified Romanesque brick building, notable for its traditional design at a time when Modernism dominated sacred architecture. The church's interior decoration is austere in comparison with the rich ornament of Chicago's more well-known Polish Cathedrals. The church has a barrel-vault ceiling, marble pulpit, baptismal font, altars and statues, as well as a pipe organ once used at St. Helen Parish. The communion rail is also constructed of marble with gates cast in bronze. There are two side altars, one dedicated to St. Joseph, and the other to the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary as well as shrines to the Sacred Heart and to Our Lady of Sorrows. The rose window is considered the church's finest treasure and washes the interior of the church in a sea of light along with a series of 14 large and 14 smaller stained glass windows flanking the nave. The front's façade is dominated by a central niche with a sculpture of St. Ladislaus looming over the building's main entrance, while a bas-relief representation of the Lamb of God rests above the main doorway. The new millennium was an occasion for the church to initiate a campaign to conduct needed renovation to the church, including repairing the campanile, repaving the parking lot and make other improvements.

In Greece, part of its native range, the plant is called drakondia, the long spadix being viewed as a small dragon hiding in the spathe.Dragon Arum at blueworldgardener.co.uk It is endemic to the Balkans, extending as far as Greece, Crete, and the Aegean Islands, and also to the south-western parts of Anatolia. Description Male flowers (at top) Female flowers (at the bottom) The species is characterized by a large purple spathe and spadix, which has a very unpleasant smell reminiscent of rotting meat to attract flies (Lucilia and others) as pollinators. The large palmate leaves have occasional cream flecks along the veins. The dragon lily has the ability to heat itself to a temperature of 18 degrees Celsius. This addition to its traits does not have any correlation to its potent scent, however it does promote the comfort of the insects who choose to pollinate on the lily.

Web services communicate via either SOAP or REST messages. WSE provides extensions to the SOAP protocol and allows the definition of custom security, reliable messaging, policy, etc. Developers can add these capabilities at design time using code or at deployment time through the use of a policy file. WSE has been replaced by Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). Versions All versions install side-by-side. * WSE 1.0 for .NET Framework 1.0 was released in December 2002. It was based on the draft version of WS-Security. It is not supported anymore and is not compatible with .NET 2.0. It uses the older \\"XMLSOAP\\" namespace in contrast to the OASIS namespace used by WSS4J and WSE 2.0/3.0. * WSE 2.0 was released for Visual Studio .NET 2003 and the .NET Framework 1.1 in May 2004. It introduced major secure communication improvements (signing and encryption of user- defined SOAP headers, Kerberos Security Context Tokens, delegated trust etc.), a new lightweight messaging infrastructure, a new programming model, support for SOAP based messaging over TCP as an alternative to HTTP, a policy framework based on WS-Policy and WSDL, WS-Addressing, WS-Trust, WS- SecureConversation support.The XML Files: What's new in WSE 2.0 WSE 2.0 can be used from within standalone executables and Windows services i.e. outside IIS in addition to ASP.NET applications. It is also compatible with .NET 2.0, however it does not have design time support with Visual Studio 2005. It is not interoperable with WSE 3.0 and WCF. * WSE 3.0 was released in October 2005 and has design time support with Visual Studio 2005. It includes policy framework enhancements including security based on policy assertions (associating CLR client proxies with policy files), turnkey security scenarios for securing end to end messages, extensibility mechanisms for user-defined policies in code and a simplified policy model applied to a message exchange instead of on a per-message level. It supports updated web services specifications and a native 64-bit runtime. WS-SecureConversation sessions can be canceled explicitly and sessions are reliable and usable in web farm scenarios as Security Context Tokens can contain the original client authentication token when sent from the client to the service, which enable sessions to be re-established if lost, e.g. when a service's appdomain is reset. WSE 3.0 is wire-level interoperable over HTTP with Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and supports the same version of the WS-* specifications as WCF (WS-Security 1.1, SOAP 1.2, MTOM).What's new in WSE 3.0 WSE stopped receiving updates, as the latest version (WSE 3.0) was supported with the Lifecycle of .NET Framework 2.0 (whose support ended on July 12, 2011).

While most of them emigrated to Australia from Malta, a number emigrated from the United Kingdom where they had settled after having been expelled from Egypt, as holders of British passports, during the Suez Crisis. According to the 2016 Census, there were 175,563 people of Maltese descent in Australia and 37,614 Malta-born people residing in the country at the moment of the census. History Migrants from Malta and Gozo working in sugar -cane farms in Mackay, Queensland, 1919 Maltese immigrants land in Sydney from the SS Partizanka, 1948 The first Maltese to arrive in Australia was possibly inmate John Pace in June 1790, though it is not clear if he was sent from Malta or if he was Maltese at all. The first certain Maltese to arrive in Australia were convicts around 1810. The first Maltese immigrant (as opposed to convict or bonded servant) is thought to have been Antonio Azzopardi who arrived in 1838. Many attempts were made at organised mass migration throughout the 19th century but it was only in 1883 the first group of 70 labourers (and nine stowaways) arrived. Historically, Maltese immigrants were subject to the White Australia policy. In 1916, a group of 214 Maltese agricultural labourers left for Melbourne aboard a French ship, due to arrive on the date of the conscription referendum. When this became known in Australia, supporters of the \\"No\\" vote claimed that the government was importing cheap \\"coloured labour\\" to replace Australian workers conscripted for overseas service. The Maltese were called \\"coloured job jumpers\\" and the Australian Workers' Union described them as a \\"black menace\\". Realising the political danger of allowing the Maltese to land, Prime Minister Billy Hughes – who supported the \\"Yes\\" vote – refused them entry under the Immigration Restriction Act 1901, and they were forced to land in Nouméa, New Caledonia. This decision was controversial, as the Maltese were popular among ex-servicemen due to their support for the war effort. After three months, they were allowed to re-enter Australia, but only after being detained upon arrival for another two weeks. The migrants became known in Malta as \\"il-tfal ta Billy Hughes\\" (\\"the children of Billy Hughes\\"). Group and mass migration gradually picked up, first, to Queensland and, after World War I, to Sydney whose automobile industry drew many. Immigration was not without difficulty as Maltese workers tended to be looked down upon and restrictions and quotas were applied. A significant percentage of the Maltese immigrants had intended to stay only temporarily for work but many settled in Australia permanently. Maltese immigration to Australia reached its peak during the 1960s. The majority of Maltese immigrants reside in Melbourne's western suburbs of Sunshine (especially on Glengala Rd) and St Albans, and in Sydney's western suburbs of Greystanes and Horsley Park. The Maltese, as in their home country, are predominantly Roman Catholic. One of the first women to migrate from Malta to Australia was Carmela Sant in 1915. The move was prompted by her husband Giuseppe Ellul, who had migrated in 1913. Giuseppe Ellul was a stonemason in Mosta before moving to Australia to commence a successful career in sugar cane and dairy farming in Mackay, Queensland. In 1916 the couple gave birth to the first born Maltese Australian, Joseph Ellul. 259 Maltese boys and 51 Maltese girls were sent alone to Catholic institutions in Western and South Australia between 1950 and 1965, following negotiations between the Maltese and Western Australian governments which had started in 1928 when Perth-based Maltese priest Father Raphael Pace urged the Christian Brothers to include Maltese children in its emerging migration scheme. Instead of receiving a better education as their Maltese parents hoped for, many of them were exploited for building works, and were never scholarised in English, while also forgetting their own Maltese language. Similar to other children living with the Christian Brother, the children were abused and measures were taken to not allow or limit contact with their family members in Malta.On their own  Notable individuals  *Jason Agius *Anthony Callea *John Aquilina *Sean McMahon *Jayden Attard *Monica Attard *Steve Balbi *Declan Bamberry *Luke Branighan *Nicky Bomba *Tony Briffa *Jake Brimmer *Tony Buhagiar *Joe Camilleri *Terry Camilleri *Troy Cassar-Daley *Lou Drofenik *Laura Dundovic *Jeff Fenech *Mario Fenech *Paul Fenech *Kayla Levett *Ben Galea *Danny Galea *Rob Galea *Nathan Grima *Adam Hills *John Hutchinson *Jamie Maclaren *Alex Malley *Mark Mallia *Jake Mamo *Shaun Micallef *Kevin Muscat *Manny Muscat *Jarrod Sammut *Shane Sultana *Tash Sultana *Shane Shackleton *Jason Singh *Melissa Tkautz *Kym Valentine *Adam Vella (sport shooter) *Adam Vella (boxer) *Alex Vella *Michael Vella *Samara Weaving *Adrian Zahra *Christian Zahra *Paul Zahra *Michael Zerafa See also *Maltese people References  Bibliography  * Maurice N.

The club was founded in 1912 and played the first ever season of professional football in France in 1932–1933 but was relegated. Currently the club plays at an amateur level, in Championnat National 2, the fourth tier of French football. History Hyères Football Club was founded on 21 November 2011 with the separation of the football and cycling sections of Vélosport Hyerois. In September 1919 it became a member of the French Football Federation, formed earlier in the year. In 1932 president Dr Barthélemy Perruc led the club into the first season of professional football in France. They were relegated from the Division after just one year, and a year after that the club gave up their professional status. In 1941 the club reached the semi- final of the wartime Non-occupied zone of the Coupe de France, eliminating Marseille in the quarter-final. In 1950 the club were champions of the Championnat de France Amateur, which was the third tier of French football, and the highest level of amateur football, at the time. The club spent the next thirty years moving between this level and the regional level below. In 1978 the club won promotion to the newly created National Division 4, and two years later reached National Division 3 where they remained for seven seasons until relegation in 1988. They remained in National Division 4 until the FFF reorganised the leagues in 1993, when they placed in the new Championnat National 3, now the fifth tier. In 1998 they gained promotion from what was now Championnat de France Amateur 2 to Championnat de France Amateur, lasting at this level until 2003. In 2006 the club were promoted from the CFA2 as both champion of group D and overall champion, and in 2009 were promoted from the CFA as champions of group B.

Biotic factors also include human influence, pathogens, and disease outbreaks. Each biotic factor needs the proper amount of energy and nutrition to function day to day. Biotic components are typically sorted into three main categories: # Producers, otherwise known as autotrophs, convert energy (through the process of photosynthesis) into food. # Consumers, otherwise known as heterotrophs, depend upon producers (and occasionally other consumers) for food. # Decomposers, otherwise known as detritivores, break down chemicals from producers and consumers (usually antibiotic) into simpler form which can be reused.  Influences   Species  Nearly all species are influenced by biotic factors in one way or another. If the number of predators was to increase, the entire food chain would be affected as any prey falling below that specified predator in the food chain will become prey. If the prey is not given enough time by the predator to repopulate, this could not only cause endangerment and extinction in the prey, but the predator as well. Contradicting a decrease in population size, if a particular species reproduces too rapidly, this will cause an increase in population size, thus affecting the environment around them.  Pathogens and Disease Outbreaks  When disease outbreaks occur, it can be detrimental to an ecosystem. When a disease hits, it will usually affect more than one species, thus causing a serious outbreak. This has the potential to set off a chain reaction thus, causing endangerment to a variety of species within that ecosystem.  Human Contact  Humans make the most sudden and long-term changes in an environment (e.g. pollution and waste). These changes either drive species out of their territory or force them to adapt to their new surroundings. These changes have the largest impact on an ecosystems population size, typically causing a serious decrease.

It is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework which is extensively used in production applications. The basic idea behind this concept is that of test-driven development (TDD) where the tests are written first and the development is based on writing just enough code that will fulfill those tests followed by refactoring. It contains its own mocking framework that is fully integrated into the framework based upon JMock. The simplicity in the RSpec syntax makes it one of the popular testing tools for Ruby applications. The RSpec tool can be used by installing the \`rspec\` gem which consists of three other gems, namely \`rspec-core\`, \`rspec-expectation\` and \`rspec-mock.\`  History  RSpec was started as an experiment by Steven Baker in 2005 along with his team members Dave Astels, Aslak Hellesøy and David Chelimsky. Chelimsky was responsible for developing the RSpec-Rails which facilitated the integration with Ruby on Rails. The initial release i.e. RSpec 1.0 came out in May 2007 which contained many prime features of RSpec which are being included in the latest releases too. However, due to some technical issues such as testing speed, it was discontinued later. The third version of RSpec i.e. the RSpec 3 was released in July 2014 which had many new features like verify doubles, composable matchers and many more. The latest version of the RSpec currently available is RSpec 3.7. Usage  Describing the behavior of objects  As mentioned above, RSpec provides a domain-specific language to describe the behavior of objects. The keywords used in RSpec are similar to the ones used in other languages and/or TDD frameworks. For example, if the keywords used in Test::Unit are considered, they can be mapped to the RSpec keywords as follows: * Assertion becomes expectation * Test method becomes Example code * Test case becomes Example group There are many such keywords which are used in the same context but with the similar names. The syntax of RSpec provides the ease of readability and describes the behavior of the code thereby providing freedom to the programmer. Every testing framework works in the following flow - given some context, when some event occurs, what outcome is expected. The methods like describe(), context() and it() form the analogy and the skeleton respectively of the test code. describe() The describe() method is used to describe a class, method or an example group. This is the outer block which actually contains the test code and it depicts the characteristics of the code enclosed in it. This method takes a number of arguments and an optional block. However, normally one or two arguments are used to describe the behavior of the example group. The first argument represents the reference to the class or module whereas the second argument is optional whose datatype would be String. The example groups can be nested as well. An example of using the describe method is as follows: describe User, \\"with no account balance\\" {....} => User with no account balance context() The context() block is used to describe the context in which the class or method mentioned in the describe block is being used. This can be considered as an alias to the word describe() in this scenario and they both can be used interchangeably. Generally, describe() is used for things and context() is used for contexts. It helps to venture out different outcomes in different scenarios. The example mentioned above can be described using the context() method as follows: describe User do context \\"has no account balance\\" do .... end end Using context() makes it easier to scan a spec file and makes it clear what it relates to. it() It is a RSpec method which describes the specifications of the sample in the context. The it() block takes a string as an argument and the string after the 'it' keyword can be considered as the function that the block is expected to perform or in other words it can be considered as a test case. Consider the following example: describe User do context \\"has no account balance\\" do it \\"is not allowed to sanction a housing loan\\" do puts \\"The loan cannot be sanctioned due to no balance in the account.\\" end end end  RSpec::Expectations  In RSpec, an expectation is a statement expressing the state that something is expected to be in, at a particular point in the execution of a code example. RSpec uses a simple framework and keywords like should() and should_not() to express expectations. It supports matchers, that is objects that try to match an expected outcome, for common operations as well as uncommon expressions. For example, if the expected outcome of a result is say numeric value 5, a RSpec expectation that uses the matcher equal for the same would be written as follows: \`result.should equal(5)\`  RSpec::Mocks  RSpec provides a library called RSpec::Mocks in order to create test doubles that facilitate focusing on roles, interface discovery, but most of all making progress without implemented dependencies thereby providing isolation from coupling and non determinism.  Tools and integration  There are many tools that support RSpec such as: * Autotest * RCov * Editors such as Vim and Emacs * IDEs such as Aptana and RubyMine. * RakeTask * TextMate RSpec also provides a number of utilities and extension points to support extending RSpec to meet domain- specific needs. For instance, using Metadata associated with groups and examples for the purpose of reporting, using global configuration to assign before and after blocks to every example group, using macros etc.  Other Ruby testing tools  * Test::Unit * MiniTest * Cucumber * Shoulda * Capybara etc. References  Further reading  1\\\\.

It was founded in the later half of 2005 by established and emerging NRENs in Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Mozambique and South Africa with the vision of securing high speed connectivity, mainly optical fibre-based, for the research and education community - at affordable prices - that connect African NRENs to each other, to other NRENs worldwide and to the Internet generally. It was incorporated in 2006 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in the Trade Registrar of the Chambers of Commerce and Industry as a non-for-profit association of National Research and Education Networks (NRENs). Today, the UbuntuNet Alliance community includes 13 NRENs in East and Southern Africa from Sudan, Ethiopia, all the way to South Africa, covering a huge land mass of the continent. The Alliance has a close relationship with the Association of African Universities, which appoints the Chairperson. The incumbent Chairperson is Professor Zimani Kadzamira former Vice chancellor of the University of Malawi who was appointed in February 2007. His term was renewed towards the end of 2009.  Vision, Mission, and Strategic Priorities  The societal vision of the UbuntuNet Alliance is that of vibrant African research and education institutions, networking effectively in the global knowledge society. The mission of UbuntuNet Alliance is to ensure that African NRENs have efficient and affordable bandwidth for their member research and education institutions that enables them to participate in the global research and education networking community. The UbuntuNet Alliance aims to achieve this through strategic priorities that include the development and capacity building of NRENs in all countries in Eastern and Southern Africa; ensuring that NRENs get access to affordable high speed connectivity by lobbying for improved national policy and regulatory environments; stimulating and supporting content networks; and making the UbuntuNet Alliance financially sustainable. UbuntuNet Alliance intends to build UbuntuNet fibre backbone network which will interconnect NRENs in Africa and connect them to the global research and education networking community through GÉANT, the European regional network.  UbuntuNet Clusters  UbuntuNet Alliance adopted an opportunistic approach that seeks to build the fibre network based on the potential for broadband terrestrial connectivity that exists or is emerging in the region. Two initial backbone development clusters were defined as UbuntuNet East and UbuntuNet South. These clusters are based purely on geographic convenience, taking into account the ease of interconnection. UbuntuNet East will interconnect NRENs in Burundi, Djibouti, DRC, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda, and will connect to the global REN community through the submarine fibres landing at points along the eastern coast of Africa. UbuntuNet South will interconnect NRENs in Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Swaziland, and Tanzania, and will connect to the global REN community through submarine fibres landing at points along the south-eastern, southern, and south-western coast of Africe. Ultimately, these sub-backbones will inter-connect into a seamless sub-regional research and education network.  Membership  Membership to UbuntuNet Alliance is open to all bona fide African NRENs serving research and education institutions. A list of members is on UbuntuNet Alliance, website.

Today, screw pickets are used widely to temporarily \\"picket\\" dogs. They are also used to graze animals such as sheep, goats, and horses. Screw pickets are also used to stabilize small trees, tent poles, and other objects that are intended to remain upright. The original picket was a stake hammered into the ground to secure a horse by tying it to the stake. This required a second tool (a hammer) or the availability of a rock to use instead of a tool. The screw picket is screwed (by turning it) into the ground. In hard ground, it requires a second tool (a leverage bar, or a spare screw picket) or the availability of a length of wood. Screw pickets can be easily bent or broken, but less easily pulled from the ground. Military non-equestrian use Screw pickets (used as supports for barbed wire defences) were introduced c. 1915 as a replacement for timber posts. The French name for this type of \\"steel stake\\" was \\"queue de cochon\\" or pigtail. The World War I steel stake became known in the British Army as a \\"corkscrew picket\\". The corkscrew picket was made from a steel bar which had its bottom end bent into a spiral coil. It also had three loops or \\"eyes\\" (some even had four) formed, one at top, one at midway and one just above the corkscrew spiral. The final product was about eight feet long. Groups of soldiers known as wiring parties went out at night into no man's land to position these supports. They later strung the barbed wire through the loops to form a defensive wire obstacle as a protection for their trench line. The British called this type of stake a 'corkscrew' picket because it was screwed into the ground rather than hammered in as the timber posts had been (the hammering made loud noise, usually attracting enemy fire). The screw pickets replaced the timber posts (although screw pickets were less rigid than timber posts), because they could be installed rapidly and silently. A wiring party is described in detail in World War I novel All Quiet on the Western Front by contemporary author Erich Maria Remarque. The corkscrew picket was screwed into the ground by turning it in a clockwise direction using an entrenching tool's handle or a stick inserted in the bottom eye of the picket for leverage. The bottom eye was used in order to avoid bending the vertical bar of the picket. Army War College. \\"Notes on the Construction and Equipment of Trenches.\\" April 1917: Government Printing Office.

It is located between the Cariboo Mountains and Quesnel Lake. The Horsefly River and Horsefly Lake were given their names by the miners who came to the area during the Cariboo Gold Rush and were greeted by masses of pesky horseflies, but the village of Horsefly was known as Harper's Camp until approximately 1920 when it was changed to Horsefly. History Harper's Camp City Hotel (1900s) The first major gold discovery of the Cariboo Gold Rush was made on the Horsefly River by Peter Dunlevy in 1859. More goldseekers soon arrived and a town was built near the site of Dunlevy's strike including several hotels, a store and a post office. Then in 1887, the area experienced a second boom when Thaddeus Harper built and operated the first of several hydraulic mines and the town became known as Harper's Camp. One of these mines was also known as Horsefly. Modern day Today the village of Horsefly is a popular tourist destination with a forestry based economy. Sockeye salmon return each fall to spawn in the Horsefly River. Horsefly offers all the amenities to locals and visitors, including a K–12 school, a general store, gas station, hardware store, museum, motel, cafe, beauty salons, neighbourhood pub, fire department, community hall (managed by the community club), and a seniors activity & wellness society.

This technique is useful to study the role of individual genes in living organisms. It differs from traditional gene knockout because it targets specific genes at specific times rather than being deleted from beginning of life. Using the conditional gene knockout technique eliminates many of the side effects from traditional gene knockout. In traditional gene knockout, embryonic death from a gene mutation can occur, and this prevents scientists from studying the gene in adults. Some tissues cannot be studied properly in isolation, so the gene must be inactive in a certain tissue while remaining active in others. With this technology, scientists are able to knockout genes at a specific stage in development and study how the knockout of a gene in one tissue affects the same gene in other tissues. Technique Diagram showing how to generate a conditional knockout mouse: A mouse containing the Cre gene and a mouse containing the lox gene were bred to generate a conditional knockout for a particular gene of interest. The mice do not naturally express Cre recombinase or lox sites, but they have been engineered to express these gene products to create the desirable offspring. The most commonly used technique is the Cre-lox recombination system. The Cre recombinase enzyme specifically recognizes two lox (loci of recombination) sites within DNA and causes recombination between them. During recombination two strands of DNA exchange information. This recombination will cause a deletion or inversion of the genes between the two lox sites, depending on their orientation. An entire gene can be removed to inactivate it. This whole system is inducible so a chemical can be added to knock genes out at a specific time. Two of the most commonly used chemicals are tetracycline, which activates transcription of the Cre recombinase gene and tamoxifen, which activates transport of the Cre recombinase protein to the nucleus. Only a few cell types express Cre recombinase and no mammalian cells express it so there is no risk of accidental activation of lox sites when using conditional gene knockout in mammals. Figuring out how to express Cre-recombinase in an organism tends to be the most difficult part of this technique. Uses The conditional gene knockout method is often used to model human diseases in other mammals. It has increased scientists’ ability to study diseases, such as cancer, that develop in specific cell types or developmental stages. It is known that mutations in the BRCA1 gene are linked to breast cancer. Scientists used conditional gene knockout to delete the BRCA1 allele in mammary gland tissue in mice and found that it plays an important role in tumour suppression. A specific gene in mouse brain thought to be involved in the onset of Alzheimer's disease which codes for the enzyme cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) was knocked out. Such mice were found to be 'smarter' than normal mice and were able to handle complex tasks more intelligently compared to 'normal' mice bred in the laboratory. Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) Conditional gene knockouts in mice are often used to study human diseases because many genes produce similar phenotypes in both species. For the past 100 years laboratory mouse genetics have been used for this because mice are mammals that are physiologically similar enough to humans to generate qualitative testing. These two have such similar genes that out of 4000 studied genes, only 10 were found in one species but not the other. All mammals shared the same common ancestor approximately 80 million years ago; technically speaking, all genomes of mammals are comparatively similar. However, in comparison between mice and humans, their protein-coding regions of the genomes are 85% identical and have similarities between 99% of their homologs. These similarities result in similar phenotypes to be expressed between the two species.[8][12] Their genes are very alike to those of humans with 99% having homologs being similar. Along with producing similar phenotypes as well making them very promising candidates for conditional gene knockouts.[8] The goal of KOMP is to create knockout mutations in the embryonic stem cells for each of the 20,000 protein coding genes in mice. The genes are knocked out because this is the best way to study their function and learn more about their role in human diseases. There are two main strategies to conditional gene knockout and those are gene targeting or homologous recombination and gene trapping. Both methods usually have a modified viral vector or a linear fragment as the mode of transportation of the artificial DNA into the target ES cell. The cells then grow in a petri dish for several days and are inserted into the early-stage embryos. Lastly, the embryos are placed into the adult female’s uterus where it can grow into its offspring.[9] Some alleles in this project cannot be knocked out using traditional methods and require the specificity of the conditional gene knockout technique. Other combinatorial methods are needed to knockout the last remaining alleles. Conditional gene knockout is a time-consuming procedure and there are additional projects focusing on knocking out the remaining mouse genes. The KOMP project contributor, Oliver Smithies, arguably provided the biggest scientific impact on this gene targeting. Oliver received the Nobel prize for medicine due to a technique allowing the ability to identify functions in genes and how to use the 'knockout' method to delete certain genes. Unfortunately, the pioneer in gene targeting died at the age of 91 on January 10th, 2017.[11] The KOMP projected was started in 2006 and is still ongoing today. The KOMP Repository provides incentives to those partaking in the projects to return feedback to them and those who meet specific criteria can be refunded 50% of the cost of their research cells.[10] References  8\\\\.

Biography He was the son of Samuel Hale Parker. He graduated from Harvard in 1848. After graduating from Harvard Law School, Parker went to the Leipzig Conservatory in 1851, where he studied piano with Ignaz Moscheles and Louis Plaidy, composition with Julius Rietz and Ernst Richter, and music theory and harmony with Moritz Hauptmann. He returned to Boston in 1854, and began offering private lessons, as he did throughout his life. In 1862, several of his private students formed the Parker Club, which offered concerts of instrumental and choral music. He married Maria Derby of Andover in 1859. They had one child. From 1864 to 1891, he served as organist at the Trinity Church, Boston, his career there coinciding almost completely with that of minister Phillips Brooks. J.C.D. Parker's grandfather Samuel Parker had been rector at Trinity. Parker also played the organ for the concerts of the Handel and Haydn Society. He taught at the New England Conservatory from 1871 to 1897. After 1897 he worked as an examiner at the Conservatory. Parker composed hymns, cantatas, oratorios, church music, and works for piano. In addition, he wrote two sets of pedagogical pieces. He wrote works on harmony in 1855 and 1870, and translated Richter's Harmonielehre (Manual of Harmony) into English in 1873.

Current staff These staffers currently work for and appear on the show on a regular, if not hourly basis. In-studio These people currently sit in the studio throughout the entire broadcast. Howard Stern Howard Stern is the host of the show, which essentially is a discussion of topics that include world affairs, celebrity gossip, self-deprecation, bodily functions, conflicts among his staff, his own personal family matters, and the antics of the show's Wack Pack. Self-proclaimed \\"King of All Media\\". Robin Quivers Robin Ophelia Quivers is a native of Baltimore, Maryland, and first met Stern after being assigned as his newswoman at WWDC in March 1981. She has been his co-host and news reader ever since. She is a former nurse and Captain in the United States Air Force. Quivers briefly left the show towards the end of her time at WWDC when Stern made a deal at WNBC in 1982, and did not realize WNBC initially refused to hire her. Quivers returned to the show at WNBC a month after Stern. Stern once said that Quivers is the only person on the show that he allowed to talk freely during the broadcast, although comedian Artie Lange was allowed this privilege as well during his years on the show. Fred Norris Of the show's staff, Stern met Norris first, in 1979, when the two worked as disc jockeys at WCCC in Hartford, Connecticut. Norris worked the overnight slot, after which Stern hosted the morning slot. Although Stern left shortly afterwards, Norris stayed at WCCC until joining Stern and Quivers at Washington, D.C.'s WWDC in 1981. The \\"Earth Dog Fred\\" nickname originated in Washington, as Norris replaced an engineer nicknamed \\"Earth Dog Brent.\\" Norris is married to Allison (née Furman) and they have one daughter, Tess. Norris' current role on the show is to provide sound effects, organize and direct commercials and live reads, and occasionally perform writing duties. Norris also provides impersonations of show regulars, celebrities and others. George Takei George Takei George Takei occasionally serves as the show's announcer. Before joining the show, Takei became popular among the cast after soundbites of his audiobook about his career on Star Trek were played on the show. The clips stood out due to his deep baritone voice and pitch perfect enunciation, and, thus, were frequently played on the show. In 2006, when the show moved to Sirius, Stern announced that Takei was the show's official announcer. Outside the studio These are the behind-the-scenes personnel, although in the Stern world, many of these staff members appear on air. Steve Brandano Brandano, previously known as \\"Steve The Intern,\\" answers Stern's phones, is a contributor on The Wrap-Up Show, and was formerly the host of the Thursday night intern show. Benjy Bronk Benjy Bronk (born Sept. 4, 1967) began working on The Howard Stern Show as an intern in 1998. Bronk eventually earned a paid position conducting pre-interviews of show guests and gathering articles for Robin Quivers' news. In 2000, Benjy was given an in-studio seat next to writers Jackie Martling and Fred Norris, writing on-the-spot jokes for Stern as the show transpired. After Martling left the show in early 2001, Bronk continued as an in-studio joke writer with Norris. When the Howard Stern Show moved to Sirius satellite radio in January 2006, Bronk continued in his role as an in-studio joke writer. Richard Christy While working as an electrician in Florida and playing as a drummer in a number of heavy metal bands including Iced Earth and Death, Christy began calling into the show from October 1999, initially sending voice mails to the show's assistant producer K. C. Armstrong, which were played on- air. From 2001 to 2003, Christy sent song parodies and bits about Armstrong and show co-host Robin Quivers including some like \\"It's K.C.'s Sausage Party\\" (a parody of \\"It's My Party\\") and \\"Gay Photograph\\" (a parody of the Def Leppard song \\"Photograph\\") that continue to be played on the show to this day. Christy made his first visit to the show on April 24, 2003, where he played a round of blackjack to win a date with a porn star. In July 2004, when the show was holding a \\"Win John's Job\\" contest following the departure of Stuttering John from the show, Christy won the position as voted by fans. Since joining the show, Christy has become known for his prank calls, song parodies, unique personality, and \\"show stunts\\" he's performed with his writing partner Sal the Stockbroker. Christy is currently the drummer in the heavy-metal band Charred Walls of the Damned. Gary Dell'Abate Gary Dell'Abate, aka Baba Booey, serves as the show's head producer. Hired right after graduating from Adelphi University in 1984 and briefly anglicizing his name to Gary Dell, he has worked for the show ever since. Dell'Abate is mocked on the Stern Show for his appearance, gullibility (he once booked a mentally challenged woman who claimed to be Madonna's sister), and frequent mispronunciations (for example, insisting that actor Nick Nolte's last name was pronounced \\"Nolt\\"). He earned the nickname \\"Baba Booey\\" after insisting it to be the correct name of the cartoon character Baba Looey. Sal Governale Salvatore \\"Sal\\" Governale, sometimes referred to as Sal the Stockbroker, was originally a frequent caller who worked as a stockbroker. Stern took notice after numerous calls mocking Gary Dell'Abate. Although he came in second in the \\"Win John's Job\\" contest to his future writing partner, Richard Christy, Sal was eventually hired as a prank caller/writer for the show, and is now credited as a producer. J. D. Harmeyer Born in December 1979 in Fairborn, Ohio, Jamie Daniel \\"J. D.\\" Harmeyer is Stern's head media producer. He records television shows, pulls clips from the internet and edits together highlights from recent happenings in movies and TV. He attended Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida. Jon Hein Jon Hein Jon Hein made his first guest appearances on the show on May 3, 2001, discussing television shows that have \\"jumped the shark\\", a term he uses to describe when a show has passed its prime (based on an episode of the show, Happy Days, where a previously popular and well-done show clearly and memorably began to go downhill). In late 2005, while experimental programming was broadcast on Howard 100 and Howard 101, Hein presented the first edition of Superfan Roundtable. His success in on-air hosting led him to become the co-host of The Wrap-Up Show when the show moved to Sirius XM in January 2006. Hein is also a cohost on the weekly Thursday show, \\"Jon Hein's TV Show\\" with J. D. Harmeyer, Steve Brandano, and Jenny Hutt, as well as the weekly Friday show \\"Geek Time\\" with Jason Kaplan and Ralph Cirella. The show has since been cancelled. Jason Kaplan Jason Kaplan is a senior producer for the show. He has many duties, including writing the daily show rundown that appears on the show's website, and taking photos that appear alongside the daily rundown. In September 2007, Jason and HowardTV director Scott DePace engaged in an intense feud stemming from their political differences. Jason was married to his girlfriend, Janis on November 8, 2008. Notable guests at the ceremony included Howard Stern, Robin Quivers, Gary Dell'Abate, as well as the majority of Stern's staff. The reception featured speeches from fellow staff members, Ronnie Mund and J. D. Harmeyer. Kaplan hosts \\"Page 69\\" along with Will Murray. On the wrap-up show on August 19, Kaplan stated that he grew up in Stanhope, NJ and attended Rutgers University. Kaplan hosted a monthly show called The Fat Guy Show,. Kaplan is also a producer of the monthly show Geek Time that airs on every Friday with Jon Hein and Ralph Cirella. Ronnie Mund Ronald Mund, commonly referred to as Ronnie the Limo Driver, is Stern's limousine driver and bodyguard, and the head of security for the Stern show complex at Sirius Radio. After a career in the Air Force, Mund started a limo business. He started driving for Stern in 1986, and quickly became a character on the radio show. In 2011, Ronnie began touring the US with other talent from The Howard Stern Show on the Ronnie Mund Block Party. In March 2013, Ronnie hosted a 4-day event in Jamaica called the Ronnie Mund Jamaican Getaway. Will Murray Will Murray is the show's researcher and segment producer. He preinterviews all guests, and compiles pages of notes of research for Howard to use during interviews. He and fellow producer Jason Kaplan host the Howard 100 News segment \\"Page 69.\\" On September 5, 2008, Will married his long-time girlfriend. A Philadelphia area native, he is a huge Philadelphia sports fan, and is a graduate of Syracuse University. Scott Salem Scott the Engineer is the show's long-time engineer, having joined on February 10, 1986. Having previously worked at WABC (AM) and WPLJ in New York City, Salem received a voice mail from Jimmy Fink, then the morning personality at WXRK informing him of his new position. In 1996, the Austin American-Statesman wrote that Scott is \\"always threatening to quit or on the verge of being fired, he's the show's whipping boy for technical problems\\". In 2007, Salem made a onetime appearance on tour with the Killers of Comedy, performing stand-up followed by a Q&A; session with the audience. Salem is an avid bowler and has competed in and appeared at several PBA tour events. Ron Tarrant Ron Tarrant joined the Howard Stern Channels in 2016 from Canada as the Head Imaging/Sound Designer & new voice of the Howard Stern Show/Channels.

C.\\" Armstrong (born July 17, 1975), who grew up in nearby Suffolk County, New York, began working on the show as an intern in 1997 and later became associate producer from 1998 to 2004.

Steve Freid Steve \\"the Engineer\\" Freid first worked with Ben Stern and later worked with Howard when he arrived at K-Rock. He gained notoriety performing as the character Wood Yi, a parody of actor/director Woody Allen. Billy West came up with the idea for the character in the early 1990s, and Steve was chosen to play the part due to having a similar-sounding voice. When performing as Wood Yi, Steve read lines supplied to him by the shows' staff, reciting them in a deadpan manner. Gary Garver Gary Garver was a West Coast-based correspondent for The Howard Stern Show who first started working for the show in 1991 when he was an operator at KLSX, the show's Los Angeles affiliate.

Artie Lange Artie Lange Lange's first appearance on the show was as a guest alongside fellow comedian Norm Macdonald on January 8, 1998, following a bit involving Scott the Engineer and his challenge to perform 17 complete push-ups. Although appearing with Macdonald to promote the film Dirty Work, Lange had been a fan of Stern since the 1980s when he used to listen with his father. In fact, after Lange's father was paralyzed in 1987, show producer Gary Dell'Abate sent Lange an autographed jacket which Lange auctioned off for $2,000 to help support his family. Following the departure of the show's writer and comedian Jackie \\"The Jokeman\\" Martling in 2001, several comedians \\"auditioned\\" for Martling's seat by sitting in for a couple of shows. Lange's first appearance in what became known as \\"The Jackie Chair\\" occurred for 2 days, on May 7 and 8, 2001. The temporary appearance consisted of being Stern's sidekick along with Quivers, and Lange frequently told personal stories, usually regarding alcohol, drugs, food and prostitutes. On October 29, 2001, Lange joined the show full-time and was voted favorite by Howard's fans in 2009. Lange left the show in December 2009. At first the leave was thought to be temporary, but in early 2010 he attempted suicide at his apartment in Hoboken, New Jersey. The incident has not been discussed in great detail on the show and for much of 2010, Stern mentioned that Lange would return when he was healthy. However, in 2011 the show and the Howard 100 News began to reference Lange as a \\"former\\" staffer. On October 3, 2011, Lange began co-hosting The Nick & Artie Show with comedian Nick DiPaolo. This show aired on Directv. In April 2014, Artie was informed before the show that Directv had cancelled his show. He went on air that night for the last time as a part of the Directv team.

His college roommate, Mitch Fatel, was on the verge of quitting his internship with The Howard Stern Show, when Melendez begged him for a recommendation for an internship on the show. Producer Gary Dell'Abate interviewed Melendez and mentioned his stuttering problem to Stern, who decided to hire him as a field reporter. On Stern's show, Melendez conducted outrageous street interviews and appeared at press conferences, asking off- the-wall questions to various celebrities, including Gennifer Flowers, Ringo Starr, Burt Reynolds, Tommy Lasorda, Larry King and the Dalai Lama. He also provided comic relief on the show itself with his misadventures, poor grammar, and sloppy pronunciation. Melendez left the show after being offered a half- million dollar contract as the announcer for The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Al Rosenberg Al Rosenberg was a writer/performer for Howard on WNBC.

The Chamber consists of five councils, committees, staff and members, and works with city officials, local businesses and the community to promote the local economy. History On March 12, 1907, sixteen men calling themselves the \\"Harbor Boosters\\" established the Newport Beach Chamber of Commerce. Each man contributed five dollars to cover the initial expenses of the first commercial body formed in the city. When the final reclamation of the bay was complete thirty years later in 1936 nearly all of the Charter members were gone, but many of them devoted their lives to the creation of Newport Harbor. Through its life, the Newport Beach Chamber of Commerce played an active part in improving the city, through harbor, industrial and municipal matters, but also by initiating and sponsoring various celebrations and civic events. For a period of eight years, from 1919 to 1927, there existed two chambers, Balboa Island and Newport Beach. In 1927, the chambers merged into the Newport Harbor Chamber of Commerce. The city was divided into six districts, each of which was entitled to two directors on the board of twelve. These sections were: 1) Newport Heights and West Newport, 2) Newport Beach, 3) East Newport, 4) Balboa, 5) Balboa Island, and 6) Corona del Mar. In 1976, the word \\"area\\" was added to the name to better reflect the character of the surrounding communities, which compose the membership. In the same year, the Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce reached a significant milestone when it moved into the new headquarters building of at its present location at 1470 Jamboree Road. In 2001 the Chamber’s official name was changed to the Newport Beach Chamber of Commerce to better associate with the Newport Beach name. As of February 2017, the Newport Beach Chamber, which started on March 12, 1907 with only 16 Charter members has grown to nearly 1,000 members, representing a cross-section of the harbor area, and is one of the largest regional Chambers in Orange County. The Chamber is funded 100% by member dues and special event income.

Cord also returns to Llanview on in September 2011 on business for Buchanan Enterprises and the involvement of his newly found brother, Rex Balsom, in its running. Cord is soon reunited with Tina again after she comes to Llanfair to spend the night returning for Victor Lord Jr.'s will reading. Cord eventually admits he still had feelings for Tina because they share a bond due to their past together and the fact that they share kids with each other. On November 15, 2011, Tina interrupts the wedding of niece Natalie to Brody Lovett with paternity test results saying that John McBain, not Brody, is the father of Natalie's baby Liam, which causes the wedding to be called off immediately. Cord and Tina take advantage of the cancelled wedding and reception preparations and marry for the fourth time.

It entered in force on January 1, 2008. The first post-Soviet copyright law of the Russian Federation became effective on August 3, 1993. It completely replaced the older Soviet legislation that had been in effect until then. The new Copyright law of 1993 was based upon WIPO model laws and followed the continental European tradition: it clearly separated economic and moral rights, and it included detailed provisions for neighbouring rights. The Copyright law of 1993 had specified a general duration of copyrights of 50 years beyond an author's death, or 50 years since the publication of an anonymous work. The implementation act for the law made the new law apply retroactively, restoring copyrights (and neighbouring rights) on works on which the shorter copyright terms from the Soviet-era had already expired or which had not been copyrighted at all under Soviet law. In 2004, this copyright term was extended to 70 years for all works still copyrighted. In 2006, completely rewritten intellectual property laws were included in part IV of a new Civil Code of the Russian Federation. These new laws entered into force on January 1, 2008, replacing all previous intellectual property legislation, including the separate copyright law from 1993. The copyright term has been extended to 70 years for works published by Russian authors and copyright protection has been retroactively granted to works which had their 50-year protection term expire in 1993–2003, bringing many notable works out of public domain. For works that have been created or published in other countries, the law now implements the rule of the shorter term, matching Russian copyright term with those existing in the country of origin.  Transition from Soviet law  When the Soviet Union was dissolved and the fifteen republics of the Soviet Union became independent states, the copyright law of the USSR also split into fifteen independent copyright laws, each with its own jurisdiction defined by the territory of the new successor state of the Soviet Union.Elst p. 487. All these successor states initially took over the old Soviet legislation. At the time of the disintegration of the USSR, the copyright law in force was defined by chapter IV of the union-wide 1961 Fundamentals of Civil Legislation, amended in 1973, when the USSR had joined the Universal Copyright Convention (UCC). Each of the republics implemented these Fundamentals in their own local laws.Newcity p. 29. In the Russian SFSR, the Russian Civil Code had been adapted to the 1961 Fundamentals in 1964,Elst p. 79. and the 1973 changes due to the accession to the UCC entered in force in Russia on March 1, 1974.Newcity p. 49. Since 1973, the USSR had had a general copyright term of the lifetime of the author of a work plus 25 years--the minimum prescribed the UCC.Newcity p. 80. Shortly before its demise, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union had initiated an omnibus revision of the copyright law of the USSR to adapt it to a market economy.Elst p. 381. The new legislation on copyrights in chapter IV of 1991 Fundamentals was passed as law on March 31, 1991 and scheduled to enter in force on January 1, 1992. The 1991 Fundamentals extended the copyright term to 50 years p.m.a. and introduced neighbouring rights for the first time in Soviet legislation. But the USSR ceased to exist before the new 1991 law became effective.Elst p. 370. In Russia, the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation passed a decree that made the USSR 1991 Fundamentals effective in Russia from August 3, 1992, on insofar as these Fundamentals contradicted neither the Constitution of the Russian Federation nor other legislative acts of Russia passed after June 12, 1990,Elst p. 255. and only on a temporary basis until the Russian Federation would have adopted a new, own Civil Code.Elst p. 372. The original USSR executive decree for the 1991 Fundamentals, which laid down the transitory provisions, did not enter in force in Russia, though,Elst p. 371. and the old Russian Civil Code remained in force insofar as it didn't contradict the 1991 Fundamentals. Chapter IV of the 1991 Fundamentals was thus in effect for exactly one year until on August 3, 1993, the new Copyright law of Russia entered in force.  Copyright law of 1993  The copyright law of 1993 was inspired by WIPO model laws and in some of its provisions heavily drew upon the formulations of the Conventions of Berne and Rome. The main innovations were much more detailed regulations on neighbouring rights, the adaptation of the law to new technologies, an expansion of contractual freedom, and provisions on collecting societies.Elst p. 394.  Objects of copyright  Under the 1993 law, copyright covers works of the sciences, literature, and the arts that are the result of creative activity and that exist in objective form. Neither the value nor the purpose of a work is a criterion for copyrightability. An \\"objective form\\" is any realization of a work such that it can be perceived by others in any way.Elst p. 395. Mere ideas are not copyrightable.Elst p. 396. Copyright is vested in an author automatically upon the creation of a work (§9(1)). Both disclosed and undisclosed works are covered by copyright. \\"Disclosure\\" is a concept newly introduced in the copyright law of 1993 to put an end to the ambiguities surrounding the term \\"publication\\" in the old Soviet copyright law. In Soviet copyright, publication included ephemerally making available a work, such as through a performance, a speech, or a broadcast. However, for foreign works protected under Soviet law indirectly through international agreements (in particular the UCC), the definition of \\"publication\\" laid down by these agreements (typically the \\"making available of copies\\", which excluded ephemeral reproduction and required the physical fixation of a work) was used.Elst p. 415. The new law tried to resolve this confusion by using \\"disclosure\\" for the broader sense (making accessible of a work to the general public through publication, performance, broadcast, or any other means), and using \\"publication\\" generally only in the sense of distribution of copies of a work to the general public. The law contains a non-exhaustive list of objective forms, which includes oral realizations.Elst p. 397, footnote 22. Speeches and jazz improvisations are covered by copyright,Elst p. 395, footnote 12. and so are interviews. Derivative works and collections or composite works are also eligible to copyright, regardless of whether or not the base works themselves are copyrighted. Among the examples of derivative works listed in the law are translations, abstracts, reviews, dramatizations, and arrangements. For collections, the originality in the selection and presentation of the collected works gives rise to copyright. Collections such as encyclopedias or databases are a special case of composite works, which also include newspapers, magazines, series of scientific works, or other periodicals.Elst p. 398. Excluded from copyright are official documents such as laws, judicial decisions, and similar administrative texts, as well as the official translations of such documents. Also deemed uncopyrightable are state symbols and marks (flags, coats of arms, medals, monetary symbols, etc.).Copyright law of 1993, §8. This also applies to the symbols of local or municipal authorities.Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, plenum decision no. 15/2006, point 22. Works of folklore are also not subject to copyright. Finally, purely informational reports on events and facts are not copyrightable, a provision corresponding to article 2(8) of the Berne Convention. If such a report goes beyond the purely factual and includes any commentary, analysis, prediction or other interpretation it is subject to copyright again.Elst p. 400. The Russian copyright law of 1993 covered works first disclosed on Russian territory, as well as undisclosed works that existed in objective form within Russia, regardless of the nationality of the author. It also covered works of Russian authors that were first disclosed outside of Russia or that, if undisclosed, existed only abroad.Elst p. 481. Foreign works (i.e., works not disclosed in Russia or not existing there of an author who did not have Russian citizenship) were subject to the Russian copyright law according to the provisions of the international treaties Russia was a member of. In 2004, article 5, which laid down these definitions, was amended with a new sub-paragraph 5(4) to cover also foreign works that were still copyrighted in their foreign country of origin, but had never been copyrighted in Russia. Such restored copyrights on foreign works were limited to at most the copyright term they enjoyed in the foreign country.Law no. 72- of 2004.  Subjects of copyright  The original copyright holder on a work is always the natural person who created the work. Legal entities cannot be original copyright holders.Elst p. 401. For anonymously published works, the publisher is assumed (until proof to the contrary) to be the author's legal representative who may exercise the copyrights on the work.Elst p. 402. If an employee creates a copyrightable work in the course of his duties vis-à-vis his employer, it is the employee who initially holds the copyright. The law stipulates, however, an automatic transfer of the economic rights to the employer, unless proven otherwise. Employers are required to pay the author royalties for each and every use of the work, but the parties are free to determine this fee and may set it arbitrarily low.Elst p. 403f. If the work created is not connected with the duties of the employee, it does not fall under this special rule, even if the work was created on company time.Elst p. 403. If several authors jointly create a work, they are all considered co- authors and initial copyright holders on the work. If their separate contributions to the work can be used independently, each author may use his part of the whole as he sees fit to do, unless there are contractual obligations to the contrary among the co-authors. Movies are treated separately by the law as part of the category \\"audiovisual works\\". Russian law does not require \\"moving images\\": according to Elst, a slide show may be a \\"audiovisual work\\" if its internal consistency amongst the images is high enough.Elst p. 406. The law does, however, require that the images be recorded somehow: a live television broadcast is not an audiovisual workElst p. 406. (but is covered by the broadcaster's neighbouring rights). For movies, the law exhaustively enumerates all the initial copyright holders: the director, the author of the script, and the composer of the film music, if any. The law stipulates a transfer of the economic rights relating to publishing the film (including the rights to subtitling and redubbing) to the producer, unless the contract specifies otherwise. Although not considered authors, other individuals such as the camera director or the set designer do have a copyright on their individual works.Elst p. 407. They may exploit their works independently of the film: a set designer may authorize the use of the set design for a theatre production, and a composer retains his right to remuneration if the music is performed. If the authors or other co-creators of a movie are employed by the producer, their works are subject to the rules for employee-created works. In this case, all economic rights are transferred by default to the producer.Elst p. 408f. In collective works such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, but also newspapers, magazines, periodicals, or also databases, the compiler is granted a copyright on the selection or arrangement, if either are creative. The compiler holds the exclusive economic rights on the use of the collection as a whole. Individual contributors keep their copyright on the parts they created, unless they transfer their rights by contract to the compiler.Elst p. 411.  Extent of copyrights  The 1993 copyright law of Russia recognizes both moral rights and economic rights. The moral rights of an author are: *The right to paternity: the right to be recognized as an author and to attribution, including the right to have one's name withdrawn.Elst p. 414. *The right to disclosure of the work. Disclosure again has the broad meaning of making the work accessible to the general public with the consent of the author through publication, public display, performance, broadcast, or other means. Publication is the distribution of copies of a work to the general public with the author's consent.Elst p. 416. *The right to withdraw a work (except for employee-created works). The author must indemnify all exploiters of the (already disclosed) work if he chooses to exercise this option.Elst p. 418. *The right to the integrity of the work protects an author's works from distortions or other modifications that would be deemed detrimental to the author's reputation or honor or outright libelous. The exclusive economic rights, also called patrimonial rights, are: *The right to reproduction of the work, including the rights to make three- dimensional copies of a two-dimensional work such as a blueprint (e.g., works of architecture)Elst p. 424. or to make two-dimensional copies (such as photos) from a three-dimensional work. In order to exercise this right, the copyright holder is also granted a right to access the original work, even if that physical original has passed into someone else's hands.Elst p. 420f. *The right to distribution, including sale and rental.Elst p. 421. *The right to exhibition of a work, i.e., the right to public display.Elst p. 423. *The rights to translation and adaptation. *The right to communication of the work to the public, which includes public performances and broadcasts, including cable broadcasts.Elst p. 425. The law does not recognize a general right of an author to receive a remuneration for the use of a work of his, since authors exclusively hold all the economic rights and can enforce a remuneration in the contracts they conclude with third parties. But the law does recognize two specialized remuneration rights: *The right to remuneration for home copying of audio or audiovisual works. The royalties are levied on records and recording media such as tapes or disks and are collected and distributed by collecting societies.Elst p. 427. *The resale right ('), which entitles an author to receive 5% of the new resale price for a work of art if that price is at least 20% higher than the last (re-)sale price. This applies only to works of the visual arts: paintings, sculptures, engravings, comics, and such, but not to photographs or manuscripts.Elst p. 428. This right is, like the moral rights, inalienable. It can be inherited.Elst p. 429. These exclusive right of an author on his works are limited by a number of allowed free uses and one case of a compulsory license (home copying of records). All these free uses limit only the economic rights, the moral rights of an author remain in force. Furthermore, any such free use must not be harmful to the normal exploitation of a work and not harm the legitimate interests of authors. The reproduction of a lawfully disclosed work is allowed for purely personal purposes, without paying royalties and without the consent of the author of the work. Exempted from this are reproductions of architectural works, databases, computer programs (but archive copies, i.e., backups are allowed), and musical scores. The copying of whole books, even if done only for personal purposes, is also not a free use but is subject to the author's economic rights.Elst p. 430f. Quotation is another free use. As in the Berne Convention, reproducing extracts from a legally disclosed work as a quote is allowed, but the amount copied must be more than necessary for the intended purpose (news reporting, teaching, criticism, reviews, and so on).Elst p. 432f. Libraries benefit of two free use provisions. The first allows them to make archival copies of works, and the second permits them to make single reprographic copies for the personal use of their clients.Elst p. 433. Several free uses relate to news reporting. Besides the general quotation, the Russian copyright law also has a provision that allows articles on current issues of economy, politics, social matters, or religion that have been published in newspapers or magazines to be freely reproduced by other newspapers.Elst p. 434. Another free use concerns the freedom of panorama: works of the visual arts, photography, or architecture that are permanently installed in publicly accessible places (which includes museums or exhibition halls)Elst p. 432, footnote 268. Also see article 1276 of part IV of the Civil Code (in force as of January 1, 2008), clarifying this. may be reproduced if the work is not the main subject of the reproduction and if the reproduction is used only non- commercially.Elst p. 432f. See also article 21 of the 1993 Copyright law, or article 1276 of part IV of the Civil Code (in force as of January 1, 2008). Article 21 of the 1993 law states that reproduction is allowed, \\"except where portrayal of the work is the basic object of such reproduction [...] or where portrayal of the work is used for commercial purposes.\\"  Neighbouring rights  The neighbouring rights, introduced for the first time in the 1991 Fundamentals, were much expanded and clarified in the 1993 copyright law, following the provisions of the Rome Convention and in some cases also the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT).Elst p. 457. The law covers performances, phonograms, and broadcasts (including cable broadcasts). Neighbouring rights are, like the copyrights, automatic and not subject to formalities except the observance of any rights of the authors (or performers) of the works performed, recorded, or broadcast. Performers are granted the exclusive rights to their performance, including a right to remuneration for any uses of a performance or a recording thereof. Besides the right to perform a performance and to deny others to perform it, these exclusive rights cover also the live broadcasting of a performance, and the video or audio recording of a previously unfixed performance. As in article 7(1)(c) of the Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations, performers' rights also cover the reproduction of non-authorized recordings, and also the reproduction of recordings for purposes other than those agreed upon, including the broadcast of a recording made for non-commercial purposes only.Elst p. 459. For broadcasts of records made for commercial purposes, the performers, together with the phonogram producer, have only a remuneration right on this secondary use of phonograms.Elst pp. 461, 465. Phonogram producers have exclusive rights on the use of their phonograms, again including a right to remuneration. Their exclusive rights cover the reproduction of the phonogram, the right to distribute the phonogram by sale or rental, and the right to import copies of the phonogram. The distribution right extends only to the first sale of a copy. The law does not recognize a non-commercial public lending right on phonograms.Elst p. 464. Both artists and phonogram producers have a right to remuneration for secondary uses of a phonogram made for commercial purposes, such as public performance or terrestrial transmission of the recording. A collecting society shall collect the royalties for these uses and distributes them equally amongst the performers and phonogram producers.Elst p. 465\\\\. See also §39 of the law.  Duration of copyrights  The 1993 copyright law reaffirmed the prolonged copyright term of generally 50 years from the 1991 Fundamentals, applicable to all kinds of works. Works of known authors were copyrighted until 50 years after the author's death (50 years p.m.a.).Elst, p. 436; see also §27(1) of the law. Anonymous or pseudonymous works were copyrighted until fifty years after the first disclosure, unless the identity of the author became known during that time and the term of 50 years p.m.a. thus applied.Elst, p. 437; see also §27(3) of the law. For works with several authors, the copyright term was calculated from the death of the longest- living of the co-authors.Elst, p. 436; see also §27(4) of the law. For authors who had worked during or fought in the Great Patriotic War, the duration of copyrights was extended by four years.Elst, p. 441; see also §27(5) of the law. The original Russian text of the 1993 law says \\"\\" Although \\"\\" means \\"work\\", some English translations of the law (for instance, the one at CIPR given in the sources below) render this as \\"authors who were in service during...\\" Elst also states it applied to works of authors \\"who worked during or participated in\\" the Great Patriotic War. For posthumously published works, copyrights were defined to last until fifty years after the publication,Elst, p. 438; see also §27(5) of the law. and for posthumously rehabilitated authors, the fifty-year term began running at the date of the rehabilitation.Elst, p. 438ff; §27(5) of the law. Elst points out that for authors who were rehabilitated while still alive, the term of 50 years p.m.a. was to be applied. All terms were to be calculated from January 1 following the date the fact occurred that caused the term to begin running.Elst, p. 436; see also §27(6) of the law. The moral rights to authorship, name, and integrity of the work were defined to be perpetual.Elst, p. 442; see also §27(1) of the law. Concerning the neighbouring rights, the term of protection was fifty years since the original performance or broadcast. For phonograms, the term was fifty years since the first publication, or fifty years since the fixation of the phonogram if not published within that time.Elst p. 469, mentioning that this term was longer than the 20-year minimum required by the Rome Convention and corresponded to the term applied in most Western European countries. Similar rules as for copyright concerning posthumously published works or authors who had lived during the Great Patriotic War or who were posthumously rehabilitated existed also for the neighbouring rights.Elst p. 470. In 2004, the 50-year term was extended to 70 years for all works still copyrighted.  Contractual regulations  The copyright law of 1993 also contained, similar to other European copyright laws, contract provisions regulating the transfer of copyrights.Elst, p. 445ff. Contracts have to be in writing, except for contracts about the use of a work in a periodical, which may be concluded orally. Shrink-wrap licenses for software are allowed.Elst, p. 454, citing Gavrilov to clarify that for publication in electronic media, contracts must be in written form. The law distinguishes between exclusive and non-exclusive transfers of rights. Only patrimonial rights can be transferred, but not moral rights, the resale right, or the right to remuneration for home- copying.Elst, p. 445. In any contract, only those rights explicitly mentioned are transferred, and a transfer is only considered exclusive if the contract explicitly says so.Elst, p. 448. Any contract must specify for which uses the rights on a work are transferred, for which term this transfer is valid, for which territory it applies, and it must define the remuneration the author receives. If no term is specified, an author may revoke the contract after five years with six months notice. If the territory in unspecified, the contract applies only to the territory of the Russian Federation. The remuneration must in general be given as a percentage of the gross income (sale price) generated by the use of the work, if the contract does not contain a remuneration clause, government-defined minimum schedules apply.Elst, p. 449f. The law prohibits the transfer of rights on future works or for future methods of exploitations.Elst, p. 453. Unless the contract explicitly includes a sub-licensing permission, a licensee may not transfer some or all of the licensed rights to a third party.Elst, p. 454.  Retroactivity  The implementation act for the new copyright law, law no. 5352-1 of July 9, 1993, stated that the copyright provisions from the 1991 Fundamentals were invalidated.Law 5352-1/1993. It also stated that the new copyright law applied to all works on which the 50-year term for copyrights and neighbouring rights had not yet elapsed in 1993.Elst p. 526. Subsequently, a discussion amongst copyright specialists erupted about the precise meaning of this.Elst p. 525ff. Many Russian scholars agreed that this provision from the implementation act made the law apply retroactively, restoring copyrights on Soviet works on which the much shorter copyright terms from Soviet times had already expired. This also applied to neighbouring rights on performances, phonograms, and broadcasts.Savelyeva p. 25. Gavrilov presented a dissenting opinion, stating that while this might have been the intention, the wording did not actually have that effect.Elst p. 527. Elst argued that the 1993 law would have been inconsistent and contain several meaningless provisions if it were not retroactive.Elst p. 528\\\\. In particular, Elst mentions two examples: first, neighbouring rights did not exist prior to 1992 in Russia or the USSR, but the law contained (a) a term extension for authors who had lived during the Great Patriotic War, and (b) a provision for posthumously rehabilitated authors: such provisions made only sense if the law retroactively granted neighbouring rights, even though at the time these works were created and the authors lived, no such rights existed at all. Second, Elst mentions that the provisions concerning posthumous rehabilitations would have largely been meaningless if the law were not retroactive, as most such rehabilitations occurred in the late 1950s under Khrushchev or in the late 1980s under Gorbachev, i.e., before the 1993 law became effective. In the United States, the general consensus was that the Russian 1993 law was retroactive.Pilch (2004), p. 93\\\\. Otherwise, the copyright on many older Soviet works would not have been restored by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act in 1996. In a ruling in 2006, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation confirmed the retroactivity of the 1993 law, explaining that it placed even works under copyright again if their old, Soviet 25-year term had already expired.Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, plenum decision no. 15/2006, point 34. Point 37 confirms the retroactivity also for neighbouring rights. - Under the 1993 copyright law, all Russian or Soviet works from the RSFSR published in 1943 or later, as well as works of authors who died in 1943 or later, became thus copyrighted in Russia in 1993. Because of the term extension of four years for authors who had lived during the Great Patriotic War, even some earlier works became subject to copyright. In the case of works formerly copyrighted under Soviet law, this amounted to a restoration of copyright; for the neighbouring rights, which hadn't existed in Soviet times, the law granted those rights retroactively.Elst p. 533. The 1993 copyright law thus rendered the old Soviet legislation largely obsolete in Russia; the former laws remained applicable only to copyright violations that had occurred before August 3, 1993. Examples of works that became copyrighted again in 1993 include the works of Boris Pilniak (executed in 1938, rehabilitated in 1957), Isaac Babel (executed 1940, rehabilitated 1954), or also Osip Mandelstam (died 1938, rehabilitated 1956/1987).Elst p. 532f. Other authors on whose works copyright was restored were Anna Akhmatova (died 1966), Vera Mukhina (died 1953, sculptor of the statue \\"Worker and Kolkhoz Woman\\"), Aleksey Shchusev (died 1949, architect of the Lenin Mausoleum), Aleksey Tolstoy (died 1945), and many others. An extreme example is Mikhail Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita: the work was first published posthumously in 1966. At that time, the Soviet copyright term of then 15 years p.m.a. had already expired as Bulgakov had died in 1940. The new Russian copyright law from 1993 placed this work under copyright again, because the 50-year term was calculated from 1966 on.Elst p. 533.  Amendments of the 1993 Copyright law  On July 19, 1995, Federal Law 110-FL changed the copyright law, strengthening the measures for protecting copyrights against infringements. Law 110-FL also made corresponding amendments in the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation and in related laws.Elst p. 385. Governmental decree no. 524 of May 29, 1998, which was published on June 16, 1998, clarified that for movies created before August 3, 1992, the film studios were no longer considered the authors, as had been the case under the old Soviet law. Instead, the authors of these cinematographic works were the natural persons identified in the 1993 law as such.Elst p. 531\\\\. It follows that the copyright term on Soviet films must be calculated as 50 (or 70) years after the death of the last surviving author, plus four years for authors who had worked or fought during the Great Patriotic War; not as 50 or 70 years since publication, as would have been the case if the studios, as juristic persons, still had been considered the authors. The decree explicitly declared that these authors were entitled to receive royalties for uses of these films (broadcast, whether by cable or wireless, reproduction, distribution (including rental), and showing to the public) and defined a remuneration schedule expressed in percentages of the income generated by the use of the works.Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation no. 524 of May 29, 1998. The decree also clarified that the copyright on such Soviet films was subject to the rules of the 1993 law: the authors were the initial rights holders, and there was a presumption of a transfer of rights to the studios unless there existed an agreement to the contrary. (See also \\"Subjects of copyright\\" above.) On August 8, 2004, the copyright law of Russia was amended by federal law no. 72-FL, by which the general copyright term was extended from 50 to 70 years. This term extension applied only to works that were still copyrighted in Russia in 2004. The same law also modified the provisions on the copyright of foreign works. It added an article 5(4) to the law that defined that a foreign work was eligible to copyright in Russia if its copyright had not expired in the source country and it had not fallen into the public domain in Russia through the expiry of its copyright term. Previously, foreign works published before May 27, 1973, when the USSR had joined the Universal Copyright Convention (UCC), had not been copyrighted at all in the Soviet Union or in Russia,Elst p. 83. even after Russia had joined the Berne Convention in 1995. When Russia had signed the Berne Convention, it had made a reservation regarding article 18 of the Berne Convention by stating that it would not consider the Berne Convention applicable to any works in the public domain in Russia.Russian Federation; decree no. 1224 from 1994.WIPO: Berne Notification 162. Foreign pre-1973 works thus remained uncopyrighted in Russia, although they should have become subject to copyright according to article 18(2) of the Berne Convention because that article only exempted works that once were copyrighted, but on which that copyright already had expired, which didn't apply to pre-1973 foreign works in Russia.Elst p. 493. Russia faced severe criticism for this, especially from Western countries.Elst p. 489. The new article 5(4) of the Russian copyright law was supposed to resolve the situation by restoring copyright on such foreign works and making Russia's copyright law fully compliant with the Berne Convention.Podshibikhin & Leontiev argued in 2002 that the continued application of the non- retroactivity reservation was becoming a problem in Russia's international relations and were better ended. They then explain the necessary modifications of the 1993 law to introduce the copyright restoration as it is prescribed by the Berne Convention. Their proposed modifications coincide with the changes that were indeed made in 2004 by law no. 72-FL.WTO, Report of the Working Party on the Accession of the Russian Federation to the World Trade Organization; p. 318, paragraph 1242. Nevertheless, the common practice in Russia did not change; pre-1973 foreign works were still commonly considered to be uncopyrighted in Russia due to this reservation.Budylin & Osipova, p. 8. Other provisions of law 72-FL amended the 1993 copyright law of Russia in several areas, especially concerning neighbouring rights, to make the legislation compliant with the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty.Boikova, Interim Draft Report.  2008-present: Part IV of the Civil Code  Since its foundation as an independent successor state of the former Soviet Union, the Russian Federation had been engaged in a large legislative project of developing a new Civil Code. Part I of this new Civil Code of the Russian Federation was signed into law on November 30, 1994, by President Boris Yeltsin and became effective on January 1, 1995.Elst p. 388. In article 2, it situates the copyright law within the Civil law. Copyright legislation was originally planned to be included in part III of this new Civil Code.Elst p. 389. Several drafts for new chapters on copyrights were prepared, but the matter proved so difficult that part III of the Civil Code was delayed several times. It was finally adopted on November 26, 2001 without the chapter on intellectual property, which was postponed to part IV.Elst p. 391. Part IV of the Civil Code took several years to work out and was submitted to the State Duma in July 2006.Budylin & Osipova, p. 15. The draft of the new intellectual property legislation was heavily criticized for being too unclear and for conflicting with Russia's international obligations, and also for introducing several untested novelties.CIPR, Russia Proposes New Civil Code. In the following months, about 500 changes were made to the draft, before it passed its final reading in the Duma on November 24, 2006.RIA Novosti, November 24, 2006. After it had also passed through the Federation Council, part IV of the new Russian Civil Code, containing articles 1225 to 1551,Ecomash, December 21, 2006. was signed into law as Federal Law no. 230-FLLaw 230- of December 18, 2006. by Vladimir Putin on December 18, 2006. The implementation act (Federal Law no. 231-FL)Law 231- of December 18, 2006. was signed on the same day; it declared part IV of the Civil Code to enter in force on January 1, 2008 with the effect of invalidating and replacing all previous intellectual property legislation.Femida Audit, December 2006. Part IV of the Civil Code was a comprehensive intellectual property legislation. It contained the copyright law proper in chapters 70 (authors' rights) and 71 (neighbouring rights); chapter 69 contained general provisions also applicable to copyright. Other chapters dealt with patent law (chapter 72), the protection of breeders' rights (ch. 73), of integrated circuits (mask works; ch. 74), of trade secrets (know-how; ch. 75), and also of trade marks, brands, and geographical indications (ch. 76). Chapter 77 detailed rules for technological applications, in particular those developed on a federal budget. A provision for the protection of domain names was removed from the draft before it was adopted.Budylin & Osipova, p. 16. Although the new intellectual property legislation was a complete rewrite from scratch and was structured quite differently than the previous 1993 Copyright Act, there were actually only minor changes in substance concerning copyright proper in the new legislation. With the exception of the Implementation Act discussed below, most changes were clarifications of omissions or of disputed points in the 1993 law. Among the true novelties introduced by the new legislation in the area of copyrights were a publication right (a copyright granted to the publisher of a previously unpublished, uncopyrighted work with a period of 25 years from the publication),Law 230- of December 18, 2006, articles 1337 to 1344. and the definition of two kinds of contracts: one for copyright transfers, and licenses for granting usage rights. Newly, gratis licences were explicitly allowed (article 1235).Golovanov, p. 5. A subtle change concerned the calculation of the copyright term for posthumously published works, which began newly from the disclosure instead of from the publication. (See above for the difference.) For a work that was disclosed during the author's lifetime, the copyright term of 70 years thus runs from the year the author died (or was rehabilitated, if the rehabilitation was posthumous), even if the work is published only later.Alexseyevna The new legislation also no longer contained a provision for a \\"domaine publique payant\\" as the 1993 Copyright Act did in its article 28(3).Golovanov, p. 5\\\\. Domaine publique payant is the concept that users of works that are in the public domain through expiration of the copyright term have to pay (reduced) royalties to the state. Although the 1993 Copyright Act did contain such a provision, it was never enforced in Russia. Some other countries also have such provisions in their copyright laws. The Implementation Act 231-FL made the new legislation applicable also to legal relations from before the coming in force of the new law, as far as new rights granted by the new law were concerned (retroactivity). In article 5 of the implementation act, the new law was made applicable to all new works, as well as to new rights that arose on pre-existing works. Existing rights on already existing works were henceforth governed by the rules of the new law, but initial authorship was to be determined by the laws in effect at the time a work was created.Law 231- of December 18, 2006, article 5. Article 6 of the implementation act specified that the 70-year copyright term was applicable in all cases where the old 50-year copyright term had not yet expired by January 1, 1993, and to all cases from before August 3, 1993 where a legal entity was the copyright holder - this applies to \\"whole works\\" in the form of cinematographic, television, radio works, as well as print periodicals and compilations, which were created by a state corporation, but individual authors such as script writers, artists, composers etc. retain copyright for their respective parts of the work.Articles 483-487 of the Civil Code of the Russian SFSR In this latter case, the copyright was to expire 70 years after the work was first lawfully disclosed, or 70 years after the creation of the work, if the work was undisclosed.Law 231- of December 18, 2006, article 6. Previously, the 70-year copyright term had applied only to works whose 50-year term had not yet expired in 2004, and thus the new Part IV of the Civil Code removed a number of works from the public domain, namely all those where the 50-year term had expired in the years 1994-2003: these became copyrighted again (with a 70-year term) under the new intellectual property legislation. Russia had committed in a trade agreement with the U.S. in November 2006 to ensure that new legislation, including part IV of the Civil Code, would be fully TRIPS compliant, even if such legislation was passed before an eventual accession of Russia to the WTO.U.S. Trade Representative, Factsheet..., November 10, 2006.Golovanov, p. 3.

Landing in New York, James quickly became popular for his small portraits in pastel and his miniatures.Bryan's dictionary of painters and engravers https://archive.org/stream/bryansdictionary05bryauoft/bryansdictionary05bryauoft_djvu.txt From 1796 to 1801 he worked mainly in Philadelphia and New York, securing portrait commissions.

He then used the original portraits to show as samples to new clients or to make copies of the originals. During this time, copies of portraits of famous people were popular, though the competition among artists was intense, and many had to travel in order to find customers.Waggoner, pp 6–7 Sharples often used a physiognotrace, a mechanical drawing aid, to record an exact profile, which he kept for his personal collection. He would then copy these originals for resale.The Met Museum http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/amdr/ho_08.144.htm He also painted three- quarter bust-size pastel portraits with a delicate, precise touch. His color palette was predominantly black, white, and grey. The skin was rendered in flesh tones and the backgrounds were generally blue. \\"The mainstay of Sharples's business was making replicas from the life portrait he made of Washington, just as Gilbert Stuart's staple was making replicas in oil of his portrait of the first president.\\"Virginia Historical Society http://www.vahistorical.org/gwportrait.htm The Sharples charged $15 per profile and $25 for a full-face view.Waggoner, pp 6–7 Sharple's subjects included George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Hester Thrale, Joseph Priestley, James Madison, Dolley Madison, and John Adams. Sharples' family members all took part in duplicating the original portraits, which sometimes made it hard to distinguish the original from the duplicate. According to the Re- identification of a Portrait by James Sharples, author David Meschutt re- identified the portrait labeled as General James Wilkinson in the Independence National Historical Park. Meschutt assessed that the unidentified figure in the portrait represents a soldier. Based on this information, Meschutt was able to narrow down the potential names of the figure with a Sharples collection catalogue. At the beginning of the process of comparing the portrait to the catalogue, Meschutt identified the figure as General William Hull. The identification process is reaffirmed by similarity between the first portraiture and the portraiture of General Hull in Worcester Art Museum. Further, John C. Milley proved the identity of the portraiture through a tracing of photography from the Independence painting. From the listing in a book of The Royal Academy Exhibitors one can see that James Sharples exhibited his works before he moved to America.

It is one of the few \\"talkie\\" films starring Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., in his penultimate film role; Fairbanks also produced the film and provided the story. The film was directed by A. Edward Sutherland, a veteran silent film director, for Fairbanks's Elton Productions, and released by United Artists. Steve Drexel (played by Fairbanks) shows a fiery optimism and can-do spirit that matches the Fairbanks screen persona that appears in his most popular films. The South Seas comedy adventure featured location filming on TahitiVance, Jeffrey (2008). Douglas Fairbanks. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, pg. 293. . with working titles being Tropical Knight, A Modern Robinson Crusoe and Robinson Crusoe of the South Seas. Plot summary The film opens with a title card that reads \\"From the time Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden of Eden, man has vainly sought to find solace, comfort and earthly pleasures in an artificial world of his own creation. Down through the ages has come that eternal heritage of the urge in every man to turn his back on so-called civilization, to get back to nature and revel in the glories and freedom of a primitive paradise.\\" The Fairbanks character Steve Drexel voluntarily strands himself on a deserted island on a bet. He intends to re-create civilization (in the form of New York) and carves a comfortable home, complete with a sign reading 52nd Street and Park Avenue out of the jungle. Drexel is joined by his dog, and befriended by a native monkey, parrot, and a wild goat that is captured in one of his traps. He attempts to cultivate a \\"head-hunter\\" native as his Man Friday from Robinson Crusoe, but fails as the native escapes. A woman played by actress Maria Alba runs away from a marriage she does not want on a neighboring island and is trapped in one of his devices. He names her Saturday and she becomes the love interest of the film. In an attempt to communicate with Saturday, he tries German, Spanish, and then Pig Latin. Over the course of the film, she slowly learns rudimentary English. Eventually, the natives on a nearby island attack the Fairbank's settlement at the behest of the men that bet against the main character. The hero defeats the hostile natives just as his friends arrive and he wins the bet. Coincidental to their arrival, a separate war party of natives (billed as head-hunters) arrives and attacks. Steve Drexel distracts them as his friends save his animals and head for the yacht. After a harrowing chase, he ends up escaping with his friends, animals and the girl Saturday on the yacht that brought him there. He takes her back to New York where she performs to an appreciative crowd in the Ziegfeld Follies.

Newman reused one of his musical themes for the 1937 film The Hurricane where it became a popular song called Moon of Manakoora. Newman's score for The Hurricane was nominated for an Academy Award. Legacy Fairbanks biographer Jeffrey Vance writes \\"Mr. Robinson Crusoe, his last personal production, was designed to meet his responsibilities in the least demanding way. The film was conceived as an inexpensive travelogue masquerading as a narrative film...Free from the hated dialogue that had so confined his type of film, Fairbanks should have been in his element. And yet, despite the primarily visual aspect of the film, his customary ebullience is not in evidence; his character is a hypomanic middle-aged man.\\" Further reading *Vance, Jeffrey.

Dutch sociologist Abram de Swaan developed this theory in 2001 in his book Words of the World: The Global Language System and according to him, \\"the multilingual connections between language groups do not occur haphazardly, but, on the contrary, they constitute a surprisingly strong and efficient network that ties together – directly or indirectly – the six billion inhabitants of the earth.\\" The global language system draws upon the world system theory to account for the relationships between the world's languages and divides them into a hierarchy consisting of four levels, namely the peripheral, central, supercentral and hypercentral languages. Theory Background According to de Swaan, the global language system has been constantly evolving since the time period of the early 'military-agrarian' regimes. Under these regimes, the rulers imposed their own language and so the first 'central' languages emerged, linking the peripheral languages of the agrarian communities via bilingual speakers to the language of the conquerors. Then was the formation of empires, which resulted in the next stage of integration of the world language system. Firstly, Latin emerged from Rome. Under the rule of the Roman Empire, which ruled an extensive group of states, the usage of Latin stretched along the Mediterranean coast, the southern half of Europe, and more sparsely to the North and then into the Germanic and Celtic lands. Thus, Latin evolved to become a central language in Europe from 27 BC to 476 AD. Secondly, there was the widespread usage of the pre-classical version of Han Chinese in contemporary China due to the unification of China in 221 BC by Qin Shi Huang. Thirdly, Sanskrit started to become widely spoken in South Asia from the widespread teaching of Hinduism and Buddhism in South Asian countries. Fourthly, the expansion of the Arabic empire also led to the increased usage of Arabic as a language in the Afro-Eurasian land mass. Military conquests of preceding centuries generally determine the distribution of languages today. Supercentral languages spread by land and sea. Land-bound languages spread via marching empires: German, Russian, Arabic, Hindi, Chinese and Japanese. However, when the conquerors were defeated and were forced to move out of the territory, the spread of the languages receded. As a result, some of these languages are currently barely supercentral languages and are instead confined to their remaining state territories, as is evident from German, Russian and Japanese. On the other hand, sea-bound languages spread by conquests overseas: English, French, Portuguese, Spanish. Consequently, these languages became widespread in areas settled by European colonisers and relegated the indigenous people and their languages to peripheral positions. Besides, the world-systems theory also allowed the global language system to expand further. It focuses on the existence of the core, semi-peripheral and peripheral nations. The core countries are the most economically powerful and the wealthiest countries. Besides, they also have a strong governmental system in the country, which oversees the bureaucracies in the governmental departments. There is also the prevalent existence of the bourgeois, and core nations have significant influence over the non-core, smaller nations. Historically, the core countries were found in northwestern Europe and include countries such as England, France and the Netherlands. They were the dominant countries that had colonized many other nations from the early 15th century to the early 19th century. Then is the existence of the periphery countries, the countries with the slowest economic growth. They also have relatively weak governments and a poor social structure and often depend on primary industries as the main source of economic activity for the country. The extracting and exporting of raw materials from the peripheral nations to core nations is the activity bringing about the most economic benefits to the country. Much of the population that is poor and uneducated, and the countries are also extensively influenced by core nations and the multinational corporations found there. Historically, peripheral nations were found outside Europe, the continent of colonial masters. Many countries in Latin America were peripheral nations during the period of colonization, and today peripheral countries are in sub- Saharan Africa. Lastly, the presence of the semiperiphery countries, those in between the core and the periphery. They tend to be those which started out as peripheral nations and are currently moving towards industrialization and the development of more diversified labour markets and economies. They can as well come about from declining core countries. They are not dominant players in the international trade market. As compared to the peripheral nations, semi- peripheries are not as susceptible to manipulation by the core countries. However, most of these nations have economic or political relations with the core. Semi-peripheries also tend to exert influence and control over peripheries and can serve to be a buffer between the core and peripheral nations and ease political tensions. Historically, Spain and Portugal were semi-peripheral nations after they fell from their dominant core positions. As they still maintained a certain level of influence and dominance in Latin America over their colonies, they could still maintain their semi-peripheral position. According to Immanuel Wallerstein, one of the most well-known theorists who developed the world-systems approach, a core nation is dominant over the non-core nations from its economic and trade dominance. The abundance of cheap and unskilled labour in the peripheral nations makes many large multinational corporations (MNCs), from core countries, often outsource their production to the peripheral countries to cut costs, by employing cheap labour. Hence, the languages from the core countries could penetrate into the peripheries from the setting up of the foreign MNCs in the peripheries. A significant percentage of the population living in the core countries had also migrated to the core countries in search of jobs with higher wages. The gradual expansion of the population of migrants makes the language used in their home countries be brought into the core countries, thus allowing for further integration and expansion of the world language system. The semi- peripheries also maintain economic and financial trade with the peripheries and core countries. That allows for the penetration of languages used in the semi-peripheries into the core and peripheral nations, with the flow of migrants moving out of the semi-peripheral nations to the core and periphery for trade purposes. Thus, the global language system examines rivalries and accommodations using a global perspective and establishes that the linguistic dimension of the world system goes hand in hand with the political, economic, cultural and ecological aspects. Specifically, the present global constellation of languages is the product of prior conquest and domination and of ongoing relations of power and exchange. Q-value Q_i is the communicative value of a language i, its potential to connect a speaker with other speakers of a constellation or subconstellation, \\"S\\". It is defined as follows: Q_i=p_i \\\\times c_i = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{P_i}{N^S} \\\\right ) \\\\times \\\\left ( \\\\frac{C_i}{M^S} \\\\right ) The prevalence p_i of language i, means the number of competent speakers in i, P_i, divided by all the speakers, N^S of constellation S. Centrality, c_i is the number of multilingual speakers C_i who speak language i divided by all the multilingual speakers in constellation S, M^S. Thus, the Q-value or communication value is the product of the prevalence p_i and the centrality c_i of language i in constellation S. Consequently, a peripheral language has a low Q-value and the Q-values increase along the sociology classification of languages, with the Q-value of the hypercentral language being the highest. De Swaan has been calculating the Q-values of the official European Union(EU) languages since 1957 to explain the acquisition of languages by EU citizens in different phases. In 1970, when there were only four language constellations, Q-value decreased in the order of French, German, Italian, Dutch. In 1975, the European Commission enlarged to include Britain, Denmark and Ireland. English had the highest Q-value followed by French and German. In the following years, the European Commission grew, with the addition of countries like Austria, Finland and Sweden. Q-value of English still remained the highest, but French and German swapped places. In EU23, which refers to the 23 official languages spoken in the European Union, the Q-values for English, German and French were 0.194, 0.045 and 0.036 respectively. Theoretical framework De Swaan likens the global language system to contemporary political macrosociology and states that language constellations are a social phenomenon, which can be understood by using social science theories. In his theory, de Swaan uses the Political Sociology of Language and Political Economy of Language to explain the rivalry and accommodation between language groups. Political sociology This theoretical perspective centres on the interconnections among the state, nation and citizenship. Accordingly, bilingual elite groups try to take control of the opportunities for mediation between the monolingual group and the state. Subsequently, they use the official language to dominate the sectors of government and administration and the higher levels of employment. It assumes that both the established and outsider groups are able to communicate in a shared vernacular, but the latter groups lack the literacy skills that could allow them to learn the written form of the central or supercentral language, which would, in turn allow, them to move up the social ladder. Political economy This perspective centres on the inclinations that people have towards learning one language over the other. The presumption is that if given a chance, people will learn the language that gives them more communication advantage. In other words, a higher Q-Value. Certain languages such as English or Chinese have high Q-values since they are spoken in many countries across the globe and would thus be more economically useful than to less spoken languages, such as Romanian or Hungarian. From an economic perspective, languages are ‘hypercollective’ goods since they exhibit properties of collective goods and produce external network effects. Thus, the more speakers a language has, the higher its communication value for each speaker. The hypercollective nature and Q-Value of languages thus help to explain the dilemma that a speaker of a peripheral language faces when deciding whether to learn the central or hypercentral language. The hypercollective nature and Q-value also help to explain the accelerating spread and abandonment of various languages. In that sense, when people feel that a language is gaining new speakers, they would assign a greater Q-value to this language and abandon their own native language in place of a more central language. The hypercollective nature and Q-value also explain, in an economic sense, the ethnic and cultural movements for language conservation. Specifically, a minimal Q-value of a language is guaranteed when there is a critical mass of speakers committed to protecting it, thus preventing the language from being forsaken. Characteristics The global language system theorises that language groups are engaged in unequal competition on different levels globally. Using the notions of a periphery, semi-periphery and a core, which are concepts of the world system theory, de Swaan relates them to the four levels present in the hierarchy of the global language system: peripheral, central, supercentral and hypercentral. De Swaan also argues that the greater the range of potential uses and users of a language, the higher the tendency of an individual to move up the hierarchy in the global language system and learn a more \\"central\\" language. Thus, de Swaan views the learning of second languages as proceeding up rather than down the hierarchy, in the sense that they learn a language that is on the next level up. For instance, speakers of Catalan, a peripheral language, have to learn Spanish, a central language to function in their own society, Spain. Meanwhile, speakers of Persian, a central language, have to learn Arabic, a supercentral language, to function in their region. On the other hand, speakers of a supercentral language have to learn the hypercentral language to function globally, as is evident from the huge number of non-native English speakers. According to de Swaan, languages exist in \\"constellations\\" and the global language system comprises a sociological classification of languages based on their social role for their speakers. The world's languages and multilinguals are connected in a strongly ordered, hierarchical pattern. There are thousands of peripheral or minority languages in the world, each of which are connected to one of a hundred central languages. The connections and patterns between each language is what makes up the global language system. The four levels of language are the peripheral, central, supercentral and hypercentral languages. This flowchart depicts the hierarchy of the languages in de Swaan's (2001) global language system theory. Peripheral languages At the lowest level, peripheral languages, or minority languages, form the majority of languages spoken in the world; 98% of the world's languages are peripheral languages and spoken by less than 10% of the world’s population. Unlike central languages, these are \\"languages of conversation and narration rather than reading and writing, of memory and remembrance rather than record\\". They are used by native speakers within a particular area and are in danger of becoming extinct with increasing globalisation, which sees more and more speakers of peripheral languages acquiring more central languages in order to communicate with others. Central languages The next level constitutes about 100 central languages, spoken by 95% of the world's population and generally used in education, media and administration. Typically, they are the 'national' and official languages of the ruling state. These are the languages of record, and much of what has been said and written in those languages is saved in newspaper reports, minutes and proceedings, stored in archives, included in history books, collections of the 'classics', of folk talks and folk ways, increasingly recorded on electronic media and thus conserved for posterity. Many speakers of central languages are multilingual because they are either native speakers of a peripheral language and have acquired the central language, or they are native speakers of the central language and have learned a supercentral language. Supercentral languages At the second highest level, 13 supercentral languages are very widely spoken languages that serve as connectors between speakers of central languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, Japanese, Malay, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swahili and Turkish. These languages often have colonial traces and \\"were once imposed by a colonial power and after independence continued to be used in politics, administration, law, big business, technology and higher education\\". Hypercentral languages At the highest level is the language that connects speakers of the supercentral languages. Today, English is the only example of a hypercentral language as the standard for science, literature, business, and law, as well as being the most widely spoken second language. Applications Pyramid of languages of the world This pyramid illustrates the hierarchy of the world's languages as proposed by Graddol (1997) in his book, 'The future of English? A guide to forecasting the popularity of the English language in the 21st century', published by the British Council. According to David Graddol (1997), in his book titled The Future of English, the languages of the world comprise a \\"hierarchical pyramid\\", as follows: * The big languages: English, French. * Regional languages (languages of the United Nations are marked with asterisk): Arabic*, Mandarin*, English*, French*, German, Russian*, Spanish*, Hindustani. * National languages: around 80 languages serving over 180 nation states. * Official languages within nation states (and other \\"safe\\" languages): around 600 languages worldwide (e.g. Marathi). * Local vernacular languages: the remainder of the world's 6,000+ languages. Translation systems The global language system is also seen in the international translation process as explained by Johan Heilbron, a historical sociologist: \\"translations and the manifold activities these imply are embedded in and dependent on a world system of translation, including both the source and the target cultures\\". The hierarchical relationship between global languages is reflected in the global system for translations. The more \\"central\\" a language, the greater is its capability to function as a bridge or vehicular language to facilitate communication between peripheral and semi-central languages. Heilbron's version of the global system of language in translations has four levels: Level 1: Hypercentral position — English currently holds the largest market share of the global market for translations; 55–60% of all book translations are from English. It strongly dominates the hierarchical nature of book translation system. Level 2: Central position — German and French each hold 10% of the global translation market. Level 3: Semi-central position — There are 7 or 8 languages \\"neither very central on a global level nor very peripheral\\", each making up 1 to 3% of the world market (like Spanish, Italian and Russian). Level 4: Peripheral position — Languages from which \\"less than 1% of the book translations worldwide are made\\", including Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Malay, Swahili, Turkish and Arabic. Despite having large populations of speakers, \\"their role in the translation economy is peripheral as compared to more central languages\\". Acceptance According to the Google Scholar website, de Swaan's book, Words of the world: The global language system, has been cited by 546 other papers, as of 16 October 2014. However, there have also been several concerns regarding the global language system: Importance of Q-value Van Parijs (2004) claimed that 'frequency' or likelihood of contact is adequate as an indicator of language learning and language spread. However, de Swaan (2007) argued that it alone is not sufficient. Rather, the Q-value, which comprises both frequency (better known as prevalence) and 'centrality', helps to explain the spread of (super)central languages, especially former colonial languages in newly independent countries where in which only the elite minority spoke the language initially. Frequency alone would not be able to explain the spread of such languages, but Q-value, which includes centrality, would be able to. In another paper, Cook and Li (2009) examined the ways to categorise language users into various groups. They suggested two theories: one by Siegel (2006) who used 'sociolinguistic settings', which is based on the notion of dominant language, and another one by de Swaan (2001) that used the concept of hierarchy in the global language system. According to them, de Swaan's hierarchy is more appropriate, as it does not imply dominance in power terms. Rather, de Swaan's applies the concepts of geography and function to group languages and hence language users according to the global language system. De Swaan (2001) views the acquisition of second languages (L2) as typically going up the hierarchy. However, Cook and Li argues that this analysis is not adequate in accounting for the many groups of L2 users to whom the two areas of territory and function hardly apply. The two areas of territory and function can be associated respectively with the prevalence and centrality of the Q-value. This group of L2 users typically doez not acquire an L2 going up the hierarchy, such as users in an intercultural marriage or users who come from a particular cultural or ethnic group and wish to learn its language for identity purposes. Thus, Cook and Li argue that de Swaan's theory, though highly relevant, still has its drawbacks in that the concept behind Q-value is insufficient in accounting for some L2 users. Choice of supercentral languages There is disagreement as to which languages should be considered more central. The theory states that a language is central if it connects speakers of \\"a series of central languages\\". Robert Phillipson questioned why Japanese is included as one of the supercentral languages but Bengali, which has more speakers, is not on the list. Inadequate evidence for a system Michael Morris argued that while it is clear that there is language hierarchy from the \\"ongoing interstate competition and power politics\\", there is little evidence provided that shows that the \\"global language interaction is so intense and systematic that it constitutes a global language system, and that the entire system is held together by one global language, English\\". He claimed that de Swaan's case studies demonstrated that hierarchy in different regions of the world but did not show the existence of a system within a region or across regions. The global language system is supposed to be part of the international system but is \\"notoriously vague and lacking in operational importance\\" and therefore cannot be shown to exist. However, Morris believes that this lack of evidence could be from the lack of global language data and not negligence on de Swaan's part. Morris also believes that any theory on a global system, if later proved, would be much more complex than what is proposed by de Swaan. Questions on how the hypercentral language English holds together the system must also be answered by such a global language system. Theory built on inadequate foundations Robert Phillipson states that the theory is based on selective theoretical foundations. He claimed that there is a lack of consideration about the effects of globalization, which is especially important when the theory is about a global system: \\"De Swaan nods occasionally in the direction of linguistic and cultural capital, but does not link this to class or linguistically defined social stratification (linguicism) or linguistic inequality\\" and that \\"key concepts in the sociology of language, language maintenance and shift, and language spread are scarcely mentioned\\". On the other hand, de Swaan's work in the field of sociolinguistics has been noted by other scholars to be focused on \\"issues of economic and political sociology\\" and \\"politic and economic patterns\\", which may explain why he makes only 'cautious references to socio-linguistic parameters\\".

He was the son of Malatesta da Verucchio, inheriting the lordship after his death. He was also the brother of Gianciotto Malatesta, husband of Francesca da Rimini, and of Paolo Malatesta. Malatestino is mentioned by Dante in his Inferno (XVII, 48-48; and XVIII, 76-84), described as a tyrant like his father, and as the assassin of Guido del Cassero and Angiolello da Carignano. But there is no historical information on these characters. Dante presents the news as a prophecy by the sower of discord, Pier da Medicina, that they, the best of Fano, must beware of Malatestino I Malatesta, tyrant of Rimini, who will kill them by mazzeratura (drowning in leaded bags) near Cattolica. The lack of any archive source on such an incident made some Dante commentators even think that here Piero wanted to perpetrate his sin as a sower of discord by putting tares between the two of Fano and the lord of Rimini. But Dante's preciseness has more of a taste of revelation and since it is a serious allegation, it may be that, as in other cases, the power of the persons concerned has covered up any mention in contemporary documents. He was podestà of Cesena (1290–1295), capitano del popolo of Bologna in 1296, podestà of Rimini (1302) and capitano del popolo of Florence (1303). In 1312 he became lord of Rimini, to which he subsequently added Cesena and Jesi. Malatestino was succeeded laterally by his brother Pandolfo I. The claims of Malatestino's own son Ferrantino would have to wait.

All types of separated trash can be accepted here for free or a small sum depending on type of material (green stuff and concrete/bricks is usually free). Some stores perform collection of chemicals (paint, batteries). There are a great number of second-hand shops (run by charity organisations) that accept goods for processing, which consists of re-use, recycling and burning it as fuel.  Facts and figures  Landfill usage has been lowered significantly from 13% in 1992 to 3% in 2016.. Dutch household waste recycling averages 49% (2012).http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/daviz/municipal- waste-recycled-and-composted The amount of separated household waste in the Netherlands was around 60% in 2014. The Dutch government wants 75% of household waste to be separated by 2020, which means that waste will decrease from 250 kilograms per capita per year to 100 kilograms per capita per year in 2020.  Recycling expertise  The Dutch have a lot of experience in recycling, stimulated by lack of free grounds and significant government funding. This expertise is sensibly exported. A 2006 article reports Dutch involvement in reform of recycling in the UK.  EU Regulations  National law concerning recycling is heavily influenced by EU regulations. Reforms may have great impact on national collection systems (for instance a downgrade of the recycling system is imaginable, when deposits on types of drink containers are lifted). Also, the environmental impact of industry is closely guarded by EU standards.  Deposit systems  Deposit systems are in use for beer bottles, larger plastic bottles, and plastic crates for bottles. For these items, the deposit (or statiegeld) is returned by automated machines at supermarkets. A video of such a machine in use and returning the deposit is available on YouTube.\\"Robotic Dutch bottle re-use machine\\", Youtube. Accessed: August 18, 2012. Gas bottles and household appliances are also covered by this. Although for these the money is never returned, it requires a shop owner to accept the discarded item it replaces, if handed in. The used term is \\"verwijderingsbijdrage\\" or \\"removal fee\\". Extra earnings from this system are spent on investments in the recycling industry. On 24 April 2020, the State Secretary for Infrastructure and Water Management Stientje van Veldhoven announced that plastic bottles smaller than 1L will be subject to a €0.15 deposit, starting on 1 July 2021. Beverage cans will be subject to a deposit in 2022 if the industry doesn't succeed to reduce the presence of cans in the environment with 70% in 2021. Dutch environmental organisations acclaimed the decision.

It often applies for aircraft, but other turbine engines can fail, like ground-based turbines used in power plants or combined diesel and gas vessels and vehicles.  Reliability  Turbine engines in use on today's turbine-powered aircraft are very reliable. Engines operate efficiently with regularly scheduled inspections and maintenance. These units can have lives ranging in the thousands of hours of operation. However, engine malfunctions or failures occasionally occur that require an engine to be shut down in flight. Since multi-engine airplanes are designed to fly with one engine inoperative and flight crews are trained to fly with one engine inoperative, the in-flight shutdown of an engine typically does not constitute a serious safety of flight issue. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was quoted as stating turbine engines have a failure rate of one per 375,000 flight hours, compared to of one every 3,200 flight hours for aircraft piston engines. Due to \\"gross under-reporting\\" of general aviation piston engines in- flight shutdowns (IFSD), the FAA has no reliable data and assessed the rate \\"between 1 per 1,000 and 1 per 10,000 flight hours\\". Continental Motors reports the FAA states general aviation engines experience one failures or IFSD every 10,000 flight hours, and states its Centurion engines is one per flight hours, lowering to one per flight hours in 2013-2014. The General Electric GE90 has an in-flight shutdown rate (IFSD) of one per million engine flight-hours. The Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6 is known for its reliability with an in-flight shutdown rate of one per hours from 1963 to 2016, lowering to one per hours over 12 months in 2016. Emergency landing Following an engine shutdown, a precautionary landing is usually performed with airport fire and rescue equipment positioned near the runway. The prompt landing is a precaution against the risk that another engine will fail later in the flight or that the engine failure that has already occurred may have caused or been caused by other as-yet unknown damage or malfunction of aircraft systems (such as fire or damage to aircraft flight controls) that may pose a continuing risk to the flight. Once the airplane lands, fire department personnel assist with inspecting the airplane to ensure it is safe before it taxis to its parking position. Rotorcraft Turboprop-powered aircraft and turboshaft-powered helicopters are also powered by turbine engines and are subject to engine failures for many similar reasons as jet-powered aircraft. In the case of an engine failure in a helicopter, it is often possible for the pilot to enter autorotation, using the unpowered rotor to slow the aircraft's descent and provide a measure of control, usually allowing for a safe emergency landing even without engine power. Shutdowns that are not engine failures Most in- flight shutdowns are harmless and likely to go unnoticed by passengers. For example, it may be prudent for the flight crew to shut down an engine and perform a precautionary landing in the event of a low oil pressure or high oil temperature warning in the cockpit. However, passengers in a jet powered aircraft may become quite alarmed by other engine events such as a compressor surge — a malfunction that is typified by loud bangs and even flames from the engine's inlet and tailpipe. A compressor surge is a disruption of the airflow through a gas turbine jet engine that can be caused by engine deterioration, a crosswind over the engine's inlet, ice accumulation around the engine inlet, ingestion of foreign material, or an internal component failure such as a broken blade. While this situation can be alarming, the engine may recover with no damage.https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/engine_prop/media/engine_malf_famil.doc Other events that can happen with jet engines, such as a fuel control fault, can result in excess fuel in the engine's combustor. This additional fuel can result in flames extending from the engine's exhaust pipe. As alarming as this would appear, at no time is the engine itself actually on fire. Also, the failure of certain components in the engine may result in a release of oil into bleed air that can cause an odor or oily mist in the cabin. This is known as a fume event. The dangers of fume events are the subject of debate in both aviation and medicine. Possible causes Engine failures can be caused by mechanical problems in the engine itself, such as damage to portions of the turbine or oil leaks, as well as damage outside the engine such as fuel pump problems or fuel contamination. A turbine engine failure can also be caused by entirely external factors, such as volcanic ash, bird strikes or weather conditions like precipitation or icing. Weather risks such as these can sometimes be countered through the usage of supplementary ignition or anti- icing systems. Failures during takeoff A turbine-powered aircraft's takeoff procedure is designed around ensuring that an engine failure will not endanger the flight. This is done by planning the takeoff around three critical V speeds, V1, VR and V2. V1 is the critical engine failure recognition speed, the speed at which a takeoff can be continued with an engine failure, and the speed at which stopping distance is no longer guaranteed in the event of a rejected takeoff. VR is the speed at which the nose is lifted off the runway, a process known as rotation. V2 is the single- engine safety speed, the single engine climb speed. The use of these speeds ensure that either sufficient thrust to continue the takeoff, or sufficient stopping distance to reject it will be available at all times. Failure during extended operations In order to allow twin-engined aircraft to fly longer routes that are over an hour from a suitable diversion airport, a set of rules known as ETOPS (Extended Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards) is used to ensure a twin turbine engine powered aircraft is able to safely arrive at a diversionary airport after an engine failure or shutdown, as well as to minimize the risk of a failure. ETOPS includes maintenance requirements, such as frequent and meticulously logged inspections and operation requirements such as flight crew training and ETOPS-specific procedures. Contained and uncontained failures The engine of Delta Air Lines Flight 1288 after it experienced catastrophic uncontained compressor rotor failure in 1996. Engine failures may be described as either as \\"contained\\" or \\"uncontained\\". * A contained engine failure is one in which components might separate inside the engine but either remain within the engine's cases or exit the engine through the tail pipe. * An uncontained engine event occurs when an engine failure results in fragments of rotating engine parts penetrating and exiting through the engine case. Uncontained turbine engine disk failures within an aircraft engine present a direct hazard to an airplane and its passengers because high-energy disk fragments can penetrate the cabin or fuel tanks, damage flight control surfaces, or sever flammable fluid or hydraulic lines. Engine cases are not designed to contain failed turbine disks. Instead, the risk of uncontained disk failure is mitigated by designating disks as safety-critical parts, defined as the parts of an engine whose failure is likely to present a direct hazard to the aircraft. Engine manufacturers are required by the FAA to perform blade off tests to ensure containment of shrapnel if blade separation occurs.Blade containment and rotor unbalance tests. , 14 CFR 33.94, 1984 Notable uncontained engine failure accidents * National Airlines Flight 27: a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 flying from Miami to San Francisco in 1973 had an overspeed failure of a General Electric CF6-6, resulting in one fatality. * Two LOT Polish Airlines flights, both Ilyushin Il-62s, suffered catastrophic uncontained engine failures in the 1980s. The first was in 1980 on LOT Polish Airlines Flight 7 where flight controls were destroyed, killing all 87 on board. In 1987, on LOT Polish Airlines Flight 5055, the aircraft's inner left (#2) engine, damaged the outer left (#1) engine, setting both on fire and causing loss of flight controls, leading to an eventual crash, which killed all 183 people on board. In both cases, the turbine shaft in engine #2 disintegrated due to production defects in the engines' bearings, which were missing rollers. * The Tu-154 crash near Krasnoyarsk was a major aircraft crash that occurred on Sunday, December 23, 1984 in the vicinity of Krasnoyarsk. The Tu-154B-2 airliner of the 1st Krasnoyarsk united aviation unit (Aeroflot) performed passenger flight SU-3519 on the Krasnoyarsk-Irkutsk route, but during the climb, engine No. 3 failed. The crew decided to return to the airport of departure, but during the landing approach a fire broke out, which destroyed the control systems and as a result, the plane crashed to the ground 3200 meters from the threshold of the runway of the Yemelyanovo airport and collapsed. Of the 111 people on board (104 passengers and 7 crew members), one survived. The cause of the catastrophe was the destruction of the disk of the first stage of the low pressure circuit of engine No. 3, which occurred due to the presence of fatigue cracks. The cracks were caused by a manufacturing defect - the inclusion of a titanium-nitrogen compound that has a higher microhardness than the original material. The methods used at that time for the manufacture and repair of disks, as well as the means of control, were found to be partially obsolete, which is why they did not ensure the effectiveness of control and detection of such a defect. The defect itself arose probably due to accidental ingestion of a titanium sponge or charge for smelting an ingot of a piece enriched with nitrogen. * Cameroon Airlines Flight 786: a Boeing 737 flying between Douala and Garoua, Cameroon in 1984 had a failure of a Pratt & Whitney JT8D-15 engine. Two people died. *British Airtours Flight 28M: a Boeing 737 flying from Manchester to Corfu in 1985 suffered an uncontained engine failure and fire on takeoff. The takeoff was aborted and the plane turned onto a taxiway and began evacuating. Fifty-five passengers and crew were unable to escape and died of smoke inhalation. The accident led to major changes to improve the survivability of aircraft evacuations. * United Airlines Flight 232: a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 flying from Denver to Chicago in 1989. The failure of the rear General Electric CF6-6 engine caused the loss of all hydraulics forcing the pilots to attempt a landing using differential thrust. 111 fatalities. Prior to the United 232 crash, the probability of a simultaneous failure of all three hydraulic systems was considered as low as one in a billion. However, the statistical models used to come up with this figure did not account for the fact that the number-two engine was mounted at the tail close to all the hydraulic lines, nor the possibility that an engine failure would release many fragments in many directions. Since then, more modern aircraft engine designs have focused on keeping shrapnel from penetrating the cowling or ductwork, and have increasingly utilized high-strength composite materials to achieve the required penetration resistance while keeping the weight low. * Baikal Airlines Flight 130: a starter of engine No. 2 on a Tu-154 heading from Irkutsk to Domodedovo, Moscow in 1994, failed to stop after engine startup and continued to operate at over 40,000 rpm with open bleed valves from engines, which caused an uncontained failure of the starter. A detached turbine disk damaged fuel and oil supply lines (which caused fire) and hydraulic lines. The fire-extinguishing system failed to stop the fire, and the plane diverted back to Irkutsk. However, due to loss of hydraulic pressure the crew lost control of the plane, which subsequently crashed into a dairy farm killing all 124 on board and one on the ground. * Delta Air Lines Flight 1288: a McDonnell Douglas MD-88 flying from Pensacola, Florida to Atlanta in 1996 had a cracked compressor rotor hub failure on one of its Pratt & Whitney JT8D-219 engines. Two died. * Qantas Flight 32: an Airbus A380 flying from London Heathrow to Sydney (via Singapore) in 2010 had an uncontained failure in a Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine. The failure was found to have been caused by a misaligned counter bore within a stub oil pipe leading to a fatigue fracture. This in turn led to an oil leakage followed by an oil fire in the engine. The fire led to the release of the Intermediate Pressure Turbine (IPT) disc. The airplane, however, landed safely. This led to the grounding of the entire Qantas A380 fleet. *British Airways Flight 2276: a Boeing 777-200ER flying from Las Vegas to London in 2015 suffered an uncontained engine failure on its #1 GE90 engine during takeoff, resulting in a large fire on its port side. The aircraft successfully aborted takeoff and the plane was evacuated with no fatalities. * Southwest Airlines Flight 3472: a Boeing 737-700 flying from New Orleans to Orlando in 2016 suffered an uncontained engine failure on its #1 engine during climb resulting in a puncture to left side of the fuselage causing a loss of cabin pressure and damage to the wing and empennage. The aircraft diverted to Pensacola International Airport, Florida for a safe landing on runway 17 about 20 minutes later without further incident. There were no injuries. * American Airlines Flight 383: a Boeing 767-300ER flying from Chicago to Miami in 2016 suffered an uncontained engine failure on its #2 engine during takeoff resulting in a large fire which destroyed the outer right wing. The aircraft aborted takeoff and was evacuated with 21 minor injuries, but no fatalities. * Air France Flight 66: an Airbus A380, registration F-HPJE performing flight from Paris, France, to Los Angeles, United States, was en route about southeast of Nuuk, Greenland, when it suffered a catastrophic engine failure in 2017. The crew descended the aircraft and diverted to Goose Bay, Canada, for a safe landing about two hours later.

An early pioneer of family planning in India and elsewhere, he was a champion of the program under the premierships of Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, and the initial period of Indira Gandhi. He invented the now-pervasive (in India and some other countries) \\"Red Triangle\\" symbol as a branding effort to familiarize and popularize the idea of family planning. Many of the mass communication techniques he developed are now used throughout the developing world to combat disease (such as HIV/AIDS) and poverty. Part of the mission statement of the present-day foundation, DKT International, which was named in his honor reads - \\"He was 41 years old at the time of his death, but had already made a major contribution to his country’s family planning effort. It was he who was largely responsible for the design and dissemination of a massive communication program that brought awareness and knowledge of family planning to hundreds of millions of Indians. He began his work at a time (1966) when modern contraceptive methods were virtually unknown in rural India. His success in saturating the country with simple, attractive messages and designs (including the Red Triangle, which is now in use in several other countries) overcame age-old communication barriers and greatly increased public awareness of birth control.\\" Life Deep Tyagi was born in Ratangarh village of Uttar Pradesh in 1928.

Biography Born to a Székely family in Farkaslaka in Udvarhely County (present-day Lupeni, Harghita County), he graduated in Law and Commerce at the Babeș-Bolyai University, Tamási emigrated to the United States in 1923, soon after Transylvania became part of Romania. He wrote his first Hungarian- language novels there, and these were soon published in Cluj, to widespread acclaim. He returned home in 1926 and lived in Transylvania until 1944. One of Tamási's most famous works from this period was a novel trilogy about the adventures of a Székely boy called Ábel, a young forest ranger living alone in the Hargita Mountains. Tamási moved to Budapest in 1944, and lived there until his death in 1966. At his request, he was buried in his native Székely Land, an ethno-cultural region in eastern Transylvania, Romania.

Although he received critical acclaim for much of his work, he became best known for the runaway success of a rendition of his song \\"Kinders van die Wind\\" (\\"Children of the Wind\\") by Laurika Rauch. Koos du Plessis was born in Rustenburg. He was the youngest of four children, and grew up in the mining town of Springs. After school, he attended the University of Pretoria, and the University of the Witwatersrand, majoring in Afrikaans- Nederlands (Afrikaans-Dutch). At university he met his future wife, Mornay. The couple had three daughters, Irma, Karien and Karla. Koos would eventually write a song for each of these four women in his life. Koos worked as journalist and editor for several Afrikaans publications (Oggendblad, Die Vaderland, Die Nataller and Die Transvaler). He died in a motorcar accident close to Krugersdorp during the early morning hours of 15 January 1984. Legacy In 2010 two Koos du Plessis tribute albums were released in The Netherlands posthumously. First was Ofschaaid Zunder Woorden, an album with songs of Du Plessis sung in Grunnegs by Wia Buze and Klaas Spekken. Karla du Plessis joined for a special duet on this album. Second was Die Land Van Blou Saffiere, released in the Tussen Kontinente-series. This release was a hardcover book that included a biography, lyrics with footnotes and explanations and a CD with 20 of his songs. He wrote two religious songs: Gebed (Prayer: Let me never leave this ground, let me in thy shadow stay...) and a carol Somerkersfees (Summer Christmas). The latter was incorporated into the hymnals of several Afrikaans churches.

Accessed 2013-10-08. The SI unit of radiosity is the watt per square metre (), while that of spectral radiosity in frequency is the watt per square metre per hertz (W·m−2·Hz−1) and that of spectral radiosity in wavelength is the watt per square metre per metre (W·m−3)—commonly the watt per square metre per nanometre (). The CGS unit erg per square centimeter per second () is often used in astronomy. Radiosity is often called Gan, Guohui, Numerical Method for a Full Assessment of Indoor Thermal Confort, Indoor Air Journal, 1994,4:154-158 in branches of physics other than radiometry, but in radiometry this usage leads to confusion with radiant intensity. Mathematical definitions Radiosity Radiosity of a surface, denoted Je (\\"e\\" for \\"energetic\\", to avoid confusion with photometric quantities), is defined as :J_\\\\mathrm{e} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi_\\\\mathrm{e}}{\\\\partial A} = J_\\\\mathrm{e,em} + J_\\\\mathrm{e,r} + J_\\\\mathrm{e,tr}, where *∂ is the partial derivative symbol; *Φe is the radiant flux leaving (emitted, reflected and transmitted); *A is the area; *Je,em = Me is the emitted component of the radiosity of the surface, that is to say its exitance; *Je,r is the reflected component of the radiosity of the surface; *Je,tr is the transmitted component of the radiosity of the surface. For an opaque surface, the transmitted component of radiosity Je,tr vanishes and only two components remain: :J_\\\\mathrm{e} = M_\\\\mathrm{e} + J_\\\\mathrm{e,r}. In heat transfer, combining these two factors into one radiosity term helps in determining the net energy exchange between multiple surfaces. Spectral radiosity Spectral radiosity in frequency of a surface, denoted Je,ν, is defined as :J_{\\\\mathrm{e}, u} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial J_\\\\mathrm{e}}{\\\\partial u}, where ν is the frequency. Spectral radiosity in wavelength of a surface, denoted Je,λ, is defined as :J_{\\\\mathrm{e},\\\\lambda} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial J_\\\\mathrm{e}}{\\\\partial \\\\lambda}, where λ is the wavelength. Radiosity method The two radiosity components of an opaque surface. The radiosity of an opaque, gray and diffuse surface is given by :J_\\\\mathrm{e} = M_\\\\mathrm{e} + J_\\\\mathrm{e,r} = \\\\varepsilon \\\\sigma T^4 + (1 - \\\\varepsilon) E_\\\\mathrm{e}, where *ε is the emissivity of that surface; *σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant; *T is the temperature of that surface; *Ee is the irradiance of that surface. Normally, Ee is the unknown variable and will depend on the surrounding surfaces. So, if some surface i is being hit by radiation from some other surface j, then the radiation energy incident on surface i is Ee,ji Ai = Fji Aj Je,j where Fji is the view factor or shape factor, from surface j to surface i. So, the irradiance of surface i is the sum of radiation energy from all other surfaces per unit surface of area Ai: :E_{\\\\mathrm{e},i} = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{j = 1}^N F_{ji}A_j J_{\\\\mathrm{e},j}}{A_i}. Now, employing the reciprocity relation for view factors Fji Aj = Fij Ai, :E_{\\\\mathrm{e},i} = \\\\sum_{j = 1}^N F_{ij} J_{\\\\mathrm{e},j}, and substituting the irradiance into the equation for radiosity, produces :J_{\\\\mathrm{e},i} = \\\\varepsilon_i \\\\sigma T_i^4 + (1 - \\\\varepsilon_i)\\\\sum_{j = 1}^N F_{ij} J_{\\\\mathrm{e},j}. For an N surface enclosure, this summation for each surface will generate N linear equations with N unknown radiosities,E.M. Sparrow and R.D. Cess. Radiation Heat Transfer. Hemisphere Publishing Corporation, 1978. and N unknown temperatures. For an enclosure with only a few surfaces, this can be done by hand. But, for a room with many surfaces, linear algebra and a computer are necessary. Once the radiosities have been calculated, the net heat transfer at a surface can be determined by finding the difference between the incoming and outgoing energy: :\\\\dot Q_i = A_i(J_{\\\\mathrm{e},i} - E_{\\\\mathrm{e},i}). Using the equation for radiosity Je,i = εiσTi4 \\\\+ (1 − εi)Ee,i, the irradiance can be eliminated from the above to obtain :\\\\dot Q_i = \\\\frac{A_i \\\\varepsilon_i}{1 - \\\\varepsilon_i}(\\\\sigma T_i^4 - J_{\\\\mathrm{e},i}) = \\\\frac{A_i \\\\varepsilon_i}{1 - \\\\varepsilon_i}(M_{\\\\mathrm{e},i}^\\\\circ - J_{\\\\mathrm{e},i}), where Me,i° is the exitance of a black body. Circuit analogy For an enclosure consisting of only a few surfaces, it is often easier to represent the system with an analogous circuit rather than solve the set of linear radiosity equations. To do this, the heat transfer at each surface is expressed as :\\\\dot{Q_i} = \\\\frac{M_{\\\\mathrm{e},i}^\\\\circ - J_{\\\\mathrm{e},i}}{R_i}, where Ri = (1 − εi)/(Aiεi) is the resistance of the surface. Likewise, Me,i° − Je,i is the blackbody exitance minus the radiosity and serves as the 'potential difference'. These quantities are formulated to resemble those from an electrical circuit V = IR. Now performing a similar analysis for the heat transfer from surface i to surface j, :\\\\dot Q_{ij} = A_i F_{ij} (J_{\\\\mathrm{e},i} - J_{\\\\mathrm{e},j}) = \\\\frac{J_{\\\\mathrm{e},i} - J_{\\\\mathrm{e},j}}{R_{ij}}, where Rij = 1/(Ai Fij). Because the above is between surfaces, Rij is the resistance of the space between the surfaces and Je,i − Je,j serves as the potential difference. Combining the surface elements and space elements, a circuit is formed. The heat transfer is found by using the appropriate potential difference and equivalent resistances, similar to the process used in analyzing electrical circuits. Other methods In the radiosity method and circuit analogy, several assumptions were made to simplify the model. The most significant is that the surface is a diffuse emitter. In such a case, the radiosity does not depend on the angle of incidence of reflecting radiation and this information is lost on a diffuse surface. In reality, however, the radiosity will have a specular component from the reflected radiation. So, the heat transfer between two surfaces relies on both the view factor and the angle of reflected radiation. It was also assumed that the surface is a gray body, that is to say its emissivity is independent of radiation frequency or wavelength. However, if the range of radiation spectrum is large, this will not be the case. In such an application, the radiosity must be calculated spectrally and then integrated over the range of radiation spectrum. Yet another assumption is that the surface is isothermal. If it is not, then the radiosity will vary as a function of position along the surface. However, this problem is solved by simply subdividing the surface into smaller elements until the desired accuracy is obtained.

The brigade was activated using the assets of the 2nd Brigade, 87th Division. The brigade is a subordinate unit of U.S. First Army. History The brigade was constituted as Headquarters, 158th Infantry Brigade on 5 August 1917 in the National Army and assigned to the 79th Infantry Division. The unit organized at Camp Meade, Maryland on 25 August 1917. The brigade deployed to Europe and fought in World War I where it received battle streamers for participation in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive and Lorraine 1918 campaigns. After the war the brigade demobilized at Camp Dix, New Jersey, reconstituted in the Organized Reserves and assigned to the 79th Division. The brigade converted and redesignated on 12 February 1942 as 3rd Platoon, 79th Reconnaissance Troop, 79th Division and was ordered to active military service on 15 June 1942. The unit reorganized at Camp Pickett, Virginia and again deployed to Europe where it participated in Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace and Central Europe Campaigns. For actions during the war the unit received the French Croix de Guerre with Palm, with streamers embroidered PARROY FOREST and NORMANDY TO PARIS, as well as the French Croix de Guerre, Fourragere. The unit inactivated 11 December 1945 at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey. The unit was converted and redesignated on 5 November 1962 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 158th Infantry Brigade while in inactive status. It was reactivated on 2 October 1997 and posted to Patrick Air Force Base, Florida. In 1999, the brigade was redesignated as 2nd Brigade, 87th Division (Training Support).

He is best known for the story of his affair with Francesca da Polenta, portrayed by Dante in a famous episode of his Inferno (Canto V). He was the brother of Giovanni (Gianciotto) and Malatestino Malatesta. Life Paolo's birth can be placed around 1246 in Verucchio. He was the third-born son of Malatesta da Verucchio (Dante's \\"Mastin Vecchio\\") and his first wife Concordia dei Pandolfini. His family gave rise to the Malatesta lords of Rimini. He was the progenitor of the Malatesta di Ghiaggiolo (or Giaggiolo) branch in the Forlì Apennines. He had three brothers: Giovanni (called Gianciotto), Malatestino and Maddalena. He was called \\"il Bello\\" for his physical prowess, as opposed to Gianciotto's unattractiveness. In 1269 Paolo married Orabile Beatrice, the last heir of the counts of Ghiaggiolo, a fief located in the Forlì Apennines, which remained without male heirs. The county also included Cusercoli, Valdoppio, and Particeto. The House of Ghiaggiolo was allied with the Montefeltro family, both Ghibellines and antagonists of the Guelph House of Malatesta. The wedding was a diplomatic success by Malatesta da Verucchio who aspired to possess the territories of the Ghiaggiolo family. They had two children: Uberto II, who bore the noble title, and Margherita, future bride of Aghinolfo Guidi di Romena. Paolo was thus the progenitor of the Malatesta di Ghiaggiolo line which became extinct in 1757 with Lamberto. The union was not happy, however, as the young man's feelings were for his sister-in-law Francesca da Polenta, wife of his brother Giovanni, who had aroused keen interest in him since their first meeting when she thought she had to marry Paolo and not Gianciotto. In fact, at the proxy marriage, celebrated in Ravenna, Paolo represented Gianciotto. Traditionally Paolo has been portrayed as a romantic, beautiful figure, not very inclined to aspirations for power, instead focused on culture and the pleasures of life. Recent investigations, however, reveal him as a young man very attentive to politics and immersed in the political intrigue of the time, capable of separating political life from sentimental life, however legendary, turbulent and passionate. Paolo followed his father in war against the Ghibellines. In 1265 he fought against Guido da Montefeltro with Malatesta and, in the same year, he faced the Traversari with Guido da Polenta of Ravenna. His diplomatic skills led him to be chosen by Pope Martin IV as Captain of the People in Florence in March 1282. It was probably here that Dante Alighieri had the opportunity to meet him. With the return to Rimini, his promising career was interrupted by his tragic death. Paolo was killed by his brother Gianciotto together with his wife, Francesca. The murders probably occurred between February 1283 (the date of Paolo's return to Rimini) and 1284, when the two lovers were surprised together by Gianciotto himself. The traditional place where the assassination took place would have been the Gradara castle. The story is told in a memorable passage from of Dante's Inferno ( Canto V ). Dante inserted the episode in homage to Paolo whom he had known in his youth in Florence; many years later, long since in exile, he was called to Ravenna by Francesca's father and got to know the historical site of the story recounted by him years before. In the fortress of Gradara a tomb was found that belonged to a noble lady, however nothing was found in regards to the tomb of Paolo that his brother would have well hidden, because it would have been tangible proof of the betrayal of his wife and of the murders, especially in view of his second marriage. Forty years later, around 1323, Paolo's son, Ramberto, claimed to have avenged his father's death by murdering Gianciotto's son and successor, Uberto, Count of Giaggolo at a banquet in his home.

History The first travel documents for overseas travel by Japanese citizens were introduced in 1866, near the end of the Tokugawa shogunate. These documents took the form of a stamped \\"letter of request\\" allowing Japanese citizens to travel overseas for business and educational purposes. The term \\"passport\\" was formally introduced into the Japanese language in 1878, and in 1900 the first regulations governing the usage of Japanese passports were introduced. The modern form of the Japanese passport first came about in 1926, and the first ICAO-compliant, machine-readable Japanese passports were introduced in 1992. Types of passports * Ordinary passport: Issued to normal Japanese citizens. ** Ordinary passports are issued in two different lengths of validity: 5 and 10 years. Japanese citizens up to 19 years of age can only be issued a 5 years passport, while those who are 20 years of age or older can choose either a 5 years (blue) or 10 years (red) passport for different registration fees. * Official passport: Issued to members of the National Diet and public servants. * Diplomatic passport: Issued to members of the Imperial Family, diplomats and their family members, and high-level government officials. ** By convention, the Emperor and Empress of Japan do not hold a passport. * Emergency passport: Issued to overseas Japanese nationals when machine-readable passports are unable to be issued by a diplomatic mission of Japan due to a malfunction and there is no time to wait for the passport to be issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, or to overseas Japanese nationals who failed to be issued a Travel Document for Return to Japan, valid for 1 year from date of issuance. ** Travel Document for Return to Japan (ja): Emergency single-use travel document issued to overseas Japanese nationals to return to Japan, features a white cover with the Paulownia Government Seal of Japan. Invalidated immediately after use. All Japanese passports issued after 20 March 2006 are biometric passports. Japanese passports have the Chrysanthemum Imperial Seal of Japan inscribed in the centre of the front cover, with the Japanese characters reading Nipponkoku Ryoken (日本国旅券) inscribed above in seal script and its English translation JAPAN PASSPORT in Latin letters below the Seal. Ordinary passports valid for five years feature dark blue covers, and those valid for ten years feature crimson-coloured covers. Additionally, official passports feature dark green covers, and diplomatic passports feature dark brown covers.

Passport note The passports contain a note from the issuing country that is addressed to the authorities of all other countries, identifying the bearer as a citizen of that country and requesting that he or she be allowed to pass and be treated according to international norms. The note inside of Japanese passports states: In Japanese: ::日本国民である本旅券の所持人を通路故障なく旅行させ、かつ、同人に必要な保護扶助を与えられるよう、関係の諸官に要請する。 In English: ::The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan requests all those whom it may concern to allow the bearer, a Japanese national, to pass freely and without hindrance and, in case of need, to afford him or her every possible aid and protection. Language Japanese passports are entirely printed in both Japanese and English, except for the note of caution that is found at the end of the passport (e.g. on page 51 of the ten-year biometric ordinary passport), which is only printed in Japanese. This note contains information about what the bearer should know when encountering various situations in a foreign country. The surname, given name and other personalised mentions (like registered domicile) are only indicated in Latin uppercase letters. Japanese names are in principle transcribed according to the Hepburn romanisation system, but exceptions are admitted in certain cases, notably when the name is the katakana transcription of a foreign name (Japanese spouse or Japanese child of a foreigner), in which case the original spelling of the name in the Latin alphabet may be used, only if you submit the official document with the original spelling issued by the government (spouse or parent's passport etc.). The signature may be written in any language and in any spelling the individual desires. Visa requirements Countries and territories with visa- free entries or visas on arrival for holders of regular Japanese passports Visa requirements for Japanese citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states which are placed on citizens of Japan. As of 3 April 2019, Japanese citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 191 countries and territories, ranking the Japanese passport the strongest passport in the world in terms of travel freedom according to the Henley Passport Index. However, suspension of visa waivers and travel restrictions toward Japanese passport holders since January 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak puts this fact into doubt. As of October 2018, the passports of Japan, Brunei, Singapore and San Marino are the only ones to allow either visa-free entry or electronic travel authorisation to the world's four largest economies, namely China, India, the European Union and the United States.

It was the last of six train ferries to begin operations across the Rhine in Germany and the second to last to close.  Construction of the railway After the take over of the Bonn–Cologne Railway Company () by the Rhenish Railway Company (Rheinische Eisenbahngesellschaft, RhE) on 1 January 1857, it built the left Rhine railway in sections to Bingerbrück. With the opening of the last section on 15 December 1859, it connected to the Hessian Ludwig Railway to South Germany. In 1864, it built the Pfaffendorfer Rhine bridge below the Ehrenbreitstein Fortress and the bridge over the Lahn at Oberlahnstein to connect with the Nassau Rhine Railway (Nassauische Rheinbahn) of the Nassau State Railway (Nassauische Staatsbahn) at Niederlahnstein, completed on 3 June 1864, creating a second railway next to the Rhine from the Rhineland to southern Germany, now known as the Left Rhine line. The Prussian Government encouraged the Rhenish Railway to extend the right bank railway from Niederlahnstein to Oberkassel (opposite Bonn and Troisdorf). The company was also given a concession to connect the new line with the left Rhine railway with Bonn by means of a train ferry.  Construction of the train ferry The building of the train ferry began immediately. The right bank railway was extended north to Neuwied in 1869 and on 27 October 1869 to Oberkassel and the train ferry wharf. A locomotive pulls a six-car passenger train off ferry in Bonn The train ferry was similar to the two established train ferries of the Rhenish Railway, between Spyck and Welle (near Emmerich and Kleve) and between Rheinhausen and Hochfeld (in Duisburg), which went into service in 1865 and 1866 respectively. The Bonn–Oberkassel ferries similarly crossed the river using their own engines, guided by two wire cables, although they operated at an angle of 45° against the river toward Oberkassel. The three routes were finished in 1868, 1870 and 1873. The ramps from the riverbank stations to the water were inclined at 1:38. The three ferry pontoons on each side were 70 meters long and 9.5 m wide. Each could carry as many as ten freight wagons, seven passenger carriages or one locomotive. The train ferry line turned to the left after Oberkassel station to reach the bank. On the Bonn side, the Bonn train ferry station was near the bank and it still served industry there until the Second World War. The line reached the main line near Kessenich and from 1870 had its own track into Bonn Hauptbahnhof. Part of this track still exists, but it is no longer fit for operations; it lies beside the Bad Godesberg-Bonn railway near Bereich Straßburger Weg and Kaiserstraße for a short section before the Hauptbahnhof. Ferry \\"Sieg\\" near the Oberkassel bank, in the background are the Siebengebirge mountains  Train ferry traffic In the opening year the timetable included, in addition to freight trains, six daily passenger trains from Niederlahnstein to Bonn. The crossing took about 20 minutes, including the push on to the ferry, uncoupling, crossing, coupling and the pull from the ferry. Traffic levels carried on the ferry for selected years are set out below: 1871: 45,280 wagons and 132 locomotives 1873: 93,107 wagons and 274 locomotives 1879: 47,841 wagons and 39 locomotives  End of the train ferry Train ferry operations stopped temporarily with the beginning of World War I and permanently from 1 January 1919. The ferry wharves in Bonn were demolished in the same year and the line was lifted between the Bonn riverside and the goods station. A shipyard was built on the Oberkassel bank, which used the former train ferry track to connect to the mainline.

History and variations  Kasuzuke was made in the Kansai region as early as the Nara period, twelve hundred years ago. Vegetable kasuzuke, known as shiru- kasu-zuke or Narazuke was originally made with white melon, but later with cucumbers, eggplants, uri, and pickling melons. It was made by Buddhist monks, and used by samurai as imperishable wartime food. During the Edo period of the 17th century, a sake dealer promoted it widely. The dish spread throughout Japan and remains popular today. Carrots, watermelon rind, and ginger may also be pickled in this way. To make shiru-kasu-zuke vegetables are pickled in a mixture of sake-kasu (in paste or sheet form), mirin, sugar, and salt. Optionally, ginger and citrus may be added. Pickling time ranges from one to three years, with the younger pickles consumed locally in the summer and the older pickles, having turned an amber color, distributed as Narazuke. To make fish kasuzuke, sugar is sometimes omitted, and sake, soy sauce, pepper and/or ginger may be added. Typical fish include cod, salmon, butterfish, and tai snapper. Brining time is one to several days. Vegetable kasuzuke is eaten as pickles, and is sweet and mild. Fish kasuzuke may be eaten raw or grilled over rice. The flavor is mild but pungent.
