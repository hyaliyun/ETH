It is located at a distance of circa 220 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 765 is about 195,000 light years across. It was discovered by Albert Marth on October 8, 1864. The galaxy has an extensive hydrogen (HI) disk with low surface brightness, whose diameter is estimated to be 240 kpc (780,000 light years).  Characteristics  The morphological classification of NGC 765 in the De Vaucouleurs system is SAB(rs)bc, where the 'SAB' denotes a weak-barred spiral, '(rs)' indicates a spiral structure which lies between that of a ring and a non-ring galaxy, and 'bc' means the spiral arms are intermediately wound. NGC 765 has at least three spiral arms, that can be traced up to a radius of 50 kpc. It has been identified to be a Low Surface Brightness galaxy with a prominent bulge. Emission by low ionisation elements, with strong [N II] and [S II] lines, as well as [O I], has been detected at the nuclear region of the galaxy indicating the presence of an active galactic nucleus. The nucleus also emits X-ray, which were detected by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. The X-ray flux in 0.2 - 10 KeV is estimated to be erg/s, which is comparable to some low luminosity active galactic nuclei, like LINERs. Diffuse X-ray emission from the galactic bulge has been attributed to the presence of gas. NGC 765 holds a large amount of hydrogen gas [HI], which has been estimated to be based on the observed HI emission by the Very Large Array and the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope wide-field survey. This mass is about an order of magnitude over the hydrogen mass observed in other low surface brightness galaxies, and also three times more than the mean mass of hydrogen in spiral galaxies. The HI mass-to-luminosity ratio for NGC 765 is MH I/LB‚àº 1.6. The mass of HI in the galaxy means it is categorised as a massive low surface brightness galaxy. The HI is distributed on a large disk, which measures 240 kpc across. This is the largest observed disk in the nearby universe and it is a similar size to the disk of Malin 1. This disk appears asymmetric, with the east side showing a rapid decline in column density between 100 and 120 kpc, while the decline in the west side is smoother. Inside the disk are observed regions with higher brightness. They are compact, measuring less than 10kpc across and have a mass similar to that of dwarf irregular galaxies, and they hold about 10% of the galactic HI. It has been suggested that these clumps of HI are the remnants of accreted galaxies.  Nearby galaxies  Two satellite galaxies have been detected; UGC 1453, an irregular galaxy which lies to the south, and NGC 765A, which was first detected in HI towards the north-east and has a faint visual counterpart. UGC 1453 is located 14.8 arcminutes from NGC 765, which corresponds to a projected distance of 310 kpc, and NGC 765A lies 16.5 arcminutes away, at a projected distance of 338 kpc. NGC 765 is a member of the galaxy group known as LGG 41. Other members of the group include NGC 776, IC 187, IC 188, UGC 1451, and UGC 1479. The group is part of the Perseus- Pisces Supercluster.

It was commissioned by cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich and the National Symphony Orchestra of Washington, who together gave its first performance in Moscow on 25 September 1993. The symphony is scored for an orchestra of: 3 flutes (nos. 2 and 3 doubling piccolo), 3 oboes (no. 3 doubling cor anglais), 4 clarinets (no. 3 doubling bass clarinet, no. 4 doubling clarinet in E), 3 bassoons (no. 3 doubling contrabassoon), 4 horns, 4 trumpets, 4 trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion (2 players), harp, piano, and strings. The movements are as follows: #Allegro moderato #Presto #Adagio ‚Äì attacca ‚Äì #Allegro vivace The playing time is approximately 35 minutes. The composition of the symphony coincided with Schnittke's work on the orchestration of the first two acts of his opera Historia von D. Johann Fausten. Hence there are similarities between the instrumentation and thematic material of both. Following performances in the United States in 1994 Schnittke made changes to the score, reducing the number of silent bars and making minor alterations to the orchestration.Ronald Weitzman (1995) Liner note from the BIS recording The first movement opens with a built up chord which shatters into fragments from which themes on viola and then on trombones emerge, the latter stating a chorale-like theme reminiscent of Bruckner. The fragments gradually come together before collapsing again. Stabbing motifs intervene which become more agitated until the opening chord returns to bring the movement to a close. The second movement is effectively a scherzo. Beginning with echoes of the stabbing motif from the first movement it features prominent roles for the four trumpets and contains references to Shostakovich's fourth and sixth symphonies. The Adagio is based on a 12 note tone row, first heard on the strings, whose harmony consists in permutations of itself. The bass clarinet, supported by two bassoons, picks out four notes from the tone row in a reference to the overture to Wagner's Tristan and Isolde. As the movement comes to a conclusion one of the more sombre permutations of the tone row becomes prominent and the movement concludes in an atmosphere of pathos. The final movement continues on from the third without a break (i.e. attacca). As with other pieces by Schnittke (for instance the fourth violin concerto) the finale draws upon the previous three movements for much of its material. It begins with a persistent four note motif to which previous themes, less fragmented than previously, are joined suggesting the unity of the symphony as a whole. The stabbing motif from the second movement returns. It is joined by a more urgent version of the four note motif from the beginning of the finale, together driving the music towards a climax in which the themes again shatter into fragments from which the tolling of a bell emerges to end the symphony.

Biography Carl Krull was born on the island of √Ür√∏ (Denmark) in 1975, to artist parents Maria Struzik-Krull and Hans Oldau Krull. Krull studied at the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts (Poland) and San Carlos Academy of Fine Arts, graduating with a Master of Fine Arts degree in 1999. He was selected as a 2007 Artist-in- residence at Art Studio Itsukaichi (Japan). Career Carl Krull's artistic style has been described as seismic or seismographic, referring to the sculptural drawing and painting approach that he developed. The approach is characterized by a topographical way of perceiving figures and space; rather than using contours to outline his subjects, Krull employs an abundance of lines to create the effect of the subject protruding from the two-dimensional surface of the paper or screen. Krull developed the method during a road trip through the United States, drawing continuous lines on a paper tube while acting as a human seismograph, allowing bumps in the road to create irregularities in the contoured lines he was drawing. Through experimentation, he evolved the method from black and white car scrolls to color, and incorporated diverse methods that include photography, drawing, painting, printmaking, large scale sculptures, and murals.

Wilkins is a Canadian economist currently serving as Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada. Wilkins was appointed to the position of Senior Deputy Governor on May 2, 2014, and will serve a term of seven years. Wilkins is also a member of the Bank of Canada's Board of Directors. Wilkins is the first woman to hold the position of Senior Deputy Governor, and is the second-highest ranking official at the Bank under the Governor of the Bank of Canada.  Early life and education  Wilkins was raised in Selwyn, Ontario. In 1987 she earned a BA in Economics from Wilfrid Laurier University. While at Laurier, WIlkins worked at the school pub and for Pierre Siklos, a professor in the School of Business and Economics. She spent two semesters as a co-op student working at the Ontario Ministry of Treasury and Economics and another working in marketing at IBM. In 1988 she earned a MA in Economics from Western University in London, Ontario.  Career  Prior to joining the Bank, Wilkins worked at both the Department of Finance Canada and the Privy Council Office, under the governments of Brian Mulroney, Kim Campbell and Jean Chr√©tien. The roles she held in these institutions were senior analytical roles that involved economic forecasting and fiscal policy development.  The Bank of Canada  Carolyn Wilkins joined the Bank of Canada in 2001, starting out in the monetary and financial modelling division of the former Monetary and Financial Analysis Department. From March 2005 to March 2010, she held the position of Deputy Chief of the Financial Market Department. In this position she led the development and implementation of extraordinary liquidity tools and collateral policy used during the 2008 financial crisis. From April 2010 to October 2011, she held the position of Special Director of Over-the-counter Derivatives Market Initiatives. From November 2011 to August 2013, she held the position of Chief of the Financial Stability Department, leading the Bank's research and analysis regarding issues in the Canadian and International financial sectors, including the assessment of risks to financial system stability, and oversight of systemically important payment, clearing and settlement systems, under the Payment, Clearing and Settlement Act. From August 2013 up to her appointment as Senior Deputy Governor, Wilkins was Advisor to the Governor, with a focus on the Canadian economy with regards to the financial system, and monetary policy.  Senior Deputy Governor  As the Senior Deputy Governor, Wilkins is in charge of the Bank of Canada's strategic planning and economic and financial research. The Senior Deputy Governor is a member of the Governing Council, who set the interest rate, and in this role shares the duty and responsibility of making decisions regarding monetary policy and financial system stability. In her role she acts under the guiding principles of the Bank of Canada which as defined by the Department of Finance Canada are: to set monetary policy with the intention of keeping inflation low and stable to maintain economic growth and living standards; to work with other governmental agencies and market actors to maintain the financial system; to design, produce, and distribute Canada's bank notes; and to have responsibilities regarding the management of public funds as the fiscal agent of the Government of Canada. On her appointment to the role of Senior Deputy Governor, The Minister of Finance Joe Oliver said that \\"Carolyn Wilkins has a distinguished career in public service, and her experience in fiscal and monetary policy making, and knowledge of financial markets is extensive.\\" As the Senior Deputy Governor, Wilkins oversees the Bank's analysis of international economic developments relating to monetary policy decisions. She is also a member of the Bank's Board of Directors. As Senior Deputy Governor, Wilkins is the Bank's G20 and G7 Deputy. Wilkins is also a member of the IMF's High Level Advisory Group on FinTech. She represented Canada on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and co-chaired the BCBS Working Group on Liquidity.  Viewpoints  Wilkins is quoted in the Financial Post saying that: \\"Economics is the greatest social science because it's got this disciplined framework and logic and mathematics, but at the same time it's all about people...at the end of the day it's about how policies or situations will change the economic realities of everybody on the street out there - and you and I.\\" As Senior Deputy Governor, Wilson often speaks on behalf of the Bank of Canada and communicates their stance on monetary policy and other economic issues. In a talk given at the McGill University Max Bell School of Public Policy Wilkins in November 2018, Wilkins addressed pursuing the best monetary policy framework for Canada. She spoke to the current policy framework, and the Bank's the focus on targeting low and stable inflation, in the context of a flexible exchange rate, which is a formalized agreement with the federal government under the inflation control agreement. Regarding the monetary policy framework she said that, \\"The framework needs to focus only on objectives that monetary policy can actually achieve,\\" these being that it is only able to affect prices in the long-run, and cannot resolve underlying structural issues such as job quality. Because of this, the Bank of Canada's monetary policy should focus on shorter-term stabilization objectives that address cyclical issues, meaning objectives that smooth the business cycle. Regarding the framework Wilkins said that: > We need to keep it simple: focus on clear objectives that monetary policy > can actually achieve, and assess how it affects people...We will need to > improve our methods to account for considerations such as distributional > effects and financial stability. We must also ensure that the right > supporting policy tools and measures are available in extraordinary > circumstances. Wilkins has also advocated for the necessity of diversity in developing monetary policy. An article by the Financial Post, quotes Wilkins saying on a panel discussion during the G7 Women's Forum in Toronto: \\"We're doing projects where we actually require that diversity of thought...Whether we're thinking about digitization, whether we're thinking about crypto assets, what the new economy is going to look like. We need that diversity.\\" She said in the talk that diversity needs to be factored into the consideration of the Bank's framework of the prescience of the issue, with the levels of inequality in society rising, creating greater concern as inequality leads to volatile economic growth, and less trust in institutions. Wilkins also spoke in regards to inequality at the G7 Symposium on Innovation and Inclusive Growth in Montebello, Quebec in February 2018 , referring to the effect of technological advances on the economy. She said in the talk that though technological innovation is key to economic growth, it has also left many behind, and that mainstream macro-economists are factoring how income distribution may affect long-term growth and macro dynamics. Wilkins said at the Symposium that central bankers do not have the mandate or tools to address this disparity by influencing the pace of technological process or income distribution, but that they have to support strong and sustainable growth, and be an advisor to analyze the tradeoffs that come with technological advancement. She suggests focusing on the development of skilled works, and keeping market power in check as two ways to address this issue. On developing skilled workers, she says, this will require reducing barriers to participation in the workforce, such as gender discrimination in the STEM fields. Keeping the market power of the tech industry in check, she says, is also important due to the potential concerns from monopoly power on prices and competition, such as lowering innovation and preventing more-inclusive growth. In regards to financial technology, Wilkins has written and spoken often about how financial technology, such as cryptocurrencies and the digitization of the economy, should be considered in regard to the Bank's monetary policy, as technological change has a profound effect on the economy. She writes that understanding the relation between technological change and the economy is essential for monetary policy because it \\"appears to be changing the relationship between unemployment and inflation.\\" In a conference address to the Rotman School of Management in March 2018, Wilkins said of cryptocurrency that she does not regard these products as currency because, \\"they do not perform any of the key functions of money.\\" She said that they are concerning because they could have financial stability implications, relating to investor protection, market integrity and the use of crypto assets for illegal activities. Considering that crypto currencies are unregulated, they present financial risk, and so Wilkins suggested at the conference that international authorities should work together to build a set of policies that govern crypto assets. Outlining these issues she said: > My bottom line here is that we need a sharpened focus on consumer and > investor protection, and market integrity. These are foundational elements > of a sound financial system because they support trust.

In 1985, he killed 6 people: five women, one of whom was pregnant, and a teenager girl, all in Leninsk-Kuznetsky. He was eventually sentenced to death and executed for his crimes.  Biography   Early years  The exact date and birthplace of Shcherbakov is unknown. In 1985, he was 23 years of age, and his mother worked at a factory. As a child, Sergey was a quiet and inconspicuous boy. After graduating from the 8th grade at school, he entered a vocational school and afterwards drafted into the army, where he stole ammunition. Shcherbakov was in love with a girl, but she decided not to wait for him to return from the army and instead married another man. Angered, Sergey motivated his future murders with this. When demobilized, Shcherbakov moved to the private sector of Leninsk-Kuzntesky, working as an underground electrician at the Yaroslavsky mine. He married a divorced pregnant woman named Irina, whose former husband was a prisoner. Shcherbakov, jealous from his wife's past, systematically beat and tortured her. Despite this, Irina gave birth to a child from her ex-husband. Annoyed, he eventually lost interest in Irina and began roaming the streets, beating passers-by and stealing hats. Sergey's wife thought he had a mistress, and wanted to make a love spell so that her husband would lose interest in women.  Murders  Shcherbakov soon really lost sexual arrest in surrounding women. In 1985, he committed a series of murders. The maniac attacked the victims mainly in the dark, killing them with blows from a hammer (in one case, he also used a wire to strangle, in others he stabbed the victim, but she survived). Shcherbakov wore a hammer in his trouser pocket or carried it in a pram (in this case, the killer told his wife that he was transporting building materials for an extension of the house). He initially did not rape his victims, but then began doing it. In the mid-1980s, the Leninsk-Kuznetsky private sector was very poorly lit, which made it easier for the criminal to commit his attacks. Shcherbakov committed the first murder on May 7, in the area of School No. 10. The victim was 27-year-old pregnant woman Tatiana Berdyugina. She was in the pathology department of the local hospital for the preservation of her fetus, but was released for the May holidays. At the murder scene, only a matchbox with a spot of blood was found. After the murder of Berdyugina, reinforced police patrols took the streets of Leninsk- Kuznetsky. Night raids were organized, with law enforcement officers acting as bait for the criminal. A tailor's wife named Vera Chulyukova became Shcherbakov's second victim. The murderer assassinated the victim a few meters from her house, hitting her on the head several times with a hammer. He also took 10 rubles and personal items from Vera, including two bags. The victim regained consciousness, however, this was noticed by the maniac who was planning on leaving the scene, instead returning and finishing the job. When the ambulance took Chulyakova, she was still alive, but died the following week. The victim left behind a young daughter. Elena Korshunova, who lived nearby, had witnessed the murder. She heard a scream coming from Chulyakova's house and looked out of the window. Thanks to the street light and shadows, she noticed on the wall of the neighboring house, lit by a lantern, a figure hitting another one on the head with a hammer, then dragging it on the ground. The investigation suggested that the murders were committed by one person. There were a lot of rumors about the motive for the crimes: there was a common opinion among schoolchildren that the maniac chose victims as a result of a card party, others claimed that he killed people based on certain grounds - those who stand last in the line, buying movie tickets to a certain place or wearing rings. All these rumors reached the investigators. Once at a bus stop, two women, talking about the killer, were arguing over who he was and where he worked: at a slaughterhouse or as an orderly at a morgue. Traumatologist Toropov was present at the stop and intervened in the conversation by saying: \\"Do you not get tired of telling me bad things?\\" (According to another version, Toropov was riding in a bus and joked about being involved in the killings). The arguing women went away, but one of them remembered some of Toropov's features, which resulted in his arrest the next day. A version was worked out that Toropov was killing people from professional interest, but investigators established his innocence. However, the doctor had to leave Leninsk-Kuznetsky, because it was rumored that he had bought off justice. There were some further rumors about the offender's identity: it was told that a criminal gang commits the murders, or the murderer is either a man nicknamed \\"Frenchman\\", or his brother, or a bald man wearing a wig and fake moustache. The third victim of Shcherbakov was Nadezhda Medvedeva, who worked the night shift. Soon after this, a resident of the city went the police station, claiming that he had found a human head in a garbage can. Arriving police found out that it was a dummy. On July 15, Shcherbakov attacked and stabbed Tatyana Galkina, but the victim managed to escape from the maniac. Doctors managed to save her life. On the same day, he committed the fourth murder in the Gorky Park, killing 15-year-old Vera Kolesnikova. The maniac first raped the victim before killing her, and then strangled the girl with a handkerchief, stolen from one of the previous victims. On July 20, Shcherbakov himself called the police, saying that he had found the body. The traces found at the crime scene indicated that the killer, having made the attack, had left something on the ground (it later turned out to be a tent). Panic broke out in Leninsk-Kuznetsky. Employees of enterprises refused to go into the evening shift, and internal trops were alerted. Police officers traveled to the enterprises, calling for reporting on every suspicious case. Many other crimes were disclosed. A theory that the maniac was a foreigner was discussed, but without any result. The maniac's fifth victim became Ekaterina Lizunova. Shcherbakov entered the construction trailer in which she worked, raping and then killing the woman. This time, the crime was committed during the day. In addition to the traumatic brain injury, there were traces of suffocation on the victim's body. There was a witness who saw a young man enter the trailer. From a distance, the witness could not examine the killer in detail, but the investigators realized that the maniac was changing tactics. The case began to consider the regional committee of the party and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. After Lizunova's murder, the maniac attacked a mine worker, but her overalls saved her life. The woman managed to scratch the attacker's face, and part of the maniac's blood remained under her nails, which allowed the investigators to find out his blood type. Another victim of the attacker threw a bag on Shcherbakov. He stumbled and fell, letting the victim get away. In a conversation with the police, she said outwardly that her attacker was \\"handsome\\". Witnesses of the attacks reported seeing a man with a pram near the crime scene. On September 21, the maniac committed his sixth and final murder. The victim was Elena Muratova. She was returning from the disco with her friend, and at that moment Shcherbakov went after the girls, who suggested that he take Muratova home, saying that she could become the killer's next victim. She refused, but Shcherbakov continued to follow them. When the girls parted, the killer struck Muratova 40 times to the head with a hammer and stole her gold watch. Gauze bags of chemical protection were found at the crime scene. While committing the murders, Sergey Shcherbakov presented himself as an exemplary family man in order to ward off suspicion from himself. He met his wife from work, saying that he was afraid that some would attack her, but would later leave the house searching for victims.  Arrest, trial and execution  A riot was brewing in Leninsk-Kuznetsky, with even the city prosecutor resigning. Then suddenly, Elena Muratova's friend told the deputy chief of the ATS from the executive committee, Stepan Krioni, that she knew what street the attacker lived on. Authorities started to observe the area. In the courtyard of Shcherbakov's house, the tent was discovered soaked in a barrel, which he had spread out before raping and killing Kolesnikova, and an old pram, with gauze bags laying on the ground. A gold watch stolen from the last victim was found in the outerwear pocket. Also noting Shcherbakov's recent scratch on the cheek, the police arrested him. During the subsequent search, stolen ammunition from the army and gold jewelry that belonged to the victims was located. During the investigative experiments, Shcherbakov confessed everything, saying that he felt pleasure talking about the attacks. However, then the offender's mother told him on a prison visit that his childhood friend Viktor Popov, who suffered from alcoholism, had hanged himself. After that, Shcherbakov changed his testimony, pinning all the crimes on Popov. It took two years to work out the accusation, with the investigators eventually being convinced of the deceased's innocence. During some of the crimes, Popov had had an alibi: he was outside Leninsk-Kuznetsky or was in a drunk tank. At trial, the maniac tried to obtain a mitigation of punishment, claiming that the girl who ditched him had broken his life. The Leninsk-Kuznetsky court sentenced Sergey Shcherbakov to death by firing squad, with confiscation of property. The convict appealed the verdict to the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, but he was denied a pardon. On September 26, 1988, in the Kemerovo Custody, the sentence was carried out. Despite this, there were rumors that Shcherbakov was not executed, but instead sent to work in the uranium mines.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. History The village of Grass Lake was founded In 1842, a by-product of the railroad line constructed through the area. In 1863, a school building was constructed for the village, located just south of this building. This was the only area school until the 1920s, when it was determined that more space was needed. The Detroit architectural firm of Lane, Davenport and Peterson was hired to design a new classroom building. Construction began in 1927, and was completed in 1929. The new building served the lower grades, while the 1863 building continued to serve as a high school. A new high school was constructed in the 1950s, and the older structure was demolished in 1960. The 1927 building was used as a school into the 1980s, when it was converted into apartments. Description The Old Michigan Avenue School is a two-story, flat-roofed, steel-frame masonry structure designed in a \\"Modern Eclectic\\" Classical Revival style. The main entrance is at the corner of the building, with wings extending in both directions to make an L-shaped footprint. The exterior of the building is clad with orange brick, sitting on a concrete basement. Projecting piers and pylons surround the main entrance. The facade is separated into bays by pilasters.

It was purchased by the Syracuse University Library on April 22, 1887, which outbid the Prussian government. The purchase dramatically increased the size of Syracuse University Library, making it the third largest library in New York state. The collection was described as \\"the finest collection of primary source materials ever assembled by one man for the study of western history\\".  Background   Leopold von Ranke  alt= Leopold von Ranke (21 December 1795 ‚Äì 23 May 1886) was a German historian and a founder of modern source- based history.Fritz Stern (ed.), The Varieties of History, Vintage, 1973, p. 54: \\"Leopold von Ranke (1795‚Äì1886) is the father as well as the master of modern historical scholarship.\\"Green and Troup (eds.), The Houses of History, p. 2: \\"Leopold von Ranke was instrumental in establishing professional standards for historical training at the University of Berlin between 1824 and 1871.\\" According to Caroline Hoefferle, \\"Ranke was probably the most important historian to shape [the] historical profession as it emerged in Europe and the United States in the late 19th century.\\" He was able to implement the seminar teaching method in his classroom and focused on archival research and analysis of historical documents. Building on the methods of the G√∂ttingen School of History, Ranke set the standards for much of later historical writing.  Syracuse University Library  Syracuse University had few books when classes began in 1871, and the library's collection was held in temporary housing. By 1875, the library still held only 2,300 items. Until 1888, the library would spend an average of $26 a year on purchasing items, and largely grew only due to donations.  Collection  Syracuse University von Ranke bookplate The collection consists of around 17,000 books, 4,000 pamphlets and 430 manuscripts. In 1984, it was valued at around $3 million (equivalent to $ million in ). It includes a first edition of Martin Luther's Table Talk, The Libellus of Telesphorus of Cosenza, a first edition copy of The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin (in French), Institutes of the Christian Religion, several volumes of Mercurius Gallobelgicus, a pamphlet written by Thomas M√ºntzer, Ludovico Antonio Muratori's ', Giovanni Domenico Mansi's Sacrorum conciliorum, the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, and extensive personal memoirs of Ranke. The collection has a large number of Venetian documents. Upon its purchase by Syracuse in 1887, The New York Times described the collection as \\"probably the rarest historical one ever owned by any one in the world\\".  History  In 1875, a wealthy cleric, John Morrison Reid, was convinced by Syracuse University librarian Charles W. Bennett of the necessity to purchase more books for the library. Reid soon donated $5,000 towards the purchase of additional books by the library. While on a trip to Europe, Bennett learned that the Ranke library would soon become available for purchase. He soon communicated his desire to Reid that the library purchase the collection when it was put up for sale. At least six university libraries, including Cornell, Harvard and Yale also considered purchasing the collection. When Ranke died in 1886, it was largely expected that the Prussian government would purchase the collection. Upon the purchase of the collection, the Chicago Tribune wrote: In an effort to secure the collection for Syracuse, Bennett contacted the oldest son of Ranke, Otto von Ranke. He gave Bennett first refusal if the Prussian government turned the library down. Leopold von Ranke's family requested that the collection was to remain in one place and they receive a fair price for it. In summer 1886, Bennett traveled to Germany to negotiate the purchase. After months of negotiating with the Prussians, who made unsatisfactory offers and proposed dividing the collection, in March 1887, Bennett informed the family that Syracuse University would respect their wishes if they made a decision within the next two weeks. The collection was successfully purchased for around $20,000, donated by Reid, and shipped in 83 crates weighing 19 tons. It arrived in March 1888, and construction began on a building to house the collection the following year. Work soon began to slow down as funding for the university as a whole slowly declined. Cataloging efforts were slow and inconsistent. In 1895, with the introduction of Dewey Decimal Classification, cataloging restarted. In 1937, the director of the library considered the collection \\"chiefly sentimental\\". By the 1950s, the collection was housed at the top of the Syracuse University Carnegie Library and was poorly maintained and cataloged. In the 1960s, professor James Powell began efforts to better maintain the collection. In 1977, the National Endowment for the Humanities granted the library $50,000 and matched an additional $50,000 raised from private sources for restoration of the collection. More than one hundred volumes of the Monumenta Germaniae Historica were donated by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. The library soon began working on \\"restoration, cataloging of the main collection and cataloging of the original manuscripts\\". Edward Muir was hired to catalog the manuscripts. In 1983, the complete manuscript catalog was published, and by 1984 the collection had been 80% cataloged.

He was known primarily for fiction but published two volumes of poetry as well as a number of plays. Biography Cagna was born in the northern Italian town of Vercelli. He attended a technical school but was expelled after which he began to work with his father as a contractor. He had a passion for literature and started to write in his early twenties. He was inspired by some influential friendships, such as that of Giuseppe Cesare Abba, Edmondo De Amicis and especially Giovanni Faldella. He visited Milan frequently where he met authors such as Medoro Savini and Antonio Ghislanzoni. His first project, Falene dell'amore e Un bel sogno (1871), was a sentimental story with moving and sometimes pathetic descriptions that emerged in the two stories. He wrote several narratives including Provincials (1886), Mountaineers ciabattoni (1888), The revenge of love (1891), and Contrada dei gatti (1924). With the publication of the Provincials, the Faldellian influence became clearer. In this book, the writer focused his attention on provincial life, characterized by the fresco of the urban context seen from its particular angle, expressed thanks to the taste of impressions and a colorful language embellished with lexical inventions sometimes tending to crudeness. Cagna was a member of the Scapigliatura society, an Italian version of Bohemianism. In his works the life of a certain petty-bourgeois world is vividly represented. From his friend Giovanni Faldella he derived a stylistic-linguistic research in an expressionistic key. What is considered his masterpiece: Alpinisti Ciabattoni, was reevaluated by Croce, Gobetti and Contini, above all for his linguistic innovations, which followed the creative path opened by the Provincials, extending it from the point of view of inspiration. The book tells the misadventures of a couple of merchants on holiday. In The Revenge of Love, the literary dimension of Cagna was enriched by realistic derivations and nuances. The writer experimented with various plays and also published two volumes of verses. Works * Maria ovvero Cos√¨ cammina il mondo.

Biography Soler launched his career as a writer in 1992 with the publication of Extranjeros en la noche (Strangers in the Night), a collection of short stories and a novella ‚Äì La noche (The Night), which was later published as a separate book. In 1983 he won the Jauja prize for short stories with Muerte canina (A Dog‚Äôs Death). After a further two novels he published Las bailarinas muertas (The Dead Dancing Girls), winning the Premio Herralde and establishing his reputation as a key exponent of modern Spanish narrative. His following novel, El nombre que ahora digo (The Name I Now Speak), is considered by some as one of the best depictions of life in the Republican sector during the Spanish conflict. In an article in El Pais in 2014, Professor Paul Preston is quoted as saying, \\"I don‚Äôt like reading novels about the Civil War, but an exception was El nombre que ahora digo, written by Antonio Soler some twenty years ago, which blew me away.‚Äù (‚ÄúPrefiero no leer novelas de la Guerra Civil, aunque como excepci√≥n me chifl√≥ una de Antonio Soler de har√° unos veinte a√±os: El nombre que ahora digo.‚Äù) He has repeated the sentiment more recently in seminars at the Ca√±ada Blanch Centre (LSE), commenting that it is one of the few novels to capture the sense of confusion and disorder prevailing during the siege of Madrid. El camino de los Ingleses (Summer Rain), published in 2004, was made into a film in 2006 by Antonio Banderas using Soler's own filmscript.IMDb page for Summer Rain. Soler was writer in residence at Dickinson College, Pennsylvania, and has given courses and lectures at numerous universities and cultural institutions in Europe, Latin America, the US and Canada.

The site's surface soils and groundwater have been contaminated from a storage tank and drum reclamation processes. Today the area is fenced in while cleanup options are being discussed in order to limit direct contact with the potential risks. In 1961, Barrels Inc. began working on the site, and continued until the owner abandoned the site in 1980.  Cleanup activities  Cleanup options are currently being evaluated. The site is being evaluated through state, federal and Potentially Responsible Party actions. For the time being, the site will stay fenced in to limit risks of further contamination. Access to the site will be restricted and future use of the site and its groundwater will be limited as well due to anticipated institutional controls. Institutional controls are activity and use limitations set in place by the EPA. By using institutional controls, exposure to contamination can be reduced, by limiting land and/or resource use, as well as guiding human behavior. For example, when land is not consistent with a certain level of cleanup, zoning restrictions may be set in place to prevent residential use. Lead and zinc has been detected at the site and has contaminated shallow groundwater. Heavy metals, volatile hydrocarbons, PCBs, oil, grease and other inorganic substances have been found to have contaminated on-site soils. To address immediate threats to human health and the environment, cleanup has also included removal actions, or short-term cleanups.  Health & environment  The greatest health risk to people is through ingesting or touching contaminated soil or groundwater. In the short term, exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks are being controlled. Currently, there are no unacceptable human exposure pathways. The EPA has determined that the site is under control for human exposure. The EPA has reviewed all the information on known and reasonably expected groundwater contamination and has concluded the migrations of contaminated groundwater is stabilized and there is no unacceptable discharge to surface water.

This waste disposal facility was licensed by Michigan to operate as a landfill from 1972 to 1978, taking in solid and liquid industrial waste. Solid waste, including soil contaminated with hazardous chemicals, was placed in an 11-acre (4.5 hectare) landfill on site, and liquid waste was placed in nine lagoons across the site to dry out and be disposed of when only solid waste remained. Poor screening of incoming waste at the facility led to the acceptance of toxic materials. Consequently, soil and groundwater around the site were exposed to environmental contaminants like polybrominated biphenyls, polychlorinated biphenyls, lead, volatile organic compounds, copper, and zinc. At the end of the site's operation and after its closure, citizens near the site raised concerns about these potential toxins. Forest Waste Products was initially assessed for Superfund eligibility on May 1, 1982, and proposed to be listed on the National Priorities List on December 30, 1982. The site was listed on September 8, 1983. Sampling at the site found that residential wells nearby were not contaminated, but there was evidence of toxic contaminants in nearby soil and groundwater. Shortly thereafter, the environmental remediation effort at the site began with the facility's lagoons. From 1988 to 1989, potentially responsible parties got rid of contaminated soil, water, and sludge from this part of the site and filled in the lagoons. Following the clean-up of the lagoons at the site, some drums containing toxic waste were removed from the main landfill to be treated off-site. The landfill was fenced-in and capped in 1997. In addition to these efforts, groundwater monitoring has occurred at and around the Forest Waste Products site since 1993. The potentially responsible party at this site is Forest Waste Coordinating Committee. In 1993, Michigan entered in an Administrative Order by Consent with the committee to establish their responsibility for reimbursing the state's expenses for oversight at the site.

A prot√©g√© of the late guitarist Joe Pass, he is a longtime performer and educator on the Southern California scene and beyond. Potenza is included in The Great Jazz Guitarists: The Ultimate Guide, by jazz critic and historian, Scott Yanow. He is a regular at ‚ÄúJohn Pisano's Guitar Night,\\" which, for over two decades, has showcased jazz guitarists in various venues throughout the Los Angeles area. Early life Growing up in Providence, Rhode Island, Frank Potenza started out playing his sister Norma's acoustic guitar. Later, at age 12, he fell under the influence of his cousin, Jimmy Gagliardi, who ‚Äúplayed and sang in rock and roll shows and nightclubs,‚Äù drove a convertible, smoked Lucky Strikes, and was ‚Äúthe epitome of cool.‚Äù Gagliardi taught Potenza guitar parts from the great R&B; songs of the day, especially Duane Eddy and Bill Doggett tunes. He was initially exposed to jazz via his father's record collection, but by his early teens, Potenza was hooked on the electric guitar sounds of rock and roll. By the early 70s, Potenza found his way back to jazz, particularly on first hearing the bluesy virtuosity of George Benson, which led him to other jazz guitarists like Pat Martino and Wes Montgomery. After high school, he attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, graduating in 1972 with a Bachelor's in music. Over the remainder of the 70s, Potenza performed with a variety of jazz bands at clubs around New England, including a stint with local jazz multi-instrumentalist, Diamond Centofanti. Association with Joe Pass In 1974, Potenza took his father to see Joe Pass perform a solo engagement at the Jazz Workshop in Boston. Pass albums such as Intercontinental, Virtuoso, and The Trio (featuring Pass with Oscar Peterson and Neils Pedersen), had by then made Potenza a big fan. After the concert, Potenza made his way to Pass' dressing room, shook his hand, and asked if he was giving lessons while in town. According to Potenza, \\"I had my first lesson with him the very next day, and that was the beginning of a 20-year friendship with him. It was a great blessing to be able to spend as much time as I got to spend with Joe.\\" Their friendship lasted until May 1994, when Pass succumbed to liver cancer. Jazz educator In 1981, Potenza moved to Los Angeles. From 1981 to 1995, he was an adjunct instructor on the Commercial Music Program faculty at Long Beach City College. During this time, the Commercial Music Program was directed by Dr. George Shaw, who was instrumental in bringing in a series of guest artists to play with the student big band. These artists, according to Potenza, ‚Äúcommonly asked for a professional rhythm section to play for them, and I was fortunate to get the chance to play with Dizzy Gillespie, Bill Watrous, Wilton Felder, Ronnie Laws, Joe Pass, and others.‚Äù In 1995, Potenza joined the faculty of the Studio/Jazz Guitar Department at the University of Southern California's Flora L. Thornton School of Music. In 2000, he completed his Masters in Music at California State University in Los Angeles. Shortly after, Potenza was promoted to the rank of Full Professor with tenure at USC. In 2006, he became chair of the Studio/Jazz Guitar Department at USC, stepping down in 2018. Potenza remains part of the program's faculty lineup. Career Throughout the 1980s, Potenza recorded a cluster of jazz albums for TBA Records as a solo artist, one of which, Soft & Warm, rose to the Top 10 in Billboard magazine's Contemporary Jazz listings, while Sand Dance made the Top 15. From 1984 - 1985, he toured with jazz saxophonist Ronnie Laws (younger brother of flautist, Hubert Laws). In 1996, in the midst of recording contemporary jazz albums, both as a sideman and bandleader, he became a touring member of the Gene Harris Quartet, which lasted until Harris‚Äô death in 2000 due to complications from kidney failure. Potenza is a featured soloist on Alley Cats, Harris‚Äô final recording for Concord Records. About playing with Harris, Potenza said, ‚ÄúGene inspired me with his soulful, heartfelt playing, and his amazing ability to rise above the health problems he was having. Some nights he would have to be helped to the stage and even to the piano bench, but Gene would summon up his energy, and in no time he was swinging and jubilant, leading the quartet with a vitality that could only be attributed to the healing power of music itself.‚Äù The guitarist has also been featured in collaborative performances with such artists as George Van Eps, Mose Allison, Joe Diorio, Joe Sample, John Pisano, Mundell Lowe, Bud Shank, and Dr. Lonnie Smith. His most recent recording, For Joe (CAPRI Records Ltd.), is a tribute to Joe Pass, who remains one of Potenza's greatest musical influences. For the recording, Potenza was able to pull together the exact same rhythm section Pass used on his classic 1964 album, For Django (Pacific Jazz). The lineup features: John Pisano (guitar), Jim Hughart (bass), and Colin Bailey (drums). For Joe showcases signature Pass originals, such as ‚ÄúA Foxy Chick and a Cool Cat,‚Äù ‚ÄúCatch Me,‚Äù and such standards as ‚ÄúBeautiful Love‚Äù and ‚ÄúRosetta‚Äù that Pass often covered. \\"On this superb album, (Potenza) pays homage to the master . . . Potenza and Pisano are, of course, celebrated guitarists . . . and their singular musical personalities and glorious tones infuse every note. Outstanding in every respect, this is one of the best straight-ahead jazz albums I‚Äôve heard in years.\\" ‚ÄîGuitar Player (Jan. 2014 issue) review of For Joe'' \\"An accomplished player, Potenza reveals touches of his mentor‚Äôs brilliance throughout this heartfelt project.\\" ‚ÄîDownbeat (Jan. 2014 issue) review of For Joe \\"[Potenza's guitar] possesses one of those sweet singing sounds that stays in your ear long after the notes have faded.\\" ‚Äî Los Angeles Times (Oct. 30, 1997) profile In 2017, the guitarist's career came full circle when he was inducted into the Rhode Island Music Hall of Fame. Potenza continues to perform at jazz venues and festivals across the country.

Family  Anne Kingsbury was born 29 October 1791, in Rindge, New Hampshire. Her parents were Benjamin Kingsbury and Abigail Sawin (1748-1793). She married Charles Wollstonecraft, whose sister Mary Wollstonecraft achieved fame in Britain as a philosopher, author, and advocate for the rights of women. One of her nephews by marriage was Edward Wollstonecraft, a successful businessman in early colonial Australia.  Career  Following the death of her husband in 1817, Anne Wollstonecraft moved to Matanzas, Cuba. While there, she studied the flora of the island, and in the mid-1820s, created an extensive illustrated manuscript, Specimens of the Plants and Fruits of the Island of Cuba, an important resource for the study of natural history in colonial Cuba. She was able to publish several of her botanical discoveries during her life, many under the pseudonym D‚ÄôAnville. One letter was published in the Boston Monthly Magazine. However, although she sent the almost completed manuscript to a publisher months before her death, Specimens of the Plants and Fruits of the Island of Cuba was never published. As well as drawings and descriptions of plants, the manuscript also included records of their indigenous uses. While Wollstonecraft devoted most of her writing to botany and ecology, she also wrote in support of women's rights, including The Natural Rights of Women, also published in the Boston Monthly Magazine. Wollstonecraft died May 16, 1828. Legacy Wollstonecraft's three- volume manuscript, Specimens of the Plants and Fruits of the Island of Cuba, was thought by scholars to be a lost work. There were references to it, but no-one had seen it. It had been donated to Cornell University in 1923 by a faculty member who was descended from her family, but because early references to the work misidentified the author's name, its significance was not recognized. It was located and its significance appreciated in March 2018 through the process of digitization.

The coroner determined she had died by asphyxiation, and had been given at least 27 Lorazepam pills on the day of her death, more than nine times a high dosage amount for an adult. The investigation into her death became known as the Asunta Basterra case (). Asunta's adoptive parents, Alfonso Basterra and Rosario Porto, were found guilty of her murder on 30 October 2015. According to court documents, the couple periodically drugged their daughter with Lorazepam for three months and finally asphyxiated her before disposing of her body. The parents, who maintained their innocence, were sentenced to 18 years in prison. The case has attracted widespread media interest in Spain and around the world, as well as a \\"statement of concern\\" from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A four-part documentary series about the case debuted in 2017 and was made available internationally on Netflix in 2019.  Background  Asunta Basterra was born Fang Yong in 2000 in Yongzhou, Hunan, China. At nine months old she was adopted by an affluent Spanish couple from Santiago de Compostela: lawyer Maria del Rosario Porto Ortega (born in Santiago de Compostela in 1969), and journalist Alfonso Basterra Camporro (born in Bilbao in 1964). Asunta was the first Chinese child to be adopted in the city of Santiago and one of the first in all of Galicia. Asunta was said to have been a gifted child. She had skipped a year in school and was a talented ballet dancer, violinist, and piano player. She was also very close to her maternal grandparents, who passed away the year before her death. Asunta's adoptive mother, Rosario Porto, came from a prominent Galician family. Rosario's father, lawyer Francisco Porto Mella (died 2012), was honorary Consul of France. Her mother, Mar√≠a del Socorro Ortega (died 2011), was a highly regarded university lecturer of art history. Porto studied law at the University of Santiago de Compostela and practiced law at her father's firm after graduation. She also claimed to have attended the London High School of Law in England; which The Guardian confirmed does not exist. In 1997 she was appointed Consul of France, inheriting the role from her father. Porto met journalist Alfonso Basterra, a native of Bilbao, in 1990. The two married in 1996 and lived in a large flat that had been given to Porto by her parents. In 2001 they travelled to China and adopted 9-month-old Yong Fang, who they renamed Asunta, from the Guiyang Welfare Institute. In January 2013, the couple separated, and Basterra moved to an apartment around the corner from the family flat. Asunta split her time between the two homes, walking the short distance between them.  Death and investigation  Asunta was first reported missing by her divorced parents, Rosario Porto and Alfonso Basterra, at 10:17PM on Saturday September 21, 2013. Asunta and her parents had eaten lunch at her father's home that afternoon. She was seen on bank security camera at 2:00PM walking to her father's house, and appeared on the same security camera at 5:21PM returning home to her mother's flat. Porto was seen on the same security camera walking home at 5:28PM. Porto initially told investigators that she had left home at around 7:00PM, leaving Asunta at home doing homework. She said that she had driven alone to the family's country house in Teo, located about 20 minutes outside the city of Santiago, and that when she returned home to her Santiago apartment at 9:30 Asunta was missing. Porto said that she called Asunta's father and many of her friends, none of whom had seen her. Investigators later recovered CCTV video footage of Porto and Asunta at a gas station on the route toward Teo at 6:20PM, contradicting Porto's timeline and story that she had left Asunta home that afternoon. After being made aware of the video Porto changed her story, this time saying that Asunta had briefly come with her to the country house that afternoon, but that she took her right back to Santiago because the child had wanted to do homework. She said that after dropping Asunta off at home in Santiago she went to a sporting goods store to buy an item for Asunta's ballet class, but did not go in the store after realizing that she had left her purse in Teo. She said she then returned to the country house in Teo to retrieve her purse, then went to get gas at a gas station but did not fill her tank because she realized she did not have her discount card. Police examined the video footage of 33 surveillance cameras around Santiago, and found no video of Porto's car on any of the roads she claimed to have driven on in Santiago that afternoon. The police in charge of the case came to believe that Porto and Asunta arrived at their house in Teo just after 6PM, and that Porto left the house around 9PM. Police first became suspicious of Porto due to an incident in the hours after Asunta's body was discovered. Asunta's body was discovered in the early morning hours of 22 September 2013, at around 1 a.m., by a passer-by on the side of a small mountain road in Teo, a few kilometers away from the Porto family's country house. Not long after, Porto and investigators went together to Porto's country house in Teo. Police told Porto not to touch anything, as the house could be a crime scene. Porto told police that she needed to use the bathroom. An officer followed her upstairs, where instead of going to the bathroom, she entered a bedroom and attempted to retrieve the contents of a wastepaper basket. The officer was able to intercept her and grabbed the bin before she could. The bin contained a section of the same type of orange rope that Asunta's limbs had been tied with when she was found. Forensic scientists were ultimately unable to determine whether or not the pieces came from the same roll. The investigation into Asunta's death was named Operaci√≥n Nen√∫far (\\"Operation Water Lily\\") by detectives, who noted that in the moonlight, the girl's body in her white shirt appeared to be floating above the ground like a flower.Lo que la verdad esconde: Caso Asunta, part 3  Documentary  A four- part documentary about the case, Lo que la verdad esconde: Caso Asunta (\\"What the Truth Hides: The Asunta Case\\"), directed by El√≠as Le√≥n Siminiani, premiered on Spanish television on 24 May 2017. It was considered a landmark documentary in Spain, which historically has eschewed the true crime genre. It became available internationally on Netflix in February 2019.

The landfill, with about of adjacent property, operated as a waste oil recovery facility from 1955 to 1967. From 1955 to 1974 the site was used as an industrial and municipal landfill. Contaminated soil, surface water, and groundwater with hazardous chemicals have been left behind as a result of the disposal of waste solvents, waste oil and paint sludge. Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing following the cleanup.  Cleanup activities  The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party actions. Several five-year reviews have been conducted by the EPA which ensure that the remedies put in place will protect public health and the environment, and function as the site decision documents intended. The most recent of these reviews has revealed that without further evaluation of the groundwater and leachate extraction systems, a protectiveness determination for the remedy at the site cannot be made. Attainment of the cleanup standards and implementation of institutional controls is required in order to continue to protect the remedy. Contaminants found at this site include naphthalene, benzene, xylene, arsenic, ethylbenzene, trichloroethene, tetrachloroethene, dichloroethene, vinyl chloride, PCBs and lead. The site's long-term remedy included: * a landfill cover * relocation of impacted soils beneath landfill cover * containment of landfill areas * groundwater extraction, treatment and monitoring * wetland mitigation and creation Operation and maintenance activities are ongoing since construction of the remedy took place between 1996 and 1999. The EPA has set activity and use limitations, called institutional controls, in place at this site. Institutional controls are activity and use limitations set in place by the EPA. By using institutional controls, exposure to contamination can be reduced by limiting land and/or resource use, as well as guiding human behavior. For example, when land is not consistent with a certain level of cleanup, zoning restrictions may be set in place to prevent residential use. No enforcement activities are currently underway at the G&H; Site.  Health & environment  Risks and pathways addressed by the cleanup include health risks from people ingesting or touching contaminants in soil, surface water and groundwater. Assessments indicate that across the entire site there are currently no unacceptable human exposure pathways and the EPA has determined the site is under control for human exposure. The EPA reviewed all information on known and reasonably expected groundwater contamination and concluded the migration of contaminated groundwater is stabilized and there is no unacceptable discharge to surface water. The EPA will conduct monitoring to confirm that affected groundwater remains in the original area of contamination. The physical construction of the cleanup is complete for the entire site.

Her output included book illustrations, tombstones, church sculptures and pub signs. Biography Reckitt was born and lived in St Albans in Hertfordshire until 1922 when her family moved to Old Cleeve in Somerset to live in a large country house known as Golsoncott. After a spell at the Taunton School of Art, Reckitt studied wood engraving at the Grosvenor School of Modern Art in London from 1933 to 1937, where she was taught by Iain Macnab. During this period she began exhibiting stone and wood carvings with the London Group and also prints with the Society of Wood Engravers. In 1937 she began making sculptured inn signs using metal sheeting and other materials for pubs in Somerset. During World War II Reckitt undertook relief work in the Whitechapel area of London and also assisted with the evacuation of children from the city to Golsoncott. After the war she studied sculpture at the Hammersmith School of Building Crafts for five years and also studied lithography at the Central School of Art and Design. Throughout the 1960s Reckitt created sculptures in wood and stone, often in a modern, constructivist style. From 1970 to 1975 Reckitt studied welding and was taught how to work with wrought iron by Harry and Jim Horrobin, at the Roadwater Smithy in Somerset. From then on she would produce sculptures and other pieces in steel and metal from her west Somerset home at Rodhuish. Among the most notable pieces from this period is her Jacob Wrestling with the Angel in wrought iron and aluminium which is in St Bartholomew's Church in Rodhuish. Several parish churches in the area around Golsoncott have examples of Reckitt's work either as sculptures, alter screens or painted pulpits. Reckitt was a member of the Society of Wood Engravers, the British Artist Blacksmiths' Association and an honorary member of the Somerset Guild of Craftsmen. She had solo exhibitions at the Bridgwater Arts Centre and at Duncan Campbell Contemporary Art. The British Museum holds several of her prints. In 2001 a retrospective touring exhibition was mounted by the Somerset County Museums Service which was accompanied by the book Rachel Reckitt: where everything that meets the eye. A private exhibition of her studio works was held at Crowcombe Church House in 2011 which featured her metalwork and later associated paintings and drawings. The author Penelope Lively was Reckitt's niece and accounts of her appear in Lively's memoirs Oleander Jacaranda and A House Unlocked. After Reckitt's death Golsoncott was sold and the funds raised were used to create the Golsoncott Foundation to support the arts and in her memory.

History The Commonwealth soldiers interred in the cemetery fell in battles in Valkenswaard and the surrounding region (such as at Best, Eersel and Bergeijk). The soldiers were killed between 14 September 1944 and 29 November 1944 with the exception on one soldier who died on 21 January 1945. The majority of the soldiers come from the Irish Guards and Devonshire Regiment. A temporary field burial site at Valkenswaard was set up at the beginning of October 1944 by No. 55 Graves Registration Unit. The earliest casualty interred in the cemetery dates from 14 September 1944. The liberation of Valkenswaard on the 17 September 1944 is where the majority of the soldiers fell in battle. In early May 1945 the first mention of a permanent British war cemetery on the site is recorded. Additional fallen soldiers from northern Belgium and southern Holland were removed from their field burial sites and re-interred at Valkenswaard by the graves concentration unit of the British Army. The local community initially took care of the graves until the cemetery was officially passed to the then Imperial War Graves Commission on 15 June 1946.

The agreement is made between the Crown prosecutor and an organization alleged to have committed certain types of criminal offences, usually in the context of fraud or corruption, with the consent of the relevant Attorney General and under the supervision of a judge. Under a deferred prosecution agreement, the Crown prosecutor can agree to defer bringing a prosecution for the alleged offences if the organization takes steps to improve its conduct, makes restitution, and implements internal controls to avoid a repetition of the conduct. In 2018, the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau introduced legislation to provide for deferred prosecution agreements in Canada, as part of the omnibus Budget Implementation Act, 2018, No. 1. The new provisions would be added to the Criminal Code as Part XXII.1. The government explained that the provisions would be an enhancement of the existing federal Integrity Regime. The goal of the legislation would be to give prosecutors additional tools to deal with allegations of commercial crimes. The Parliament of Canada enacted Part XXII.1 in June 2018. The provisions have subsequently generated some political controversy. SNC-Lavalin, a major Canadian engineering firm, is facing criminal charges under the Criminal Code and the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act in relation to its business dealings in Libya and was one of the first corporations to seek a deferred prosecution agreement. The federal Public Prosecution Service of Canada refused that request, on the basis that SNC-Lavlin did not meet the conditions under Part XXII.1. Allegations were made that members of the Trudeau government had put inappropriate pressure on then-Minister of Justice, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to authorize a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin. Following an investigation by the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner (CIEC), the Commissioner released his report on and August 14, 2019 said that Prime Minister Trudeau had contravened the Conflict of Interest Act by seeking to directly and indirectly influence Wilson‚ÄëRaybould. Deferred prosecutions in other countries In the federal government's 2017 discussion paper, distributed as a guide for the public consultations that took place in the autumn of 2017 \\"regarding a possible DPA regime in Canada\\", a comparison was made between the DPAs in the United States since the 1990s and in the United Kingdom since 2014. In DPAs in United Kingdom were authorized for use by the Crown Prosecution Service and the Serious Fraud Office for fraud, bribery and other economic crime.UK Serious Fraud Office: Deferred Prosecution Agreements. Unlike the American model, in Britain the courts have a role in approving proposed deferred prosecution agreements, adding to public transparency.Crime and Courts Act 2013 (UK), 2013 c. 22, Schedule 17. In 2017 the UK broadened their use to include tax evasion cases. However, the approach taken by American prosecutors has been criticized by US courts as being too lenient. In spite of these criticisms, the US courts have held that they have only a limited power to review deferred prosecution agreements. In most cases, the courts approve the agreements. France enacted legislation authorizing deferred prosecution agreements in December 2016. The Minister of Justice of Australia introduced a federal DPA regime in 2017. According to a February 27, 2019 Financial Post article by Terence Corcoran, internationally, most countries used deferred or negotiated settlements as opposed to turning to the courts when dealing with corporate corruption which has resulted in the payment of billions of dollars in fines. Corcoran said that government prosecutors have used deferred prosecution agreement to negotiate settlements with \\"Siemens, Walmart, Alcoa, Daimler, Alcatel-Lucent\\". In 2019 the United States had 130 active cases under negotiation under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Deferred prosecution agreements in the United States \\"... are governed by policy and practice rather than binding regulations.\\" Major cases in included Munich-based Siemens, one of the largest companies in the world, that had to pay a total fine of $1.6 bill in mid-December 2008‚Äîthe \\"largest fine for bribery in modern corporate history.\\" According to a 2008 NPR article, an FBI investigator said that Seimens' \\"actions were not an anomaly\\"...executives in corporations used bribery as a standard operating procedure and a \\"business strategy\\" to win contracts. In July 2017, Transparency International Canada, the Canadian branch of a global anti-corruption non-government coalition, released a detailed report on deferred prosecutions. The report reviewed deferred prosecution legislation in several other countries and discussed the arguments for and against deferred prosecutions. The report concluded that: \\"On balance, as a means of pursuing greater enforcement of and compliance with anti-corruption laws, we urge the Government of Canada to consider adopting a properly designed DPA mechanism\\".  Development of Canadian legislation   Initial steps  In 2015, the Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) department of the government of Canada introduced the Integrity Regime, to \\"ensure the government does business only with ethical suppliers in Canada and abroad\\". Under the Integrity Regime, PSPC reviews cases of alleged corrupt business practices, to determine \\"whether a supplier is ineligible to do business with the government\\", usually in relation to \\"procurement and real property transactions over $10,000\\".Government of Canada's Integrity Regime - About the Integrity Regime\\", May 17, 2017. Discussions about the potential establishment of deferred prosecution agreement legislation in Canada began in February 2016. Under traditional criminal law, Canadian prosecutors only had two options: \\"prosecute and charge alleged offenders, or decide not to prosecute alleged offenders\\".  Public consultation process  In September 2017, PSPC announced a public consultation on potential enhancements to the Integrity Regime, and \\"whether deferred prosecution agreements should be used in Canada\\".\\"News Release: Government of Canada seeks views on addressing corporate wrongdoing\\", Public Services and Procurement Canada, September 25, 2017.\\" PSPC published a discussion paper, and also provided a web page to guide discussion. The consultation was regarding \\"potential enhancements to the recently implemented Integrity Regime\\" which could include the implementation of deferred prosecution agreements in Canada, similar to the one adopted in the United Kingdom to respond to corporate wrongdoing. PSPC described the potential deferred prosecution legislation as a means of ensuring \\"corporate criminal conduct is subject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties\\" while mitigating \\"unintended consequences associated with a criminal conviction for blameless employees, customers, pensioners, suppliers and investors\\". PSPC also recognized that in some cases, a criminal conviction could lead to \\"job losses and wider negative implications to the economy.\\" During the public consultation period, the government received 75 written submissions. PSPC also conducted meetings with approximately 350 interested parties and groups, such as industry associations, businesses, justice sector stakeholders (including law enforcement), non-governmental organizations, and academics.  Results of the consultation  The report on the public consultation process was released on February 22, 2018. The report stated that a majority of participants supported having a Canadian regime for deferred prosecution agreements. The majority also favoured an approach based on the United Kingdom regime, which was seen as having greater transparency than the American model. The report noted that the \\"vast majority\\" of the participants in the consultation believed that deferred prosecution agreements were \\"best suited for economic offences committed by organizations, such as fraud, offences under the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, bribery, money laundering and, generally, offences under the Competition Act\\". Participants stated that deferred prosecution agreements would give the prosecutor more options in dealing with commercial crime, rather than the current binary choice of prosecuting or not prosecuting. However, participants also suggested that the factors which prosecutors should consider in deciding whether to offer an agreement should be specifically set out in the legislation. Participants considered that publication of the general terms of a deferred prosecution agreement would be important for purposes of public transparency. The majority of the participants favoured the British model, with a strong supervisory role by the courts to ensure that a proposed agreement is in the public interest and that the terms of a particular agreement are \\"fair, reasonable, and proportionate\\". On March 27, 2018, PSPC issued a media release to announce an enhancement of the \\"government-wide Integrity Regime\\", which it described as a \\"made-in-Canada version of a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) regime, to be known as a Remediation Agreement Regime\\". It also announced that amendments to the Criminal Code would be introduced to implement the new legal procedure. Enactment of legislation On March 27, 2018, the Government introduced legislation to create a system for deferred prosecution agreements. Although the legislation amended the Criminal Code, it was not framed as a stand-alone amendment to the Code. Instead, it was included in the omnibus budget legislation. The amendments to the Criminal Code were found in Division 20 of Part Six of the budget bill.Budget Implementation Act, 2018, No. 1, SC 2018, c. 12, s. 404. The amendments would add a new Part XXII.1 to the Criminal Code to authorize deferred prosecution agreements, termed \\"remediation agreements\\".Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c. C-46, Part XXII.1, sections 715.3 to 715.43. The inclusion of the amendments to the Criminal Code in a budget bill attracted some criticism from members of the all-party Finance Committee of the House of Commons, in their review of the budget bill.\\"Federal budget bill quietly proposes tool to ease penalties for corporate crime.\\" CBC/Canadian Press, May 15, 2018. Some members of the committee commented that they only became aware of the Criminal Code amendments during the testimony of an official from the Department of Justice, and even one Liberal MP on the committee, Greg Fergus, stated that he was caught by surprise by the provision. Pierre-Luc Dusseault, a New Democrat, said that he thought the provision was tucked into the budget bill to make the change quietly, without much opportunity to debate it. Some members of the Finance Committee suggested the proposal should be referred to the Justice Committee of the Commons, which has greater expertise in criminal law, while others suggested that the proposed amendments should be taken out of the budget bill and made into a separate bill. One Conservative MP, Dan Albas, supported these options, stating that: \\"This is a fundamental departure from the way we handle the Criminal Code\\". The Liberal majority on the committee declined to do so. Greg Fergus, a Liberal MP, also stated he had concerns with the substance of the proposed legislation, which would allow those charged with white-collar crimes to avoid serious criminal sanctions: \\"It seems we're letting those with the means have an easier time of it than those who don't have the means.\\" The bill passed the House of Commons on June 6, 2018 and the Senate on June 14, 2018. It received royal assent on June 21, 2018.Library of Parliament, LegisInfo: An Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on February 27, 2018 and other measures. The provisions for deferred prosecution agreements came into force ninety days after royal assent,Budget Implementation Act, 2018, No. 1, s. 409. namely September 19, 2018.  Outline of the legislation  The federal Department of Justice issued a \\"Backgrounder\\" on the new legislation in March 2018. According to that summary, the main purposes of a remediation agreement are: * To denounce an organization‚Äôs wrongdoing and the harms that such wrongdoing has caused to victims or to the community; * To hold the organization accountable for the wrongdoing; * To require the organization to put measures in place to correct the problem and prevent similar problems in the future; * To reduce the harm that a criminal conviction of an organization could have for employees, shareholders and other third parties who did not take part in the offence; and * To help repair harm done to victims or to the community, including through reparations and restitution.\\"Government introduces ‚Äúmade-in-Canada‚Äù Deferred Prosecution Agreement framework\\", Dentons LLP. The Backgrounder also emphasized that only certain types of organizations could qualify for a deferred prosecution agreement. Government agencies, trade unions and municipalities would not be eligible. Nor would crimes committed by, or at the direction of, criminal or terrorist organizations. As well, only certain types of economic crimes could be considered for deferred prosecution, such as fraud or bribery. Crimes which resulted in death or serious bodily harm, or that damaged national defence or national security, would not be eligible. The offences which would be eligible for consideration for a deferred prosecution agreement are specifically listed in a schedule to the Criminal Code.Criminal Code, s. 715.3(1) \\"offence\\". Part XXII.1 also sets out conditions which must be met before a Crown prosecutor may enter into negotiations with an accused organization. One of those conditions is that the relevant Attorney General must consent to the negotiation of the agreement. Another condition is that a deferred prosecution agreement must be in the public interest.Criminal Code, s. 715.32(1). Part XXII.1 then sets out a lengthy list of factors which the Crown prosecutor must consider, such as the \\"nature and gravity\\" of the alleged offence, whether the organization has taken internal steps to prevent further misconduct, and whether it has cooperated with the authorities and made reparations for the harm it has caused.Criminal Code, s. 715.32(2). Part XXII.1 also sets out factors which the Crown prosecutor is not permitted to take into account in considering whether to open negotiations. In the case of charges under the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, the prosecutor \\"must not consider the national economic interest, the potential effect on relations with a state other than Canada or the identity of the organization or individual involved.\\"Criminal Code, s. 715.32(3). Reactions to the new provisions According to the Law Times, the provisions for deferred prosecution agreements change the way Canadian prosecutors can prosecute white-collar crime, by including a remediation system whereby offenders can avoid conviction if \\"they co-operate with the Crown and the courts\\". The Law Times cited Ottawa-based counsel Patrick McCann, who said that the deferred prosecution provisions would \\"bring Canada in line with many other countries that have deferred prosecution agreements, including the U.S., the U.K. and most other European countries\\". According to McCann, a deferred prosecution agreement \\"addresses the unfairness of the situation when you have a large company that has a rogue senior officer\\" who has committed a crime with the entire company getting blamed. McCann said that deferred prosecution agreements are fair to investors in companies who are innocent of any wrongdoing. Through the regime, companies have added incentives to comply and to \\"self-report potential wrongdoing\\". According to John Boscariol, except for a few cases in the early 2010s, Canada has been slow to enforce its anti- bribery law, partially because it lacked the tools, such as a deferred- prosecution agreement regime. Several major law firms confirmed that the legislation gave incentives for corporations to be pro-active in detecting illegal conduct, self-reporting, and creating internal structures to prevent illegal acts. The new provisions also give more tools to prosecutors, instead of the options to prosecute or not prosecute. According to Dalhousie University's Graham Steele ‚Äî a Rhodes Scholar, lawyer and former provincial finance minister in Nova Scotia ‚Äî \\"investigating and prosecuting ... transnational corruption cases can be incredibly difficult, time consuming and expensive\\". Criminal court cases take years to complete and it is very difficult for prosecutors to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty. Steele explained that in Canada, while the \\"attorney general has to sign off on a DPA\\", the Attorney General does not initiate or request that a prosecutor initiate an agreement. One trans-national law firm, Dentons, commented that while most of the Canadian provisions are similar to those in other countries, such as Britain, there is one aspect of the Canadian legislation which is unique to Canada: the requirement that victims of the conduct be informed of the proceedings and their right to compensation. The definition of \\"victim\\" is very broad. Coupled with the right to compensation, this aspect of the Canadian regime will likely result in large numbers applying for compensation, if a deferred prosecution agreement is being proposed to the courts. SNC-Lavalin Quebec construction company SNC- Lavalin was one of the first major companies in Canada to seek a deferred prosecution agreement. The Economist reported on allegations in February 2019 that Trudeau and his officials had attempted to influence justice minister and attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to use the DPA instead of prosecuting SNC-Lavalin on bribery charges. Following an investigation into alleged violations of the Conflict of Interest Act, the August 14, 2019 57-page report by the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner (CIEC) found that Prime Minister Trudeau had contravened the Conflict of Interest Act. The report detailed the process through which the DPA was established in Canada. Immediately after the CIEC report was released, Anne McLellan, released her report that had been commissioned by Trudeau at \\"the height of the SNC-Lavalin controversy\\". Trudeau had ordered the McLellan report to investigate whether there was a conflict in having one person as both justice minister and attorney general, as was the case for Wilson-Raybould. According to an iPolitico article, legal experts said that the dual role complicates the Shawcross doctrine‚Äîthrough which the \\"attorney general is supposed to act independently on any prosecutorial decisions\\". Trudeau said at an August 14 press conference that the McLellan report recommendations, that did not include separating the two offices, \\"would help the government address the issues identified in the SNC-Lavalin controversy and protect prosecutorial independence.\\" According to a CBC News interview, Trudeau responded to the CIEC report by accepting \\"responsibility\\". Even if Trudeau believed that Wilson-Raybould \\"did fail here somehow\\", [he] and his advisers would still be responsible for respecting the Shawcross doctrine, which protects the independence of the attorney general from political pressure.\\" He added that he \\"can't apologize for standing up for Canadian jobs.\\" References Category:Canadian criminal law Category:Prosecution ","title":"Deferred prosecution agreement (Canada)"},{"id":"60047049","text":"Zoltan Kondorossy (born 28 January 1906, date of death unknown) was a Romanian wrestler.

Personal life  Lockey contracted meningococcal septicaemia as a baby in 2007, at the age of 15-months. Despite her parents being told that she was likely to die, Lockey survived following a successful operation to have both arms and her toes amputated. Lockey was initially provided with simple prosthetics from the NHS. While researching 3D printing, Lockey's mother discovered Open Bionics, who were looking for a below-the-elbow amputee to trial new prosthetic arms. Since being chosen in 2016, Lockey has used bionic arms developed by the company, which enable her to perform actions such as picking up small objects and playing video games. These arms are the first of their kind to be medically-approved in Britain. In 2014, Lockey's custom-made bicycle was stolen; it was recovered four days later and two people were charged. One set of her arms were based on the Deus Ex video game. In 2019, Lockey received new custom arms designed by the team creating Alita: Battle Angel. Lockey now creates and shares make-up tutorials online. She featured in the video for Kate Nash's 2019 song Bad Lieutenant.

As with the 2011 census, it will enumerate the number of people in the country, survey the demographic, economic, and social characteristics of the population, as well as ascertain the types of building stock available in the country. The census will comply with both European Union and United Nations census guidelines. The full set of results will be available by 31 March 2024. Smartphone and geolocation technologies will be utilised in order to carry out the census. A design competition was launched in September 2018, asking university students to design the census logo, and the winner was announced in 2019. Background The 2011 Greek census showed that the population of Greece had declined by 0.88% compared to the 2001 census, to 10,815,197 people. This demographic trend is expected to continue if fertility rates remain low, with the Hellenic Statistical Authority estimating the decline of the total population of Greece to 9.7 million by 2050 in that scenario. Similarly, Eurostat estimates that, without migration, the Greek population will decline to 9.3 million by 2050, and to 8.9 million with lower fertility; the main Eurostat scenario projects the country's population as 9.1 million in 2050.

Karandin officiated for 26 seasons in the Soviet Union, and was selected by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) to referee games at two Winter Olympic Games, and six Ice Hockey World Championships. He became the first Soviet referee chosen to officiate matches involving players from the National Hockey League, when assigned to the first Super Series. He later refereed at two Canada Cup events, and became president of the Siberia‚ÄìFar East branch of the Ice Hockey Federation of Russia. In 2004, he was inducted into both the IIHF Hall of Fame, and the Russian Hockey Hall of Fame. Early life Karandin was born 22 March 1937, in Novosibirsk. Before becoming a referee, he played for HC Dynamo Novosibirsk. Refereeing career Karandin officiated 876 games within the Soviet Union ice hockey championships. He refereed matches in the Soviet Union for 26 seasons from 1961 to 1987, was named to the top ten list of the best Soviet Union referees 23 times, and refereed international matches from 1966 to 1987. He officiated at the 1972 Winter Olympics, the 1984 Winter Olympics, and six Ice Hockey World Championships in 1970, 1973, 1983, 1985, 1986, and 1987. Overall, he officiated 268 international games, which also included two IIHF World U20 Championships, and one IIHF World U18 Championship. Karandin was the first Soviet referee chosen to officiate matches involving players from the National Hockey League, when he was assigned to games in the Super Series '76. In total, he later worked four different Super Series, and two Canada Cups. Karandin authored the book Hockey Parallels released in 2010, which recounted his experiences in ice hockey, and included several games he considered memorable. He officiated the 1969 Soviet hockey championship game between HC CSKA Moscow and HC Spartak Moscow, where he disallowed a goal by CSKA at the end of the second period because the official timekeeper's watch had expired, although the scoreboard had one second remaining. CSKA coach Anatoly Tarasov delayed resuming the match for 40 minutes in protest, before an eventual 3‚Äì1 loss to Spartak. In the Super Series '76, Karandin stated that he was \\"urgently summoned to Moscow to apply for a Canadian travel visa\\", and that Soviet administrators quickly excused him from domestic duties to travel abroad. He expressed gratefulness to Canadians for the opportunity which changed his destiny. He officiated the 28 December 1975 victory by CSKA over the New York Rangers, and received praise from Phil Esposito. He was a linesman in the CSKA New Year's Eve match versus the Montreal Canadiens, and officiated the 1976 Philadelphia Flyers‚ÄìRed Army game. During the series, Karandin earned $10,000, but experienced difficulties when transferring the money back to the Soviet Union. Administration career Karandin was elected president of the Siberia‚ÄìFar East branch of the Ice Hockey Federation of Russia in 1991. He is still active in the role as of 2018, and is also a member of the national federation's executive committee. He aims to improve lower levels of competition in the region, and grow youth ice hockey by improving the funding for schools, and coaching support. He has stated that the city of Khabarovsk is a historical strength in the region, but moving the Far East hockey branch offices further east to Vladivostok might endanger that role, despite growth in the latter city. He also wants to make improvements to the Ice Sports Palace Sibir in Novosibirsk, which is too old for the modern standards of hosting an Ice Hockey World Championship. Awards and honors Karandin was presented with a golden diploma from the IIHF in 1987, in recognition of his service. In 2004, he was inducted into both the Russian Hockey Hall of Fame, and the IIHF Hall of Fame. He was honored by the IIHF during the 2004 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships. He also refereed a hockey legends game during the 2004 event, featuring former star players from Russia, Canada, Finland, Sweden, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. In 2014, he attended the opening of the Russian Hockey Hall of Fame museum in Moscow. In July 2018, Karandin was appointed an honorary vice-president of the Ice Hockey Federation of Russia.

In 1909, he built a large home in Washington, D.C. that now serves as an embassy of Uzbekistan. Moore died after a leisure trip to England, on his way home as a first class passenger on the RMS Titanic when it sank in the North Atlantic. Early life and ancestors Moore was born in Clarksburg, West Virginia, in 1865 to Jasper Yates Moore (1834‚Äì1907), a legal clerk, and Frances Elizabeth Reynolds (1842‚Äì1894), both of Virginia. Younger brother Frank Reynolds Moore (1869‚Äì1954) joined the family four years later and they lived in Harrison County, West Virginia into the 1880s. Moore had a private school education, then attended and graduated from Dufferin College in London, Ontario. Moore's great-great-grandfather, Mordecai Moore, came to America from England in 1732 as Lord Baltimore Charles Calvert's private physician. Mordecai's son, Samuel Preston Moore, moved from Anne Arundel County, Maryland to Harrison County in about 1802. Business career Soon after his education, Moore explored and developed properties in West Virginia for coal mining, oil, and timber, partnering with Stephen Benton Elkins and Henry Gassaway Davis. He moved to Washington, D.C. in 1890 and began working for the William B. Hibbs & Co. brokerage firm in 1891, for which he received an annual salary in 1910 of $25,000, . Moore raised cattle and horses on farmland he owned in Montgomery County, Maryland, and had some real estate investments near Leesburg, Virginia. Sportsman and social activity Considered among the top equestrians in the Washington area, Moore played an integral part in starting the Chevy Chase fox hunting club, and was later a master of foxhounds for the Loudoun Hunt in Loudoun County, Virginia. Moore was a member of various private social clubs, including the Metropolitan, Chevy Chase, and Alibi clubs in Washington, as well as the New York Yacht Club in New York City and Travelers Club in Paris. RMS Titanic fate April 17, 1912 Washington Post headline: \\"No News of Major Butt or Clarence Moore\\" Titanic's voyage Moore left Washington in mid-March 1912 for what his wife said was a pleasure trip to England. The main purpose for his trip was to find and buy English Foxhounds for the Loudoun Hunt. While there, he also attended the Grand National horse race. Moore bought 50 pairs (100) of the dogs and booked first class travel back to the U.S. for himself and his English manservant, Charles Henry Harrington. They boarded the RMS Titanic on April 10 at Southampton with ticket number 113769 at a cost of ¬£42, 8s, , or about $. Moore had originally planned to transport the dogs with him on the Titanic, though ultimately made other arrangements for them. According to survivor accounts, on the night of the ship's iceberg collision and sinking, Moore was playing cards in the smoking room with his dining companions and fellow Americans, Major Archibald Butt, Harry Elkins Widener, and William Carter (husband of Lucile). Among the stories Moore told that evening was how he had helped a newspaper reporter interview Anse Hatfield, the patriarch on one side of the infamous Hatfield‚ÄìMcCoy feud. The Washington Times wrote that Moore and Butt, who was also from Washington, remained together until jumping into the water as the ship went down. Their bodies were never recovered. Moore's employer and business associate, William B. Hibbs, went to New York, where many survivors were taken by the RMS Carpathia, and Brigadier General Edwards went to the White House at Moore's wife's pleading, though no additional information was available. Personal life and legacy Clarence Moore House, Washington, D.C., 2008 Moore's first wife, Alice McLaughlin (1872‚Äì1897), was the daughter of Frank McLaughlin, former owner of the Philadelphia Times. She gave birth to two children, and died 12 days after bearing the second: *daughter, Frances Sarah Preston, September 14, 1894 ‚Äì early October 1921, who married Henri Marquisan and died in Paris, and *son, Samuel Preston, born July 5, 1897. Moore married again on June 20, 1900 in Beverly, Massachusetts to Mabelle Florence Swift (1878‚Äì1933), daughter and heiress of Chicago meat packer Edwin C. Swift (a brother of Swift & Company founder Gustavus). The couple had four more children, the first of whom died young: * son, Edwin Swift, November 25, 1901 ‚Äì , * son, Jasper, November 30, 1905 ‚Äì 1969, in Duncan, British Columbia, * son, Clarence Jr, born January 20, 1910, who attended Eton and Harvard and married Joan Ashton Lindsley on December 28, 1932, and * son, Lloyd, born November 29, 1911, who married and was divorced from Eppes Bartow Preston (n√©e Hawes; 1901‚Äì1981), daughter of U.S. senator Harry B. Hawes. Moore asked architects Jules Henri de Sibour and Bruce Price in 1906 to design a mansion for his family on land his wife had bought in 1901. Known as the Clarence Moore House, its construction was completed at 1746 Massachusetts Avenue NW in 1909. Moore died three years later and his widow remarried in 1915 to Danish immigrant Aksel C.P. Wichfeld, a year before he was appointed to the Danish legation, afterward only using the mansion for diplomatic and social events. She sold the property to the monarchy of Canada in 1927, after which it was used as a Canadian chancery and embassy. Canada relocated their embassy to another property, officially opened in 1989, and sold the Massachusetts Avenue property in 1996 to the government of Uzbekistan, which also uses it as an embassy. Though often cited as having the middle name \\"Bloomfield\\", Moore's birth, census, and passport records do not include a middle name. When his daughter was born in 1894, her father's name was listed as \\"Clarence Samuel Preston Moore\\". His name may have later been confused with that of another famous American of his time, archaeologist Clarence Bloomfield Moore (1852‚Äì1936).

The series focuses on a trio of kids, collectively referred to as the \\"Stump Kids\\", lead by Craig (voiced by Philip Solomon) a young boy who wants to explore and map as much of the wide and mysterious creek located in the fictional town of Herkleston, Maryland. His companions include Kelsey (voiced by Georgie Kidder in the pilot and the first 3 episodes and No√´l Wells in episode 4-onwards) a young \\"warrior\\" girl with an active imagination and a lust for adventure, and J.P. (voiced by H. Michael Croner) a goofy and kind-hearted boy who likes to take things easy. The three of them attend different schools with the Creek being the only thing that brings them together. Main Craig Williams Craigory \\"Craig\\" Williams is a 9-year-old boy who enjoys playing at the creek with his friends Kelsey and J.P. He is a natural leader and always tries to help kids when they need it the most. Craig is usually seen carrying a turquoise bag, that he uses to carry \\"important\\" items, and a staff, made out of a pole from a stair banister that he got his head stuck in once. Craig seems to know his way around the creek and worships its importance to the kids in Herkleston. He sets his sights on wanting to explore the creek for his own amusement and chart out everything. Because of this, he takes on the role of a cartographer at the creek as he usually draws maps and is asked by others to map or plot things for them. In \\"Escape from Family Dinner\\", it is implied that Craig is smart to some degree as he takes advanced math and admits that he likes the class. He also seems capable of knowing the answers to a math question just by looking at it for a few seconds. Craig can become power hungry or obsessive as seen in \\"Ace of Squares\\" and \\"Bug City\\". The reason for this might lead back to his own relationship with Bernard. However, by the end of both episodes, he overcomes these urges. He is also convinced of supernatural or above average forces such as in \\"Doorway to Helen\\" (thinking that Helen was communicating to him from another dimension) and \\"The Last Kid in the Creek\\" (believing that he wished he was the only kid in the Creek), despite clear evidence to the more obvious and practical reasoning (Helen has a different schedule from Craig and all the other kids caught a virus from Kit). He can sometimes be pretty close minded as well, as he tends to ignore other people's advice in favor of his own, though he eventually sees reason. Craig maintains a great relationship with his family with the exception of Bernard whom he has a love-hate relationship with. As seen in \\"Bring Out Your Beast\\" however, deep down it is implied that he simply wants to connect with him as his brother had a tendency to push him away when he was younger. The closest relationship he has is with his grandfather, Earl, who seems to have an adventurous spirit similar to Craig. Craig also cares for his two friends Kelsey and J.P. who in return look to him for guidance. He, along with his friends, all seem to be well known at the Creek, most likely for their various heroic endeavors. Craig has been viewed as something of an adviser and aide to the various factions of the Creek and has managed to enter the good graces of many, such as the Sewer Queen. His ability to be diplomatic has allowed him to form the Creek Council, a council consisting of him, Kelsey and J.P. and the leaders of the various factions of the creek. Craig can be stubborn when it comes to maintaining some semblance of his childhood. In \\"The Evolution of Craig\\", he worried that he would turn into someone like Bernard and grow up into someone boring. In \\"Cousin of the Creek\\", he was slightly miffed when his cousin seemed to lack the enthusiasm they once shared when they were younger, though by the end they managed to find common ground. He ultimately wants to maintain his carefree nature throughout his life, but learns that it is also important to show some maturity. He takes his role in the Creek very seriously to the point that he has managed to garner some self-importance. In \\"Tea Timer's Ball\\", he humorously believed that Eliza was trying to get back at him for humiliating her in the past, when in actuality she was trying to get back at Sailor Boy for not being invited to his yacht. He later took comfort in the fact that he had numerous other rivals and enemies at the Creek. Kelsey Pokoly Kelsey Pokoly, sometimes referred to as Kelsey Bern, is a ginger-haired 8-year-old girl who is one of Craig's friends. She is always seen wearing a cape. She has a pet parakeet, which she identifies as a falcon, named Mortimor who is usually perched on top of her head. Kelsey is adventurous and tends to be overly dramatic. She has internal narrations that the others are seemingly aware of. She is raised by her single widower father. Though she apparently won't admit it, Kelsey seems to slightly suffer from loneliness due to always being home alone without any parents to watch her for a long time. In \\"Doorway to Helen\\", it is revealed that Kelsey is Jewish. It is implied that her obsession with fantasy came from her mother, who died sometime ago, and has been inspired to write her own book called Robyn and the Snow Sword. In \\"The Other Side: The Tournament\\", she is revealed to be a fan of the show Steven Universe. Kelsey is under the belief that she is the lead hero in her own story and that one day her adventures will be written down. She carries a sword made from PVC pipe that was \\"bestowed\\" on her by a warehouse worker ironically named Piper. Despite it being a harmless blunt toy, it is shown to be very effective in combat, though it gets destroyed in \\"The Other Side\\" and rebuilt by \\"Camper on the Run\\". She wears a bluish-purple cape that she is seldom seen without and may have possibly come from her mother. Aside from that, Kelsey has a short temper and can be very feisty and curt in situations. Every now and then, she has to be held back by Craig and J.P. whenever she begins to act out. In \\"Kelsey Quest\\", it is shown that whenever she is intimidated or put down, she can become self-degrading and her internal monologues begin to stall. Because of this, she needs the comfort and support of her friends. Kelsey loves her father, who is the only person besides Mortimor who she has to rely on. In return, her father supports her fantasies. Kelsey is very close to Craig and J.P. She views the former as her equal in terms of adventuring and the latter as a simple, naive sidekick of sorts. She nevertheless cares for them dearly. Besides them, she appears to be close friends with Maney of the Horse Girls, who acts as her steed in \\"battle\\", Stacks, who provides interesting talks over various books of fantasy and sci- fi origin, and has shown strong admiration towards Wildernessa and her animal conservationist efforts. In \\"Tea Timer's Ball\\", she learns that a boy named Aaron has a crush on her. Despite accepting his offer to attend a dance, she admits that she does not have any romantic feelings for him, most likely because she does not want to be held down. J.P. Mercer John Paul \\"J.P.\\" Mercer is a tall, Southern accented 10-year-old boy who is one of Craig's friends. He wears a hockey jersey that is clearly too big for him. He is not the brightest kid, as he can be easily duped by others, but is very helpful and kind to those around him. In \\"Under the Overpass\\", Craig stated that he and Kelsey \\"found\\" J.P. through their constant exploration. He maintains an open minded attitude about things and hardly shows any prejudice whatsoever. These traits most likely come from his sister Laura who taught him that \\"all bodies are beautiful\\". He is also more likely to get dirty than either Craig or Kelsey which does not seem to bother him, but does occasionally irritate others. According to his mother, J.P. cannot stand directly in the sun for more than twenty seconds, otherwise \\"he'll combust\\". Due to having a simple mind set, J.P. is at times shown to be incapable of taking care of himself and sometimes needs to rely on his friends for support. On the other hand, he gets along well with younger kids. As J.P. is older than his friends, he does wish to be more responsible as seen in \\"Sunday Clothes\\". He has a much more practical mindset and occasionally shows more discipline as he once berated Craig for getting angry and will at least attempt to take initiative whenever he or Kelsey are not up to the task. He is also willing to put them above anything else and considers them his lifelong companions. He has a mutual attraction to Maney of the Horse Girls. What started as admiration has since evolved into genuine romantic feelings, as the two of them act shy when they are around one another. J.P. surprisingly gets along well with Boris of the Junior Forest Scouts, despite everyone else disliking that group. He also has surprising intuition. During the events of \\"Alone Quest\\", J.P. was able to guess exactly what Kelsey was doing throughout the day with pinpoint accuracy, scaring Kelsey and Craig. In \\"The Evolution of Craig\\", J.P. reveals that he wants to be just like his sister because of how well adjusted she is since graduating high school. He also deeply loves his mother Paula, but is only able to see her late at night when she comes home from flying. Craig's family * Bernard Williams (voiced by Phil LaMarr) ‚Äì Craig's smarter, yet cynical and condescending, 16-year-old brother who looks down on Craig and his adventures at the creek. He is obsessed with getting good grades and getting into an Ivy League college. Despite his studious nature, Bernard has shown to have had a fun and geeky side in the past. He used to play Bring Out Your Beast and showed interest in teaching it to Craig as seen in the episode of the same name. He also seems familiar with the game Power Punchers and plans on teaching it to Jessica. The episode \\"Craig and the Kid's Table\\" reveals that he indeed used to enjoy being with his younger siblings, but while growing up chose to act more mature, or at least what he perceives as mature.

During the summer, she and Bernard work at Pasta La Vista, an Italian restaurant. * Neil Pokoly (voiced by Ian Roberts) ‚Äì Kelsey's widower father who is stern, but caring. He seems very liberal however, as he lets her wear her cape in their family photo. Neil can be rather intimidating, but he is shown to at least adhere to Kelsey's personality.

He seems to lack certain social skills as he tends to be literal and fails to realize that much of his planning is an annoyance to some. * Paula Mercer (voiced by Kari Wahlgren) ‚Äì J.P.'s mother who works as an airline pilot. He rarely gets to see her due to her constant traveling. * Laura Mercer (voiced by Fortune Feimster) ‚Äì J.P.'s older sister who is a nurse and also appears to help care for the family.

He is outgoing and constantly shows off a confidant attitude which usually results in him declaring his own coolness, much to everyone's annoyance. * Angel Jos√© (voiced by Angel Lorenzana) - The 10-year-old Owner of the Creek Daycare, who watches the creek kids younger siblings. * Charmaine (voiced by Charmaine Verhagen) - A girl with big hair that covers her eyes. Bobby dislikes her for ruining his candy. * Nate Moger III (voiced by Tony Revolori) - The owner of the World Creek Pencil Break Federation. He technically holds the title and fought J.P. for it. His pencil is actually a mechanical pen that nevertheless gets destroyed by J.P. * \\"No-Neck\\" Natthew (voiced by Benjamin Valic) - A child who ate pop-rocks and drank soda at the same time resulting in his head exploding. He has become a Halloween legend and is the source of scary stories. People believe that he wears a pumpkin for a head, but actually wears different costumes, such as an astronaut, to hide his headless state. He is very sensitive about his name which he claims is a \\"family name\\". It is ambiguous whether he is truly headless, or simply playing along. * Omar/The Green Poncho (voiced by Robinson) ‚Äì A legendary boy who guards the overpass from intruders. While enigmatic, he considers the Stump Kids his friends. Surprisingly, he finds J.P. hilarious. In \\"Into the Overpast\\", he was shown to have had a much more humorous side and was close friends with Maya. They met young Xavier and became close friends with him. When Xavier ascended the throne, he had Omar and Maya fight for the role of his best friend. While Omar was victorious, he turned down the position and fled to the overpass where he was rescued by the previous Green Poncho, implying that he inherited the role of guardian. Kids from the Other Side The resident children of Herkleston Mills, which sits opposite of Herkleston. They live in a hierarchy type society,similar to a caste system and are led by a king who labels his subjects as \\"Best Friend\\", \\"Buddy\\" and \\"Pal\\" in decreasing order. They are all adorned in clothing resembling plants or flowers (e.g. Cherry Blossom, Coneflower, White Lily, etc.). * King Xavier (voiced by Charles DeWayne) ‚Äì The ruler of Herkleston Mills, the other side of the creek. He typically displays a happy and excited demeanor, giving his subjects balls and candy to their hearts content, but only based on how close of friends he considers them. However, underneath he has a ruthless sociopath, selfish, and dictator like attitude and plots to take over the other side of the creek. In \\"Sugar Smugglers\\", it's revealed that his parents buy him all of the best candy and snacks, which allowed him to bribe more and more kids into building him a kingdom until they were all under his control. He inherited the title of king from his sister Cheyenne when she left for high school. * Maya (voiced by Sydney Mikayla) ‚Äì The King's right-hand woman and his \\"best friend\\" of the hierarchy. She has a cold demeanor and wields a bat as her weapon. She dueled Kelsey in \\"The Other Side\\", easily besting her and destroying her prized sword with her foot. Among her duties is ensuring no other candy or snacks come into Herkleston Mills, so the king can maintain complete control over his subjects. In \\"Into the Overpast\\", she was once close friends with the Green Poncho/Omar and was kicked out of little league because of her feisty demeanor. She became Xavier's friend, but lost her friendship with Omar when they fought to be his right hand. She lost, but Omar decided to flee instead, thus allowing Maya to take up the role. * Shawn (voiced by Croner) ‚Äì A member of the Honeysuckle Rangers and a \\"pal\\" of the hierarchy. He is very feisty and direct, and more willing to get the job done. He displays a form of dominance between him and Raj. While at first antagonistic against Craig, he becomes his ally when he sees through the king's selfishness. * Raj (voiced by Parvesh Cheena) ‚Äì A member of the Honeysuckle Rangers and a \\"pal\\" of the hierarchy. He is very calm, diplomatic and sometimes apologetic. He appears to have romantic feelings for Shawn. He used to be an enemy of Craig, but later becomes his ally. * Keun Sup/The Blur (voiced by SungWon Cho) ‚Äì The Champion of the Cherry Blossoms. He can run at incredible speeds. * Jackie/The Arm ‚Äì The Champion of the Water Lillies. She is tall and lanky and perfect for tossing water balloons with pin point accuracy. * Aggie/The Squashinator (voiced by Fazal) ‚Äì The Champion of the Acorn Knights. She is a rather large girl who rides atop a smaller, slightly diminutive, Acorn Knight. She is very boastful and talks down to others, but is also quite sensitive and cries when she gets hurt. * Cheyenne (voiced by Najja Porter) ‚Äì The former king of the other side and Xavier's older sister. She gave up the title when she entered high school. * Randy (voiced by Burnett) ‚Äì Cheyenne's best friend and right hand. He has a very friendly jock-like personality.

Life Born at Aberystwyth on 5 March 1851, he was the eldest son of Richard Roberts, a timber merchant and shipowner there, and was brought up a Calvinistic Methodist. From a private school at Shrewsbury he went to the Liverpool Institute, and then on to University College, London. Here he distinguished himself in geology; he graduated B.Sc. in the University of London with first-class honours and scholarship in that subject in 1870. In 1871 he entered the University of Cambridge, as foundation scholar of Clare College, graduating B.A. in 1875 as second (bracketed) in the first class of the natural science tripos. He proceeded M.A. at Cambridge and D.Sc. at London in 1878; and was from 1884 to 1890 fellow of Clare College. He became fellow of University College, London, in 1888. Meanwhile, Roberts was lecturer in chemistry at University College, Aberystwyth, during 1877, and in 1884 was appointed university lecturer in geology at Cambridge. He changed direction, with an ambition to organise and develop higher education among the classes that were at that time not touched by the universities. In 1881 he had become assistant and organising secretary to the syndicate at Cambridge which had been formed in 1873 to control the \\"local lectures\\" or 'university extension' work. Here he worked with James Stuart and George Forrest Browne. From 1885 to 1904 he was secretary to the London Society for the Extension of University Teaching, an independent organisation to in the metropolitan area. In 1894 Roberts returned to Cambridge to take charge of the work under the Cambridge syndicate; and eight years later he became the first registrar of the Extension Board in the University of London. In the new University of Wales he served as junior deputy chancellor (1903‚Äì5) and as chairman (1910‚Äì11) of the executive committee of the court, on which he sat as one of the representatives of the college of his native town. He was J.P. for Cardiganshire, and high sheriff of the county (1902‚Äì3). A longtime lecturer for the Gilchrist Educational Trust, Roberts acted as its secretary from 1899 for the rest of his life. He was a student of law at the Middle Temple, but was not called to the bar. He was a broad-based activist for the improvement of educational opportunities, and a liberal in politics. He opposed as inadequate the proposal by Albert Mansbridge to limit working men to non- graduate university courses. In 1911 Roberts was appointed secretary of the Congress of the Universities of the Empire which the University of London, with the co-operation of other British universities, organised for the summer of 1912. In June 1911 he attended a preliminary conference of Canadian universities at Montreal, bur suddenly died of calcification of the coronary arteries at his house at Kensington on 14 November 1911. His body was cremated at Golders Green, and he was subsequently buried with public honours at Aberystwyth. In his memory two scholarships for the encouragement of university extension work were founded by public subscription, the administration of the fund being undertaken by the Gilchrist trustees. Works Roberts wrote: * Eighteen Years of University Extension (1891) * Earth's History: an Introduction to Modern Geology (1893) Family and legacy Roberts married in 1888 Mary, eldest daughter of Philip S.

He was born in the parish of Kirkmichael, Ross-shire, on 29 July 1639. His father, Sir James Fraser, was the second son of Simon, seventh Lord Lovat, by his second wife, Jane Stewart, daughter of James, lord Doun (son of the Earl of Moray). Sir James Fraser, a devout man, was elder for the presbytery of Inverness in the general assembly of 1638 which abolished episcopacy, and sat in several other general assemblies. The son was educated at a grammar school, and suffered much from his father's financial difficulties. At the Siege of Inverness his father Sir James Fraser held Inverness Castle for the Covenanters of the Clan Fraser of Lovat against the royalist James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose. At a very early age he came under deep impressions of religion, abandoned the study of the law, and obtained license as a preacher of the gospel from a presbyterian minister in 1672. Legal Problems Coming under the notice of Archbishop Sharp as a preacher at conventicles, he was ordered to be apprehended in 1674; decreets and letters of inter-communing were passed against him 6 August 1675. He was summoned before the council 29 Jan. 1676‚Äì7, and ordered to be imprisoned on the Bass Rock the next day. He was escorted to the Bass by twelve horsemen and thirty foot. Here he remained two years and a half, being released on giving security for good behaviour in July 1679. He was depressed by the sudden death of his wife in October 1676, and by the many troubles of the time, as well as by his imprisonment. He yet found material for recording in his diary many matters that called for gratitude. While in prison he studied Hebrew and Greek, and gained some knowledge of oriental languages. He wrote also a treatise on justifying faith, of which many editions have been printed. Some of its views in favour of a universal reference in the work of Christ were strongly objected to by certain of his brethren who saw it in manuscript, and it was not till 1722 that the first part was published, the second appearing in 1749. Imprisonment In December 1681 he was again arrested and committed to Blackness Castle as a prisoner until he paid a fine of five thousand marks and gave security either to give up preaching or quit the kingdom. A brother-in-law caused the fine to be remitted, and Fraser was sent out of Scotland. On 21 July 1683 he was ordered to be imprisoned for six months in Newgate, London, for refusing the Oxford Oath. Before 6 July 1687 he returned to Scotland, and was living in the bounds of Lothian and Tweeddale. In 1689 he was minister of Culross, Fife, where he exercised his ministry with diligence and earnestness. He was a member of the assemblies of 1690 and 1692, had a call from Inverness in September 1696, but died in Edinburgh on 13 September 1699. Theology James Fraser is noted for a doctrine of universal atonement although he did not think that all would be saved. There was a Breach in the Reformed Presbyterian Church Synod in 1753 following the publication of the book A Treatise on Justifying Faith by James Fraser of Brea, who had written it while a prisoner on the Bass Rock. The Amyraldian view of the atonement was commended by a number of ministers who for a while set up their own Synod. The theology also caused no small commotion in the Antiburgher Church and Thomas Mair was ejected. Personal life He married (1) 31 July 1672, Isobel (died October 1676), daughter of Sir William Gray of Pittendrum, and widow of William Hamilton, merchant, Edinburgh, and had issue ‚Äî Jean (married as his second wife, 1698, Hugh Bose of Kilravock), died without children; Beatrice (married William Burnet, minister of Falkirk) (2) Christian (died without children about 1696), daughter of John Inglis, minister of Hamilton, and widow of Alexander Carmichael, minister of Pettinain.

Potter (ed.), The Persian Gulf in History (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009), p. 240. It pitted a Portuguese force against a combined force of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and English East India Company (EIC). Although the battle was a draw, the result was the loss of Portuguese influence in the Gulf. The Portuguese had conquered Hormuz in 1507 and ruled it as a vassal state until in 1622 it was conquered by Persia with English assistance. The Portuguese made several efforts to recapture the fortress of Hormuz in the following years. Rui Freire de Andrada, with a force of galleys under his command, was besieging Hormuz and awaiting reinforcements from Portugal when in early 1625 he was forced to raise the fleet by an allied fleet of English and Dutch ships.Niels Steensgaard, The Asian Trade Revolution: The East India Companies and the Decline of the Caravan Trade (University of Chicago Press, 1973), pp. 351‚Äì352. The Anglo-Dutch fleet had intelligence of the arrival at Goa of the Portuguese reinforcements under Nuno √Ålvares Botelho in September 1624. The allied fleet left Surat in India and arrived in the Strait of Hormuz in January 1625, forcing Andrada to lift the siege just weeks before the arrival of Botelho on 10 February. The Portuguese fleet consisted of the eight galleons of Botelho and a fleet of rowed galleys under Andrada. The Anglo-Dutch fleet had eight large and two small vessels. Botelho initiated battle early on 11 February. What followed was \\"one of the biggest sea battles ever fought in Asian waters during that period\\". According to a Portuguese observer, the exchange of gunfire was like the opening of the mouths of Hell and the Persians on shore were stunned. According to the English commander, John Weddell, the Persian governor of Bandar Abbas and the English agent in town watched the battle from their roofs. They counted 16‚Äì17,000 shots fired over two days of fighting, after which the fleets withdrew. Although many ships were heavily damaged, all were afloat. Botelho rejected advice to retreat to the coast of Arabia, preferring to wait out his rivals in case they decided to attack Portuguese Muscat. The rival fleets lay at anchor‚Äîthe Portuguese off Larak Island and the companies under the guns of Bandar Abbas‚Äîuntil later that month, when the companies decided to leave. The Portuguese sallied forth to engage them, but the fighting was inconclusive. Botelho then took the fleet to Muscat for repairs. He reported 130 of his men killed in action. The English and Dutch reported 29 and 45 killed in action, respectively. The difference reflected different tactics.

Prior to his involvement in drug trafficking, L√≥pez Falc√≥n owned a flower business in Miguel Alem√°n. He was part of the cartel during the 1990s and was a trusted enforcer of the former kingpin Gilberto Garc√≠a Mena. L√≥pez Falc√≥n's role in the cartel was managing drug shipments from Tamaulipas to the United States. Security forces believed L√≥pez Falc√≥n was not a violent crime boss; he preferred to indulge in his personal interests, which included promoting music and entertainment, managing his restaurant chains, and running his horse-breeding business. After joining the cartel, he continued to pose as a legitimate businessman to keep a low profile. In the late 1990s, L√≥pez Falc√≥n encountered problems with Garc√≠a Mena, who sought the support of the cartel's leader Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n to oust him. L√≥pez Falc√≥n broke ties with the Gulf Cartel and forged alliances with the Sinaloa, Milenio, and Ju√°rez cartels. The Gulf Cartel reportedly blamed L√≥pez Falc√≥n for the April 2001 arrest of Garc√≠a Mena and plotted to kill him. He fled to Nuevo Le√≥n, where he established his center of operations. L√≥pez Falc√≥n survived an attempt on his life a month later but he was killed in Guadalajara in May 2003. His murder remains unsolved, but investigators believe his killers were probably members of Los Zetas, the Gulf Cartel's former paramilitary group. Personal life and career L√≥pez Falc√≥n, who is commonly referred to by his nickname El Yeyo, was born in Miguel Alem√°n, Tamaulipas, Mexico, in 1965. Before becoming involved in drug trafficking, L√≥pez Falc√≥n owned a flower business in Miguel Alem√°n. He later joined the Tamaulipas-based criminal group the Gulf Cartel and worked as a smuggler under the kingpin Gilberto Garc√≠a Mena (\\"El June\\"). L√≥pez Falc√≥n and Garc√≠a Mena worked with the drug trafficker Fidel Hinojosa (\\"El Choco\\"); Ricardo Garza Manr√≠quez, the former Miguel Alem√°n Public Security Department head; and Zeferino Pe√±a Cu√©llar (\\"Don Zefe\\"), the former head of the Miguel Alem√°n Municipal Police. In the Gulf Cartel, L√≥pez Falc√≥n was reportedly responsible for coordinating drug trafficking shipments from Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, to the United States. In 1999, the Secretariat of National Defense (SEDENA) identified L√≥pez Falc√≥n as a rising drug smuggler. Security forces suspected he kept a low-profile status and posed as a businessman. He used the pseudonyms Gilberto Salinas and Edelio Flores to hide his real identity. L√≥pez Falc√≥n's cousin Rolando L√≥pez Salinas (\\"El Rolis\\") was reportedly his personal assistant. L√≥pez Salinas acted as L√≥pez Falc√≥n's personal bodyguard and head of his security services. Murder operations conducted by L√≥pez Salinas were ordered directly by Garc√≠a Mena; L√≥pez Falc√≥n allowed this because he preferred not to be linked to that part of the business. According to Mexican security forces, L√≥pez Falc√≥n was not known to be a violent criminal leader. He reportedly avoided ordering murders, preferring to focus on drug trafficking and his other interests, which included promoting ranchera music and entertainment, cockfighting, managing his restaurant chains, and equestrianism and horse breeding. His affinity for breeding fine horses earned him the nickname \\"El Se√±or de los Caballos\\" (English: The Lord of the Horses). L√≥pez Falc√≥n was one of the wealthiest people in Miguel Alem√°n; he owned multiple properties, including an estate known as The Bougainvilleas (Spanish: Las Bugambilias), where he hosted the city's anniversary parties and multiple horse-racing events. Garc√≠a Mena and the Miguel Alem√°n mayor Ra√∫l Rodr√≠guez Barrera sometimes attended these events. Other invitees included local officials, members of the Mexican military, and bettors from across Mexico. Authorities suspected his horse-breeding business was a money laundering front and that he used a strawperson to manage it. One of L√≥pez Falc√≥n's last public appearances was on 22 June 2000 when he was seen at the opening of a restaurant in Monterrey; nine pictures of the event were leaked to the Monterrey-based newspaper Diario de Monterrey two years later. L√≥pez Falc√≥n appeared with multiple people, including the Nuevo Le√≥n governor Fernando Canales Clariond. Other attendees included the Santiago mayor Eduardo Manuel Garc√≠a Garza and the priest Alejandro Leal, who conducted the inauguration blessings. L√≥pez Falc√≥n was with his girlfriend Mar√≠a Eugenia Garza D√≠az, the daughter of the restaurant owner. When L√≥pez Falc√≥n was not attending his businesses in Tamaulipas, he spent his time in Texas, where he reportedly continued to run drug trafficking activities. According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, L√≥pez Falc√≥n was a legal U.S. resident and lived at a house in Houston with a female named Yolanda and a male named Roberto P√©rez L√≥pez. Security forces suspected that L√≥pez Falc√≥n used Houston as a safe haven; he had a criminal background in Houston where he was identified as an illegal people smuggler. On his Texas driver's license, his name was listed as Adelio L√≥pez Falc√≥n. He was listed as being tall and weighing . His date of birth was listed as 26 June 1955, whereas in Mexico his year of birth was listed as 1965. The U.S. driver's license was once suspended by a Texan judge; L√≥pez Falc√≥n was released on parole and was re-issued with a new license with the same Houston address.  New alliances  L√≥pez Falc√≥n and Garc√≠a Mena began having disagreements in the late 1990s. The differences started after L√≥pez Falc√≥n began diversifying the Gulf Cartel's portfolio and started smuggling cocaine to the U.S. from Tamaulipas. Garc√≠a Mena primarily smuggled marijuana through this corridor. Garc√≠a Mena sought support from Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, the top leader of the Gulf Cartel, to try to oust L√≥pez Falc√≥n. L√≥pez Falc√≥n sided with L√≥pez Salinas and sought the support of rival organized crime groups. In mid-2000, L√≥pez Falc√≥n and L√≥pez Salinas met with members of the Sinaloa Cartel and brokered a drug deal without the Gulf Cartel's approval. L√≥pez Falc√≥n eventually left the Gulf Cartel and formed an alliance with the Sinaloa Cartel, which promised L√≥pez Falc√≥n larger profits in exchange for allowing them to smuggle drugs in Tamaulipas. This prompted Garc√≠a Mena and the Gulf Cartel to fully cut ties with L√≥pez Falc√≥n and his group. L√≥pez Falc√≥n forged an alliance with the Sinaloa Cartel, Milenio Cartel, and Ju√°rez Cartel, which operated as a triangle organization. In 2000, the Attorney General's Office (PGR) confirmed an alliance between L√≥pez Falc√≥n and Arturo Beltr√°n Leyva, a kingpin who had ties with the drug lords Ismael \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada and Ignacio Coronel Villarreal. According to information provided by United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), L√≥pez Falc√≥n also worked closely with the Milenio Cartel kingpin Armando Valencia Cornelio. L√≥pez Falc√≥n was reportedly the Milenio Cartel's main intermediary in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n. Investigators also believed L√≥pez Falc√≥n allowed the Milenio Cartel to smuggle drugs from Nuevo Laredo to Texas. Intelligence reports, however, indicated Valencia Cornelio did not fully trust L√≥pez Falc√≥n because he believed he was a law enforcement informant. To defend himself from the Gulf Cartel's front, L√≥pez Falc√≥n also sided with Dionisio Rom√°n Garc√≠a S√°nchez (\\"El Chacho\\"), a former state police officer and head of a Nuevo Laredo-based smuggling group known as Los Chachos. Los Chachos had an alliance with the triangle organization L√≥pez Falc√≥n worked with and helped them smuggle drugs in Tamaulipas. Los Chachos also helped L√≥pez Falc√≥n's group fight off the Gulf Cartel's forces in their turf. In his new role, L√≥pez Falc√≥n continued to pose as a legitimate businessman. He was tasked with ensuring his new organization had political support and protection from the police, especially because they were operating in a locale they were not originally from. To gain political support in northern Mexico, L√≥pez Falc√≥n's new leaders tasked him with finding an influential politician to support them. L√≥pez Falc√≥n reached out to the National Action Party (PAN) politician Mauricio Fern√°ndez Garza, who was running for governor of Nuevo Le√≥n in 2003. According to Fern√°ndez, L√≥pez Falc√≥n contacted him in early 2003 for a meeting; L√≥pez Falc√≥n once visited his office to deliver several suitcases filled with U.S. dollars. The money was reportedly intended to help Fern√°ndez finance his campaign in exchange for his political support and permission to operate in Nuevo Le√≥n should Fern√°ndez win the election. Fern√°ndez said he did not accept the money.  Downfall  On 22 September 2000, the Gulf Cartel carried out an armed attack against L√≥pez Salinas in Miguel Alem√°n. He was injured in the attack but his chauffeur H√©ctor Arias was wounded. The attack was presumed to be carried out on Garc√≠a Mena's orders. Five days later, six gunmen were arrested in Ciudad Camargo, Tamaulipas, following an anonymous tip provided to the Tamaulipas State Police. In their confession to the police, the gunmen said they were hired by L√≥pez Salinas and were from the Sinaloan cities of Culiac√°n and Guam√∫chil. They also said they were stationed in Nuevo Le√≥n and ordered to make incursions into Tamaulipas. This alarmed the police of the presence of organized crime members from other turfs outside Tamaulipas. On 27 November 2000, the Miguel Alem√°n Rural Police chief Pablo Gayt√°n Mej√≠a was murdered by four gunmen, presumably on L√≥pez Falc√≥n's orders. Gayt√°n Mej√≠a was reportedly a close friend of Garc√≠a Mena and helped facilitate his drug operations. After the attack, Garc√≠a Mena's henchmen killed the four gunmen. Fearing for his life, L√≥pez Falc√≥n fled Miguel Alem√°n and settled in Monterrey. His family fled the area after learning about his issues with Garc√≠a Mena. L√≥pez Falc√≥n's estate was abandoned but he continued to visit the city discreetly. On 9 April 2001, the Mexican Army arrested Garc√≠a Mena after a week-long manhunt in Guardados de Abajo, Camargo. The Gulf Cartel suspected L√≥pez Falc√≥n plotted against him by informing Mexican authorities of his whereabouts. They also believed the way security forces raided several properties containing drugs and the house where Garc√≠a Mena was hiding was unusually specific, which led them to believe L√≥pez Falc√≥n had betrayed them. The Gulf Cartel thus carried out a search to kill L√≥pez Falc√≥n and other aligned with his faction. To increase law enforcement and media attention against L√≥pez Falc√≥n and several of his accomplices, C√°rdenas Guill√©n's lawyer Juan Jes√∫s Guerrero Chapa leaked a false rumor that L√≥pez Falc√≥n was part of a new Nuevo Le√≥n-based criminal group known as the Monterrey Cartel (Spanish: C√°rtel de Monterrey) to the national press in mid-2001. This media strategy was also employed to help ease the increasing law enforcement pressure the Gulf Cartel was experiencing in Tamaulipas following the arrest of Garc√≠a Mena and to help refocus their efforts against C√°rdenas Guill√©n's turf competitors. Federal and state officials later stated that the Monterrey Cartel did not exist.  Assassination attempt  On 13 May 2001, L√≥pez Falcon attended a Vicente Fern√°ndez music concert inside a cockpit arena in Guadalupe, Nuevo Le√≥n. At around 4:00 am, approximately fourteen gunmen from the Gulf Cartel's former paramilitary group Los Zetas stormed the arena searching for him. Authorities confirmed that the gunmen were carrying AK-47s and .38 calibre firearms, identified themselves as members of the army, and ordered people to stay on the ground. The gunmen entered the arena and fired their guns into the air to create confusion among the attendees and force L√≥pez Falc√≥n to flee outside, where the gunmen planned to kill him. Surveillance videos captured L√≥pez Falc√≥n in the front seats of the event sitting next to a blond woman. He was able to leave before the gunmen entered the arena after his bodyguards alerted him of the presence of armed men outside. L√≥pez Falc√≥n had at least twenty bodyguards posted inside and outside the arena. He left the premises escorted by his gunmen and by merging with the crowd of concert attendees. He did not suffer any injuries. Outside the premises, Los Zetas shot at multiple vehicles and injured a bystander but they failed to kill their intended target. Authorities initially suspected Garc√≠a Mena ordered the attack as retaliation for L√≥pez Falc√≥n's alleged involvement in his arrest. Other authorities suspected C√°rdenas Guill√©n ordered the attack because he saw L√≥pez Falc√≥n as a threat to his hegemony and wanted to eliminate the competition on his turf. Investigators stated the Gulf Cartel was tracking L√≥pez Falc√≥n's whereabouts in Nuevo Le√≥n and were reportedly close to killing him at his home in Monterrey days prior. Upon discovering that L√≥pez Falc√≥n was planning to attend the event that night, the Gulf Cartel mounted an operation against him. Prior to the attack, L√≥pez Falc√≥n was a relatively unknown crime boss outside his area of influence. Los Zetas was also a newly formed group within the Gulf Cartel and was not well known outside Tamaulipas. The attack catapulted to fame both Los Zetas and L√≥pez Falc√≥n to national attention. Among politicians, the incident raised worries about the presence of drug lords in Nuevo Le√≥n and the alleged existence of the Monterrey Cartel. On 3 June 2001, a picture of L√≥pez Falc√≥n sitting in the arena's seats was published by the Monterrey-based newspaper El Norte. A few days later, an anonymous citizen issued a memo to the PGR and El Norte with pictures of L√≥pez Falc√≥n accusing L√≥pez Falc√≥n of being in public places in Miguel Alem√°n with armed men and that local authorities did nothing to stop him. Authorities suspect this memo was submitted by his rivals. Later that month, the PGR and Nuevo Le√≥n authorities confirmed L√≥pez Falc√≥n did not have a pending arrest warrant or a formal indictment at a federal and state level. Both levels of government agreed to work together to formally start an investigation against L√≥pez Falc√≥n's alleged criminal activities. PGR investigator Mario Rold√°n Quirino opened an investigation against him. Rold√°n Quirino, however, was murdered on 21 February 2002.  Aftermath and manhunt  Following the assassination attempt, authorities increased their efforts to arrest L√≥pez Falc√≥n, one of the most-wanted criminals in northern Mexico. On 5 June 2001, the Mexican Army carried out a secret operation in Mier, Miguel Alem√°n, and Camargo to arrest L√≥pez Falc√≥n and suspected Gulf Cartel trafficker Alesio Garc√≠a Pe√±a (\\"El Huarach√≥n\\"). They raided multiple properties, including two houses in Mier tied to Garc√≠a Pe√±a, a ranch owned by Garc√≠a Mena, and a property in Camargo, where they seized of marijuana. The Army also set up a checkpoint in front of L√≥pez Falc√≥n's estate but did not raid it. The PGR confirmed the drugs were not linked to the traffickers for whom they were searching and one person was arrested in the operation. The operation lasted less than a day; the federal troops returned to their barracks before midnight. Local authorities supported the measures carried out by the Army and the PGR, and stated that they expected more secret operations to be carried out in the area in light of the growing presence of organized crime activity in northern Mexico. On 4 August 2001, a shootout between L√≥pez Falc√≥n's and L√≥pez Salinas' gunmen broke out outside a cockfighting arena in Reynosa. According to police reports, the gunmen got into a verbal dispute at the parking lot of the arena after the Bobby Pulido music concert ended. Three people were injured in the attack. Authorities drew similarities with the shootout in Nuevo Le√≥n months prior in which L√≥pez Falc√≥n was targeted. On 30 October 2001, approximately fourteen gunmen stormed an estate in Monterrey to kill Pe√±a Cu√©llar. One person was killed and two others were injured but Pe√±a Cu√©llar was not present when the incident occurred. According to police reports, the attack may have been ordered by L√≥pez Falc√≥n as vengeance after he discovered Pe√±a Cu√©llar had started the rumor that L√≥pez Falc√≥n was responsible for Garc√≠a Mena arrest. Security forces suspected that by framing L√≥pez Falc√≥n, Pe√±a Cu√©llar wanted to earn a high-ranking position within C√°rdenas Guill√©n's chain of command. Garc√≠a Mena had originally framed L√≥pez Falc√≥n as his informant and blamed him for his capture. On 20 November 2001, L√≥pez Falc√≥n's bodyguard Juan Mart√≠nez Torres (\\"El Banano\\") was kidnapped in Miguel Alem√°n. A few days later, L√≥pez Falc√≥n's lead accountant Jaime Barrera Pe√±a was also kidnapped; police suspected they were probably kidnapped by C√°rdenas Guill√©n's faction. On 28 November 2001, eighteen gunmen broke into an estate owned by Raymundo Garc√≠a Sol√≠s, a suspected Gulf Cartel member, in Cadereyta. The gunmen killed one of the property guards and injured two children. The PGR and the Mexican Army raided the property a few days later in search of L√≥pez Falc√≥n, and continued their searches in Monterrey to arrest him and several of his associates, including Mario Ram√≠rez (\\"La Gata\\") and Ren√© Garc√≠a Sol√≠s (\\"La Pata de Garra\\"), Raymundo's sibling. The attack was reportedly carried out on L√≥pez Falc√≥n's orders because Ren√© was linked to Pe√±a Cu√©llar. The gunmen mistook Raymundo's estate for Ren√©'s. On 13 May 2002, the Gulf Cartel kidnapped L√≥pez Falc√≥n's associate Garc√≠a S√°nchez in Monterrey; he was tortured and killed, and his corpse was abandoned in Nuevo Progreso, Tamaulipas, a few days later. Killings and attacks between the Gulf Cartel and L√≥pez Falc√≥n's faction continued in Nuevo Le√≥n through the rest of the year. The escalating dispute between both groups led to additional military deployments of the Mexican Armed Forces in Tamaulipas and Nuevo Le√≥n.  Closing in on L√≥pez Falc√≥n  In late 2002, authorities seized multiple drug shipments reportedly owned by L√≥pez Falc√≥n's group. On 9 October 2002, former Tamaulipas State Police chief Carlos Gonz√°lez Pamatz was arrested in Houston with of cocaine from L√≥pez Falc√≥n's group. The following day, federal policemen stationed in China, Nuevo Le√≥n, arrested suspected drug traffickers Jorge Calzada Garc√≠a and Patricia Rodr√≠guez Madrigal, who were in possession of of cocaine in a vehicle. In their police confession, Calzada Garc√≠a said he was hired by a man named Evelio or Edelio, who went by the alias El Yeyo. He said he did not recall this man's last name. Policemen suspected he was referring to L√≥pez Falc√≥n. Calzada Garc√≠a was paid US$4,000 to transport the drugs; he said he was told to collect the vehicle filled with drugs at a shopping center in San Pedro Garza Garc√≠a and drive it to Reynosa, where he initially brokered the deal and received the vehicle's keys from El Yeyo. Rodr√≠guez Madrigal said she was not aware of the drug deal. The couple was driving a Peugeot that was bought in the state of Jalisco but had Tamaulipas license plates. Investigators began investigating a drug link between Monterrey, Reynosa, and Guadalajara. While facing a judge, however, Calzada Garc√≠a retracted his statement and said he did not recall the exact name of the man who hired him. He said the man's name was Edelio Ram√≠rez or Rodr√≠guez, that his nickname was La Yeya, and that he lived in McAllen, Texas. This was the second largest drug seizure in Nuevo Le√≥n in 2002 and showed the PGR L√≥pez Falc√≥n was likely operating in Monterrey and trying to take over the turf from C√°rdenas Guill√©n. Reynosa was generally considered a turf controlled by C√°rdenas Guill√©n. On 14 March 2003, the Mexican Army arrested C√°rdenas Guill√©n in Matamoros. Prior to his capture, the Gulf Cartel experienced several major blows from law enforcement crackdowns, including the arrests of some of C√°rdenas Guill√©n's lieutenants such as Garc√≠a Mena, Ad√°n Medrano Rodr√≠guez, Rub√©n Sauceda Rivera, and Jos√© Manuel Garza Rend√≥n. Authorities believed C√°rdenas Guill√©n's possible successors were Pe√±a Cu√©llar, V√≠ctor Manuel V√°zquez Mireles, Gregorio Sauceda Gamboa, and Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez. They reiterated that one of the major targets was L√≥pez Falc√≥n, who they regarded as one of the top-three Gulf Cartel leaders in the past two years. They said unlike other gangs like Los Chachos, L√≥pez Falc√≥n had the operational capacity to confront the Gulf Cartel. The Army and the PGR thus refocused their efforts to apprehend him; they feared he had become one of the leading drug lords in northern Mexico and south Texas. They also suspected he no longer lived in Tamaulipas and had relocated to Nuevo Le√≥n, where he reportedly owned several money laundering fronts.  Death  On 6 May 2003, two gunmen murdered L√≥pez Falc√≥n in a restaurant in Guadalajara, Jalisco. The gunmen sat at a table close to L√≥pez Falc√≥n, who was having breakfast with horse breeder √ìscar Alejandro Coker Preciado and an unidentified woman. L√≥pez Falc√≥n finished his food and chatted for over an hour afterwards. When he ordered the check, the gunmen stood up and began walking towards the restroom. On their way, they passed next to the table where L√≥pez Falc√≥n was sitting and shot him from behind. Investigators confirmed L√≥pez Falcon was shot three times in the head at point-blank range and died at the scene. According to investigators, L√≥pez Falc√≥n arrived at the restaurant after being dropped off by someone else. He had no bodyguards with him. Authorities requested the closure of the restaurant until further notice so evidence from the crime scene could be gathered. L√≥pez Falc√≥n was at the restaurant discussing the purchase of a pure-bred horse, which he wanted to take to one of his ranches in Texas. Coker Preciado and L√≥pez Falc√≥n had previously met in Texas and Monterrey. Coker Preciado was unharmed in the attack but suffered a nervous breakdown and was attended to by emergency staff when they arrived at the scene. The other person who was eating with them left moments before the murder. A police officer guarding a nearby bank heard the gunshots; he thought a bank robbery was underway and called for reinforcements. The Guadalajara Municipal Police were the first to arrive at the scene; they discovered L√≥pez Falc√≥n's body sitting next to his table. When he died, L√≥pez Falc√≥n had with him four cellphones, a push-to-talk device, US$1,260 and MXN$6,200 in cash, several credit cards, his Texas driver's license, a Rolex watch, a gold ring and necklace, and a business card from a McAllen-based construction company.  Investigation  When news of the murder was made public, it was not known that the victim was L√≥pez Falc√≥n and/or a suspected crime boss. Preliminary reports described the victim as a businessman from Monterrey; rumors the businessman was a crime boss, likely L√≥pez Falc√≥n himself, began circulating. Mexican authorities doubted the victim was L√≥pez Falc√≥n because they thought it was unusual that he was in Guadalajara, which was far from his center of operations. Investigators had information that he was hiding in McAllen. L√≥pez Falc√≥n's identity card named him by his alternate first name Adelio. Jalisco authorities suspected the victim was probably L√≥pez Falc√≥n and federal authorities did not discard this possibility. His identity was confirmed by the Jalisco authorities on 8 May after they cross-referenced his identity cards with information federal authorities had on file. Jalisco authorities confirmed that L√≥pez Falc√≥n had no pending criminal charges in Jalisco but said he was suspected of being involved in drug trafficking in Tamaulipas and Nuevo Le√≥n. The same day, Jalisco's attorney general Gerardo Octavio Sol√≠s G√≥mez confirmed the PGR was taking over the case and placing it under federal jurisdiction; the case would be headed by the Specialized Unit Against Organized Crime (UEDO), one of the PGR's former branches. State officials requested the PGR's assistance on the case because of L√≥pez Falc√≥n's criminal profile and his alleged involvement in drug trafficking, a crime that falls under federal jurisdiction. The UEDO said the investigation would also include the charges of illegal possession of military-exclusive firearms and organized crime involvement against the suspects. They were expecting Jalisco authorities to open a separate homicide case under state jurisdiction. Federal authorities asked state officials to withhold information about the case from the public and recommended secrecy in the investigation. The federal government dispatched troops from the Federal Investigation Agency (AFI) and the PGR to Guadalajara. They were planning to increase security in Jalisco and Nuevo Le√≥n to prevent a violent response from organized crime groups. L√≥pez Salinas was the suspected successor to L√≥pez Falc√≥n; authorities believed a turf war between his faction and those aligned with C√°rdenas Guill√©n was a possible aftermath. The UEDO also took Coker Preciado to Mexico City for questioning. Coker Preciado confirmed to investigators that there were two gunmen in the attack and that they escaped the crime scene in a white vehicle. Eyewitnesses said L√≥pez Falc√≥n's killers were dressed in white and walked away from the scene after killing him but most were unable to provide investigators with physical descriptions of them. The policeman at the bank said he saw the gunmen; he was the only person who provided the PGR with this information. Some eyewitnesses said a woman arrived at the restaurant moments after the murder to inspect the scene but investigators could not link her with L√≥pez Falc√≥n. At the scene, investigators discovered two .45 pistol bullet casings. According to the PGR and SEDENA, their main line of investigation was that L√≥pez Falc√≥n was killed by members of Los Zetas on C√°rdenas Guill√©n's orders. They suspected Jes√∫s Enrique Rej√≥n Aguilar (\\"El Mamito\\"), Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano (\\"El Lazca\\"), Luis Alberto Guerrero Reyes (\\"El Guerrero\\"), and/or √ìscar Guerrero Silva (\\"El Winniepooh\\") may have participated in the murder. Before joining organized crime, these men were members of the Mexican Army's Special Forces Airmobile Group (GAFE) and were hired by C√°rdenas Guill√©n as part of his security circle. Another line of investigation suggested L√≥pez Falc√≥n may have been killed by a gambling group within the horse-racing or cockfighting industries; he was known for gambling millions on these sports and the police believed the method the gunmen used to kill L√≥pez Falc√≥n was one not usually used by Tamaulipas-based criminal groups. The police did not discard the possibility L√≥pez Falc√≥n may have been betrayed and killed on orders of the Milenio Cartel's leadership circle, or by members of Los Texas, a Nuevo Laredo-based gang that was a rival to both L√≥pez Falc√≥n and the Gulf Cartel.  Body handling and funeral  L√≥pez Falc√≥n's corpse was first kept at the Forensic Medical Service in Jalisco, where authorities expected his family members to reclaim it. They wanted to interview his relatives about the case. On 8 May, a man who identified himself as L√≥pez Falc√≥n's nephew telephoned the morgue asking how to reclaim the body but he did not arrive in person. Another man called the morgue asking for similar details; he grew angry at staff and told them he would forcibly take the body if they did not give it to him. This incident alarmed authorities, and forced them to guard the morgue and L√≥pez Falc√≥n's body using security forces from Guadalajara metropolitan area, the Jalisco State Police, the PGR, and AFI, until further notice. On 9 May, L√≥pez Falc√≥n's sister traveled from Roma, Texas, to Guadalajara to confirm the identity of the corpse. She was accompanied by her two attorneys to start the body reclamation process. The UEDO interviewed his sister before meeting with the Jalisco Institute of Forensic Sciences, who gathered her blood samples and conducted DNA tests on the body. The test results were expected to be ready in one or two weeks, and Jalisco authorities stated that the corpse would not be given to relatives until their family link was confirmed. The PGR were responsible for setting the date when the body would be given to L√≥pez Falc√≥n's family. After the DNA tests, his sister returned to Texas and awaited the notification from Mexican authorities. The police thought his family would hold a wake in Miguel Alem√°n or Mexico City, and that L√≥pez Falc√≥n would be buried in Guardados de Arriba, a rural community in Miguel Alem√°n where his wife, who died in the 1990s, was buried. On 11 May, the Secretariat of Health approved L√≥pez Falc√≥n's transfer; his corpse was flown from Miguel Hidalgo International Airport in Guadalajara to General Lucio Blanco International Airport in Reynosa. The body was then transported to the U.S. and sent to a funeral home in Rio Grande City, Texas, where it was prepared for burial. At Roma‚ÄìCiudad Miguel Alem√°n International Bridge, the Mexican Army set up a checkpoint to search for suspicious vehicles and individuals with drugs or weapons. They questioned drivers about their destination and purpose of their travel, and were wary of vehicles with license plates other than Tamaulipas' and of luxurious vehicles. A wake and mass were held on 12 May; his sister said L√≥pez Falc√≥n would be buried in Roma on 14 May. At the morgue and funeral, his family asked the local police to control attendees' access; visitors were eventually allowed to visit L√≥pez Falc√≥n's services but the police did not allow the media to access the area. Multiple corrido and mariachi songs were composed for L√≥pez Falc√≥n and played during his funeral.

In 2013, De Nardi was appointed professor of economics at University College London; since September 2018, she has been a senior scholar at the Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Her research interests include macroeconomics, public economics, wealth distribution, savings, social-insurance reform, social security, household economics, health shocks, medical expenses, fertility and human capital. De Nardi's research has been published in the Review of Economic Studies, the Review of Economic Dynamics, the Oxford Review of Economic Policy, the Journal of Political Economy and the American Economic Review. Education De Nardi received a B.A. in economics and commerce with highest honours from Ca' Foscari University of Venice in Italy in November 1993. She received an M.A. degree in June 1998 and a Ph.D. in August 1999, both from the University of Chicago. Career After receiving her B.A. degree, De Nardi was a research fellow at Ca' Foscari University of Venice. She became an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in 1998, was an assistant professor in the department of economics at the University of Minnesota from 2000 to 2005, and was a research assistant for Thomas J. Sargent. Before receiving her M.A. degree from the University of Chicago, De Nardi was a teaching assistant at the school. In addition to her appointments at University College London and the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, she has been a faculty research fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research since 2006, an international research fellow at the Institute of Fiscal Studies since 2015, and a research fellow at the Center for Economic and Policy Research since 2016. In 2018, De Nardi became first vice-president of the Midwest Economic Association. She is a coordinator and leader in the Market Network at Human Capital and Economic Opportunity (HCEO). Before moving to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in 2018, De Nardi was a senior economist and advisor in the research department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. She has been an editor of the Review of Economic Dynamics since 2017. Since 2015, De Nardi has been on the editorial board of the Journal of Economic Literature. From 2014 to 2017, she was associate editor of the Journal of the European Economic Association and Fiscal Studies. Articles De Nardi has written over 30 articles on topics including the role of bequests and entrepreneurship in wealth distribution, the medical expenditures of the elderly, the impact of Social Security reform on the general economy, the relationship between fertility and social security, and the effects of estate taxation. \\"Family and Government Insurance: Wage, Earnings, and Income Risks in the Netherlands and the US\\" (2019) De Nardi co-authored the article with Giulio Fella, Marike Knoef, Gonzalo Paz-Pardo and Raun Van Ooijen. It examines the size and distribution of wage shocks and the role of insurance against these shocks in the United States and the Netherlands. Unlike previous papers which explored shocks to individual earnings, De Nardi, Fella, Knoef, Paz-Pardo and Van Ooijen distinguished the mechanisms of shocks in wages and changes in hours. The authors provided data on the distribution of male wages and earnings and their household earnings and income found by analyzing distributional measures of wage changes. The results of their analysis indicated that in both countries, there was evidence of non-linearity and age dependence; high wage and earnings risk existed for people with the lowest and highest wages and earnings. Wage and earnings persistence varied significantly by age; in the Netherlands, income risk is lower for the middle range of income distribution. De Nardi, Fella, Knoef, Paz-Pardo and Van Ooijen found that the government plays a large role in reducing the risk in the Netherlands; in the United States, the role of family in reducing risk is more important. They looked into how much insurance was provided by spousal labor by comparing individual earnings to total earnings at the household level, and how much was provided by the tax and transfer systems. De Nardi, Fella, Knoef, Paz-Pardo and Van Ooijen compared both countries, concluding that the labor supply has little effect on the standard deviation of wages in the Netherlands. They found that taxes and transfers have a greater effect in the Netherlands, reducing inequality and risk in wages and earnings. In the United States, the standard deviation of all income measures was generally higher; there was evidence of volatility in hours (which increased the dispersion of wage changes), and the standard deviation of male earnings had increased. The United States spousal- labor supply played a larger role in reducing the standard deviation of male earnings on all levels of previous earnings; in the Netherlands, that role was played by the government. \\"The Lifetime Costs of Bad Health\\" (2018) Poor health can shorten a person's life expectancy. This article explores the effects of health shocks over a lifetime. Co-authored with Svetlana Pashchenko and Ponpoke Porapakkarm, the article developed a structural framework to help measure the long-term effects of poor health. Considering the fact that inequality can be traced back to factors predetermined early in life, the authors created a model which can yield the short- and long-term dynamics of health and health-related inequality of economic outcomes to measure the lifetime costs of poor health. For their research, De Nardi, Pashchenko and Porapakkarm used three data sets: the Health and Retirement Study, the Medical Expenditure Panel and Survey, and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. They found that individuals were generally willing to pay about five percent of their average income to increase their probability of being healthier by one percent. People in poor health tend to save less, and differences in health are a factor in explaining a large wealth gap. \\"The Aggregate Implications of Gender and Marriage\\" (2018) Margherita Borella, Mariacristina De Nardi, Fang Yang investigate the aggregate importance of gender and marriage. They note that most macroeconomists ignore women and marriage when setting up structural models and when calibrating them using data on men only. Borella, De Nardi, Yang question if by ignoring gender and marriage in both models and data, that implies the resulting calibration matches well the key economic aggregates. They used data from the Panel Study and Income Dynamics and the Health and Retirement Survey for the 1941‚Äì1945 cohort. In their paper, they constructed and calibrated four different economies. Economy 1 uses a standard one-gender, no marriage, lifecycle framework and like usual macro models, they only used data on men for calibration. While Economy 2 is the same model as Economy 1 but instead they calibrated using data on both women and men. Economy 3 uses the same model as both Economy 1 and 2 but now its calibrated by aggregating the data at the household level and using couples instead of singles. Finally, in Economy 4, the model single and married men and women over their whole life cycle. They found that Economy 4 did better than the other economies. Which shows that modelling marriage and gender is important for understanding key economic aggregates over the life cycle. Borella, De Nardi, Yang conclude that macroeconomists should be taking marriage and gender into account in the quantitative structural models. They state that by modelling marriage and gender explicitly would give the best results for matching the aggregates. \\"Inequality and Recessions\\" (2018) In this article, Gene Amromin, Mariacristina De Nardi, Karl Schulze investigated whether the widening gap between the rich and poor has any direct effects on macroeconomic aggregates. They largely focus on the Great Recession. By using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and Credit Bureau Panel Data, they compared consumption and wealth during the Great Recession. Amromin, De Nardi and Schulze argue that the role of borrowing constraints cannot be fully captured by only looking at data where the majority of households have little wealth before the recession. They state that most macroeconomic theories do this. Summarizing two papers, one by Krusell and Smith and another one by Krueger, Mitman and Perri, it is provided evidence to show that inequality can make the effects of a recession even worse. Amromin, De Nardi and Schulze conclude that different measures of household constraints have been permanently increased due to the Great Recession. \\"End-of-life medical spending in last twelve months of life is lower than previously reported\\" (2017) Collaborating with 27 other economists, they measured the composition and magnitude of medical spending in the last three years before death. They took health care data from nine countries: Denmark, England, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Taiwan, United States and Canada(Quebec). The comparison between countries revealed that there is no direct relationship between how a country's health care service are funded and how they are provided. They found the average medical spending per capital in the last twelve months of life is about $80,000 in the United States, $60,000 in the Netherlands and Denmark and $50,000 in Germany. Medical spending in the last twelve months and last three years of life is high. De Nardi, French, et al. recorded that in the last twelve months of life, medical spendings ranged from 8.2 percent in Japan to 22.7 percent in Quebec. Since Hospital spendings make a significant portion of medical spendings in the last twelve months compared to the last three years of life, they saw the medical spendings ranging from 13.5 percent in Japan to 34.9 percent in Taiwan win the last three years of life. They concluded that all nine countries they looked into, the medical spendings at the end of life were high compared to spending at other ages. In the last twelve months of life, they saw medical spending making up most of its aggregate spending. In the United States, it was about 8.5 percent and 11.2 percent in Taiwan. The reduction of medical spending does not effect the total medical spending significantly. De Nardi, French, et al. concluded that instead there should be a reduction in the caring costs for people with chronic conditions. \\"Why do the elderly save? The role of medical expenses\\" (2010) This paper by De Nardi, Eric French and John Bailey Jones construct a model of saving for retired singles that include a mix of different medical expenses and life expectancy. For their paper, they used the Assets and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old dataset (AHEAD). De Nardi, French and Jones only took the data on single retired individuals for their analysis. Which consisted of 3,259 individuals, where 592 were men and 2,667 were women. For their model, they accounted for social insurance programs. Their estimated model shows that the savings of the elderly are largely due medical expenditures. De Nardi, French and Jones predict that the elderly, between the ages of 74 and 84, the median assets for those in the top permanent income quantile see a fall from $170,000 to $130,000. If all medical expenses were to be eliminated, the median asset would fall much more. We would expect it to fall from $170,000 to $80,000. Their results are mainly due to two things. First, even if the elderly had health insurance, the out-of-pocket medical and nursing home expense would still be a large amount. Second, they found that the average medical cost rises significantly with age and income. Their model predicts the average out- of-pocket medical expenses will rise from $1,100 when they are 75 to $9,200 when they are 95. They also found that, a 95 year old in the top quintile of the permanent income distribution is to spend $15,800 on medical expenses. While someone who is the same age but in the bottom quintile of the permanent income distribution is expected to spend $1,700. So medical spending largely effects savings. By properly accounting for old age expenditure on medical care and social insurance programs providing a consumption floor, it can explain the elderly's savings. De Nardi, French and Jones conclude that savings of the elderly are motivated by the medical expenditures and that social insurance affects the saving of both the income-rich and income-poor. \\"Entrepreneurship, Frictions, and Wealth\\" (2006) De Nardi received a research grant from the National Science Foundation Research Grant. She is the principal investigator and conducted the research from 2003 to 2006. De Nardi co-authored this journal article with Marco Cagetti. De Nardi and Cagetti constructed a model that analyzes the role of borrowing constraints as determinants of entrepreneurial choices and the effects it has on wealth inequality and aggregate capital accumulation. They found that more restrictive borrowing constraints created less inequality in wealth holdings but causes a reduction in average firm size, number of entrepreneurs and aggregate capital accumulation. Cagetti and De Nardi show the relationship between entrepreneurship and wealth. From their data, they explain how entrepreneurs are richer than non-entrepreneurs but business owners are much richer than self-employers. The paper notes that many entrepreneurs have potentially high rates of return but are constrained in the amount they can borrow. Since an entrepreneur wealth acts as collateral, the amount that can be borrowed is determined by how rich they are. Cagetti and De Nardi used the assumption where if there is a borrowing constraint, entrepreneurs could sell their idea to someone else that faces less constraint. They show how the main factor in determining the number of entrepreneurs, size of firm, aggregate capital accumulation and overall wealth concentration in the population is due to how stringent the borrowing constraint is and voluntary bequest. They concluded that the main factors can cause issues for policy analysis, such as subsidized loans and taxing bequest. The paper notes that taxing bequest can reduce the amount of entrepreneurial wealth, which affects the amount they can borrow. Resulting in less entrepreneurs. \\"Wealth inequality: Data and models\\" (2008) De Nardi collaborated with Marco Cagetti to summarize the wealth distribution and its economic models in the United States. The majority of the data they used are from the Survey of Consumer Finances. Cagetti and De Nardi explain that all quantitative models of wealth inequality make human capital exogenous and they argue that we should actually take human capital accumulation into consideration when studying savings and wealth inequality. They also point out that some areas in models of inequality can be employed and extended. Cagetti and De Nardi states that it takes a lot of work to fully understand the quantitative importance of each factor in determining wealth inequality. Though there has been great advance in the models, there is still room for improvement in these models in order to apply them to problems where inequality is a key determinant.

William McGill, a friend of her father.McQueen, Page 15McQueen, Page 273. When she died she was the last member of Robert Burns's immediate family and when living at Bridge House in Alloway for the last sixteen years of her life she entertained many visitors who were interested in his life and works. She was the source of many published insights into Burns' life, character and loves. Her siblings knew her as 'Isbal'. Life and background When at Lochlea, Robert Chambers records from her own words \\"Her main occupation was one suited to her tender years ‚Äì that of tending the cattle in the field. Her father would often visit her, sit down by her side, and tell her the names of the various grasses and wild flowers, as if to lose no opportunity of imparting instruction. When it thundered she was sure he would come to her, because he knew that on such occasions she was apt to suffer from terror.\\"Begg, Page 19 She recalled that her mother sand sweetly and had a great fund of ballads and songs, this being a significant influence on Robert. She also emphasised how considerate and supportive she was to her husband.Begg, Page 21 Alloway 'Auld' Kirk ruins. After her father's death the family moved to Mossgiel Farm where she lived and worked for nine years.Begg, Page 23 Gilbert and Isabella are regarded as being very articulate and having a literacy propensity far above the average.Mackay, Page 65 John Wilson of Tarbolton of Dr Hornbook fame was her teacher for a brief period.Begg, Page 3 Robert Bowie from Stewarton became a merchant in Kilmarnock and for some time he courted Isabella however nothing came of it and he never married.Mackay, Page 144 The Begg family moved to Dinning Farm in Closeburn Parish, Nithsdale in 1800, after Gilbert Burns moved from there to Morham Mains in East Lothian. In 1810 the lease expired and John Begg became the land steward for Mr James Hope Vere MP on his estate at Blackwood in Lanarkshire.Begg, Page 27Begg, Page 21 On 24 April 1813, after nearly three years at Blackwood, John met his death when his horse reared and fell on him, crushing him to death. He was returning from his regular trip to Lesmahagow market on a horse that he had been asked to ride because it had become fractious due to lack of exercise.Begg, Page 28 Isabella was left a widow with nine children with ages from three to eighteen. Robert Burns Begg wrote the 'Memoir of Isobel Begg'. For a while Mr James Hope Vere paid her a small annual grant however to make ends meet she opened a dame's school in Kirkmuirhill which she ran for four years.Begg, Page 29 William had qualified for the University of Edinburgh to study for medicine however lack of funds forced him to enter the teaching profession and after working at Dalmeny Academy he became the parish schoolmaster at Ormiston in East Lothian.Begg, Page 29 The whole family moved to Ormiston where Isabella again ran a school. She later moved to nearby Tranent when William resigned his post and supported her family with the help of Agnes and Isabella, working as dressmakers.Begg, Page 31Begg, Page 66 William had emigrated in 1834 and Jane died in July 1822,Begg, Page 44 followed by Edward in March 1824.Begg, Page 46 Isabella Burns Robert Burns Begg, her son, was able to obtain an annuity for his mother which she benefitted from for a number of years, relinquishing it when her circumstances improved.Begg, Page 55 In 1842 Robert Chambers and others secured an income for Isabella, Queen Victoria granting her a pension.Begg, Page 66 in 1843 Dr Chambers also acquired for he the lifetime use of a picturesque cottage on the Belleisle estate on banks of the River Doon.Begg, Page 67 In 1843 the family moved back to Ayrshire and in her final years she lived at Bridge House, Alloway in a small thatched cottage where she died aged eighty-five in 1858. The house no longer stands having been demolished in the 1890s. It was located quite near to the main entrance to Belleisle House and was named after the bridge over the Slaphouse Burn.Boyle, Page 26 In 1846 Isabella and her daughters met the Abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass who had been inspired by Robert Burns and made a special visit to Alloway and recorded the warmth of his welcome in the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave.History Scotland Family As stated, at the age of 22 Isabella married John Begg at Mossgiel Farm on 9 December 1793 and they lived there for seven years. He was an orphan and had been raised by his uncle, a Mr Campbell of Roughdyke Farm in Sorn parish.Begg, Page 26 He is described as a quarrier in Mossgiel in the marriage register. Kinross Isabella had nine children, three girls and six boys : William (1794‚Äì1864), Robert Burns (1798‚Äì1876), John (1796‚Äì1867), Agnes Brown (1800‚Äì1883), Gilbert Burns (1801‚Äì1885), Jane Breckenridge (1804‚Äì1822), Isabella (1806‚Äì1886), James Hope (1808‚Äì1840) and Edward Hamilton (1811‚Äì1824).Westwood (2008), Page 17Westwood (2008), Page 35Westwood (2008), Page 36 William died in Canada after emigrating to America in 1834. Robert Burns on 24 July 1825 married Grace Beveridge in Kinross. He had been a teacher at Dalmeny Academy and became the schoolmaster of Kinross parish and died aged 80 in the schoolhouse.Begg, Page 30 Agnes Brown and Isabella never married, both dying at Bridge House. Gilbert Burns Begg was a Petty Officer in the Royal Navy, serving at Navarino and in the Crimea. James Hope Begg had been a baker's apprentice however he left and joined the 26th Regiment and served in India from 1829 to 1840 however he regiment were sent to China where he was killed on 2 November 1840.Begg, Page 54 John died at Kilmarnock on 11 April 1867. Her son Gilbert Burns Begg is buried in Pollokshaws in the Vennel or Kirk Lane Cemetery and her son John Begg is buried in the Glasgow Southern Necropolis.McQueen, Page 261 Her daughters Agnes and Isabella are buried next to their mother in the old kirkyard at Alloway. Isabella kept in touch with Ann Park's illegitimate daughter Elizabeth 'Betty' Burns who had been brought up by Jean Armour and had married.Begg, Page 37 None of Robert Burns's letters to Isabella are known to survive. Association with Robert Burns Isabella's religious education was partly taught at home by his father, using the A Manual of Religious Belief that William Burnes had written for that purpose, assisted by John Murdoch. Her siblings had been taught with the same manual. Isabella was the source of many published insights into her brother's life and loves,Robert B. Begg, Page 76 in particular she is the sole authority for Burns's first love being Nelly Kilpatrick although she was only around three years of age at the timeMackay, Page 52 and up until then Nelly Blair had been the accepted name of the lady concerned.McQueen, Page 156 Isabella identified 'Montgomerie's Peggy' as the housekeeper at Coilsfield House. She may have been 'Highland' Mary.McQueen, Page 275 Isabella Steven was identified with O Tibbie, I hae seen the day by Isabella.McQueen, Page 281 At times her recollections were manifestly wrong. Signature of Robert Burns Begg, Isabella's grandson. Memorably Isabella was the one who described the deathbed scene of her father on 13 February 1784 when he advised ..to walk in Virtue's paths and to shun every vice and intimated that there was a member of his family whose future conduct he feared. Her brother Robert asked Oh, father, is it me you mean? His father said it was and Isabella recollected that he turned towards the window with tears streaming down his face and his chest heaving with barely suppressed emotion.Begg, Page 20 Isabella's daughter of the same name wrote to Dr Chambers and informed him that it was her Uncle Gilbert and his sisters who were set against Robert marrying Elizabeth Paton.Hogg, Page 68 Isabella provided the name Alison Begbie, the lady who refused his marriage proposal, to the Burns biographer Robert Chambers when she herself was 76 years of age, recollecting events and details from when she was only 9 or 10 years old.MacKay, Page 83 Research by the author James Mackay suggests that 'Elison Begbie' was more likely to be a confused recollection of the name Elizabeth Gebbie, a surname which does appear in the Galston parish register. For the four years that Burns remained at Mossgiel Farm he would ask Isabella to sing through the words of the songs he was composing and Isabella also recalled secretly reading the poems that Robert would write on a slate in his room after his mid-day meal having composed them in his head in the morning. Robert may have become aware of this as he starting using a simple code in parts of his compositions.Mackay, Page 143Begg, Page 24 Her brother died when she was twenty-five years old. In the autumn of 1786, Isabella recalled the delivery of a letter that clearly caused Robert considerable distress and this is thought to be news of the death of 'Highland' Mary Campbell.Mackay, Page 208 Whilst at Lochlea Farm Robert wrote a story, The marriage of Robin Redbreast and Jenny Wren, for his young siblings which Isabella remembered and told to Dr Chambers in 1850/51. The story was published in Chamber's Nursery Rhymes of Scotland.Boyle, Page 27 The grave of Isabella and her daughters Isabella and Agnes in Alloway Auld Kirk. On 10 June 1844 Isabella, now living in Ayrshire, was part of a family reunion in which her nephews Robert, William Nicol Burns and James Glencairn Burns met together on the banks of the Doon in what was a great public event with at least eighty thousand in attendance.McQueen, Page 30Begg, Page 69 A jotting-book used to record simple transactions by William Burness also had records by Robert and Isabella was in the habit of cutting out sections of the jotter for souvenir hunters who visited her at her Belleisle home.Mackay, Page 70 She recalled that Robert never gained any proficiency with the fiddle or the German flute.Mackay, Page 79 Robert Chambers donated the ¬£300 profits from his 1851 four volume book The Life and Works of Robert Burns to Isabella's two daughters in order to secure their future financial security.Begg, Page 76 In 1891 Robert Burns Begg, Isabella's grandson, privately published for the family a Memoir of Isobel Burns, signed and numbered by him. In 1894 this was reprinted for general circulation. It is not clear why her name was shortened to 'Isobel' as she signed her letters 'Isabella', however her family knew her as 'Isbal'.Purdie, Page 62 The book was dedicated to his father and namesake, Robert Burns Begg. In 1843 David Octavius Hill photographed her when she was seventy-two, the only one of Robert Burns' siblings to be so. At the age of seventy-seven a life-size half portrait of Isabella was painted in oil by William Taylor of Ayr, another having been painted earlier by William Bonnar of Edinburgh.Begg, Page 58 One time Confederate President Jefferson Davis visited Alloway and the Misses Begg invited him to tea. Upon arrival he foud that they had put up his portrait in their cottage.McGinn, Clark. Robert Burns and the American Civil War.

Localities within counties that have adopted such resolutions are not displayed in this map. Second Amendment sanctuary, also known as a gun sanctuary, is a state, county or locality in the United States that has adopted laws or resolutions that prohibit or impede the enforcement of certain gun control measures perceived as a violation of the Second Amendment such as universal gun background checks, high capacity magazine bans, assault weapon bans, red flag laws, etc. Although other jurisdictions had previously adopted legislation now characterized as creating Second Amendment sanctuaries, the Carroll County, Maryland Board of Commissioners is thought to be the first body to explicitly use the term \\"sanctuary\\" in its resolution on May 22, 2013, and Effingham County, Illinois County Board is thought to have popularized the term on April 16, 2018. Examples of the resolutions include the Second Amendment Preservation Ordinance in Oregon, and the Second Amendment Protection Act in Kansas. The term \\"sanctuary\\" draws its inspiration from the immigration sanctuary cities movement of jurisdictions that have resolved to not assist federal enforcement of immigration laws against illegal aliens.  State laws  Although the Obama-era state laws listed below were approved prior to the adoption of the term \\"sanctuary\\" in reference to legislation resisting the enforcement of gun control laws they are now frequently characterized as part of the Second Amendment sanctuary movement.  Alaska  On July 9, 2010, Governor Sean Parnell signed the Alaska Firearms Freedom Act (HB 186), declaring that certain firearms and accessories are exempt from federal regulation. On September 10, 2013, Parnell signed HB 69, which amended and expanded HB 186.  Idaho  On March 19, 2014, Governor Butch Otter signed SB 1332 to protect Idaho law enforcement officers from being directed by the federal government to violate citizens' rights under Section 11, Article I of the Idaho Constitution. Previously, HJM 3 was passed in 2009.  Kansas  On April 16, 2013, Governor Sam Brownback signed the Second Amendment Protection Act.

She is Head of Mammalian Behaviour & Evolution. She studies scent communication between mammals, as well as animal welfare and pest control. She served as the President of the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour from 2010 to 2012.  Early life and education  Hurst earned her bachelor's degree in science at the University of Birmingham. She was inspired to study behavioural ecology after reading Mice All Over by Peter Crowcroft. She earned her PhD in 1984 on the behavioural ecology of the house mouse Mus domesticus. During her PhD she watched wild mice in agricultural buildings, studying their social organisation and ability to live at such high population densities.  Research and career  Hurst joined the University of Nottingham as a postdoctoral researcher in 1985, obtained a Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) Postdoctoral Research Fellowship from 1986 to 1988, a SERC Advanced Fellowship from 1989 to 1984 and an Agricultural and Food Research Council (AFRC)/BBSRC Advanced Fellowship from 1994 to 1998. Hurst works on the mechanisms and evolution of scent communication in animals. She is interested in the roles of volatile and non-volatile scents. She was appointed the William Prescott Professor of Animal Science at the University of Liverpool in 1998 and Head of Mammalian Behaviour & Evolution Group. Her main research interests are in the chemobiology of competitive signalling in mammals. Hurst became interested in the signals that determine animal mate choice. She is interested in how scents are used in sexual communications. She demonstrated that the quality of an animal's odour determines the chances that it will be selected as a mate. She found that female mice prefer to nest with their sisters, irrespective of whether they knew each other before. Specifically, female house mice prefer partners that share their own major urinary protein genotype. In the absence of this phenotype match, females preferred partners with whom they share multiple-loci across the genome. Hurst identified a non-volatile pheromone that was released in male urine that female mice find highly attractive. She went on to find that this pheromone was a major urinary proteins (MUP20), which she called darcin named after Mr. Darcy in Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice. Hurst went on to establish that this pheromone could stimulate both short and long-term learning and that darcin and other major urinary proteins influence the odour signature that female mice learn. She also showed that darcin increased neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus. and has been involved with work that has identified a genetically determined circuit-extending from the accessory olfactory bulb to the posterior medial amygdala mediating all behavioural responses to darcin. She found that female mice are more attracted to male mice with their own territory. She found that darcin and other major urinary proteins influence the odour signature that female mice learn. She edited volume 11 of Chemical Signals in Vertebrates that followed a conference of the same name in Chester, UK. Professor Jane Hurst, William Prescott Professor of Animal Science Her research is directed in part to the development of humane control of rodent pests. She also identified non-aversive handling methods that would reduce anxiety in mice, allowing them to be more reliable in laboratory tests. Hurst developed the use of mouse-friendly handling tunnels, reducing their anxiety and allowing them to explore more during animal testing. Hurst is also interested in how animals can detect scent-cues of ill- health and disease. ] For this work, she was awarded the NC3Rs prize in 2010. Hurst is also interested in how animals can detect scent-cues of ill-health and disease. In 2010 Hurst was appointed President for the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour (ASAB).

In the late 19th century it was briefly the object of German colonial initiatives. German interests in Mahinland Mahin on a map by Hugo Z√∂ller (1885) The Hamburg businessman had a trading post in the British colony of Lagos and wanted to extend its interests in palm oil to the east along the coast and into the interior. He therefore hired a number of agents, including the explorer Gottlob Krause to conduct negotiations with local rulers. From May 1884 Krause and Heinrich Bey, who was both German consul and agent for G. L. Gaiser, opened friendly discussions with the rulers of Mahin and a trading post was opened in Akpata. On 23 August 1884 Bey met Gustav Nachtigal, the Imperial Commissioner for German West Africa in Lagos and tried to convert these friendly agreements into sovereign treaties. On 15 December 1884 Bey moved the firm‚Äôs steamer the Tender into the Artijere lagoon where it remained as a hulk. On 14 January 1885 one of Gaiser‚Äôs agents, Zimmer, asked Gustav Nachtigal, then in Kamerun, to assure German protection for their property. German traders supported this request as they wanted to ensure their goods could reach the upper Niger region free of the duties applied by the British in the areas they controlled. Since 1882 the coast between Lagos and Cameroon had fallen under the jurisdiction of the British consul in Calabar, although it was too large for Britain to be able to exercise effective control over it.Pierre Bertaux: Afrika ‚Äì Von der Vorgeschichte bis zu den Staaten der Gegenwart. Weltbild, Augsburg 1998, , S. 232. On 18 January 1885 another of Gaiser‚Äôs agents, Eugen Fischer reached a private agreement with the Amapetu (king) of Mahin, granting sovereign rights to G. L. Gaiser over fifty miles of coastal land to the east of Lagos. On 20 January 1885 Nachtigal steamed from Victoria (today Limbe, Cameroon) to Gogoro in the western Niger with the (de) SMS M√∂we and the Gaiser, accompanied by the explorer and journalist Hugo Z√∂ller.Max Buchner: Aurora Colonialis ‚Äì Bruchst√ºcke eines Tagebuches aus dem ersten Beginn unserer Kolonialpolitik 1884/1885. Piloty & Loehle, M√ºnchen 1914, S. 214 f. (unver√§nderter Faksimilereprint, Fines Mundi, Saarbr√ºcken 2016). With Z√∂ller accompanying them, Gustav Nachtigal and Eugen Fischer concluded a treaty of protection over Mahinland with the Amapetu on 29 January 1885 (some sources say 25 January). According to German sources the treaty covered lagoon, forest and swamp areas with stilt dwellings, in which 8-10,000 people lived.Hugo Z√∂ller: Die deutschen Besitzungen an der westafrikanischen K√ºste ‚Äì II. Die deutsche Kolonie Kamerun. Teil 1, Verlag von W. Spemann, Berlin und Stuttgart 1885, 67 ff. The village of Mahin, where the Amapetu lived, was sprawling and prosperousZ√∂ller 1885, S. 78. although the other settlements were less significant. These included Gogoro in the coast, and Aboto (or Agboto), where the most important subchiefs lived.Z√∂ller 1885, S. 79. in return for ceding his land the Amapetu was given silk, liquor, 20 pounds sterling and a Reichsadler inscribed with the words King of Mahin. British response and final agreement The British authorities in Lagos recognised the German agreements and the British governor was ready to enter into bilateral negotiations. On 11 March 1885 Nachtigal confirmed that the German protectorate extended over the ‚Äústretch of coast in Mahinland known as Mahin beach‚Äù from Abejamura to Abotobo. Wagner 2008, S. 374. The protectorate was conditional on ratification by the German government within 18 months. Chancellor Otto von Bismarck regarded territories such as Mahinland and in Southwest Africa, which he did not even bother to take under formal protection, as useful bargaining chips in his negotiations with the British; he did not see colonies as valuable in themselves. He therefore instructed Nachtigal to avoid ‚Äúany further steps with regard to Mahin.‚Äù During the negotiations leading to the Anglo-German agreement of 29 April 1885 Mahinland was traded for British recognition of the German protectorate over Cameroon. Germany undertook not to establish any protectorates between Lagos in the west and Rio del Rey in the east, while Britain had already guaranteed the free navigation of the Niger at the Berlin Conference. On 24 October 1885 Mahinland was formally handed over to the British. Gaiser received no compensation as ta trade was unimpeded.  Mahin today  Today Mahin lies in the Nigerian state of Ondo.

PyClone outputs clusters of variants based on calculated cellular frequencies of mutations.  Background  Clonal evolution model According to the Clonal Evolution model proposed by Peter Nowell, a mutated cancer cell can accumulate more mutations as it progresses to create sub-clones. These cells divide and mutate further to give rise to other sub-populations. In compliance with the theory of natural selection, some mutations may be advantageous to the cancer cells and thus make the cell immune to previous treatment. Heterogeneity within a single cancer tumour can arise from single nucleotide polymorphism/variation (SNP/SNV) events, microsatellite shifts and instability, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), Copy number variation and karyotypic variations including chromosome structural aberrations and aneuploidy. Due to the current methods of molecular analysis where a mixed population of cancer cells are lysed and sequenced, heterogeneity within the tumour cell population is under-detected. This results in a lack of information on the clonal composition of cancer tumours and more knowledge in this area would aid in the decisions for therapies. PyClone is a hierarchical Bayes statistical model that uses measurements of allele frequency and allele specific copy numbers to estimate the proportion of tumor cells harboring a mutation. By using deeply sequenced data to find putative clonal clusters, PyClone estimates the cellular prevalence, the portion of cancer cells harbouring a mutation, of the input sample. Progress has been made for measuring variant allele frequency with deep sequencing data but statistical approaches to cluster mutations into biologically relevant groups remain underdeveloped. The commonness of a mutation between cells is difficult to measure because the proportion of cells that harbour a mutation doesn't simply relate to allelic prevalence. This is due to allelic prevalence depending on multiple factors such as the proportion of 'contaminating' normal cells in the sample, the proportion of tumor cells harboring the mutation, the number of allelic copies of the mutation in each cell, and sources of technical noise. PyClone is among the first methods to incorporate variant allele frequencies (VAFs) with allele-specific copy numbers. It also accounts for Allelic Imbalances, where alleles of a gene are expressed at different levels in a given cell, which may occur in the cell due to Segmental CNVs and normal cell contamination.  Workflow   Input  diagram showing the workflow of PyClone to cluster tumour mutations PyClone requires 2 inputs: # A set of deeply sequenced mutations from one or more samples derived from a single patient. Deep sequencing, also referred to as high throughput sequencing, uses methods such as sequencing by synthesis to sequence a genomic region with high coverage in order to detect rare clonal types and contaminating normal cells that comprise as little as 1% of the sample. # A measure of allele specific copy number at each mutation location. This is obtained from microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization or whole genome sequencing methods to detect chromosomal or copy number changes.  Statistical modeling  For each mutation, the PyClone model divides the input sample into three sub-populations. The three sub-populations are the normal (non-malignant) population consisting of normal cells, the reference cancer population consisting of cancer cells wild type for the mutation, and the variant cancer cell population consisting of the cancer cells with at least one variant allele of the mutation. PyClone implements four advances in its statistic model that were tested on simulated datasets :  Beta- binomial emission densities  Beta-binomial Emission Densities are used by PyClone and are more effective than binomial models used by previous tools. Beta-binomial emission densities more accurately model input datasets that have more variance in allelic prevalence measurements. Higher accuracy in modeling variance in allelic prevalence translates to a higher confidence in the clusterings outputted by PyClone.  Priors  PyClone acknowledges that some geometrical structures and properties, such as copy number, of the clonal population to be reconstructed is known. When not enough information is available or taken into account, the reconstruction is usually of low confidence and many solutions are possible. PyClone uses priors, flexible prior probability estimates, of possible mutational genotypes to link allelic prevalence measurements to zygosity and copy number variants and is one of the first methods to incorporate variant allele frequencies (VAFs) with allele- specific copy numbers.  Bayesian nonparametric clustering  Instead of fixing the number of clusters prior to clustering, Bayesian nonparametric clustering is used to discover groupings of mutations and the number of groups simultaneously. This allows for cellular prevalence estimates to reflect uncertainty in this parameter.  Section sequencing  Multiple samples from the same patient can be analyzed at the same time to leverage the scenario in which clonal populations are shared across samples. When multiple samples are sequenced, subclonal populations that are similar in allelic prevalence in some cells but not others can be differentiated from each other.  Output  PyClone outputs posterior densities of cellular prevalences for the mutations in the sample and a matrix containing the probability any two mutations occur in the same cluster. Estimates of clonal populations from differing cellular prevalences of mutations are then generated from the posterior densities.  Applications  PyClone is used to analyze deeply sequenced (over 100√ó coverage) mutations to identify and quantify clonal populations in tumors. Some applications include: Using PyClone to track clonal composition of subsequent tumour grafts Xenografting is used as a reasonable model to study human breast cancer but the consequences of engraftment and genomic propagation of xenografts have not been examined at a single-cell resolution. PyClone can be used to follow the clonal dynamics of initial grafts and serial propagation of primary and metastatic human breast cancers in immunodeficient mice. PyClone can predict how clonal dynamics differ after initial engraftment, over serial passage generations. Circulating tumour DNA (plasma DNA) Analysis can be used to track tumour burden and analyse cancer genomes non-invasively but the extent to which it represents metastatic heterogeneity is unknown. PyClone can be used to compare the clonal population structures present in the tumour and plasma samples from amplicon sequencing data. Stem and metastatic-clade mutation clusters can be inferred using PyClone and then compared to results from clonal ordering. Serial Time Point Sequencing: PyClone can be used to study the evolution of mutational clusters as cancer progresses. With samples taken from different time points, PyClone can identify the expansion and decline of initial clones and discover newly acquired subclones that arise during treatment. Understanding clonal dynamics improves understanding on how related cancers such as MDS, MPN and sAML compare in risk and give insight on the clinical significance of somatic mutations. Section sequencing: PyClone is most effective for section sequencing tumor DNA. Section sequencing is when samples are taken from different portions of a single tumour to infer clonal structure from differential cellular prevalence. An advantage of section sequencing is more statistical power and information on the spatial position and interactions of the clones, uncovering information on how tumors evolve in space.  Assumptions  A key assumption of the PyClone model is that all cells within a clonal population have the same genotype. This assumption is likely false since copy number alterations and loss of heterozygosity events are common in cancer cells. The amount of error introduced by this assumption depends on the variability of genotype of cells in the location of interest. For example, in solid tumors the cells of a sample are spatially close together resulting in a small error rate, but for liquid tumors the assumption may introduce more error as cancer cells are mobile. Another assumption made is that the sample follows a perfect and persistent phylogeny. This means that no site mutates more than once in a clonal population and each site has at most one mutant genotype. Mutations that revert to normal genotype, deletions of segments of DNA harbouring mutations and recurrent mutations are not accounted for in PyClone as it would lead to unidentifiable explanations for some observed data.  Limitations  In order to obtain input data for PyClone, cell lysis is a required step to prepare bulk sample sequencing. This results in the loss of information on the complete set of mutations defining a clonal population. PyClone can distinguish and identify the frequency of different clonal populations but can not identify exact mutations defining these populations. Instead of clustering cells by mutational composition, PyClone clusters mutations that have similar cellular frequencies. In sub-clones that have similar cellular frequencies, PyClone will mistakenly cluster these subclones together. Chances of making this error decreases when using targeted deep sequencing with high coverage and joint analysis of multiple samples A confounding factor of the PyClone model arises due to imprecise input information on the genotype of the sample and the depth of sequencing. Uncertainty arises in the posterior densities due to insufficient information on the genotype of mutations and depth of sequencing of the sample. This results in relying on the assumptions made by the PyClone model to interpret and cluster the sample.

Functional studies suggest that the ropB multigene regulon is responsible for not only global regulation of virulence but also a wide range of functions from stress response, metabolic function, and two-component signaling. Structural studies implicate RopB‚Äôs regulatory action being reliant on a complex interaction involving quorum sensing with the leaderless peptide signal SpeB-inducing peptide (SIP); acting in conjunction with a pH sensitive histidine switch. See Photo: File:Crystal Structure of RopB.png  Discovery  Observations of an extracellularly secreted glucosyltransferase (gtfG) sequentially proximal to and activated by an rgg gene with inverted repeats in the intergenic region of Streptococcus gordonii served as a basis for studying its homology between Streptococcus pyogenes. It was discovered that S. pyogenes also shared an rgg/ropB gene located directly next to the subject of its transcriptional regulation, in this case SpeB protease, with intergenic inverted repeats. Confirmation of linkage between rgg/ropB and speB secretion activation was achieved by means of ropB insertional disruption which resulted in decreased speB production.  Structure   Gene location  The location of the ropB gene is directly and sequentially proximal to the subject of its transcriptional regulation (speB) which lies downstream of a 941 bp intergenic region between the two. Transcription of the ropB gene seems to necessitate a promoter within a series sequences between 238-480 bp and up to 800 bp upstream of the gene itself inside the highly repetitive intergenic region.  Protein binding location  The RopB protein binding location lies adjacent to speB promoter 1 that is also located within the highly repetitive intergenic region, however the ropB gene and the speB gene are transcribed in opposite directions. The -10 and -35 regions of speB promoter 1 have poor consensus; in order to ameliorate this, the RopB aids the RNA polymerase bondage with the help of a polyU polypyrimidine tract inside the palindromic inverted repeat region in a fashion uncannily similar to intrinsic termination in E.coli.  Protein domains   N-Terminal  The N- terminal domain consists of amino acids 1-56 and is an amino terminal responsible DNA-binding and is a key mediator in the linkage between the C-terminal domain of the opposite dimer. The dimer interface II has its I255 side chain located in the N-terminal.  C-Terminal  The C- terminal domain, also known as RopB-CTD is a carboxy terminalligand-binding domain made of amino acids 56‚Äì280. RopB-CTD houses 5 TPR motifs and attaches to the SIP peptide in the innermost part of the SIP binding pocket in a sequence-specific manner without induction of polymerization.  TPR domain  The tetratricopeptide repeat domain provides the concave surface necessitated for SIP recognition. RopB-CTD houses 5 stacked TPR motifs, each having sets of paired antiparallel helices that aid in the formation of a concave inner pathway and a convex exterior. The base of the recognition site is constructed by Œ±6 and Œ±8 helices [See Also: alpha helix], while the supporting walls are constructed from helices Œ±2, and Œ±12. The exterior portion of the recognition site is flanked by asparagines N152 and N192 thus providing a ridge of support for the peptide-protein complex.  Dimer interface  The dimer interfaces of RopB are constructed by a union of the Œ±8 - Œ±12 helices of the N- terminal domain and the C-terminal domain. Additionally, there is an Interface I forged from 3 side chains (C22, Y224, and R226), an Interface II forged from 1 side chain (I255), and N- terminal domains that are all responsible for dimerizing RopB protein subunits together.  Peptide binding pocket  The SIP peptide binding pocket is the docking station of the eight amino acid leaderless peptide signal, SpeB-inducing peptide (SIP). The binding pocket is a tripartite construction of the C-terminal‚Äôs Œ±12 helix which is a capping helix, TPR3‚Äôs Œ±6 helix that has a hydrophobic interplay with SIP sidechains, and TPR 4‚Äôs Œ±8 helix which electrostatically stabilizes SIP. Variations in pH level altered strength of adherence between SIP and the SIP binding pocket with acidic pH levels between 5.5 and 6.5 enhancing adherence and pH levels between 7 and 9 reducing adherence.  Histidine switch  Though the RopB protein has 7 histidines (H12, H81, H93, H144, H265, H266, and H277) structurally present, the RopB histidine switch primarily operates with a single functionally involved histidine (H144) conveniently placed to associate with RopB sidechains (Y176 and E185) that near each other upon the addition of a hydrogen ion to H144 in acidic conditions. Only one histidine (H12) is located on the N-domain while the rest lie in the C-terminal domain.  Regulon kinetics  Streptococcus pyogenes has evolved an interwoven complex of gene regulatory mechanisms in the SIP signaling pathway by implanting a pH sensitive histidine switch onto the quorum-sensing RopB protein. During the neutral to basic pH conditions whether synthetically induced or naturally caused by low population density of S. pyogenes, the interaction between the unprotonated functionally involved histidine (H144) with relevant sidechains (Y176, Y182, E185) in the SIP binding pocket domain is impaired and SpeB protease expression is inhibited. On the other hand, as extracellular pH decreases to be more acidic in cases of high population density, S. pyogenes has no elaborate pH homeostatic capabilities relative to non-lactic bacteria, therefore intracellular cytosolic pH levels will more easily resemble extracellular levels. Cytosolic acidification mobilizes the SIP pathway to allow for the SIP-RopB protein complex to form and increasing SIP production. Furthermore, increased cytosolic acidity enhances the maturation of SpeB zymogen (SpeBz) into mature SpeB protease (SpeBm) to dramatically increase its proteolytic activity and virulence.  Homology   Rgg family  Rgg-like transcriptional regulators can be found in a variety of gram-positive bacteria Where RopB regulates SpeB protease production in S. pyogenes, a roughly equivalent secretory control mechanism can be seen in Rgg‚Äôs regulation of GtfG glucosyltransferase production in S. gordonii, in the manner in which gadR regulates acid resistance in Lactococcus lactis, how lasx regulates expression of lantibiotic lactocin S in Lactobacillus sakei, and MutR‚Äôs regulation of mutacin in S. mutans Sequentially, these genes are all localized contiguously to their respective subject of regulation and share promoters localized contiguously to inverted repeat regions.  RRNPP family  Characterization of the RRNPP family of quorum sensing regulators (which stands for proteins Rap, NprR, PrgX, PlcRd) were used in comparisons with RopB to postulate its structural functions. The Rap protein derived from Bacilli regulates sporulation, the NprR protein in Bacillus thuringiensis regulates necrotrophism, the PrgX protein regulates conjugation in Enterococcus faecalis, and PlcR protein regulates transcription of virulence factors in both Bacullis thuringiensis and Bacillus cereus. Similarities were observed in conserved asparagine residues on the TPR motifs of each of these proteins and in RopB.  Quorum sensing  Quorum sensing regulates a menagerie of aspects in Firmicutes including the production of RopB-like proteins in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Similarities in the pH sensitivity of the cell signaling mechanisms were found in pneumococci, S. mutans, and Staphylococcus aureus as well.  pH sensitive histidine switch  Amongst Rgg-like proteins, it has been observed that the pH sensitive histidine (particularly H144) and interacting amino acids (Y176, Y182, and E185) of RopB of Streptococcus pyogenes are conserved in S. porcinus, S. psuedoporcinus, S. salivarius , L. pentosus, Enterococcus sp., L. aviaries, E. faecalis, and L. reuteri. Thus, suggesting the usage of a pH sensitive histidine switch complex with gene regulating effector molecules in a slew of other bacteria [See Also: allosteric regulation].  Pathogenesis  RopB regulation speB is a key determinant in the expression of the SpeB proteinase which is a primary virulence factor and the most abundant extracellular protein in Streptococcal secretions. SpeB cleaves host serum proteins that make up the human extracellular matrix and bacterial proteins including other secreted Streptococcal proteins. As previously mentioned, it is responsible for the dissemination of a host of infectious diseases including but not limited to pharyngitis, impetigo, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis, and scarlet fever.

He participated in 11 polar expeditions, including the first Chinese expeditions to Antarctica and the North Pole. He was a professor and doctoral advisor at Wuhan University, and was a recipient of the Ho Leung Ho Lee Prize in Earth Sciences.  Biography  E Dongchen was born on 15 July 1939 in Guangfeng, Jiangxi, Republic of China, in the midst of the Second Sino- Japanese War. When he was a child, his grandmother and father were killed by Japanese troops, and he worked as a cowherd to make a living. After the end of the wars and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, an elementary school was opened in his village in 1950 and he attended school for the first time at the age of 11. He excelled in school, and was admitted to the Wuhan Institute of Surveying and Mapping in 1960. After graduating in 1965 with a degree in astronomical and geodetic survey, he taught at a military academy and his alma mater, which was later merged into Wuhan University to become its School of Geodesy and Geomatics. The Great Wall Station in 2011 In 1984, E joined China's first expedition to Antarctica under Guo Kun, and led the surveying and mapping team. His team surveyed more than 1,600 points, and the expedition constructed China's first Antarctic research base, the Great Wall Station, which was opened on 20 February 1985. Four years later, he joined another expedition and participated in the construction of China's second Antarctic base, the Zhongshan Station. When China sent its first scientific expedition to the North Pole in 1999, E joined the team at the age of 60. He was the only scientist who participated in building all three Chinese polar research bases and the first North Pole expedition. In total, he took part in 11 polar expeditions, including seven to Antarctica and four to the North Pole. He named more than 300 features and places in Antarctica, including the Great Wall Bay, the first Chinese place name in Antarctica. E was an academician of the International Eurasian Academy of Sciences, Honorary Director of the Chinese Antarctic Center of Surveying and Mapping. He received a number of awards, including the Ho Leung Ho Lee Prize in Earth Sciences. After his retirement, E became a writer of popular science books and a motivational speaker.

The criminal complaint process began in 2012 in the prosecutor's office of Villeta, Cundinamarca, Colombia; there are nine complaints of women for sexual abuse against the perpetrator Orlando Gaitan Camacho. Four of these complaints are made by minors, (one of 14 and another of 17 years). All the denunciations are about sexual abuse exercised by Edgar Orlando Gait√°n Camacho within healings in yag√© ceremony and other spaces. These complaints showed the perpetrator Orlando Gaitan Camacho, peasant man, farm administrator, a contractor providing services with the state, who posed as \\"alternative peace Nobel prize,\\" \\"Taita de yag√©\\" and self-called \\"last indigenous Carare\\" for placing the victims in an inability to resist and abuse them. The perpetrator Orlando Gait√°n was in 2015 in Villeta prison (Cundinamarca) under insurance measure, he left in 2016 due to the expiration of terms. At this time, the criminal process enters the second instance, and the announcement of the ruling was made by the judge who is handling the case in Guaduas Cundinamarca. Guilt was only ruled for three minors. All nine complaints are for the crime of \\"carnal access in person put in an inability to resist.\\" The Office of the Prosecutor already presented evidence and concepts from Colombian indigenous organizations who responded that Mr. Orlando Gait√°n does not belong to any recognized community, likewise The Right Livelihood Award Foundation, the Swedish organization that annually awards the \\"Alternative Nobel Prize,\\" clarified to the media. Communication that Orlando Gait√°n, was never distinguished with this award. In the same way, expert reports on legal medicine were presented by each of the victims, where their vulnerability and defenselessness were shown. This one is not the only case. So, for that reason the accusing agency ignited the alarms at the time in the media: \\"A cultural phenomenon called 'neochamanism' is being spread, managed by people who, supposedly, do spiritual cleansing\\", taking advantage of urban people who do not know the indigenous practices, they have hope of being cured and of finding answers to their existence \\".  The version of his followers  Human rights activist, healer, spiritual teacher, and expert in the indigenous plant medicine and shamanic traditions of Colombia. Monica Brice√±o Robles accepts that Gaitan Camacho was briefly president of the Association of Peasant Workers of the Carare (Asociaci√≥n de Trabajadores Campesinos del Carare (ATCC)), which he helped form to find a solution to the violence caused by conflicts between the Colombian military, guerrillas, and paramilitary groups in the Carare region. He was born in 1958 in the Carare-Op√≥n region of Magdalena Medio, Santander Province, Colombia. Monica Brice√±o Robles said: Orlando Gait√°n Camacho spent his youth in the mountains of Carare where he learned about the use of traditional medicine from his grandmother Salom√©, who was one of the last full-blood Carare. As a child and as a young man he traveled extensively with his family through rural regions of Colombia, where he developed knowledge and expertise with traditional plant medicines, including Ayahuasca, and the cultural practices surrounding their use. Later he became an apprentice to shamans in Putumayo, Caquet√° and Choc√≥ Provinces. Currently, he attends patients and provides spiritual guidance and leadership to communities in Colombia, Mexico, and the United States. He develops remedies and directs rituals and ceremonies, including Yag√© in Bogot√°, Medellin, Bucaramanga, Pasto, and on the Atlantic Coast. His lifelong mission is to recover human senses that have been suppressed and nearly lost. He is also active in the ongoing work of reconciliation and recovery in Colombia's journey towards peace and stability, helping organize a ritual (based on traditional indigenous practices) at the demolition of Medellin's former headquarters of drug cartel leader Pablo Escobar.

He started out as a portrait painter, though later commissions for religious themes took precedence. His works are the iconostases in Vranjevo (1834), Nadalj, Beska (1840) and the one in the village church in Grgeteg. The portraits he painted for the palace of the Patriarchate of Karlovci were lost during the turbulent times that followed. Biography He was born in 1792 in Beƒçkerek into a family of artists. He was first taught drawing and painting in his father's atelier, and after his father's death in 1807, he continued working with his older brother Georgije at the same studio. So it was until 1819 when he went to Vienna to the Academy of Fine Arts to pursue his academic training. His stay in Vienna was an extremely fruitful artistic period because it was there that he held exhibitions of his early work in 1822. He planned in 1824 to become Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá's court painter, and to paint the likenesses of all the members of the princely family, but this was thwarted by the Austrian authorities in Zemun. At the beginning of 1828, he went to Zadar where he spent a year teaching students modern painting techniques completely freed of post-Byzantine, zoographic schemata. In Zadar he was also commissioned to do some restoration work by the Serbian Orthodox Diocese of Dalmatia on the iconostasis of the Serbian Orthodox Church of Saint Elijah. After Zadar, he returned to Beƒçkerek for a short period before setting off on another painting junket. After 1830 he returned to Beckerek, where, with short periods of interruption, he remained for the rest of his life. He lived in the center of Beƒçkerek, in Krunski Sokak (now \\"Dr. Zoran Kamenkoviƒá\\" Street). During the 1830s and 1840s, his creative energy did not falter, however, after that period Jeftemije slowly fell into oblivion, and his place became occupied by another exceptionally talented painter, Konstantin Danil. Jeftimije Popoviƒá died in Beƒçkerek in 1876. He was 84. Oeuvres Jeftimije Popoviƒá painted religious themes and portraits of distinguished individuals in both Serbia and Serbian Vojvodina. His works are the icons in the iconostases found in the Serbian Orthodox Church of Saint Elijah, build in 1773, in Zadar (1828), in the Serbian Orthodox Church of Saint John the Precursor in Vranjevo (1834),https://vojvodinaonline.com/en/what-to-see-and-do/culture-and- history/the-church-of-st-john-the-precursor-novi-becej Nadalj, Be≈°ka (1840) and the one in the village church in Grgeteg.

Biography He was one of eight children born to a farming family of modest means. He began his education at the local parish school, where he first displayed a talent for art. His abilities were noticed by a local nobleman, who helped him to finance studies at the State Ceramics Vocational School in Myrhorod with Opanas Slastion. His work was often held up as a model for the class. He worked there until 1913, when he was excluded for organizing revolutionary activities. He then went to Poltava and found a position at the , where they made copies of Ukrainian carpet designs for a weaving workshop in Kiev owned by Bogdan Khanenko, who was a major patron of the arts. His earnings enabled him to enroll at the short-lived Kiev Art School. His works were regularly exhibited there and he began to illustrate children's books. In 1917, after finishing his studies there, he transferred to the Ukrainian State Academy of Arts, where he became a student in the workshop of Mykhailo Boychuk.Brief biography @ the Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine While there, he was largely involved in decorative work for buildings, designing posters and creating various revolutionary materials for public display. He also received a commission from the State Publishing House to illustrate a collection of children's stories called –ë–∞—Ä–≤—ñ–Ω–æ–∫ (Periwinkles). He worked on that project together with Boychuk's younger brother Tymofiy. After graduating in 1920, he returned to Myrhorod and became a teacher at his former ceramics school. Later, he taught the same subject at a technical school in Kiev. His proficiency in his chosen specialty was widely recognized, so he was able to secure a position at the , where he worked from 1925 to 1934. That year, he returned to Kiev to accept an appointment as a Professor at the State Academy. In 1936, he was arrested and tortured by the NKVD on charges of counterrevolutionary activities, related to his Ukrainian nationalism. In July, the following year, he was executed by firing squad, together with his former mentor and friend, Boychuk, and the painter Vasily Sedlyar. He was rehabilitated in 1958.

Payen Talu led a group of indigenous demonstrators to the offices of the Kuomintang and Democratic Progressive Party legislative caucuses in June 2011, where they delivered a petition opposing a drafted aboriginal autonomy billI, as the bill did not increase the budget for indigenous affairs or grant them the right to land and natural resources. In August 2013, he called for the Japanese government to renounce its claim over the Senkaku Islands and return them to the control of the Kavalan people. In February 2014, Payen Talu, and fellow former legislators Wei Yao-chien and , among others, founded the Jiawu Regime Change organization in support of Taiwan independence. Controversy In September 2010, Payen Talu was accused of molesting two girls. After two appeals, he began serving a five-year prison sentence at Taipei Prison in July 2014. Payen Talu was released in May 2018 to seek medical treatment for kidney failure.

History The company was founded by five partners: Henry N. Bills, William Gutknecht, Charles Evers, Emil Czarnecki, and William Jung. During Prohibition, Bills bought out the other partners and brought on his sons and son-in-law into the business. The company survived Prohibition by selling near beer. After Prohibition, the brewer was the first to obtain a beer manufacturing permit from the city to resume beer production. In 1953, the brewery's workers went on strike at the same time as the other five major brewers in the city (Schlitz, Pabst, Miller, Blatz, and Gettelman) in what was referred to as \\"the Great Milwaukee Brewery Strike\\". In 1962, the company sold to Lacrosse, Wisconsin-based G. Heileman Brewing Company and produced 133,000 barrels of beer. In 1963, the company laid off workers until their staff was reduced to fifty employees. In 1964 the brewery was closed.

The model is understood to be unrealistic, and not a good representation of real- world voting behavior, however, it is useful for mathematical comparisons of voting methods under reproducible, worst-case scenarios. The model assumes that each voter provides a complete strict ranking of all the candidates (with no equal rankings or blanks), which is drawn from a set of all possible rankings. For m candidates, there are m! possible strict rankings (permutations). There are three variations of the model that use different subsets of the full set of possible rankings, so that different election permutations are drawn with different probabilities:  Impartial Culture (IC)  This model assumes that each voter's ranking is randomly selected from a uniform distribution. If these are chosen by n voters, there are thus m!^n possible elections (\\"preference profiles\\".)  Impartial Anonymous Culture (IAC)  This reduces the set of possible elections by eliminating those that are equivalent if the voter identities are unknown. For example, the two- candidate, three-voter election {A>B, A>B, B>A} is equivalent to the election where the second and third voters swap votes: {A>B, B>A, A>B}, and so all variations on this set of votes are only included once. The set of all such elections is called the anonymous equivalence class (AEC), and if the strict rankings are being chosen by n voters, there are \\\\left ( \\\\frac {n+m!-1} {m!-1} \\\\right ) possible elections This is also referred to as the \\"Dirichlet\\" or \\"simplex\\" model.  Impartial, Anonymous, and Neutral Culture (IANC)  This reduces the set of possible elections further, by eliminating those that are equivalent if the candidate identities are unknown.

Education Myrtle was born in Birmingham, Alabama, the fifth of seven children of the farmer Riley McGraw and his seamstress wife Mary Byram. She grew up in an area that was still recovering from the aftermath of the American Civil War. After completing a sixth grade level of education, she took a course in a local business school to learn shorthand and typing. Afterward, she was hired by a law office, where she worked for the next two years at a salary of $3 per hour. While there, the lawyer for whom she worked had the foresight to encourage her to continue her education. He helped her to enroll at the Snead Seminary, which at the time was a private Methodist boarding school. To pay her way, she worked as secretary to the school headmistress. As a teenager at Snead, in 1916 McGraw read an article in the Independent about the eminent American psychologist John Dewey. Shortly thereafter she wrote to him about the article, and was surprised when he responded. The two continued to correspond until McGraw left for China in 1919, and this would later lead to professional collaboration. After graduating from Snead, she matriculated to Ohio Wesleyan University in 1920 with the goal of eventually attending Columbia University. She graduated with an AB degree in 1923. McGraw successfully enrolled as a graduate student in the Teachers College at Columbia University, majoring in religious education. She earned extra money typing up the manuscript The Art of Experience for John Dewey, who was a professor of philosophy at Columbia. Upon earning her master's degree, she left to teach at a mountain school in Puerto Rico. However, after a year she became convinced that religion was not the field for her. She returned to Columbia and began studying for a Ph.D. in psychology with the supervision of Helen Thompson Woolley. Dr. Woolley headed up Columbia's Institute of Child Development, and the director of research there hired McGraw as a research assistant. Finally, in 1927, Myrtle was granted a Laura Spelman Rockefeller fellowship, which allowed her to finish up her course work in psychology and neuroanatomy. Accepting a teaching job at Florida State College for Women as assistant professor of psychology, McGraw began research for her dissertation. Her study was concerning performance differences between Caucasian and African-American children, using a battery of standard tests developed by the Austrian developmental psychologist Charlotte B√ºhler. Finding subjects for her thesis research in Tallahassee, Florida proved a challenge. She said, \\"I located subjects by driving around looking for diapers drying on clotheslines\\". With her investigation complete, McGraw returned to New York in 1929, joining the Institute for Child Guidance as an intern. She completed her dissertation, titled, \\"A comparative study of a group of southern white and negro infants\\", and was awarded a doctorate from Columbia in 1931. Career With the onset of the Great Depression causing her concern about finding a post-doctoral internship, a former professor of McGraw advised her to talk to Fred Tilney, the director of the Neurological Institute of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia. She was appointed associate director of the Normal Child Development Study at Babies Hospital in New York City by Tilney in 1930. Her work involved experimental research on child development of the neuromuscular system as a complement to Tilney's own studies of animal neural systems and behavior, and their correlation to humans. McGraw collaborated with Tilney and neuroembryologist George Coghill, and incorporated the ideas of John Dewey, to try and understand the growth process. Her work combined observation with some then-unique approaches to study environmental effects that could optimize motor development in an infant. She became the first to demonstrate a swim reflex in 2‚Äì4 month old babies. For several years she performed twin studies, which led to a heralded comparison study titled Growth: A Study of Johnny and Jimmy published in 1935. Among the experiments, she was able to place 13-month old subject Johnny in roller skates and teach him to skate, much to the interest of her fellow researchers and the press. The press retained an interest in this experiment from 1933 to 1942, although the supposed performance differences created between the two due to lab research turned out not to be as significant as initially supposed. McGraw's work continued until the Normal Child Development Study ended early in 1940 due to the war. She remained at the Babies Hospital long enough to complete her second book, The Neuromuscular Maturation of the Human Infant, published in 1943. A focus of her studies was to unite concepts in biology and physics to reach an understanding of the neurobehavioral development in an infant. She was critiqued as a maturationist by some, but her analysis of neurobehavior was actually more complex. Her work, in collaboration with others including John Dewey, advanced a focus on the reciprocal relationship between experience and the process of neural growth during early development. In this, she disagreed with Arnold Gesell's view on the role of maturation. Her insights have influenced the work of other scientists, including Ronald Oppenheim, Gilbert Gottlieb, Esther Thelen, and Adele Diamond. Her work also influenced the development of water birthing as well as parents applying swimming lessons for infants to encourage motor skill development. Domestic life Dr. McGraw was married in 1936 to research engineer Rudolph Mallina. It was an unusual ceremony because they chose marriage by contract based upon a little-used section of the Domestic Relations Law. The contract was signed with State Supreme Court Justice Samuel I. Rosenman as a witness. The following year the couple would have a daughter, Mitzi. McGraw spend most of the decade from 1943 in a domestic lifestyle raising her daughter and doing some occasional writing, although she did some teaching at New York University and Adelphi University. In 1953, she was offered a position with the psychology department at Briarcliff College. The work schedule was favorable, allowing her to still spend time with her daughter. Her husband died in 1970 at the age of 87, and she retired from teaching at Briarcliff in 1972. At the age of 89, she died of pneumonia at her home in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. Her daughter Mitzi Wertheim said of her, \\"mother was born at the end of the nineteenth century, she lived in the twentieth century, and she thought in the twenty-first century\\".

It is dedicated to conductor Kurt Masur who gave its world premiere performance in New York with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra on 10 February 1994. The symphony is scored for an orchestra of: 3 flutes (no. 2 doubling alto flute, no. 3 doubling piccolo), 3 oboes (no. 3 doubling cor anglais), 3 clarinets (no. 2 doubling bass clarinet, no. 3 doubling clarinet in E), 3 bassoons (no. 3 doubling contrabassoon), 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion (2 players), harp, celesta, piano, and strings. The movements are as follows: #Andante ‚Äì attacca ‚Äì #Largo #Allegro The playing time is approximately 23 minutes. The symphony opens with an extended (42 bars) violin solo. This is eventually joined by the other string instruments in an expansive, open, chorale-like structure which, nevertheless, maintains a mysterious and dissonant atmosphere throughout. Towards the end of the movement the solo violin theme reappears, this time for the first violins together. The theme is accompanied by a sustained chord from the second violins which continues through to the beginning of the second movement which is played without a break (i.e. attacca). In contrast to the string-focused first movement, the brief second movement (just two and a half minutes in the recording by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales) concentrates on woodwind and brass. The mood is very different from that of the first movement: blocks of cluster chords are interspersed with sharp interjections from the woodwind and brass, and long periods of silence. The final movement is nearly as long as the first two combined. The woodwind figurations from the second movement become increasingly significant before the music breaks down in a similar way to the music of the first movement and finale of the previous year's sixth symphony. A melody in the horns, invoking Bruckner, suddenly breaks through in an attempt to give the movement some direction, but the music soon breaks down again, becoming stuttering and texturally thinner. Finally, the Bruckner-like horn theme returns on tuba, contrabassoon and double bass but this time in the guise of a funereal waltz and the symphony comes to a close.

She is an Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Toronto Scarborough and Chairwoman of the Canadian Women Economists Committee through the Canadian Economics Association.  Education and work  Elizabeth Dhuey earned her B.A. in economics and sociology from the University of Colorado Boulder in 1999, before earning an M.A (2002) and PhD (2007) in economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Upon graduation, Dhuey was appointed to the position of Assistant Professor of Economics in the Department of Management at the University of Toronto Scarborough in 2007. In 2014, she was promoted to the position of Associate Professor of Economics. She holds cross-appointments with the Department of Economics, the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, and the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation at the University of Toronto.Curriculum vitae of Elizabeth Dhuey retrieved from the website of the University of Toronto Scarborough. In addition to her academic work, Dhuey held the role of President of the Canadian Women Economist Network in 2018. Appointed in 2017 for a four-year term, she is the current Chairwoman of the Canadian Women Economists Committee, a standing committee of the Canadian Economics Association. Dhuey has been a research fellow with the Behavioural Economics in Action at Rotman Centre (BEAR) at the Rotman School of Management since 2016.  Notable contributions  Dhuey‚Äôs research focuses on the economics of education. She is a significant contributor to knowledge on topics such as the developmental effects of education system organization on young children and necessary policy considerations for the state funding of special education programs.  Research on the effects of education system organization on child development  In a forthcoming paper with David Figlio, Krzysztof Karbownik and Jeffrey Roth, Dhuey takes an empirical approach in understanding the disadvantages faced by children based on their age of entry to primary school, specifically those that are the youngest of their group. This is in response to the increase in redshirting of kindergarten students, based on the supposed benefits from delaying entry to schooling such as increased cognitive development, stronger interpersonal skills, and better professional outcomes down the road. To test the effects that being the youngest or oldest of an age cohort can have in developmental outcomes, Dhuey et al. implement a regression discontinuity design within families that have children born in August and in September: these birth months correspond to being immediately before and after the average age cutoff time for school entrance. Dhuey et al. find significant positive developmental outcomes for September-born students over their August- born classmates. Notable differences in outcomes are also present in receiving disability status, while test scores and high school graduation rates are similar across the oldest and youngest students. On the end of policy considerations, they find that summer school can exacerbate age of entry effects while smaller first grade classrooms can lessen age of entry effects. Published in 2013, Dhuey conducted research on the differing academic achievements in students who attended a middle school versus those who attended a school from kindergarten that led directly into high school. This look at the effects of grade-level configuration used a sample of student outcomes, in the form of test scores, from the Canadian province of British Columbia. The results showed that middle school attendance negatively affected math and reading scores at the grade 7 level when compared to scores for students who attended grade 7 within a primary school, disproportionately so for students on the lower half of the test score distribution. The importance of this research is highlighted through grade reform being a relatively inexpensive policy measure in improving education outcomes, and one that comes with a high level of control at the district level.  Research on policy considerations relating to educational program funding  In an analysis of select financial education policy in 2011, Dhuey looks at the individuals and groups most likely to benefit from new state subsidization of kindergarten programs in the United States. The subsidization resulted in increases in access to and enrollment in kindergarten, and subsequently reduced the probability of students being below grade for their age: primarily so for low- income children. Dhuey and Lipscomb look at the census funding model for special education programs within the United States in a 2011 report on its advantages and disadvantages. Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), federal and state governments subsidize up to 62% of the additional costs needed to support learners with disabilities, while districts cover the rest. One method of allocation for support funding is census funding; census funding bases allocation decisions on total district enrollment and offers a fixed amount per student. Census funding does not consider factors such as the number of students with disabilities within a district or the extent of their disabilities. Census funding reduces fiscal incentives for districts to over-identify disabilities, and also offers benefits in its ease of application, transparency and ability to be modified. A major disadvantage with census funding is the underlying assumption that special education needs per student are uniform, despite multiple studies showing that disability rates are most often unevenly distributed; additionally, census funding does not consider potential differences in the proportion of students with disabilities per district. Based on these considerations among others, Dhuey and Lipscomb suggest the use of a weighted- student formula to account for factors such as poverty and high-cost disabilities that affect the distribution of special education needs, and that efforts for cost-effective program delivery are initiated to avoid the risk of having districts exhaust their state funding and sacrifice program quality as a result.  Research on the role of school principals in educational outcomes  With Smith in 2014, Dhuey looks at the role that high-quality school principals can play in increasing student achievement, through the measure of math and reading test scores in British Columbia, Canada. Principal quality is measured through the characteristics of the policies they implement, addressing areas such as class size, student assessment and teacher allocation. Control measures are implemented for principal tenure and experience to minimize indirect effects stemming from the continuing activity of principals past their term at previous schools. Their results indicate that a one standard deviation increase in principal quality leads to a 0.289-0.408 standard deviation increase in student achievement. The implication of their findings is that the identification of quality principals and subsequent dispersion of them across schools can play a significant role in reducing gaps in performance across students. In a 2018 paper co-authored with Smith, Dhuey continues her research in this area by estimating the value that principals provide to student achievement from a sample of primary school students in North Carolina. The results indicate that principals are able to add considerable value to student achievement through test scores, primarily based on the match between schools and principals. Similar to the previous study, the findings of this paper indicate that gaps in student achievement can be addressed by allocating high-quality principals where they are needed.  Media appearances and contributions  Dhuey's work has contributed to discussions on the economics of education across a number of print and digital media publications. Dhuey's findings on the considerable advantages for older children in classroom environments, and the rise of academic redshirting, is cited in pieces published in the Wall Street Journal, the Toronto Star and Slate. The 2008 novel Outliers: The Story of Success by Malcolm Gladwell also features her work on this topic. Dhuey's research appeared in a 2014 article for Maclean‚Äôs on a rise in ADHD diagnosis rates, discussing the pressures that motivate ADHD diagnoses. She has also been featured in the New York Times, Parents Magazine and Today.  Selected publications   *Dhuey, Elizabeth. (2011) \\"Who Benefits from Kindergarten?

He was a son of Ramakrishna Kunwar of Kunwar family. He served as governor of Jumla, Pyuthan and sub-ordinate administrator under Amar Singh Thapa at Srinagar of Garhwal province. He suppressed the rebellion of Jumla as a governor. He fought at the battle of Khadbuda where he killed King Pradyumna Shah of Garhwal. He was the grandfather of Jang Bahadur Kunwar Ranaji who later became the Maharaja of Kaski & Lamjung and Prime Minister of Nepal. Early Life He was born to Gorkhali Sardar Ramakrishna Kunwar on 1753 A.D. He was the first cousin of Chandrabir Kunwar, father of Balbhadra Kunwar. Career Kaji Abhiman Singh Basnyat, Ranajit's senior commander at the Kerung Axis in the 1792 CE campaign of Sino-Nepalese War After the consolidation of Pyuthan in November 1786, Ramakrishna Kunwar opened ammunition factory at Pyuthan. He died there and was succeeded by his son Ranajit Kunwar for the operation of the factory. Ranajit participated as reinforcement to Gorkhali forces under Chautariya Shree Krishna Shah in the Kuti Axis (1st division) in the first campaign of the Sino-Nepalese War on 1788 A.D. He then acted as subordinate commander under Kaji Abhiman Singh Basnyat at Kerung Axis on 1792 A.D. Sino-Nepalese War. The inhabitants of Jumla did not accept the conquest by Gorkhali rulers and they frequently invoked rebellions on the Gorkhali administration. A royal order then warned the residents of Jumla against rebellion with punishment according to their caste. A royal order issued on Tuesday Jestha Badi 11, 1850 V.S. (May 1793) mentions that on 1849 V.S. (1792 A.D.), the locals led by the former ruler Sobhan Shahi had rebelled in opposition to Subba (governor) Ranajit Kanwar at Jumla. The inhabitants were then consequently enslaved upon that incident. The royal order frees all the slaves of that Jumla rebellion incident on Tuesday Jestha Badi 11, 1850 V.S.. Similarly, in another incident, Subba Ranajit Kunwar imposed heavy fines on the inhabitants of Jumla as a result of their rebellion in 1793. A royal order of King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah dated Shrawan Sudi 2, 1859 V.S. (July 1802) shows that Ranajit Kunwar was in his tenure at Jumla on 1851 Vikram Samvat (1794 A.D.). Finally, Ranjit Kanwar was replaced by Jog Narayan Malla as Subba (governor) of Jumla on Baisakh Badi 1, 1851 (April 1794). The royal orders dated Bhadra Badi 11, 1853 (August 1796) mentions Subba Ranajit as in-charge of fort construction at Pyuthan. The local Amalidar of Isma was also instructed for necessary preparations for construction of Pyuthan fort under Subba Ranajit. He was further ordered to repair bridges over the Madi river and build checkposts at Sheoraj and Dhunwakot. An administrative document from Jumla dated Chaitra Sudi 7, 1857 (April 1801) shows ‚Äò‚ÄôSubba‚Äô‚Äô Ranajit's administrative order to Alidatta Jaisi of Sija to restore the revenue assignment for Kanakasundari temple which was discontinued by the Amali (i.e. local administrator). Similarly, document dated Chaitra Sudi 7, 1857 (April 1801) and Jestha Badi 1, 1858 (May 1801) shows his tax exemption and land allotment decisions as a Subba (governor). On Baisakh Sudi 10, 1861 V.S. (May 1804), the royal orders from King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah instructed Sardar Ranajit Kunwar along with Sardar Angad Khawas and Subedar Nirbhaya Simha Thapa to investigate the conflict between King Samundra Sen of Bajhang and King Mandhir Shah of Bajura and take over the areas by military means and deport the obstructer to the capital. Bada Kaji Amar Singh Thapa, Overall Commander at Battle of Khadbuda 1804 CE King Pradyumna Shah of Garhwal Kingdom prepared for warfare by assembling 12,000 men of various groups such as Ramghads, Pundirs, Gujars, and Rajputs under a Gujjar Sardar Ramdayal Singh of Landhaur. On the other hand, Gorkhali forces were led by overall commander Amar Singh Thapa, and his subordinate commanders Bhaktibir Thapa and Ranajit Kunwar. The battle took place at Khadbuda on 22nd Marga 1860 V.S. (January 1804). Pradyumna Shah on his horseback was having a conversation with Miya Dulal Singh of Prithvipur and momentarily, Ranajit shot Pradyumna Shah to death. His shot proved successful as Garhwali soldiers ran away and the war finally ended. Bada Amar Simha appointed Ranajit as chief of one of the three revenue divisions of Garhwal namely Srinagar. The letter sent on Sunday, Bhadra Sudi 11, 1867 V.S. by Ranajit Kunwar to Bhimsen Thapa states his involvements in the western provinces of Kingdom of Nepal. Ranajit reports to the Bhimsen regarding the enemy forces of Barha Thakurai kings at Panthajada and war preparations by Gorkhali companies at Panthajada. He further reports the submission of Terai region by Sikh Maharaja Ranjit Singh and subsequent hostility by hill Rajas towards Gorkhalis. Ranajit also mentions that his son Rewanta Kunwar wrote about the then existing economic problems in military management at Kumaun region. On Ashadh Sudi 1, 1870, General Bhimsen Thapa was granted 30 ropanis and 5 annas of land at Lagantol under inheritable Birta-Bitalab tenure for the construction of a house. Among the Bharadars (courtiers) who were present for the demarcation of the boundary, Kaji Ranajit Kunwar was also present there. As a Kaji, Ranajit issued administrative order to Chautariyas Atmarama Padhya and Tilakarama Padhya of Udayapur in Pyuthan to restore Hulak (mail) posts and repair suspension bridges at Arthala as per the letter dated Bhadra Badi 14, 1871 V.S. Allowances, Grants and Levies Kaji Ranajit Kanwar received NRs 1000 allowance while working as military commander in Kumaun region in 1866 Vikram Samvat. He received 200 muris of land grants on Manachamal tenure by a royal order was issued in Aswin Badi 13, 1862. Ranajit was among the highest ranked Bharadar (state-bearing officer) of the government of Nepal in the year 1861 Vikram Samvat (1804/05 CE). Thus, he was charged NRs. 272.25 as special Salami levy to repay the loans incurred by former King Rana Bahadur Shah during the four year (1800-1804 CE) stay at Banaras. Death As per Rana genealogy mentioned by Christopher Buyers, he died from the wounds received in the assault of the Jhabesar in Kangra on 1815 A.D. Chronicler Daniel Wright contends that Ranajit died in the conquest of Kangra while storming at Jhapabesar in Kumaon. He was hit by a bullet in the right chest aged 58 years when he was climbing a bamboo ladder at the wall. Descendants The table produced by Kumar Pradhan shows the three sons of Ranajit - Bal Narsingh Kunwar, Balaram and Rewant. Bal Narsingh Kunwar was political aide of Bhimsen Thapa. His son Jung Bahadur Kunwar became Prime Minister of Nepal. The appointment letter of Jung Bahadur Kunwar as Prime Minister of Nepal, confirms that he was son of Bal Narsingh Kunwar and a grandson of Ranajit Kunwar. Furthermore, the appointment of Bam Bahadur Kunwar as Kaji also mentions Bal Narsingh Kunwar as his father and Ranajit Kunwar as his grandfather. After proclaiming descent from Ranas of Mewar, Jung Bahadur Kunwar adopted the title of Kunwar Ranaji on 15th May 1848 and became Maharaja (Great King) of Kaski and Lamjung on 6th August 1856.

State football Allen played junior football with boys at Rye Demons in the Mornington Peninsula Junior Football League. In 2016, Allen started playing with Dandenong Stingrays Youth Girls Academy. She also played as vice-captain for Vic Metro and helped them win the 2016 AFL Youth Girls National Championships as the team beat Western Australia by 95 points at the MCG under the coaching of Wayne Siekman. She was named Vic Metro's Most Valuable Player for her defensive efforts and leadership. Allen was selected for the 2017 AFL Women's Under 18 All-Australian team. Allen started the 2018 season as a top AFLW draft prospect. For a second consecutive season, she played for and captained Dandenong Stingrays in the TAC Cup. At the end of the season, she won the club's best and fairest award and was selected for the 2018 TAC Cup Team of the Year. In July, Allen captained Vic Country in the 2018 AFL Women's Under 18 Championships. At the end of the series, she was selected for the season's All-Australian team. Allen also played five games in 2018 for Casey Demons in the VFL Women's (VFLW), twice being named in the club's best players. Despite all the accolades, Allen thought she plateaued in 2018 as she felt she had to take a step back to focus on playing with passion and enjoyment. AFL Women's career Allen was drafted by Collingwood with the club's first selection and the fifth pick overall in the 2018 AFL Women's draft. She made her debut in the club's loss against Geelong at GMHBA Stadium in the opening round of the 2019 season. In her debut season, Allen played as a defender. For the 2019 season she moved forward into the midfield and scored her first professional goal against Carlton in round 5. Allen was awarded a Rising Star nomination following her performance in Collingwood's six-point victory over Brisbane at Victoria Park in round 7, their only win of the season. In the match she collected 10 disposals, took six marks, and laid three tackles. Following the season in which she played all seven matches, in April 2019, she signed a new deal with Collingwood ahead of the 2020 season. Personal life Allen grew up in Rye on the Mornington Peninsula. In her junior years, she was a motocross rider for seven years, but after countless injuries and hospital stays as well as due to the financial burden, she focused on playing Australian rules football from the age of 12.

Built in 1910, it is the fourth courthouse in the county's history. Former courthouses Marion County was formed in 1823 from what had been the northern part of Jefferson County,Brinkerhoff, J.H.G. Brinkerhoff's history of Marion County Illinois. Indianapolis: Bowen, 1909. and the land now occupied by central Salem was donated for the express purpose of founding a county seat, with a lot reserved for courthouse construction. At the second meeting of the county court, a contract was signed with Aaron Hicks to build a courthouse at a cost of $499. Measuring , this 1¬Ω-story log building was pierced with two doors but no windows, and its interior was partitioned into two. The upper half story served as a jail to hold those awaiting trial.Weiser, Dennis. Illinois courthouses: an illustrated history. Virginia Beach: Donning, 2009, 96-97. Hicks finished the building within nine months, and it served until 1837. After the county stopped using it, the courthouse became a church building for local Methodists, and local Baptists also used the building for several years. The original courthouse's upper floor was replaced by a new jail between 1830 and 1832. In 1836, the county board ordered the construction of a new courthouse at a cost of $655, but contractor Mark Tully failed to complete it (the reason is unrecorded, but the county's refusal to penalize him indicates that he had good reason), and Nathaniel Adams instead oversaw construction. Two stories tall with a hip roof, and measuring , the wooden courthouse was pierced with several windows and doors on its various sides, including a second-floor doorway that opened onto a balcony above the main entrance. Adams employed high-quality construction methods, allowing it to stand for several decades; after it ceased to be used as a courthouse, Charles Mills bought the building and moved it elsewhere to serve as his residence. Marion County's third courthouse was ordered in July 1857, and Joseph Miller began construction in the following year. However, Miller was found to be using poor-quality materials, and county officials were able to annul the contract and obtain an award of damages, although Miller's poverty prevented the county from recovering any significant amount. His contract was given to the firm of Moore and Morrow, and at a cost of $35,000 the new building opened in 1860. Its design featured Neoclassical elements on the second story, including pilasters and a pair of columns supporting a pediment the width of the facade. This building remained in use into the twentieth century; Brinkerhoff's History of Marion County Illinois (1909) reported: > \\"It is still the courthouse for Marion county, and though out of style, is > yet a substantial building, and but that modern conveniences and comforts > are lacking, would stand a century. Current courthouse Joseph Royer designed the present courthouse, which was built starting in 1910. Featuring a form of Neoclassical architecture newer than its predecessor, the courthouse is a two-story stone building with Ionic columns set on both sides of the main entrance. These doors sit at the top of a wide flight of stairs with elements such as ornamental lamps at the sides. Rectangular windows, both single and paired, are set in various parts of the facade. The exterior features ashlar blocks sitting atop a raised basement, with plain string courses at various levels near the basement's summit and under the edge of the roof. Near the courthouse sits a two-story office building, which was constructed in 1978 according to a design by Field, Goldman, and Magee. The same firm oversaw the renovation of the existing courthouse in the same year.

As in the First Crusade, the pilgrims and soldiers of 1101 crusade did not leave as a part of one large army, but rather in several groups from various different regions from across Western Europe. In September 1100, a large group of Lombards left from Milan. These were mostly untrained peasants, led by Anselm IV, Archbishop of Milan. When they reached the territory of the Byzantine Empire, they recklessly pillaged the countryside in want of food and provisions until the Byzantine emperor Alexios I, possibly under force of arms, escorted them to a camp outside Constantinople. This did not satisfy them for long, as they forced their way inside the city where they pillaged the Blachernae palace, even killing Alexios' pet lion. In order to limit any further damage, the Lombards were quickly ferried across the Bosporus and made their camp at Nicomedia, to wait for additional Crusading reinforcements. The Siege The Norman historian Ordericus Vitalis reported that Emperor Alexios I Komnenos at first dismissed the crowd outside the Theodosian Walls as just a rowdy and obstreperous group, clamoring for provisions, either refusing to or unable to move on to Anatolia. But when the group started to break down the outer gates of the Theodosian Walls, he ordered that three fierce lions and seven leopards (‚Äútres ferocissimos leones et septem leopardos‚Äù) from his private zoo be driven between the middle and outer walls and posted guards on the inner third wall, against which the Blachernae Palace was built and commanded that the gates be shut. He planned to frighten away the Crusaders with wild beasts and defend the city without human force, thus avoiding direct conflict with the Crusaders. When the Lombards broke through the outer gate, the lions sprang on the first men to enter and injured many others whom they savaged with teeth and claws, tearing at the men who were caught unawares and had no experience of fighting wild animals. The Crusaders withdrew and once they recovered from their ordeal, returned to throw spears and javelins at the animals, striking down and killing the lions, while driving away the leopards, chasing them as they fled up to the middle wall before leaping over the wall. The Lombards smashed through the gate in the second wall and attempted to take the third by assault. Breaking down the final gates, they ransacked the Blachernae Palace and eventually withdrew back to the camp, either voluntarily or by force of arms. Over the course of the raid on the palace the Lombards also killed the emperor‚Äôs pet lion, which had been kept as a companion within the palace.https://www.scribd.com/doc/278725055/Byzantine-Garden-Culture-2002-pdf Byzantine Garden Culture, Dumbarton Oaks, p79-80, 2002 While the ransacking was limited to just the Blachernae palace, the emperor arranged for the Lombards to be quickly ferried across the Bosporus and made their camp at Nicomedia to wait for additional Crusading reinforcements. Aftermath Over the next few weeks the majority of the Lombards, along with most of the remaining Crusading army that joined them, was defeated during the Battle of Mersivan. The Siege of Constantinople of 1101 was a forerunner of the Fourth Crusade in 1204, which proved to be far more destructive for the Byzantine Empire in the coming centuries.

Born in Bad Mergentheim, he studied at Heidelberg University and then under the German director Erwin Piscator. Heyme was the artistic director of the Staatstheater Wiesbaden from 1964 to 1967, the Schauspiel K√∂ln (Cologne's principal theatre) from 1968 to 1979, the W√ºrttemberg State Theatre in Stuttgart from 1979 to 1986, the Ruhrfestspiele theatre festival from 1990 to 2003, and the Theater im Pfalzbau in Ludwigshafen from 2004 to 2014. Now in his 80s, he continues to work as a freelance director. Early years Heyme was born in Bad Mergentheim. His parents were ballroom dancers who had run away together as adolescents to run a dance school in Cologne. After his father's death from typhoid in World War II, his mother Erika married Kurt Joachim Fischer who became a prominent journalist and screenplay writer in post-war Germany. After the war, the family settled in Heidelberg where Heyme received his secondary education at the Helmholtz Gymnasium. After graduating from the gymnasium in 1955, he briefly studied architecture in Karlsruhe, but then moved to Heidelberg University where he spent seven semesters studying sociology, German studies and philosophy as well as taking acting lessons. Heyme was Erwin Piscator's pupil and assistant in Berlin and Mannheim in 1956. He then worked as an assistant director at the Heidelberg Castle Festival and as an organizer of the International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg. He also appeared in Bernhard Wicki's 1958 cult film ' for which his stepfather had written the screenplay. Director and dramaturge Heyme began his directing career at the Mannheim National Theatre and at Theater Heidelberg where he became both director-in-residence and an actor in 1958. He then moved to the Staatstheater Wiesbaden in 1963. Known as an \\"aggressive modernizer\\" of the classics, Heyme caused a near-riot in the Wiesbaden theatre with his controversial 1965 production of Schiller's play William Tell which he set in the Nazi era. His production of Marat/Sade that same year was the first to bring him national attention and was subsequently performed at the Berliner Theatertreffen festival as were many of his later productions. During the early 1960s he also directed one of the earliest performances in Germany of Harold Pinter's The Caretaker at the Theater im Zimmer in Hamburg and the German premiere of Joe Orton's Loot at the Deutsches Schauspielhaus in Hamburg. The Schauspiel K√∂ln where Heyme was the artistic director and dramaturge from 1968 to 1979 From 1968 to 1979 Heyme was the artistic director and dramaturge of the Schauspiel K√∂ln (Cologne's principal theatre). At Cologne he concentrated on works by the classic German playwrights, Schiller, Goethe, and Hebbel and on ancient Greek tragedies and comedies, his \\"Antiquity Project\\". The project produced some of the first performances in Germany of Euripides' The Bacchae and Aristophanes' The Frogs. As in Wiesbaden, Heyme's productions of both classic European dramas and ancient Greek plays were marked by their radical modernization which made reference to contemporary political and social issues. It was during this period that Heyme coined the term \\"subventionierte Opposition\\" (\\"subsidized opposition\\") to describe his vision of modern theatre. His last production for Cologne was a controversial Hamlet designed by the video and installation artist Wolf Vostell. The final scene of the Heyme-Vostell production depicted the dead Hamlet, Claudius, Gertrude, and Laertes lying naked on metal trolleys with their intestines on top of their bodies. Behind them newsreaders drone on flickering television screens while a dwarf repeatedly spins around Hamlet's trolley. In search of new forms of theatrical expression in 1979, Heyme staged an epic production of Sophocles' play Antigone in Calcutta. The work was translated into Bengali and used local actors, many of them amateurs. It was performed outdoors with the actors under a specially constructed tent and drew large crowds. After leaving Cologne, Heyme worked as the artistic director for drama at the W√ºrttemberg State Theatre in Stuttgart. In 1986 he left Stuttgart for the Grillo-Theater in Essen and also taught directing at Folkwangschule there. He resigned from his posts in Essen in 1992 in protest at the cuts in the city's budget for cultural institutions. This was followed by a brief, unsuccessful period (1992‚Äì1994) at Theater Bremen. From 1990 to 2003 Heyme was also the artistic director of the Ruhrfestspiele theatre festival and concentrated primarily on his work there after leaving Bremen. Heyme's last permanent post was as artistic director of the Theater im Pfalzbau in Ludwigshafen where he served from 2004 through 2014. His production of Goethe's Torquato Tasso inaugurated the newly renovated theatre in 2009. Amongst his other productions in Ludwigshafen were the German premiere in 2007 of Mohamed Kacimi's play on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, Holy Land, and the world premiere in 2014 of Gilgamesch, a play based on a new German translation of the Epic of Gilgamesh by Stefan Maul and adapted for the stage by Christoph Klimke. His contract was not renewed at the end of the 2014 season. Later years Heyme rehearsing his production of The Tempest in 2015 In late 2014, Heyme began what he called his \\"Sturm-Projekt\\" (Storm Project). It was a production of Shakespeare's The Tempest updated to the present day and set in the Neckarstadt-West district of Mannheim, an area notorious for its crime and red-light district. He used a cast of mostly amateur actors, many of whom were Bulgarian immigrants living in the district. The dialogue was in German but occasionally switched to Bulgarian. Funded by the city of Mannheim and grants from private sponsors, the production premiered in the Mannheim district in which it was set on 10 July 2015. The Storm Project is also central to Heyme's autobiography, Sturm. Splitter (Storm. Splinter), which was published in August 2015 to mark his 80th birthday. Written during the preparation and rehearsals for The Tempest, the book recounts episodes in his life from his early childhood to the present. Each of his memories takes a quote from The Tempest as its starting point, but they are not presented in chronological order. Also published in 2015 was Theater! Arbeit! Heyme!, a book devoted to Heyme's life and work by Peter W. Marx and Harald M√ºller. Since leaving his post at the Theater im Pfalzbau, Heyme has continued to work as a freelance director. His later productions have included Ronald Harwood's play Quartet at the Hamburg Kammerspiele in 2016, Goethe's play G√∂tz von Berlichingen at the in 2018, and Viktor Ullmann's opera Der Kaiser von Atlantis for the Pfalztheater in Kaiserslautern in 2018. Although Heyme's directorial work has been primarily devoted to plays, he has directed several opera productions during his career. He had earlier directed Puccini's Manon Lescaut for Frankfurt Opera in 1983, Strauss's Elektra for the Pfalztheater in 2009, and Wagner's Ring Cycle for Theater im Pfalzbau and Oper Halle in 2013. Personal life According to a 2018 interview with Heyme in Die Rheinpfalz, his career took a heavy toll on his personal life. He worked 14-hour days, and his controversial productions at times resulted in death threats, petitions to have him fired, and battles with the intendants of various theaters where he worked. G√≥mez, Heyme's Spanish Water Dog, is named after one such intendant because, as Heyme put it, he wanted to have a G√≥mez who obeyed him. Heyme has been married five times. His first four marriages ended in divorce. He lives in Ludwigshafen with his fifth wife, √âva Adorj√°n, and the two youngest of his four children. Adorj√°n is an actress and director who lectures in performing arts at the University of Koblenz and Landau. Heyme also has a country estate in the Westerwald region.

Geologists have theorized that this depression was an extension of the Bay of Zekreet prior to the drop in sea levels c. 3,000 years ago. Geology The area spanning from Dukhan to the upper part of the Bay of Zekreet is the only surface of Qatar where an entire section of the Eocene Dammam Formation is exposed. History A settlement dating to the early 19th century was discovered at the southern end of the bay, and was possibly presided over by the pirate ruler of Qatar, Rahmah ibn Jabir al-Jalahimah. Another archaeological site, Uwaynat Ali, is found on the other side of the bay. The western side of the bay hosted the shallow-water harbor used to unload supplies for Qatar's oil industry. The growth of the modern village of Zekreet, which is across the bay, was dependent on this harbor. Shortly after the Mesaieed Harbor opened in 1952 it was made obsolete.

Production The play premiered in 1966. Original cast *Keith Michell *Alan White 1967 TV Adaptation A TV adaptation was directed by Lionel Harris and written by Alan Poolman. It was the first collaboration between the BBC and the ABC. Australian TV drama was relatively rare at the time. Plot Brothers Kain and Rattler Sutherland live on a station in the Australian outback. The brothers clash when an Aboriginal maid gives birth to a child which both believe they have fathered.

It was filmed in Australia in March and April 1966: exteriors in the Northern Territory near Tennant Creek, at Warrabri and at Devil's Marbles, and interiors at the ABC's Gore Hill studios. Lionel Harris, the director, Alan Poolman, the writer, and actors Michell, White and Devlin came from London; the rest of the cast were Australian. Props had to be brought in from Sydney. 'The days were long and hard,\\" said Harris. Harris said the play's theme was \\"in not taking those closest to you for granted - not living entirely for self. Kain thinks he has no conscience but his discovery that he has provides the play's conflict.\\" Production design was by Douglas Smith. The budget was reportedly $65,000. Chief cameraman was Frank Parnell who later died in a helicopter crash filming a documentary. Broadcast The broadcast ran for 90 minutes and aired 17 April 1967. In the UK it was broadcast in the drama anthology series Theatre 625 as item 17 in series 4. It was thought lost, but survives as 16mm film. Reception The Sydney Morning Herald said it \\"grabbed and gripped with a force we too rarely see on the Box.\\" The Sunday Sydney Morning Herald TV critic called it \\"the event of the week\\" praising the \\"strong performances from\\" Michell, White and Devlin and the \\"superbly photographed outback scenery. The photography ran rings around most routine Hollywood westerns. In colour, it would be a masterpiece.\\" He did say \\"I felt that author Alan Poolman over-wrote at times. But this is small stuff, weighed alongside the tremendous dramatic impact of the play as a whole\\". The London Times said it had \\"great emotional power.\\" The Age thought it was \\"an essentially melodramatic play\\" but said \\"Michell's performance turned into something of breathtaking strength.\\" The Bulletin called it \\"awful...

The final Council of the eastern Cherokees was held at Rattlesnake Springs, and in 1838 federal troops held and assembled 13,000 Cherokees on the site to begin the migration to Oklahoma known as the Trail of Tears. Federal troops along with militias from Tennessee and Georgia established two military camps near the site, Camp Foster and Camp Worth, which were used to oversee the Cherokees prior to removal. These camps were two of several camps used for this purpose in the area, including Fort Cass in Charleston. More than 200 Cherokees reportedly died at the springs prior to removal due to unsanitary conditions.

Importadora y Exportadora de la Patagonia, doing business as La An√≥nima, is an Argentine chain of supermarkets that operates mainly in the region of Patagonia. Formats consist of mostly mid-size supermarkets, as well as some hypermarkets that are usually anchors for shopping malls. Stores carry both standard brand names and private label brands, such as La Anonima and Best. The company also operates two major meat packing plants, and some of its products are exported to other countries. Today, La Anonima has 162 branches in 83 cities across Argentina and its workforce consists of 11,500 employees, making it, as of 2015, the fifth-biggest supermarket chain in the country by sales. History Jose Menendez At the end of the 19th century, Jose Menendez was a powerful landowner, colonizer, banker, industrialist and owner of a shipping company. His company's main trading post was set up in Punta Arenas, Chile, while also maintaining numerous establishments in Argentine territory. In 1908, Menendez, Mauricio Braun and Gast√≥n Blanchard merged their respective companies and founded the Sociedad Anonima Importadora y Exportadora de la Patagonia (Import and Export Company of Patagonia), initially based in Punta Arenas, passing into Argentine jurisdiction in 1910. By 1911 it was operating several stores in a warehouse format, while also having a naval fleet as well as regular passenger and cargo transportation lines between Buenos Aires and Punta Arenas, with stopovers in several Argentine Patagonia ports, through the use of two ships made to order in Britain: the Argentine and the Asturian. Mr. Menendez died in Buenos Aires in 1918, never having lost his Spanish nationality. At the time, the president of La An√≥nima was his son-in-law, Mauricio Braun (of German and Prussian descent), who remained in this position until 1932, when he was replaced by Carlos Men√©ndez Behety. By 1929 it had 25 branches in different locations within southern Argentina, in addition to 4 ships. The Braun Menendez conglomerate worked in different areas, monopolizing much of the wool trade, meat packing industry and banking sector of Patagonia. Both families were part of the Argentine Rural Society and together owned the Exploitation Company of Tierra del Fuego, having 430,000 hectares with 1,250,000 sheep that produced 5 million kilos of wool, as well as leather and meat. The company spearheaded economic development in the region, becoming involved in industries as diverse as electricity generation and transmission, telephony, and transportation of people and goods. This process was not without conflict, though. Like other large trading companies in the Americas at the time (such as HBC in Canada), the company purchased lands from the government that were previously inhabited by natives such as the Selk'nam, Y√°mana, Qawasqar and Alacalufes. The process of conquering these lands in Argentina was called Conquest of the Desert. La Anonima, in the early 1920s Sheep husbandry in Argentine Patagonia, late 19th century Due to how long and complex the company name was, inhabitants of Patagonia simply called it \\"La An√≥nima\\" (literally, The Anonymous), and the name stuck. Between 1929 and 1968 La An√≥nima published the magazine La Argentina Austral, and also participated in the inauguration of the first radio programs in Comodoro Rivadavia and R√≠o Gallegos. In 1942, the company opened its capital to public offering, trading in the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange since then. In 1957, La An√≥nima and other partners created the airline Austral L√≠neas A√©reas, which eventually became the second-largest commercial airline in the country after Aerol√≠neas Argentinas. The name Austral reflects the Patagonian identity of its owners. In 1967 the company started selling off various assets, including ships, warehouses and numerous buildings. During the same year, several warehouses were converted to the supermarket format, the Trelew location being the first, and this transition was completed in 1971. In the early 1980s, the stock package was again concentrated in the Braun family, who assumed the current leadership of the company and launched a new strategy aimed at gaining leadership in the retail industry of the Patagonia region through a policy of growth, adopting new technologies and establishing a new corporate identity. The company is known for being an early adopter of innovative retail technology such as barcodes, in the 1980s. Present La Anonima in Comodoro Rivadavia In 1991, the company opened a small chain of stores in a convenience store format under the Best name. This chain was sold in 2010 to French retailer Carrefour (which also operates its flagship banner in Argentina), although the Best name was retained as La Anonima's budget tier private label brand. Carrefour would later convert these stores into the Carrefour Express banner. In 2000, La Anonima signed an agreement with French retailer Groupe Casino to sell Leader Price private label brand items in all of its locations. The Leader Price range covered an assortment of items, from food to clothing and was produced by suppliers from Argentina, Uruguay and France. At that time Casino was operating in Argentina a chain of hard discount stores also named Leader Price, but unrelated to La Anonima, that sold only Leader Price-branded items. During Argentina's 2001 economic crisis, the company registered a severe drop in its turnover for the first time in its history. After consumer confidence was restored in the country in 2003, the company went through several years of uninterrupted growth in terms of revenue and profits. In 2005 the company acquired from the Williner family a local supermarket chain, Quijote, that operated in a small area in Santa Fe. Eventually, the Quijote brand was phased out and the remaining stores were reopened under the La Anonima banner. La Anonima in Villa La Angostura In recent years the company has invested heavily in its meat processing and packing plants, as well as getting complete control of the Pampa Natural plant in 2017, after having partial ownership for several years. The output of the company's meat plants makes it the fifth-largest meat exporter within Argentina, supplying 2,400 tones of beef for the country's share in the Hilton Quota. In 2009, the company launched its own credit card line, under a partnership with Tarjetas del Mar S.A. (a company which later it acquired), offering customers a no- interest line of credit for appliance purchases, among other benefits. In 2017, the company became widely known in the country for several relatives of the Braun family that became part of the cabinet of the Macri administration. The involvement of family members in politics was not well received within the company, especially after the poor economic results of the new government, which resulted in the company's worst quarter since 2002. Its current president is Federico Braun, son of Oscar Braun, the tenth son of Mauricio Braun, and cousin of the mother of Marcos Pe√±a, former chief of cabinet of the Argentine government.

History  The retreat began on November 22, after the Red Army captured the city of Omsk. As the bulk of the White Army headed East in the Great Siberian Ice March towards Lake Baikal, the Orenburg Army took a slightly more South-Eastern direction through Kazakhstan towards Sergiopol. On December 1, Red Army troops captured Semipalatinsk, and on December 10, Barnaul, thus cutting of the Army of Dutov from the main force of the White Army under Vladimir Kappel. The only way possible now, was to march south to the Semirechye, which was under control of Ataman Annenkov. On December 13 Karkaralinsk was taken by the Red Army and Dutov's troops departed from Sergiopol towards Semirechye and the Chinese border. This segment of the road (about 600 km) was the hardest, and many of the retreating Cossacks and refugees died of starvation and disease. The troops retreated in the sparsely populated, barren terrain, and had to spent the night in the open air. They had to eat horses and camels. The local population couldn't sustain thousands of extra people. The mortality from cold, famine and typhoid grew. The seriously ill were left to die in settlements, for the deceased there was no time to bury them in the frozen ground. Long day marches allowed the bulk of the army to stay ahead of the enemy, but stragglers were often attacked and killed by Kazakhs. The remains of the Orenburg Army reached Semirechye on December 31, 1919, and were met with hostility by Annenkov's Semirechye Cossacks. It is estimated that half of the 20,000 people that started the march, died and that 90% of the survivors were sick with various stages of typhus. The Orenburg Army camped in Semirechye until March. When the Red Army approached, they crossed the Chinese border between March and May 1920 together with the 4,000 Semirechye Cossacks, to be interned.

The sabkha runs for approximately 20 km, occupies an area of 73 km¬≤, has a width of 2 to 4 km and a depth of between 6 and 7 meters below sea level. Consequently, the sabkha holds the distinction of accommodating the lowest point of Qatar. It is situated roughly 10 km east of the city of Dukhan and 2 km from Dukhan Highway. The Dukhan Field is to its immediate west. Description depression that separates the Dukhan Sabkha from the Bay of Zekreet Studies suggest that the sabkha is fed by seawater from the Bay of Zekreet, north by approximately 3 km. Geologists have theorized that Rawdat Jarrah, the depression separating Dukhan Sabkha from the Bay of Zekreet, was an extension of the bay prior to the drop in sea levels c. 3,000 years ago. Various species of algae are found on the sabkha surface. As a result of high uranium content, the sabkha has very high levels of radioactivity, ranging from a mean of 16 to 75 cps. Salinity levels are high in the sabkha. Among the reasons for this include the intrusion of seawater, a prevailing desert climate and salt deposition from sediment runoff. The soil lacks nutrients of any substantial quantities except for sodium chloride and calcium. Qatar's government has designated plots of land within the sabkha for biosaline agricultural experimentation to determine which salt-tolerant plant species grow best in sabkha habitats. Geology Its main constituents are aggregation sediments, evaporites, and an assemblage of wind-blown sediments. Sediments within the sabkha differ from other sabkhas in the region. Here, they are described as mainly comprising brownish-grey wind-blown sand underneath halite crystals up to 2 meters-thick. Gypsum crystals are also found overlaying the sabkha, particularly in its center.

He was one of the most high-profile representatives of Italian Catholicism during the early decades of the twentieth century. In 1912 he founded the Giovine Orchestra Genovese. Probably his more defining legacy is the Opera nazionale per il Mezzogiorno d'Italia (O.N.P.M.I. / loosely, \\"National Operation for Southern Italy\\") which he set up with Giovanni Minozzi to create and operate a chain of orphanages and associated educational facilities, addressing an urgent necessity created by the slaughter of the First World War. Biography Provenance Giovanni Semeria was born during the aftermath of the 1866 Italian War of Independence. In accordance with his late father's wishes, he was born in Colle which at that time was an autonomous municipality, but which has subsequently been renamed as Coldirodi and in 1925 subsumed into San Remo, a sprawling coastal municipality along the coast between Genoa and Nice. His father, also called Giovanni, died when an outbreak of Cholera gripped the regiment in which he was serving during the course of the war. His widowed mother settled near Turin and took as her second husband Pietro Grosso. The fact that he was an orphan conditioned Semera's entire life. Early years When he was 9 Giovanni's mother sent him to a boarding school in Cremona, under Jesuit influence: he remained at school in Cremona till he was 14. He was then transferred to the Carlo Alberto Academy (\\"Real Collegio Carlo Alberto\\") at Moncalieri (near Turin) where the principal influence came from Barnabites. It was here that his vocation matured, which led him to break off his schooling. The boy was still only 15 when he entered the Barnabite order at Santa Maria al Carrobiolo (Monza) as a novice. He received his monk's habit on 8 October 1882 and was permitted to vote as a member of the Barnabite order for the first time on 22 October 1883. Rome He studied Philosophy and Theology in Rome and was ordained into the priesthood on 5 April 1890, still not yet 23. During his student years he manifested a singular enthusiasm for public speaking, which was something that would never leave him. Following his ordination he remained in Rome for several years, teaching seminarian students and contributing to theological magazines. He was elected to membership of several learned societies. In October 1892 the Pope invited him to attend the Scientific Congress in Genoa, which involved a trip back to the north. Return to Genoa By the time he left Rome and relocated to Genoa in 1895 he had acquired a burgeoning reputation as a teacher, a writer of articles on church matters, and as a preacher. Two years later he was invited to preach the 1897 Lent sermons at the basilica San Lorenzo in Damaso in Rome where he attracted crowds that overflowed up the altar steps and into the apse beyond.Ugo Ojetti \\"La Tribuna\\" 1897. The sermons greatly extended his reputation, and over the next few years he accepted invitations to preach in France, Belgium, Switzerland, England, Asia, Africa, and the United States. Sent away For many years he lived at the Vittorino da Feltre College in Genoa, surrounded by the young people for whom he wrote many of his early books. At the same time he continued to appear in some of Italy's most important pulpits, sustaining a reputation for oratorical brilliance. Within the church hierarchy there were, however, who found him a threat. Leading the charge was Cardinal de Lai, an outspoken and well-networked conservative prelate with a bitter and longstanding hostility to the Barnabites. Semeria was accused (\\"unjustly\\") of fomenting Modernism and in the end he was sent away to Brussels, leaving Genoa incognito on the night of 21/22 September 1912. Silenced for the next two years, he was able to concentrate on ministering to families of the Italian expatriates who had moved to Belgium, attracted by the employment opportunities provided by the coal mines and associated heavy industries. On 19 July 1914 Semeria left for a break to visit his mother who by this time was staying with one of his childhood friends at Lopagno (TI) in Switzerland. While he was there, on 4 August 1914 rumours reached him that the First World War had broken out at the end of the previous month and that Belgium faced imminent invasion. The rumours were correct which meant he was unable to return to Belgium. He was still unable to enter Italy, following the difficulties that had led to his departure in 1912. He spent the next few months in Geneva at the Bonomelliano Mission, helping to provide assistance to Italians abroad, and identified to his fellow monks as \\"Don Dosio, a priest from Piedmont\\". War Semeria never wanted war and certainly never would have promoted it, but was slowly converted to acceptance that it was the political reality. On a human level he was not insensitive to the emotional response engendered by the invasion of Belgium. More widely, there was no shortage of priests desperately applying to be involved on the frontline, for instance as military chaplains. Meanwhile, within the military establishment there were concerns that involving priests in the actual fighting, especially priests with a history of outspokenness and oratorical effectiveness, risked introducing unhelpful and inappropriate shades of pacifism to the fighting troops. At the same time, Marshall Cadorna, Chief of Staff of the Italian Army between 1914 and 1917, was on record as being personally in favour of the involvement of military chaplains on the frontline. Cadorna had been posted to Genoa back in 1911: he and Semeria had known each other well since that time. In June 1915 Cadorna invited Semeria to come for a meeting at Treviso. Semeria was still banned from entering Italy and there was no question of his crossing the border from Switzerland going unnoticed: there is shrill written evidence in surviving sources of consternation on the part of Cardinal de Lai and a number of others. Nevertheless, Semeria's passage was not blocked, and despite some uncertainty along the way as to whether he would attend the meeting ‚Äì which may have resulted simply from his messages not being delivered as anticipated ‚Äì on 13 June 1915 Giovanni Semeria did indeed enjoy the rare (for a priest) privilege of a personal meeting with the supreme commander of the Italian army. The upshot was his appointment as a military chaplain, though in the immediate term he was given no information on where he would be sent. The next three years were a time of feverish activity, both priestly and humanitarian, providing for the soldiers' spiritual necessities and for needs that were purely material. There were endless homilies to be delivered, conferences and intense conversations at many levels, masses on the frontline, confessions, visits to the wounded and a huge amount of correspondence to be handled, often in response to the \\"most unexpected requests\\". It was during this period that one ambition above all others came to the fore, which Semeria shared with another military chaplain, Giovanni Minozzi from the Abruzzo: the war would one day end, and after it they should take care of all the orphans it had created. Fulfilling that ambition was the project to which, using all his gifts with the spoken and written word, Giovanni Semeria would devote the final decade of his life. Most of the soldiers through whose deaths they lived came from the Italian south, an impoverished region geographically distant from the war on the northern borders, where the loss of family breadwinners would be felt especially acutely, and it was clear to Semeria and Minozzi that it was in the south of the country that destitution resulting from the slaughter of war would be particularly intense. Orphans War ended in 1918 and already in 1919 plans were well advanced for two orphanages; one in Amatrice across the mountains to the east of Rome, and a second in Gioia del Colle, far to the south, near Bari. War had left the principal nation states of Europe close to bankruptcy, and there was no longer so large a class of people as before 1914, willing to part with significant amounts of cash for Christian philanthropy. Semeria and Minozzi desvised a strategy which between November 1919 and July 1920 involved splitting up. Minozzi took what Semeria later described as \\"the more prosaic part\\" (\\"la parte pi√π prosaica\\"), staying in Italy to continue with the work of looking for sites, organising land clearance and building preparations, looking after relations with local authorities and coordinating funding appeals in Italy and neighbouring countries, while Semeria took the \\"more poetic part\\", travelling to the United States of America where there were American dollars and the \\"generous hearts of our emigrants\\" (\\"i cuori generosi dei nostri emigranti\\"). His skill as a public speaker combined with his first hand experience of the scale of the orphan issue created by the war to make him a highly effective fund raiser. He addressed church congregations and public meetings in theatres and town halls. In the words of one source, people \\"were astonished by this bearded figure with such a picturesque and disorderly style...\\". Astonished or not, many were moved to open their pocketbooks. By the end of 1919, not two but four orphanages had already been opened: two in Amatrice and a fourth in Potenza (between Salerno and Bari). The scale of the initiative, and of Semeria's success in attracting generous international financial support for it, quickly became apparent. The operation was registered as a legal entity on 13 January 1921 with a name redolent of its founders' ambitions for it: Opera nazionale per il Mezzogiorno d'Italia (O.N.P.M.I. / loosely, \\"National Operation for Southern Italy\\"). Ten years later the O.N.P.M.I. had looked after more than 1,000 orphans in 14 orphanages, more than 6,000 in 60 Kindergartens with workshop annexes, with 20 alpine and coastal summer-camp locations. Semeria's passionate fundraising, using homilies, participating at conferences, producing publications, was undiminished. The entire purpose of \\"selling himself\\" in this way was to engage support for \\"his orphans\\". It was notable that despite his own educational background, there was no attempt to use the O.N.P.M.I. as a training ground for theological scholarship. Semeria was more than content to guide the children towards skilled manual and artisanal trades, for which there were desperate labour shortages in the northern half of the country. Death at Sparanise Giovanni Semeria delivered his final speech at Montecassino. Still smiling, he was nevertheless now obviously exhausted and seriously ill. He returned to his orphanage at nearby Sparanise where he was staying. He collapsed and died in the presence of Minozzi, the nuns, the orphans, those who love and admiration he had earned. His body was taken to the Barnabite monastery in Rome, wrapped in the Italian flag. In the end his remains were buried at an O.N.P.M.I. summer camp which he was particularly fond, at Monterosso al Mare along the coast from La Spezia.

Designed by Paul Thiry and completed in 1952, it was the first International Style building on the Washington State University campus. It is one of the many dormitories on the Washington State University campus available to undergraduates. Variously called \\"Regents Hall\\" and the \\"Regents Hill Halls,\\" the complex (originally named the \\"New Women's Dormitory\\" and officially renamed the \\"Regents Hill Dormitories\\" on December 4, 1951), consists of two, four-story linked residential wings, McGregor Hall and Barnard Hall, and Stearns Hall‚Äîa free-standing dining hall and common space. Together with Scott Coman Hall just to its northwest (completed in 1958), the complex ushered in a new era of campus design featuring large, technologically sophisticated, light-filled concrete buildings for research, teaching, and residential life. Regents Hill was also the first residential hall built following World War II at what was, in 1952, still called Washington State College (WSC). The college became Washington State University in 1959.  Design  Perched on a hilly rise at the northeastern edge of the campus, the 400-student residence was promoted as a \\"dream dormitory\\" for women and may have been the first residential hall in the Pacific Northwest with evident ties to European modernism.\\"Building Program for 1950 Set; WSC to Grow.\\" Alumni Powwow (Washington State College, Pullman, WA) 30, no. 5, February 1, 1950. However, its interior connections to its local region and its Japanese- infused landscape reveals the building's overall hybridity within an otherwise monolithic postwar architecture palette beginning to take hold around the United States for public and private buildings alike. Regents Hill includes several notable design features. Connecting the growing college to mainstream trends in European architecture, the principal residential wings of Barnard and McGregor Halls feature an open-air stair-and-balcony tower that joins them at the campus-facing corner, reminiscent of Dutch modernist Jan Duiker's Open Air School in Amsterdam. The wings, too, feature strip windows suggestive of modern machinery and are elevated above the ground level by small reinforced concrete columns, resembling the \\"pilotis\\" of Le Corbusier's architectural experiments of the 1920s. Thiry had once met Le Corbusier, and likely would have been aware of his architectural theories. Looking down from the spiral staircase in Stearns Hall at Regents Hill At the same time, Thiry's design attempted to link the building to local conditions: the lobby of Stearns Hall, for example, features a sculptural spiral staircase, curved walls, and a wavy, stainless steel banister; originally, Stearns included carpets and furniture that Thiry considered \\"emblematic of the Palouse country\\" because their wavy designs suggested the rolling hills of the surrounding landscape. An alumni magazine celebrated McGregor Hall and Barnard Hall for their spacious, double rooms with picture windows and floors featuring kitchenettes, laundry units, and an outdoor lounge area (what later became known as the \\"sun porch\\") with \\"flower garden and lawn.\\"\\"New Women's Dormitory Being Completed for Opening this Fall.\\" Alumni Powwow (Washington State College, Pullman, WA) 31, no. 10 (July 1951): 7. The magazine boasted of the building's common sewing and typing rooms and considered the design, overall, to mark a significant advance in campus housing because of its \\"home and small-group living.\\"\\"New Women's Dormitory Being Completed for Opening this Fall.\\" Alumni Powwow (Washington State College, Pullman, WA) 31, no. 10 (July 1951): 7. The residential complex, including Scott Coman Hall, was Thiry's first and only work at WSC‚Äîor in all of eastern Washington. A noted architect whose residential designs in Seattle were the first to explicitly demonstrate European modernist ideas, Thiry would cement his legacy with his role as principal architect of the Century 21 Exposition in Seattle (1962). He also designed the Seattle Center Coliseum‚Äînow KeyArena‚Äîfor that exposition.Meredith L. Clausen, \\"Paul Thiry.\\" In Jeffrey Karl Ochsner, ed., Shaping Seattle Architecture: A Historical Guide to the Architects (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2014): 290-95.  Landscape  246x246px Regents Hill features the university's only Japanese- influenced garden. Tucked behind McGregor Hall on a slope, a small, informal landscape of trees, shrubs, moss, stone pathways, and a small pond suggests the architect's travels to Asia in 1934 and his awareness of the Japanese work of Czech-American architect Antonin Raymond. An open, metal sculpture, built with the original design, still stands and adds to the overall effect. Several large rocks are scattered loosely about the landscape, yet their seemingly random placement might have been intentional to reveal the connections between eastern and western cultures; broadly suggestive of Washington state's geography on the Pacific Rim. The design's relationship to the landscape as a whole‚Äîfrom its sensitive relationship to the ground (by raising it up on stilts) to its expansive windows permitting views from its hilly site‚Äîearned it a place among Architectural Forum's five best college buildings in 1951.\\"Dormitory Rooms: Planning for Maximum Spaciousness with Minimum Space.\\" Architectural Forum: The Magazine of Building 95, no. 9 (1951): 174-77.

Mai has been bullied due to Hai Phuong's reputation as a debt collector and for not having a father, and she wants to stop going to school so that she can support her mom so she won't be hated by the community anymore. One day, while in the market Hai Phuong sees Mai being accused of stealing a wallet. The other witness pressures Hai Phuong to take their side, which hurts Mai‚Äôs feelings and infuriates her when Hai Phuong does not believe her, resulting in Mai scolding her mother for trusting strangers more than her own family and running away. It is revealed that someone framed Mai, and Hai Phuong tries to find Mai to apologize, but Mai is captured by thugs.

Biography Early life Reshetnyak was born in the city of Chernivtsi. At eight years old, her parents urged her to go to a musical school, in the accordion class but she left the school about a year later. Thirteen years later, Tatiana began studying vocals, firstly in the ensemble, and then took individual lessons. In 2001, during a visit to Lviv, Tatyana had the opportunity to perform ensemble before the Pope John Paul II's appearance. The first significant event for her was a trip to Skadovsk for the Black Sea Games festival, where she took the third place. Tatyana has three brothers, two twins who are confectioners, one of them working also as a singer, and Misha Marvin who is singer and well known in Ukraine. Her parents are Natalia and Mikhail. When Tatyana was 18 years old, she married the famous producer Dmitry Klimashenko. 2008‚Äì2011: Hot Chocolate In 2008, Tatyana became member of the girl group Hot Chocolate (–ì–æ—Ä—è—á–∏–π –®–æ–∫–æ–ª–∞–¥).

It was named after the naval officer , who died during the Battle of Copenhagen, while bravely defending the decommissioned frigate Kronborg against three Royal Navy ships of the line. Hauch can be viewed as a scaled-down version of the preceding six gunboats of the Thura class. Hauch was built entirely in iron and the smaller size meant that it could only accommodate a single cannon. The 30 lb smoothbore cannon was not very accurate and was replaced by a smaller, but rifled 18 lb cannon in 1864. Towards the end of her career the armament consisted of two small smoothbore cannons (falconets), used for warning shots during fisheries inspection duties. The steam engine was reused from the scrapped gunboat St√∏ren. This engine lasted until 1886, when it was replaced by a new Burmeister & Wain 200 HP steam engine.  Duty  Hauch, under command of Lieutenant William August Carstensen and a crew of 25 entered service in July 1893 as flagship of a steamship squadron of rear admiral C.E. van Dockum. The squadron consisted of HDMS Absalon, HDMS Esbern Snare, HDMS Fylla, HDMS Willemoes, HDMS Buhl, HDMS Krieger and HDMS Marstrand. However, the ship did not live up to expectations. It was first and foremost too slow, most likely due to the small length, as it was designed to fit the locks on the Eider Canal. The ship was under command of lieutenant Peter Urban Bruun with a crew of 24 during the second Schleswig War in 1864, but never engaged in fighting. After the war it was considered to sell the ship, but instead Hauch was placed on land for the next 16 years. Here she remained until 1880, where a need for a fisheries inspection vessel arose.  Marine surveys  HDMS Hauch in her later years, where experiments with rigging her with sails were performed Between 1880 and 1896 Hauch served as a fisheries inspection vessel for the Kattegat and Danish Straits, typically from March through November. The zoologist C.G. Johannes Petersen participated in many of the cruises, in particular in the years 1883-1886. This resulted in a report on the scientific results of the investigations, often seen as the first major contribution to the research field marine benthic ecology, as C.G. Johannes Petersen realised that there were pronounced patterns in the distribution of the different species. Certain species seemed to always occur together, which led him as the first to define the concept of a benthic community. Hauch was decommissioned in 1900. The engine was removed and reused in refitting the steam ferry Sallingsund into a fisheries research vessel. The hull of Hauch was sold for scrap in 1901 for 2,100 kroner.

He received his B.S.S. degree in Economics from the Universit√© de Montr√©al and his Masters of Business Administration from the University of Detroit Mercy. As an educator, Sfeir lectured at Lebanese University, Beirut University College, Haigazian College, l‚ÄôUniversit√© Saint-Joseph and Le Centre d‚Äô√©tudes bancaires. In the years to follow, he was appointed Trustee on the board of directors of the Lebanese American University (LAU), Beirut and Byblos; Vice-Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the University of the Holy Spirit (USEK); Member of the Board of Trustees AMIDEAST; and Vice-Chairman of the American Friends of the Middle East, Beirut. Sfeir has been associated with the newly commissioned Salim Sfeir Building at the School of Business Administration at USEK, the Holy Spirit University of Kaslik, being awarded honorary degrees at both USEK and the American University of Science and Technology (AUST).  Career  Sfeir began his career in finance with the Bank of Nova Scotia. (Years later he would acquire the Bank of Nova Scotia branch in London.) By 1980, he joined Bankmed in Beirut as Deputy General Manager. Three years later, he formed Wedge Bank (Middle East) as General Manager, and in 1987 launched Wedge Bank Switzerland as Chief Executive and Vice Chairman. The turning point came with the management buy-in of Bank of Beirut in 1993. This local bank eventually expanded to nine countries on four continents. Today, Bank of Beirut comprises more than 100 branches and strategic business units internationally. Sfeir is committed to his pocket, as well as the Lebanese ruling class' interests. The Bank of Beirut efforts have been centred on funnelling money from Lebanese citizen's pockets into the pockets of the bank owners and ruling figures (who are one and the same). In close association with His Beatitude Bechara Boutros Al Rahi, the patriarch of the Maronite Church, Sfeir formed the World Maronite Foundation for Integral Development, whose mission is to harness the full potential of the Church and its adherents, to ensure funding from Lebanese nationals and the diaspora. In 2019, Sfeir was unanimously elected as chairman of the influential Association of Banks in Lebanon (ABL). As the influential chairman, Sfeir oversaw the collapse of the Lebanese economy (2019-2020) ‚Äì with the inevitable unraveling of the Ponzi scheme economic plans orchestrated by ABL, BDL (Lebanese Central Bank), and the country's ruling figures.  Honours and awards  Sfeir has been recognized through many honors internationally, including: *Inauguration of the Library of the Pontifical Maronite College in Rome *Medal of Saint Maroun by Mar Bechara Boutros El Rai, Patriarch of Antioch *Honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters Honoris Causa, Lebanese American University *Knight Commander of the Pontifical Order of Pope Saint Sylvester *Medal of the National Order of the Cedar conferred by President Michel Suleiman *Medal of the Maronite Patriarchate, Maronite Patriarch of Antioch  References   External links  *Bank of Beirut shrugs-off economic challenges *People:Bank of Beirut SAL (BOB.BY) Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:Lebanese bankers Category:Economy of Lebanon ","title":"Salim Sfeir"},{"id":"60051202","title":"2019 World Sprint Speed Skating Championships ‚Äì Men"},{"id":"60051203","title":"2019 World Sprint Speed Skating Championships ‚Äì Women"},{"id":"60051211","text":"TGRT Haber is a nationwide TV channel in Turkey.

First identified by Carlos Ribeiro in 1875, the dolmen has recently been restored and can be easily visited. The dolmen is believed to have been made up of a polygonal chamber measuring 3.7 √ó 3.8 meters and formed by seven vertical stones (orthostats), together with an access corridor. Three large blocks have also been identified that may be fragments of the stone that covered the tomb. A few archaeological fragments were found at the site and they are now deposited in Lisbon's Geological Museum but many more were believed to have been taken prior to Ribeiro's excavations. The artifacts collected, as well as more recent radiocarbon dating, suggest that the chamber was used in the late-Neolithic period between the middle and end of the 4th millennium BC. Later, in the second half of the 3rd millennium or in the second millennium, additional funerary deposits may have been made in the access corridor. The Anta de Agualva was first identified in 1875 by military engineer and geologist Carlos Ribeiro who excavated this site as well as several other dolmens in the area to the northeast of Lisbon, such as the Anta da Estria, Anta da Pedra dos Mouros, Anta das Pedras Grandes, and Anta do Monte Abra√£o. The dolmen was registered as a national monument in 1910. In 1944, Georg and Vera Leisner drew up a new plan of the monument similar to that of Ribeiro but, in their case, assuming the existence of a significant tumulus. Further excavations were carried out in 1958 by Veiga Ferreira. The conservation of the monument has always presented problems related to the lack of clearance of the bush and to urban pressure. In 1994 the Archaeological Museum of S√£o Miguel de Odrinhas carried out a set of actions to safeguard the monument, including clearance of the area. In 2004, a park was inaugurated, denominated \\"Jardim da Anta\\" (Garden of the Anta), with the dolmen integrated in the landscaping. In 2017, at the initiative of Sintra City Council, work was carried out on the preservation and restoration of the monument and it was formally opened in April of that year.

It has been in England since 1828 and in the collection of Polesden Lacey since 1922.1246502, painting record in the National Trust The motif of a figure presented in a \\"niche\\" follows a style made popular by Metsu's teacher, Gerrit Dou. The central figure is a woman dressed in a similar red bodice worn by Metsu's wife Isabella de Wolff in a portrait he painted soon after he married her in Enkhuizen in 1658. Like other contemporary Leiden fijnschilders, Metsu has chosen the subject of a niche or window to frame his subject. The popular motif generally includes a curtain for a dramatic effect, and though Metsu painted curtains sparingly, he has chosen to place his subject prominently in front of a closed curtain here. Her portrayal at first glance needs no other supporting commentary, unlike his other \\"niche\\" paintings which are adorned with details in the typical \\"Dou\\" manner. A closer look reveals an interesting bas-relief under the window, which appears to be a Metsu variation of Francois Duquesnoy's frieze of Children Playing with a Goat. Though its meaning is lost, it shows a clue (along with her dress) that this woman is someone connected to Metsu's circle and was possibly a model for other Leiden painters.

He was the second of fourteen children born to couple Theodoro Sim√µes de Oliveira and Reginalda Ferreira de Mattos. His probable true name was Febr√¥nio Ferreira de Mattos, but he gained fame as Febr√¥nio √çndio do Brasil, the \\"Son of Light\\", as he presented himself to police officers, journalists, judicial authorities and forensic psychiatrists. His father, Theodoron, as he was best known, worked as a farmer, but for some time he had been a butcher. He was an alcoholic, and very often violently attacked his wife. On several occasions, Febr√¥nio witnessed his mother's beatings. Theodoron was also violent with his children. Probably in 1907, at the age of 12, Febr√¥nio fled his home in the company of a travelling salesman. He wandered around the localities around his hometown, until he arrived in Diamantina, where he learned to read and earned his living as a butler. Later, he moved to Belo Horizonte, surviving as a shoe shiner and a domestic servant. Probably in 1909, Febr√¥nio, aged 14, went to Rio de Janeiro, then the Federal Capital. He returned to the state capital of Minas Gerais in 1916, under the name of Pedro de Souza, but soon returned to Rio de Janeiro. Criminal life and mystical revelations Since returning to Rio de Janeiro, Febr√¥nio began to commit crimes, and between 1916 and 1929, dozens of passages were recorded by police for fraud, blackmail, bribery, theft, robbery and loitering. During one of these arrests in 1920 at the Dois Rios Correctional Facility on Ilha Grande, Febr√¥nio, who was reading a Bible in the intervals of praxitherapy during the night, had a vision in which a woman with long blond hair chose him as the Son of Light, a title that was his responsibility to declare to all that God had not died. According to the vision, he was to tattoo boys, albeit with the use of physical force, with the symbol of DCVXVI, which meant \\"God, Charity, Virtue, Holiness, Life, Magnet of Life\\". The tattoo would serve as a talisman for those who exhibited it on their body. Acting accordingly to what had been commanded to him in the vision, Febr√¥nio tattooed the phrase \\"Behold the Son of Light\\" on his chest and, throughout the circumference of his torso, the letters DCVXVI I. Febr√¥nio then began to write a book titled The revelations of the Prince of Fire, published in 1926, which brings incomprehensible messages, taken from the mysterious dreams that were transmitted to him. In 1921, when he left the correctional colony, Febr√¥nio set up a medical consumers' co-operative named The Auxiliadora M√©dica, announcing it in a classified ad of the newspaper Correio da Manh√£. The ad was read by a dentist, Dr. Bruno Ferreira Gabina, who joined the co-operative. Febr√¥nio, presenting himself as Joaquim √çndio do Brasil, rented an office for the dentist and then went on to assist him with the appointments, but the two left the premises a month later, without paying the rent. In 1922, after taking Dr. Gabina's diploma, Febr√¥nio opened his own dental practice on Rua Visconde do Rio Branco, in Centro, where he demonstrated sadistic behavior by subsequently extracting several healthy teeth from those who sought his assistance. Due to his bad reputation, he turned his office into a job agency, which deceived people who, looking for work, deposited money for Febr√¥nio. Pursued by the police, he moved to Bahia in 1925, where he pretended to be a dentist under the name of Febr√¥nio Sim√µes de Melo √çndio do Brasil. From there he settled in Mimoso do Sul, in the state of Esp√≠rito Santo, where he pretended to be Dr. Gabina, but soon left following the deaths of two children whom he had prescribed drugs to. Later, in the mining town of Rio Casca, presenting himself as Dr. Uzeda Filho, he continued to act as a fake doctor, even causing the death of a woman in childbirth. Back in Rio de Janeiro, Febr√¥nio was arrested on October 8, 1926, caught for acting suspiciously on a hill at the Sugarloaf Mountain. As he presented delusional ideas and lied compulsively, he was admitted to the National Psychopath Hospital, which he left a few weeks later. During this hospitalization, he was examined by distinguished psychiatrist Dr. Adauto Botelho, who first diagnosed Febr√¥nio with a mental disorder. First sexual crimes In January 1927, once again being arrested, Febr√¥nio sexually subjugated two cellmates in the 4th Auxiliary Police Station in Rio de Janeiro. When he tried to rape a third, Djalma Rosa, Rosa resisted and was beaten to death. On February 21, 1927, he was arrested again on the Corcovado hill while dancing, completely naked and with his body all painted yellow, in front of a terrified child who was tied to the trunk of a tree. As he heard from witnesses that Febr√¥nio had earlier been spotted cooking a stolen human head from the Caju Cemetery in the house where he was a tenant, the deputy sent him back to the National Psychopath Hospital. At the time, he was examined by eminent physician Dr. Juliano Moreira, who, assisted by Dr. Henrique Roxo, confirmed that Febr√¥nio from a mental illness. In April 1927, Febr√¥nio was admitted to the National Hospice of the Insane, at Praia Vermelha. When he was discharged, he took with him another inmate who was also discharged, 17-year-old Jacob Edelman, to whom he promised employment in his dental office. On the way, they sought 17-year-old Oct√°vio de Bernardi, a young man who had been offered a job for Febr√¥nio, this time in a slaughterhouse. At night, in a deserted place in Mangaratiba, he tattooed the inscription DCVXVI on Jacob's chest, before the terrified Oct√°vio. A few days later in Praia das Flecheiras, a wasteland situated at the western end of Governador Island, an area that was later landed for construction of the Gale√£o Airport, Febr√¥nio violated Jacob sexually; soon, he did the same with Oct√°vio, not without tattooing him beforehand. A few days later the two boys were released, very terrified, but alive. Febr√¥nio again tattooed another victim, 18-year-old Manoel Alves, at the beginning of August 1927, deceiving him with a false promise of employment. When detained at the House of Detention, Febr√¥nio committed sexual crimes against cellmates again. On August 8, 1927, he was released, after he had been acquitted of the murder of Rosa on July 27 the same year. When he left, he wore a navy blue uniform and a cap, stolen from a cellmate. Murders On August 13, 1927, Febr√¥nio, wearing the same uniform and cap from the House of Detention, persuaded the family of Alamiro Jos√© Ribeiro that the 20-year-old should accompany him to accept employment in his bus driving company. While they were in a forest on Ribeiro Island, near Jacarepagu√°, Febr√¥nio began arguing with Alamiro on account of the young man denying his libidious advances. Febr√¥nio ended up strangling him with a green vine he found on the spot, until he died of suffocation. The body of Alamiro, dressed only with a shirt and the former's clothes, was found two days later. On the same day that Alamiro's corpse was found on August 15, Febr√¥nio, again resorting to a misleading promise of employment, tattooed a 16-year-old boy named Joaquim, whom managed to evade his would-be killer. Perhaps aware of the social commotion generated by Alamiro's murder, Febr√¥nio traveled to Petr√≥polis, staying in room 3 of Hotel Rio Branco under the name of Dr. Gabina. In that city, Febr√¥nio bought a suit from a tailor and left behind the navy uniform he wore during Alamiro's murder. When the tailor went to the hotel to receive the second part of his payment, Febr√¥nio noticed a cyst on his neck and proposed to treat it, applying a tincture of iodine followed by a sudden blow with a knife, causing a painful hemorrhage that precipitated the tailor's escape without the other money. A few days later, Febr√¥nio returned to Rio de Janeiro. On August 29, he approached 10-year-old Jo√£o Ferreira, best known among his friends and relatives as \\"Jonjoca\\". Febr√¥nio deceived the boy's parents by offering him a butler's job and, counting on their permission, left with him. When they found themselves in the woods of Largo do Fran√ßa, Febr√¥nio promised Jonjoca a suit as a gift, in the case the boy accepted to get the same tattoo as the one on his companion's chest. Frightened, he consented, and Febr√¥nio performed the procedure with a needle, thread and red paint. Later, they went to the forest of Ribeiro Island, where Jonjoca was strangled with a rope. The boy's corpse was found only on September 7 that same year, naked, lying about 300 meters from the body of Alamiro, Febr√¥nio's previous victim, had been discovered. Indictment and judgment On August 16, police were warned that a corpse had been found on Ribeiro Island the day before. The body was recognized as that of Alamiro Jos√© Ribeiro, next to which there was a cap. One of the investigators recalled that, a few days ago, a detainee had been released from prison wearing that cap. In the House of Detention, the investigator obtained information that the cap had been stolen by Febr√¥nio √çndio do Brasil, the day that he had been released. The mugshot from Febr√¥nio's police file was shown to Alamiro's father, who identified him as the man who, by offering the boy a job at his bus company, left with him on the day of his disappearance. Febr√¥nio was finally located on August 31 of the same year, while entering a train on the Leopoldina Railroad at Leopoldina Station. When led to the 4th Auxiliary Police Station in Rio de Janeiro, he was recognized by Jonjoca's father as the one who proposed for him to work as a butler and took his son on the day of the boy's disappearance. Two days later, on September 2, delegate Dr. Oliveira Ribeiro was able to obtain Febr√¥nio's confession regarding Alamiro's murder, but only assumed responsibility for the murder of Jonjoca on September 8, when he declared that he had committed both crimes in a sacrifice to the living god, symbol of his religion. On September 19, 1927, Febr√¥nio was denounced by the Public Prosecutor's Office for the murder of Ribeiro and Jonjoca, and two days later he was transferred from the 4th Auxiliary Police Station in Rio de Janeiro to the House of Detention, where he received the prison number 194. Several cases of children who were reported by the press as possible victims of Febr√¥nio were excluded from the case for a lack of concrete evidence. It was also not possible to prove that Febr√¥nio had assassinated Dr. Bruno Ferreira Gabina in order to take possession of his diploma, although since 1922 the whereabouts of the dentist have remained unknown, even by his own mother, Maria Ferreira Gabina. On September 21, the printed newspaper O Jornal began a series of reports entitled \\"The criminal Febr√¥nio before Psychiatry\\". The first interviewee was Dr. Faustino Espozel, professor of Neurology at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Rio de Janeiro, currently the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The next day it was the turn of Dr. Pedro Pernambuco Filho, assistant professor at the same faculty. The series ended on October 2 with the interview by Dr. Henrique Roxo, who had examined Febr√¥nio earlier that year, where he had recommended that the criminal be transferred to the National Hospice of the Insane. All three doctors were unanimous in stating that Febr√¥nio suffered from mental illness, which motivated his crimes, and that he, by virtue of his dangerousness, should be hospitalized in a psychiatric asylum colony to undergo treatment. On October 4, the jurist Dr. Evaristo de Moraes, in an interview with O Jornal, considering the fact that Febr√¥nio had improper treatment at the National Hospice, recommended that he be transferred to a mental asylum. In 1928, Febr√¥nio was taken before a jury, presided over by Judge Dr. Ary de Azevedo. His defense was executed by the lawyer Dr. L√©tacio Jansen, who sustained criminal incomputability in the face of his manifest madness. It was then that Febr√¥nio was examined by forensic psychiatrist Dr. Heitor Carrilho. Data collected from the interview appeared to indicate an imaginary mystic-delirious extravaganza by the inculturation of Febr√¥nio, exemplified by the fixation in the maternal figure that, according to him, was called Estrella do Oriente √çndio do Brasil. This data was compared with the information obtained by Agenor Ferreira de Mattos, Febr√¥nio's brother who lived in Jequi√© and had come to visit him, later proving that the defendant falsified his testimony, either on purpose or due to pathological lying. On February 20, 1928, Dr. Carrilho, aided by Dr. Manoel Clemente Reyio, finally issued an extensive expert report which became famous later on, from which the following conclusions were drawn:CARRILHO, Hector. Report of the medical- psychological examination carried out in the accused Febronio √ç. of Brazil. Archives of the Judicial Asylum of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, v. 1, n. 1, p. 77-101, 1930. 1\\\\. Febr√¥nio √çndio do Brasil, is a bearer of a constitutional psychopathy, characterized by ethical deviations, covering the form of moral madness and instinctive perversions, expressed in homosexuality with sadistic impulses, a state that is joined by delirious ideas of the imaginary, mystical character. 2\\\\. His antisocial reactions or the criminal acts of which he is accused result from this morbid condition which prevents him from the normal use of his will 3\\\\. Consequently, their imputation capacity is impaired or terminated. 4\\\\. It should be borne in mind, however, that the abnormal manifestations of his mentality are elements that define his inescapable fear and that he must therefore be segregated ad vitam for the salutary and elevated effects of social defense, establishment appropriate to delinquent psychopaths. Armed with the powerful scientific arguments of this report, Dr. Jansen obtained Febr√¥nio's acquittal, and Judge De Azevedo determined his recollection, and as of June 6, 1929, he became the first inmate of the Judiciary Nursery of Rio de Janeiro, renamed in 1954 as Heitor Carrilho Judicial Asylum, in honor of its first director, who had died that same year. Escape, recapture and death On February 8, 1935, Febr√¥nio, taking advantage of the distracted guards caused by the arrival of morning shift employees, climbed the 4-meter high wall of the Judicial Asylum thanks to the use of a rope made of laced sheets, whose end had a hook made with bucket handles. His escape, however, lasted until the following day, since Bernadino Barbosa went to the police station to report that Febr√¥nio was hiding at his house in the Rio neighborhood of Hon√≥rio Gurgel. Bernadino said that he had been lodged at the request of a friend, Agenor, brother of Febr√¥nio, and that he decided to look for the police since he had been horrified to know, through newspapers that reported the escape, of the crimes committed by his guest. Febr√¥nio, found totally naked, was returned to the Judicial Asylum, where he remained until his death on August 27, 1984, at the age of 89, caused by pulmonary emphysema. His body was discreetly buried on September 5, 1984, at the Caju Cemetery. Legacy Cultural legacy The life and crimes of Febr√¥nio generated repercussions in the culture and influenced several artists. Theater The first cultural manifestation about the anti- juridical acts committed by Febr√¥nio was the painting The Son of the Light, that was showcased in 1927 in the revue \\"I do not want to know more of her\\", by the company Ra-Ta-Plan. The director Paulo Biscaia Filho produced the play DCVXVI - this is the Son of Light, with actor Cl√≥vis Inoc√™ncio in the role of Febr√¥nio.DCVXVI - HIS SON OF LIGHT. Text and direction of Paulo Biscaia Filho. Curitiba: Vigor Mortis. Available at:http://www.vigormortis.com.br/Stage/dcvxvi.html Literature During the period of the year 1927, when Febr√¥nio was showcased in the newspapers, an unknown author who signed as M. Splayne, possibly a pseudonym, wrote The crimes of the monster Febr√¥nio, a collection of information obtained in the press and that barely disguised his condemnatory impetus.SPLAYNE, M. The crimes of the monster Febr√¥nio. Rio de Janeiro: Liv. J. of Rio, 1927. In the same year, the Swiss poet Blaise Cendrars collected data on Febr√¥nio during his stay in Brazil and obtained authoritzation to speak to him personally in the House of Detention. The material served for the publication of a series of critical articles in the French newspaper Paris Soir, compiled in 1938 in the chapter Febr√¥nio (magic sexualis) of his book La vie dangereuse, in which he tried to correlate the crimes of Febr√¥nio with his mixed race of African descent and the Brazilian tropical climate, in addition to describing the sensations he experienced when interviewing him.CENDRARS, Blaise.

The book of Febr√¥nio. S√£o Paulo: [Publisher?], 2001. Music Between 1928 and 1935, Febr√¥nio was the theme of some carnival marches. One of them, \\"I went in the bush, Creole\\", authored by Gomes J√∫nior, has the following excerpt: \\"I went in the bush, / creole, / look for cip√≥, / Creole! / I saw an animal, / Creole, / with one eye! / It was not a bug, / it was nothing, / was the Febr√≥n / of wide pants \\". Language and collective imagination Febr√¥nio was used in the 1930s as a bogeyman by parents who had the intention of frightening their disobedient children, with phrases such as \\"Be careful that Febr√¥nio comes to get you!\\" Cinema In 1981, Jos√© Sette directed the feature film \\"Febr√¥nio √çndio do Brasil\\".FEBRONIA, INDIAN OF BRAZIL.

Television The program Linha Direta, on Rede Globo, dedicated their November 25, 2004 broadcast to the crimes committed by Febr√¥nio, played in skits by actor Flavio Bauraqui. The episode included comments from specialists in Law and Medicine, among them Dr. Talvane Marins de Moraes, a forensic psychiatrist who accompanied Febr√¥nio in his last years as an intern of the Heitor Carrilho Custody Hospital. Legal legacy The judgment of Febr√¥nio √çndio do Brasil was recognized as the triumph of scientific arguments about the cold letter of the law. It was the first Brazilian case in which medical science influenced a judicial decision in proving that the defendant was completely incapable of understanding the unlawful nature of the fact committed by him and should not therefore be penalized, since the agent nor would he understand the intimidatory and corrective intent of the repressive measure.FRY, Peter. Positive Law versus Classical Law: psychologization of crime in Brazil in the thought of Heitor Carrilho. In: FIGUEIRA, S√©rvulo Augusto. Culture of Psychoanalysis. S√£o Paulo: Brasiliense, 1985. Prevailing in the judgment of Febr√¥nio the distinction between criminal and sick, something that occurred in France almost a century before, in 1835, in the case Pi√©rre Rivi√®re, who until then reigned a classical legal school, who judged the crime committed by someone equipped with free will, gave way to the positivist school, aimed at the man as an individual immersed in a socio-cultural environment, which allowed to inaugurate in the country the measure of security for criminals that are criminally incapable and endowed with lasting danger, aiming at the treatment of morbid condition and the prevention of recidivism, a principle definitively established in Brazilian legislation by the Penal Code of 1940.WUNDERLICH, Alexandre. The cases of Pi√©rre Rivi√®re and Febr√¥nio √çndio do Brasil as examples of institutionalized violence. Jus Navigandi, Teresina, v. 4, n. 43, 2000. Available at: http://jus.com.br/artigos/1013 Febr√¥nio was also the first case in which science legitimized a perpetual social segregation in Brazil, since the mental illness that held the criminal understanding was permanent and progressive, with a low probability of cure. Unlike the Pierre Rivi√®re case, whose diagnosis of monomania was enough just to commute his death penalty into life imprisonment, fulfilled in Beulieu Prison next to offenders without mental illness, which never received new psychiatric evaluations to her suicide by hanging,FOCAULT, Michel. I, Pi√©rre Rivi√®re, who swallowed my mother, my sister and my brother, 5. ed. Rio de Janeiro: Graal, 1991. Febr√¥nio was, during the entire period of his hospitalization in the custody hospital, regularly submitted to medical treatment and electroconvulsive therapy, aiming, always after periodic psychiatric exams, to prepare a medical report attesting his cure or the absence of dangerousness, which would enable him to be discharged from hospital and returned to normal life in society, or a medical report that would confirm the maintenance or aggravation of his mental illness, which would keep him, at least until the next examination, in the Judicial Asylum in the name of social defense.CARRILHO, Hector. The collaboration of the psychiatrists on the pity issues. Archives of the Judicial Asylum of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, v. 1, n. 1, p. 43-54, 1930.

Medicine, especially psychiatry, has evolved, benefited in part by the interest aroused by the mystic-delirious ideas of Febr√¥nio. At the time, it was routine to deal with people with mental illness using a strait jacket and thermal shock by bathing with water of different temperatures, with poor results for the rehabilitation of sanity. Thanks to the progress of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, currently patients with even more severe conditions are treated in an efficient way, which allows the extinction of dangerousness and the return to social life. This scientific development was only achieved in Brazil due to the seminal studies of psychiatrists Dr. Leonidio Ribeiro,RIBEIRO, Leon√≠dio. The Febr√¥nio case: some considerations about sadism.

Dr. Murillo Campos and Dr. Waldemar Berardinelli, who show that crime may be a clinical sign, sometimes the first and even the only one, of potentially curable mental illness. The initial diagnosis of moral madness given to Febr√¥nio by Dr. Heitor Carrilho, based on theories of Ernst Kretschmer, Sigmund Freud and James Pritchard, innovative for the first decades of the twentieth century, was reformed by forensic psychiatrist Dr. Talvane Marins de Moraes, who had the opportunity to study his psychic picture in private and in person. Thus, equipped with the most advanced diagnostic resources and modern psychopathological concepts, Dr. Moraes found that Febr√¥nio suffered from hebephrenic-paranoid schizophrenia.MORAES, Talvane Marins de.

Amminapes knew Alexander from his youth at the Macedonian court, where he remained in exile together with Artabazos II and a Persian nobleman named Sisines, after conflicts with the Achaemenid ruler Artaxerxes III. He was later able to return to the Achaemenid Empire and was given responsibilities in Egypt. He was in Egypt with the satrap Mazakes in late 332 BCE when they surrendered the country to Alexander, and he is the one who convinced Mazakes to do so and helped negotiate the terms of the surrender. He then joined the army of Alexander the Great. Amminapes later received in 330 BCE the satrapy of Parthia and Hyrcania as a reward for his services, but he was still joined with the Macedonian general Tlepolemus. Tlepolemus was later appointed by Alexander satrap of Carmania, which he retained on the death of Alexander in 323 BC, and also at the fresh division of the provinces at Triparadisus in 321.

Gurudwara Parmeshar Dwar Sahib  Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale with parents. The new building of Gurudwara Parmeshar Dwar Sahib is situated on the Sangrur-Patiala Road Sheikhupur, Punjab, was completed in 2010. Kalgidhar Sangat Niwas was built shortly afterwards. A massive diwan hall with sitting capacity of over 50000 was also built. Here, monthly Guru Manyo Granth Chetna Samagam (the holy congregation) is organized on First Saturday of every month. Sikh devotees (Sangat) gather in huge numbers and Amrit Sanchar is also held on same day. He also broadcast preaching live through TV, youtube and a dedicated app. Gurudwara Parmeshar Dwar Sahib  Philosophy  Dhadrianwale urges people to apply the teachings of Sikh Gurus in daily life, instead of just performing rituals. He urges common Sikh people to read and understand the Gurbani and follow it in day-to- day activities. He refuses to believe in heaven or hell and claims that all our Karmas are paid-for at mental, emotional and spiritual levels in this life. People must be honest, hardworking and should follow their responsibilities with passion. He teaches people to live a practical and truthful life. He also opposes animal slaughter practices that are prevalent in some groups. His faith in God is not limited to any deity, personality or holy place. He emphasizes that the whole universe is the embodiment of God (Ik Onkaar) itself including the humans. He strongly criticizes exploitation of the environment, \\"We must take are of nature as it takes care of us\\" The law of nature is one thing he strongly believes in. Nature is bound by laws, and if we follow them, the desired results are bound to come.  Controversies  In recent years, he shifted to a different perspective of understanding the ideas in Guru Granth Sahib. There has been some ongoing controversy among some Sikh scholars and Sikh groups over this. In 2016, a conflict started with Baba Harnam Singh of Damdami Taksal. The basis of this was ideological diasgreement. On the evening of 17 May 2016, while Ranjit Singh was travelling to attend a Diwan (congregation) in Ludhiana, more than two dozen armed men attacked him. His aide Bhai Bhupinder Singh Khasi Kalan was shot dead, but Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale survived. Dhadrianwale continued to receive life threats from various groups. CM of Punjab interfered and asked them to stop giving such threats. In February 2020, activist from Sikh groups including Damdami Taksal disrupted his sermons citing Dhadrian Wale's distortion of Sikh history and opposition of core Sikh principles like Naam Japna (meditation with recitation of God‚Äôs name); waking up at amrit vela (early morning) and belief in heaven and hell. Dhadrian Wale preaches that these principles should be as per the judgement of an individual. In August 2020, the Akal Takht directed the Sikh community to boycott Dhadrian Wale till he seeks clemency for his alleged objectionable remarks against 'Sikh principles', the jathedar of Akal Takht and distortion of Sikh history. Dhadrian Wale was previously asked to participate in a meeting with a five-member committee constituted by Akal Takht Jathedar Harpreet Singh at Gurdwara Dukh Niwaran Sahib, Patiala in December 2019, but he declined.

The score, composed by Pinar Toprak, was released by Hollywood Records on March 8, 2019, in the United States. Background In May 2018, Clark Gregg indicated that the film's soundtrack would include songs from the 1990s. Pinar Toprak signed on to compose the film's score the following month, making her the first woman to score an MCU film. Directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck stated that while they wanted to bring in more women on the film, Toprak was not hired because of her gender but because she stood out as their favorite among a group of candidates that included both men and women. For her audition, Toprak hired a 70-piece orchestra to perform seven minutes of music that she composed. Toprak described the score as a fusion of electronic and orchestral sounds with the electronic parts representing the aliens and the orchestra representing the main character. Toprak recorded the electronic sounds on an analog-synthesizer in her home studio and recorded a 90-piece orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London. Toprak said that the main part of the score's development was the title character's theme, while later developing themes for the Kree and the Skrulls, whom she tried to connect in order to \\"find the universe\\" for the film's scenes in space and Earth, while describing the scenes on Earth as \\"fun\\". Toprak tried to develop the character's theme as a theme \\"that is recognizable from the first two notes\\", stating that \\"[the audience] don't always have time, especially later in the movie, to fully go into it\\". She began developing the film's theme by \\"humming ideas\\", eventually coming with \\"a minor-seven interval\\" during a walk, which she used as the film's theme. Toprak said that Carol Danvers' theme is \\"strong and powerful\\", but also emotional, in order to focus on the character's vulnerability. She also tried to showcase the character's \\"super fun and really witty\\" nature. Toprak was inspired by 90's films for the score, stating that \\"[b]ack then, action movie scores were a lot more note-y. Very dynamic with a lot of things going on\\", and that the score pays homage to the score to the action films from 1990.\\" Toprak references Alan Silvestri's theme from The Avengers near the end of the film. In April 2019, Mark Salcido of the website Screen Geek alleged that Marvel and the film's directors had been unhappy with Toprak's work on the film even after she had responded to \\"ample\\" notes, and had replaced her as composer for the film with Michael Giacchino. Giacchino responded to this report by confirming he was involved in the film, revealing that he had been asked to give feedback on Toprak's work while he was working with Marvel on the score for Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). He thought Toprak had written a \\"beautiful theme and an inspiring score\\" for the film, and had helped her work on \\"a few cues\\" which he said was him supporting her as a fellow member of the Marvel \\"family\\". Giacchino made it clear that he \\"did not write the score to Captain Marvel ... bottom line is [Toprak] is a fabulous composer and certainly doesn't need me.\\" Track listing Additional music Additional music featured in the film includes: * \\"Crazy on You\\" by Heart * \\"Kiss Me Deadly\\" by Lita Ford * \\"Whatta Man\\" by Salt-N-Pepa * \\"Connection\\" by Elastica * \\"Only Happy When It Rains\\" by Garbage * \\"Crush with Eyeliner\\" by R.E.M. * \\"Waterfalls\\" by TLC * \\"You Gotta Be\\" by Des'ree * \\"Come As You Are\\" by Nirvana * \\"Just a Girl\\" by No Doubt * \\"Man on the Moon\\" by R.E.M. * \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" by The Marvelettes (sung by Samuel L. Jackson) * \\"Celebrity Skin\\" by Hole An official playlist containing these songs is available on Apple Music.

Superseded by larger, drive-through vessels, she was re-built and moved to the Kyles of Bute where she served until 1986. History MV Broadford was built to provide additional capacity on the Skye crossing. However, the service still struggled to keep up with increasing demand. Side-loading was slow and larger, bow-loading vessels were ordered for Skye. In 1969, STG acquired the Bute Berthing Co. and was re-built and re-engined for service at Colintraive. Broadford remained for some months as spare vessel before joining her old consort on the Clyde. She underwent near-identical conversion at Lamont's but was not re-engined or shortened. Layout Broadford was similar to her sister, . She was built with side ramps with angled ends and a deck-turntable. Unlike Portree, her navigation bridge was placed aft for greater stability and her side-ramps were hydraulically operated and were significantly wider to accommodate large vehicles. She had no passenger lounge but in 1968, a very small shelter was fitted. In 1971, she was converted to bow-loading, with a hydraulically operated bow ramp, hinged at three points and hanging from two long booms. She lost her side-ramps and deck-turntable and could then carry ten cars or one commercial vehicle and eight cars. Her vehicle deck was strengthened to carry 20-ton loads.

Originally written in Latin, the book was dedicated to the prophet Daniel from the Old Testament, but Daniel is not attributed as the author of the dream book. An explanation for the dedication is that Daniel was considered a father of dream sciences, and his prophetic visions served as inspiration for the arts of dream interpretation. One of the main sources for the contents of the book is the Oneirocritica of Artemidorus. The Somniale Danielis was very important during the Middle Ages for explaining dreams, specifically in the identification of meaning and transferable knowledge. Although the Church attempted various bans on divination, the interpretation of dreams through dream books was popular. The first manuscript, according to scholars, was likely written in the 5th century, and the text was repeatedly distributed and remained popular until the sixteenth century. The vernacular works of literary figures such as Dante and Boccaccio used the Somniale Danielis as inspiration to create relatable stories based on dream narratives for popular audiences.  Contents and structure  The Somniale Danielis has a basic glossary layout, in which key terms corresponded directly to the main theme or content of the dream. The words were arranged alphabetically, followed by concise interpretation of the dream. Examples of the glossary include references to specific creatures, objects, events etc, often paired with whether the vision should be interpreted as positive or negative. The Somniale Danielis also contained tests by which the importance of the dream could be ascertained. These tests included questioning such as the time of night they dreamed or if they had overeaten before bed. The manuscripts were often colour-coded, for example the subject of the dream would be written in red, while the explanation would be written in black. The structure takes influence from Greek manuscripts, especially Oneirocritical texts. The Somniale Danielis was translated into Arabic and European vernaculars, and thousands of unique versions are believed to have existed, though most are assumed lost.  Interpretation and significance  Historical study of the dream manual has aimed at comparing local editions of the manual in aim to isolate unique cultural features of a given location, to establish the manuals as ‚Äúwitnesses of a popular culture‚Äù. The Somniale Danielis is perceived to collate traditional beliefs that were once transmitted orally. Historians have tried to recreate and reinterpret the culture of the lower classes of European populations by attempting to understand the dreams of people and the meanings they imparted on society. It is believed that what was included in the manuals tended to be things which were important to that given society, so by investigating each individual manuscript of the Somniale Danielis, we can learn more about the popular culture of the Middle Ages, not just as geographically homogeneous, but as specific to particular regions, or in some cases to particular towns or communes. Scholarly consensus also believes that dream manuals are one of the few pieces of literature of the Middle Ages which transcended class, and are applicable to all levels of the social strata.

He began his career as a three-year-old in Australia where he won two races and ran second in the Rosehill Guineas before being exported to Hong Kong. As a four- year-old he won twice and was placed third in both the Hong Kong Classic Mile and the Hong Kong Derby. In the following year he emerged as the best racehorse in Hong Kong, winning five races including the Celebration Cup, Sha Tin Trophy, Hong Kong Mile, Queen's Silver Jubilee Cup and Champions Mile and being named Hong Kong Horse of the Year. He resumed his form in the following season, taking the Celebration Cup, Sha Tin Trophy, Jockey Club Mile, Hong Kong Mile, Hong Kong Stewards' Cup and Queen's Silver Jubilee Cup. He was rated the fourth-best racehorse in the world for 2018 and the equal-best horse ever trained in Hong Kong. Background Beauty Generation is a bay gelding with a narrow white blaze and four white socks bred at Highden Stud in Palmerston North, New Zealand by Nearco Stud Limited. In 2014 he was put up for auction at the New Zealand Bloodstock National Yearling Sale and was bought for NZ$60,000 by Hermes Syndications. He was sent to race in Australia where he was named Montaigne and entered training with Anthony Cummings who also headed the syndicate which owned the horse. He was sired by Road To Rock, a top-class Australian performer whose wins included the George Main Stakes in 2009 and the Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2010. Beauty Generation's dam was a descendant of Eulogy (foaled 1911), a British mare who was exported to New Zealand and was the ancestor of numerous major winners including Dundeel, Red Handed, Bonecrusher and Ambitious Dragon. Racing career 2015/2016: three-year-old season Montaigne began his track career in Australia by finishing second in a maiden race over 1100 metres at Warwick Farm Racecourse on 7 January 2015 and recorded his first success in a similar event over 1400 metres at the same track thirteen day later. On 6 February Randwick Racecourse he took on older horses in a handicap race over 1600 metres and won again, coming home more than two lengths in front of Kellyville Flyer. In his four remaining Australian starts Montaigne was campaigned in Group races and showed good form despite failing to win. He finished third in the Hobartville Stakes, fifth in the Randwick Guineas, second in the Rosehill Guineas and fourth in The BMW. At the end of the season Montaigne was sold privately to Patrick Kwok Ho Chuen and exported to Hong Kong where he was renamed Beauty Generation and sent into training with John Moore. In all of his subsequent races he wore blinkers. 2016/2017: four-year-old season Beauty Generation was ridden in all of his races as a four-year-old by Zac Purton and was campaigned exclusively at Sha Tin Racecourse. He wore blinkers in all of his Hong Kong races. On 27 December the gelding ran second on his Hong Kong debut and then recorded his first success for his new connections when he won the Violet Handicap over 1600 metres on 17 January, beating California Disegno by a head. He was then moved up in class and was beaten by Rapper Dragon on his next three starts, finishing third the Hong Kong Classic Mile, eleventh in the Hong Kong Classic Cup and third in the Hong Kong Derby. In April he was dropped back in class for the Jinbao Street Handicap over 2200 metres and won again, beating Eagle Way by a short head. On his final run of the season he was stepped up in trip for the 2400 metre Queen Mother Memorial Cup and finished unplaced behind Eagle Way. 2017/2018: five-year-old season Sha Tin Racecourse, the location for most of Beauty Generation's races K C Leung rode Beauty Generation in most of his races in the 2017/2018 season. Starting at odds of 17.9/1 on his seasonal debut in the Group 3 Celebration Cup over 1400 metres on 1 October, the gelding led from the start and won \\"unchallenged\\" by one and a half lengths from the favourite Seasons Bloom with Time Warp (Hong Kong Cup), Beauty Only (2016 Hong Kong Mile) and Eagle Way finishing behind. Three weeks later he followed up in the Group 2 Sha Tin Trophy, beating Booming Delight by a head after taking the lead 400 metres from the finish in a race which saw Werther (Hong Kong Cup), Beauty Only and Helene Paragon (Queen's Silver Jubilee Cup) run unplaced. In the Jockey Club Mile on 19 November he started favourite, but in a closely contested finish he was beaten into third place behind Seasons Bloom and Helene Paragon. In the Group 1 Hong Kong Mile on 10 December Beauty Generation started the 7.4/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Seasons Bloom, Beauty Only and Helene Paragon in a fourteen-runner field which also included Roly Poly and Lancaster Bomber from Ireland, Satono Aladdin (Yasuda Kinen) from Japan and Lightning Spear from England. He took the lead from the start, broke clear of his rivals early in the straight, and stayed on well to win by a length from the 35/1 outsider Western Express. After the race, John Moore said \\"As we anticipated, he got the gun run today. He was able to dictate on his own terms, and over a mile he definitely has a turn of foot. He really attacked the line today. I thought if he wasn't taken on, he'd be very tough.\\" In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Beauty Generation was rated the ninetieth-best horse in the world with a rating of 118. On 28 January Beauty Generation finished only seventh to Seasons Bloom in the Stewards' Cup after which Leung lost the ride on the gelding. Purton resumed the ride when Beauty Generation started the third choice in the betting behind Beat The Clock and Fifty Fifty in the Queen's Silver Jubilee Cup over 1400 metres on 25 February. He was among the leaders from the start, took the lead 400 metres out and \\"held on gamely\\" to win by a head from Beat The Clock. On 8 April he finished fifth to Beauty Only in the Chairman's Trophy, conceding five pounds in weight to four horses who finished ahead of him. Three weeks later the horse ended his season in the Champions Mile and, with Purton in the saddle, started favourite ahead of seven opponents including Season Bloom, Pingwu Spark, Singapore Sling (Hong Kong Classic Cup) and Beauty Only. Beauty Generation took the lead soon after the start and set a steady pace before accelerating in the straight and winning by a length from Western Express. In July 2018 Beauty Generation was named Hong Kong Champion Miler and Hong Kong Horse of the Year at the Hong Kong Jockey Club Champion Awards. Moore, who was winning the award for the sixth time, commented \\"When he wins, it's not always exciting, he just gets out in front or on the speed and wins the big ones. I brought him back from what we thought was a 2000 metre horse and made him a miler and here we are enjoying the fruits of all his successes on the stage of Horse of the Year ‚Äì it's amazing\\". 2018/2019: six-year-old season Zac Purton, Beauty Generation's regular jockey Zac Purton was Beauty Generation's regular jockey in the 2018‚Äì2019 season. The gelding began his campaign, as in the previous season, in the Celebration Cup for which he was assigned top weight of 133 pounds. After racing in second place he took the lead 400 metres out and accelerated away from the field to win in \\"impressive\\" style by two and three quarter lengths from Ping Hai Star. On 20 October he repeated his 2017 success in the Sha Tin Trophy, winning by half a length from Singapore Sling, to whom he was conceding sixteen pounds, after leading from the start. In the Jockey Club Mile on 18 November Beauty Generation started odds-on favourite, with the best fancied of his seven opponents being Singapore Sling and Beauty Only. After tracking the early leaders he moved up on the outside and took the lead entering the straight. Despite hanging to the left in the closing stages he came home three lengths clear of Southern Legend, with Beauty Only a head away in third place. On 9 December Beauty Generation attempted to repeat his 2017 success in the Hong Kong Mile and started odds-on favorite in a fourteen- runner field. Beauty Only, Singapore Sling and Southern Legend were again in opposition while the international contingent included Vivlos (Dubai Turf), Persian Knight (Mile Championship) and Mozu Ascot (Yasuda Kinen) from Japan, One Master (Prix de la For√™t) and Beat The Bank (Summer Mile Stakes) from England, Comin' Through (Doomben Cup) from Australia and Inns of Court (Prix du Palais-Royal) from France. Beauty Generation went to the front before half way, broke clear of the field early in the straight and came home three lengths clear of Vivlos. Purton commented \\"That's what we all hoped we would see today. I‚Äôm just happy for the horse that he's come out and produced it on a big stage. He showed everyone how brutally good he can be. He's got a really high cruising speed ‚Äì he's very comfortable rolling along at that speed and then he can kick off it.\\" In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Beauty Generation given a rating of 127, making him the fourth best racehorse in the world behind Cracksman, Winx and Accelerate. His rating matched that of Able Friend in 2014 making him the equal highest rated horse ever trained in Hong Kong. On his next appearance Beauty Generation made a second attempt to win the Stewards' Cup and was made the 1/10 favourite, with the best-fancied of his five opponents being Conte and Pakistan Star (Queen Elizabeth II Cup). He led from the start opened up a clear advantage in the straight, and won \\"comfortably\\" by three lengths from Conte. After the race Moore described the winner as the best horse he had ever trained, ahead of Viva Pataca and Able Friend. The Queen's Silver Jubilee Cup on 17 February saw Beauty Generation head the betting at odds of 1/4 ahead of Beat The Clock, who had won the Centenary Sprint Cup in January. Having gained the advantage from Beat The Clock after 400 metres he led the field into the straight and was never seriously challenged, winning by one and three quarter lengths. Moore commented \\"When I saddled him up he just wanted to knock me down and get out of the boxes. This horse is in such good form at the moment. Today we had no hiccups leading into the race whatsoever, everything has gone exactly to plan.\\" On 7 April Beauty Generation made his second attempt to win the Chairman's Trophy and went off at odds of 1/5 against eight opponents. He led from the start, accelerated clear in the final furlong and won by one and a quarter lengths from Eagle Way with Pakistan Star half a length back in third. On 28 April the gelding attempted to repeat his 2018 success in the Champions Mile and went off at odds of 1/20 against six opponents headed by Conte and Singapore Sling. He went to the front and set a steady pace before accelerating in the straight and won in a \\"canter\\" by a length and a half from Singapore Sling. His victory made him the first horse to win eight races in a Hong Kong season and took his lifetime earnings to HK$84,770,000 beating the record set by Viva Pataca.

In August 2018, German publisher Strictly Limited Games announced plans to finish and release the game. The company's team of nine people, including DICE co-founder Fredrik Liljegren and other former DICE employees, used an original Sega Genesis development kit to finish the game's production, porting the game to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, two modern systems, afterwards. At the time, Sony, the makers of the PlayStation, owned the Psygnosis back-catalog. Strictly Limited Games also attempted to add tank levels that were missing from the game with input from its original designers. Prior to release, Hardcore was retitled Ultracore due to licensing issues. Ultracore was first released as part of the Mega Sg, an aftermarket console for Sega Genesis games developed by Analogue, on March 25, 2019. Ultracore is set to be released for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch on June 23, 2020, with a planned release for PlayStation Vita at a later date. A physical version compatible with original Sega Genesis systems is also planned. In Japan, this version was released by Columbus Circle on 17 October 2019.

Polman's mother is American, and her father Canadian. She was raised as a Reformed Mennonite, but later converted to Islam. In 2011, the Soroptimist International issued her a Women's Opportunity Award. Her citation said she was working on a diploma in Legal Administration, and planned to work as a children's advocate.  Time in Syria  Polman had taken an interest in nursing, and her online penpal, who said his name was Abu Aymen, told her that her nursing skills were needed in the caliphate. The two later married. In early 2015, Polman travelled from Vancouver to Istanbul on her US passport. She told her family that she was going to Austria for two weeks. Polman says she had grown disenchanted with Daesh by 2016, and tried to escape. She says she was captured, and imprisoned, in Raqqa, where she endured brutal interrogation and rape. Polman is currently being held in the al-Hawl refugee camp in Syria, where she is held with New Jersey-born Hoda Muthana. Polman left three adult children in Canada when she traveled to Istanbul. Polman's siblings told The New York Times that she had a hard life, and that they had been unable to help her. Howard Eisenberg, an immigration lawyer in Polman's home town, told local reporters for CHCH-TV that he anticipates her struggle to return to Hamilton to be a long one. Ian Austen, one of The New York Times Canadian correspondents wrote about Polman, after discussing her with Rukmini Callimachi, The New York Times reporter who first found her, in the refugee camp in Syria. He wrote that Callimachi speculated that she first identified herself as a Canadian to her American captors because she would be treated more leniently, as a Canadian, only to realize that Canadians were \\"in limbo\\". Callamachi speculated that Polman started to identify as an American when she realized that while Americans might face prosecution upon repatriation, at least they were being repatriated.

He is known for his research on the health effects of exposure to silica and alumina. Biography James Derek Birchall (usually known as Derek) was born in Leigh, the son of David Birchall, who managed a butcher‚Äôs shop, and Valetta (n√©e Marsh), who died in childbirth, aged 25. David Birchall remarried four years later, to Dora Mary Leather. In the meantime, Derek had been brought up by his grandparents. Birchall left primary school, aged 14, and joined an industrial firm in his area, Sutcliffe Speakman as a general laboratory assistant. He was promoted to assistant in the research laboratory, and worked on activated carbon and flame. From an internal company report in 1947 it was evident that Birchall had done a lot of experimental work ‚Äúwith great care and precision‚Äù. After a period of time with John Kerr & Co, and doing his National Service in the army, Birchall joined ICI Salt Division in 1957, as assistant technical officer. Much of his early work there was on the nucleation of sodium chloride solutions and the improved formation of dendritic crystals. He was then transferred to ICI Cassel Works to apply his expertise to help commission a sodium cyanide plant, and increase the size of the crystals produced. After the formation of the Mond Division in 1964, and further promotion, Birchall had his own team and could return to his first love: the extinction of fire. It resulted in the invention and commercialising of Monnex, a dry powder extinguisher still in use today. He later worked on new composite materials, and on silica and its hydrates. There then followed a period of outside appointments: * 1976-1985 Visiting Professor in Materials Science, University of Surrey * 1977-1979 Visiting Fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford * 1984-1986 Visiting Professor at MIT * 1985 Professorial Associate of Brunel University * 1986-1988 Visiting Professor of Biochemistry, University of Surrey * 1988-ca 1991 Visiting Professor at Durham University In 1992, Birchall took up the post of Professor of Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Keele, where he became interested in the role of silicon in biology. Awards and honours He was named a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1982, making him one of very few individuals without a university degree to be so named. He was named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1990, and (with J.E. Evetts) was jointly awarded the Armourers and Brasiers' Company Prize in 1993. Family Birchall married Pauline Mary Jones at Sheffield register office on 2 June 1956. They had two sons, Shaun and Timothy. James Derek Birchall died in a traffic accident. He was ‚Äústruck by a vehicle on a pedestrian crossing in London on 30 November 1995. After several days on a life-support machine he died without regaining consciousness on 7 December.‚Äù He was buried at St John the Evangelist's Church, Norley, alongside his wife, who had died five years earlier.

Ownership of the brewery changed several times until John Beck bought out his partner Stephen Weber in 1861, and retained ownership until 1877 when it was sold to Jacob Veldt. Two years later it was sold to William Gerlach who renamed the brewery Cream City Brewing Company. During the 19th century, the brewery was emerging as a significant player in the Milwaukee beer market. In the 1880s, the facility produced 25,000 barrels of beer annually. The company was able to survive Prohibition by selling near beer. However, due to debt problems, the company was foreclosed by creditors in 1937.

The operation  Having received a request from Admiral King to provide a distraction for Operation Watchtower, Vice Admiral Sir James Somerville decided on a fake invasion force, which were to sortie towards the Andaman Islands in an effort to draw Japanese forces to the area. Somerville himself would be shadowing with 'Force A' consisting of the battleship HMS Warspite, aircraft carriers HMS Illustrious and HMS Formidable, light cruisers HMS Birmingham, HMS Effingham, HMS Mauritius and HNLMS Jacob van Heemskerck and destroyers , HMAS Napier, HMAS Nizam, HMAS Norman and HNLMS Van Galen. Units started to assemble along the Indian coast and at Ceylon from 21-25 July, with a start date of 1 August. 'Force A' sortied early on the 30th after reports of Japanese cruisers being seen. The three dummy fleets set sail on 1 August from Vizagapatam ('Force V'), Madras ('Force M') and Trincomalee ('Force T'), this last force contained the RFA tankers Appleleaf and Broomdale. On the evening of the 1st 'Operation Spark' was carried out, this was a faked plain language SOS message from one of the ships reporting a collision and unable to move. The diversion forces then turned to return to port. Somerville stayed nearby for some hours but as no Japanese attacks or movements developed, and his heavy ships were required for Operation Stream Line Jane he decided to end the operation and return to port.  Aftermath  While the operation was carried out successfully and without combat losses, the Japanese failed to take the bait and no significant naval or air units were redeployed ‚Äì although the seaplane tender Sagara Maru was sent to the islands on the 4th and a bomber unit sent to reinforce Sabang so it could be said to have been a minor success.

Based on the public perception of her as a white child after photographs of her were published in the press, she was compared to the fictional character of Ida May and used by abolitionists before the Civil War to advance the cause of ending slavery in the United States.  Early life  Mary Mildred Williams, born Botts in 1847, was the second child of Seth Botts and his wife Elizabeth (n√©e Nelson). Seth and Elizabeth were married in the early 1840s. Williams had an older brother, Oscar, and a younger sister, Adelaide (also known by her middle name of Rebecca). At the time of Williams‚Äô birth, her mother, brother, grandmother, and aunts were enslaved in Prince William County, Virginia, near Washington, while her father was enslaved in neighboring Stafford County. The maternal side of Williams' family were the subjects of protracted legal battles centering around the descendants of Jesse and Constance Cornwell. Through her father, Humphrey Calvert, Constance purchased Williams' maternal great-grandmother, Lettice (or \\"Letty\\"), and grandmother, Prudence Bell (also known as \\"Prucy\\" or \\"Pru\\"), between 1809-1812. According to court and census records, Williams' mother, Elizabeth, was the daughter of Prudence and a white man named Thomas Nelson, who was Cornwell's executor. Upon becoming free at the age of seven in 1855, Williams and her family joined her father, who had escaped Virginia and changed his name to Henry Williams, in Boston. Between the 1855 Massachusetts state census and 1860 federal census, the Botts family changed their name to Williams. In the summer of 1860, Williams‚Äô older brother Oscar died from tuberculosis.  Legal proceedings  When Constance Cornwell died in 1825, she willed Williams' maternal grandmother, Prudence, her two children Elizabeth (Williams' mother) and Albert, and \\"the increase of the females forever\\" to her daughter Kitty Cornwell's eldest son John Cornwell. She specified in her will that the inherited slaves (or their children) could not be sold, and if he were to try they would be freed. Because John was not of age at the time of Constance's death, her slaves were to be retained by the executor of her will, Thomas Nelson, until John turned 21 in 1830. However, Constance‚Äôs will was disputed by her children, and a legal battle began in 1835. The legal disputes continued for years, and Prudence and her children remained in Nelson‚Äôs possession. When Nelson passed away in 1845, J.C. Weedon, his qualified administrator, took possession of Prudence along with her children and grandchildren. John Cornwell instituted proceedings to recover the family from Weedon in 1847, as they had been willed to him by Constance. The case of Nelson‚Äôs Adm‚Äôr v. Cornwell was decided by the Virginia Supreme Court in October 1854. It awarded all of the property to John, aided by Prudence‚Äôs husband and Mary‚Äôs father, Seth Botts, then known as Henry Williams.  Freedom  In 1855, at age seven, Williams became free through the efforts of her father, Seth Botts, an escaped slave. Botts had escaped bondage in 1850, renamed himself to Henry Williams, and spent the subsequent four years seeking out the help of prominent abolitionists in Boston in his quest to secure his family‚Äôs freedom. Williams, with the help of his wealthy backers, bought the property from Cornwell and ended his family‚Äôs bondage. This is how Henry‚Äôs daughter, Mary Mildred Williams, came to the attention of abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner.  Relationship to the abolitionist movement  On March 1, 1855 a letter from Charles Sumner dated February 19 addressed ‚ÄòDear Doctor‚Äô was published in the New-York Daily Times (originally published in the Boston Telegraph on February 27) that had accompanied a daguerreotype of Williams. In the letter, Sumner declares: ‚ÄúThe daguerreotype mentioned in the following letter is a portrait of one of the family referred to, a most beautiful white girl, with high forehead, straight hair, intellectual appearance, and decidedly attractive features.‚Äù In a subsequent article March 9, 1855, reporters of the New-York Daily Times expressed ‚Äúastonishment‚Äù that she was ‚Äúever held a slave.‚Äù In early 1855, articles were published about her in the Boston Telegraph and the New York Times, and copies of her photograph were widely publicized. After her photograph was published, she accompanied Senator Charles Sumner, a leading abolitionist, on a publicity tour. The photo and tour made her famous, and she was compared to fictional character Ida May, the child hero of the then popular novel about a white girl kidnapped into slavery, Ida May: a Story of Things Actual and Possible by Mary Hayden Pike (1854). She was described in the words of a columnist in Frederick Douglass‚Äô Paper as ‚Äòperfectly white, and on that account produces intense excitement. We see daily white fugitives and the cupidity of a slaveholder would suffer him to keep anyone, even his mother, in slavery. When white men learn this, and that their own liberties are in danger, then they will see the reasonable-ness of an unconditional emancipation.‚Äô Abolitionists emphasized her perceived whiteness to enlist sympathy, as well as to frighten Northerners that any child, regardless of appearance, might be snatched away and made a slave. On May 19 and 20, 1856, Sumner spoke in the Senate comparing Southern political positions to the sexual exploitation of slaves then taking place in the South. Two days later Sumner was beaten almost to death on the floor of the Senate in the Capitol by Representative Preston Brooks from South Carolina, known as a hothead.  Adulthood and death  By 1865, Williams had moved to Lexington, Massachusetts, along with her parents and sister. Five years later, she was living with her mother and sister in Hyde Park, a suburb of Boston. It is unclear why her father did not join them there. Williams as well as her mother and sister were listed as white in the 1870 census. Both she and her mother identified as white women for the remainder of their lives. When her mother died in 1892, the death certificate listed her maiden name as that of her white father: ‚ÄúElizabeth A. (Nelson) Williams.‚Äù Williams never married nor had children. She became a clerk at Boston‚Äôs Registry of Deeds, where she worked until at least 1900. She rented an apartment in the Eleventh Ward of Boston, and according to the 1900 census, she lived there with her ‚Äúpartner,‚Äù Mary Maynard. Maynard worked as a bookkeeper and probation officer and was listed as the child of Irish and English immigrants. Williams died in 1921 and was buried in Boston.

It is located along Eldridge Road (County Route 23/2) between the unincorporated communities of Lehew and Yellow Spring.  Geography and setting  Concord is centered along Eldridge Road (County Route 23/2) in southeastern Hampshire County, West Virginia. It is situated approximately west-southwest of Lehew and approximately east-northeast of Yellow Spring. A 1933 map of Hampshire County placed Concord at the location of the former L Ridge School. Cacapon Mountain and the Cacapon River valley are positioned approximately west of Concord, and Timber Ridge is located approximately to the community's east.  History  The land upon which Concord is located was originally part of the Northern Neck Proprietary, a land grant that the exiled Charles II awarded to seven of his supporters in 1649 during the English Interregnum. Following the Restoration in 1660, Charles II finally ascended to the English throne. Charles II renewed the Northern Neck Proprietary grant in 1662, revised it in 1669, and again renewed the original grant favoring original grantee Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper and Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington in 1672. In 1681, Bennet sold his share to Lord Colepeper, and Lord Colepeper received a new charter for the entire land grant from James II in 1688. Following the deaths of Lord Colepeper, his wife Margaret, and his daughter Katherine, the Northern Neck Proprietary passed to Katherine's son Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron in 1719. Under Lord Fairfax's ownership, the Cacapon River Valley was predominantly inhabited by English-speaking settlers as early as the late 1730s; most came from Pennsylvania and New Jersey. As settlement progressed during the second half of the 18th century, the fertile land of Hampshire County (including the Cacapon River valley) also attracted German settlers from Pennsylvania and elsewhere in Virginia before and after the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1783). James Kelso, an immigrant from County Donegal, Ireland, purchased along Loman Branch near Concord in the 1804, and his landholdings eventually grew to approximately . The Concord Meeting House, once located in the vicinity of present-day Concord, was mentioned by early 19th-century Christian Reverend Christy Sine in his journal dating from the 1820s. A church known as the Concord Presbyterian Church also formerly operated in Concord. The United States Post Office Department established a post office at Concord on 8 March 1876. In July 1918, the department created a star route, which connected Concord to Gore, Virginia, on the Northwestern Turnpike, by way of Lehew and High View. This postal route ran from Concord to Gore and back six times per week, and became operational on 1 August 1918. Concord's post office remained in operation until 15 March 1933. Following its closure, Concord's mail was routed to the Lehew post office. Throughout its operation, Concord's post office had seven postmasters, including five grandchildren of settler James Kelso: Ida Cordelia Kelso, John Newton Kelso, Carter Gilbert Kelso, Laura Ellen Kelso, and Olive Willetta Kelso. {!

She was renamed MV Carrigaloe for service across the River Lee in County Cork. History MV Kyleakin was built to replace several smaller ferries on the Skye crossing. The crossing was an urgent problem when STG took over control from 1 January 1969. Side-loading had been slow and the small vessels could not keep up with increasing demand. In August 1969, Patrick Thomas announced a number of innovations, including the ordering of two 28-car ferries for Skye. While they were being built at a Newport yard, Ross & Cromarty County Council and Inverness County Council proceeded with new terminals for end-loading operation. There were delays with the ships and with the slip at Kyle. Kyleakin was floated out of the building dock on 24 July and towed to the Clyde for completion and trials. She finally entered service on 14 August but was troubled by problems with her hydraulic ramps and then her cooling system. Layout Kyleakin was novel in several ways. She was the first group ferry to be built outside Scotland, the first with drive-through capability and the first to be equipped with Voith- Schneider propulsion. She was built with large hydraulic ramps at both ends of a vehicle deck, strengthened to carry vehicles up to 32 tons. A narrow lounge along one side, with an deck open above provided passengers accommodation. Kyleakin had only one plain gantry mast, projecting inside from her wheelhouse. Her Gardner diesel engines were coupled to two Voith-Schneider propulsion-units at diametrically opposed corners of her hull, making her extremely manoeuvrable. Service Kyleakin and her sister replaced a fleet of small vessels at Skye in 1970/71. Traffic continued to increase. New ferries were ordered in February 1990 from Ferguson Shipbuilders at Port Glasgow. From 28 April 1991, CalMac instituted a year-round 24-hour service. Kyleakin was displaced by the new on 12 September 1991. Three days later, she left Kyle for Ireland. Her new owners, Cross River Ferries Ltd. of Cobh, County Cork renamed her Carrigaloe for service on the Carrigaloe‚ÄìGlenbrook service, again in consort with her sister (renamed Glenbrook).

They might have bought the liquor to drink after a day's work in the plantation.  Aftermath  Ten people have been detained for the incident. Assam Government has announced ex-gratia of 200,000 for the dead and 50,000 to those undergoing treatment. The Government is also planning to ban and seize all illicit liquor in the state.

In late 1401, Timur invaded the Kingdom of Georgia once again. George VII had to sue for peace, and sent his brother, Constantine with the contributions. Timur was preparing for a major confrontation with the Ottoman dynasty and apparently wished to freeze the currently prevailing situation in Georgia, until he could return to deal with it more decisively and thoroughly at his leisure. Thus, he made peace with George on several terms: * Georgia would pay annual tribute; * provide troops for Timur; * allow Timur's armies transit; * special privileges for Muslims;Sicker, Martin (2000), The Islamic World in Ascendancy: From the Arab Conquests to the Siege of Vienna, p. 155.

Timur gave the Georgian ambassadors fine gowns and a good send-off, pleased that ‚Äòthe obstinate have put their heads into the yoke of submission‚Äô.

The method has been developed to fulfil clinical demands of quick examinations. With this method, the observer can see if there is an increased respectively decreased mobility in a specific motion segment. The CTR technique measures both segmental and total skin distractions. It compares the degree of segmental flexion mobility by establishing a ratio between segmental and total skin distraction. First the skin distraction in cm is measured using a special transparent measuring strip and a pen, the absolute mobility. Then absolute values are calculated in a computer program, CTR graph 5.2. Relative values are shown in percent. Each person has totally 100% mobility in the area C7-T5. The relative values show how many percent of the total mobility that is related to in each motion segment. After each measure, a curve called the CTR profile is calculated. Norlander has created a classification system for relative segmental flexion mobility between C7-T5. Three classes of flexion mobility were defined ordinary, hypo- and hypermobility. Ordinary mobility was based on relative flexion mobility between the lower and the upper quartile for each motion segment between C7-T5. Hypomobility was based on relative flexion mobility below the lower quartile for each motion segment, between C7-T5. Hypermobility was based on the upper quartile for each motion segment, between C7-T5. From this classification a normal curve for the relative segmental flexion mobility has been calculated. CTR have high intratester repeatability with a coefficient of variation (CV) not exceeding 5% and a good intertester repeatability with a CV not exceeding 8%. The CTR technique show a high correlation between vertebral flexion mobility and skin distraction. The validity of the CTR technique was evaluated in a radiological study. Six small metal markings were glued to the skin with 30 mm intervals according to the CTR technique. The markers were glued with the subject in an upright posture and the upper marking placed over the most prominent part of the spinous process of the C7. Lateral radiographs were used to obtain overlay measurements of the alteration of the vertebral angles and of skin markers. The CTR is a valid technique. No other research has been made for validity and reliability. Previous studies with CTR have examined the relationship between segmental mobility C7-T5 and neck- shoulder pain. A significant correlation was found between decreased mobility in motion segment C7-T1 and T1-T2 and increased risk for neck- shoulder pain. Norlander and Nordgren have also shown that several clinical symptoms show relationship to segmental mobility examined with CTR. A significant correlation was found between decreased mobility in C7-T2 and experience of hand weakness and headache.

Written and produced by the band, the song was initially issued as a buzz single on 19 February 2016, in anticipation of the album's release. Subsequently, Atlantic Records sent it to alternative radio in the United States on 15 November 2016, as the fourth and final single off the album. Musically, \\"The Heart of Me\\" is a synth-laden chillwave song with indie rock elements and emotional lyrics. It features background vocals by English singer Charli XCX. \\"The Heart of Me\\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, some of whom complimented its upbeat production. The single became Miike Snow's first to lack an accompanying music video. The song is included on the soundtrack for the racing video game Forza Horizon 3 (2016). In March 2017, a deep house remix of the track by Dutch DJ duo The Him was released digitally. Background Charli XCX provided background vocals on the song. \\"The Heart of Me\\" was written by Miike Snow's three members, Christian Karlsson, Pontus Winnberg and Andrew Wyatt, for the band's third studio album, iii (2016). Wyatt conceptualized the melody of the song's intro while walking over a bridge in Australia. The recording sessions for the album took place in different studios in California, New York, and Sweden, from 2014 to 2015. In an interview for the Los Angeles Times, Wyatt said he adapted his singing based on the needs of each song throughout the album. He had previously aimed to present a \\"consistent character\\" during concerts, which resulted in the band's second studio album Happy to You (2012) holding a \\"more uniform sound\\". For iii, Wyatt switched focus to his performance in the studio rather than on stage, which resulted in a \\"lighter, airier quality\\" to his voice on \\"The Heart of Me\\". He said he learned a lot about how he wanted to sing and \\"how the softer you sing the bigger it sounds\\". English singer Charli XCX, who contributed guest vocals on the album track \\"For U\\", provided background vocals on the song alongside Winnberg and Wyatt. The two previously worked with the singer on her album Sucker (2014), for which Wyatt sang background vocals on two tracks. \\"The Heart of Me\\" and other album tracks include sections of computerized vocals. Karlsson explained in an interview for Electronic Musician that \\"I never like any vocal when it just sounds like a normal vocal. Ever. Sometimes I feel like I spend 50 percent of my time on the treatment of the vocals and 50 percent of the time I spend on the rest of the song.\\" The live instruments in \\"The Heart of Me\\" were played by Winnberg, Wyatt, and Homer Steinweiss. The band handled its production, engineering with S. Vaughan Merrick, and mixing with Niklas Flyckt. Digital mastering was performed by Kevin Grainger. Composition and lyrics Musically, \\"The Heart of Me\\" is a chillwave song with indie rock elements. Its instrumentation is primarily provided by drums, a piano, and a synthesizer. The song begins with a manipulated vocal hook. Music critics likened the song to works by American bands MGMT, Passion Pit, and Spoon. Earmilk writer Steph Evans characterized it as \\"upbeat\\" and rock and roll-infused, while Neil Z. Young of AllMusic defined it as \\"peppered with fuzzy synths\\". According to James Grebey of Spin, the production displays a \\"cool aloofness\\" that is \\"betrayed, sublimely, by the more emotional vocals\\". Similarly, Dancing Astronaut writer Alex Hitchcock observed the contrast between the \\"high-spirited, synth-filled melody\\" and the \\"brooding, emotionally-charged vocals\\". In the bridge, he sings about \\"standing in a cathedral in Europe and feeling at one with the universe\\", as interpreted by Spectrum Culture writer Josh Goller. The writer noted the song's theme of love, sentimentalism, and relationship melodrama. musicOMH Ben Hogwood perceived the lyrics as commentary on fame and \\"the trappings of it\\"; the writer singled out the first verse's line \\"I can't stop this hurtful shit from happening\\" as alluding to fame having personal consequences. Release \\"The Heart of Me\\" premiered on 18 February 2016, on the radio show Advanced Placement on Sirius XM's station Alt Nation. The next day, it was released for digital download through Jackalope and Atlantic. It followed \\"I Feel the Weight\\" as the second buzz single to premiere in the weeks leading up the March release of iii. Atlantic later selected the song to serve as the album's fourth and final single; it was sent to alternative radio in the US on 15 November 2016. It was the second single overall from the album to be serviced to radio in the U.S., following \\"Genghis Khan\\". Two months prior to its radio impact, the song appeared in the racing video game Forza Horizon 3 (2016) on the in-game radio station Horizon Pulse. On 3 March 2017, a deep house remix of the song, produced by Dutch DJ duo The Him, was digitally released through Jackalope and Atlantic. Critical reception The Heart of Me received generally positive reactions from music critics. Hitchcock of Dancing Astronaut regarded the single a \\"testament to how much Miike Snow have evolved\\" since Happy to You. The writer deemed it a suitable for \\"the year's warmer days\\" and concluced that it \\"highlights the group's ability to purvey upbeat, intricate production with aplomb\\". While reviewing iii, The Line of Best Fit Grant Rindner noted that the song and \\"Genghis Khan\\" exhibit \\"earworm melodies and inescapable hooks\\". Rindner recognized the former's \\"powerful piano chords and crunchy drums\\", which they felt evoked \\"a stripped-down Passion Pit at their absolute peak\\". PopMatters critic Ryan Dieringer felt \\"The Heart of Me\\" recalled Spoon's album They Want My Soul (2014), writing that \\"Miike Snow do Eno-esque drums almost better than Eno\\". Eric Renner Brown, writing for Entertainment Weekly, deemed the song \\"vibrant\\", elaborating that it \\"sounds perfectly engineered for Spotify's running feature or the sprawling pastures of a music festival\\". While reviewing the album, Dylan Stewart of The Music named \\"The Heart of Me\\" as \\"proof\\" that the band has \\"lost little ground in delivering their latest record\\". Comparing it to previous singles \\"Genghis Khan\\" and \\"My Trigger\\", Sean Maunier of Metro Weekly opined that while the song is not as memorable as the former two, \\"it pulses with synths and some interesting swells\\". DIY critic David Beech felt \\"The Heart of Me\\", along with the two aforementioned singles, \\"possess a pop pomp that's been hinted at only slightly in the past\\". He concluded, \\"Though there's a definite confidence in their composition, they certainly feel less organic, more contrived than before.\\" In a negative review, Rachel Brodsky of Spin dismissed its \\"cheery falseness\\", stating that it \\"sounds ready to be slapped into a Target commercial, as if its only sincere yearning is for royalty checks\\". At the time of its initial release, both Ilana Kaplan of New York Observer and Anders Nunstedt of Expressen named \\"The Heart of Me\\" one of the best songs released that week. Swedish magazine Caf√© selected it as the 37th best song of 2016.

It took place in 1885, at the beginning of the German colonial empire and towards the end of the Spanish Empire. Background 1858 map of the Spanish East Indies Raising the German flag on Mioko Island in November 1884 Spain had regarded the Caroline Islands as part of the Spanish East Indies ever since the Age of Discovery, when the Treaty of Zaragoza had marked it out as part of the Spanish sphere of influence. Nevertheless, Spain did not exercise effective control over the Islands, and in 1875 Spain agreed with Germany not to extend the customs jurisdiction of the Philippines over the Islands, thereby assuring free trade for German businesses in the Pacific. The Anglo-German agreement of April 1884 recognised Kaiser-Wilhelmsland and the islands to its north as part of the German sphere of influence and in November 1884 the German flag was raised on Mioko Island in the future Bismarck Archipelago. These developments brought German interests more closely and assertively into contact with those of Spain. The Anglo-German agreement only defined the zones of influence of the two signatory powers and did not clarify any other limits on German power. On 23 January 1885 the Hamburg firm of Hernsheim & Co asked the German government to take the Caroline Islands under protection in order to secure its trading monopoly. The Colonial advisor in the Foreign Office, Friedrich Richard Krauel, endorsed this proposal and forwarded it to the Under-Secretary, Herbert von Bismarck. His father, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, believed that Spain was about to formally annexe the Caroline Islands in response to German expansion. In June 1885 the rumour spread that Spain would bring the Islands under effective occupation and had already named a governor. On 21 July 1885 Kaiser Wilhelm I approved the German occupation of the Carolines. Raising the flag Bismarck confirmed to the German Admiralty that the flag should be raised over the Carolines. On 31 July 1885 Lieutenant Commander Paul Hofmeier, in command of the gunboat Iltis off Shanghai, was ordered to carry out the raising of the flag on Yap and Palau and to secure treaties of protection with local chiefs to legitimise German occupation. On 4 August 1885, the German authorities informed the Spanish Government that they were extending the area of German protection to the Carolines. Spain's Foreign Minister Jos√© de Elduayen y Gorriti immediately rejected Germany's right to take this step. The Spanish government sent Berlin a note, affirming that the Carolines had belonged to Spain since 1543. A few days later, however, Spain guaranteed freedom of trade for Germans in the Carolines. A hostile press campaign began in Spain, which resulted in anti-German protests. There were demonstrations in Madrid, where a rally attracted over 30,000 people, and around 80 other places in the country. The Carolines Question allowed Spain's Republican opposition to embarrass King Alfonso XII, which meant that his government wanted the matter resolved quickly. Bismarck, surprised by the scale of the protests, announced on August 23, 1885 that Germany had no intention of negating established historic rights and proposed to take the matter to arbitration. However Spain produced no evidence of prior ownership and Bismarck was in no hurry to conclude matters before receiving a report from the German navy. On the evening of 2 August 1885 when the German gunboat Iltis steamed into the harbour at Yap, it found two Spanish warships, the San Quentin and the Manila at anchor. They had brought the future Spanish governor as well as priests and soldiers to the island, and construction of a Spanish government post had already begun. Nevertheless, Hofmeier had the German flag raised, which prompted the Spaniards to raise their own flag. It seemed that a fight would follow, but the Spanish withdrew and left the island. Commercial concerns When news of the German flag-raising reached Madrid at the beginning of September 1885, riots broke out around the German embassy. The German consulate in Valencia also found itself the target for angry attacks. With the threat that the situation could get out of control, the Spanish government urged Germany to find an early solution. Meanwhile, the gunboat Albatross under Corvette Captain Max Pl√ºddemann continued to raise the German flag and visited many of the Caroline Islands between 20 September and 18 October 1885. However, by now Bismarck feared that in the event of war with Spain, France would side with her against Germany. At the same time, the dispute was having a damaging effect on German-Spanish trade relations (the volume of trade had increased around tenfold since 1879). This was of greater importance than the possession of the Carolines' possession ever promised. Spain played upon German commercial concerns by promising an advantageous trade agreement for Germany in return for recognising Spanish sovereignty. Arbitration Caricature in the Kladderadatsch weekly magazine from 27 December 1885: ‚ÄûPope Leo XIII. as arbiter in the Carolines Question between Germany and Spain, felling a truly Solomonic verdict concerning the partition of the problem child, so that both sides call out in satisfaction: \\"So start cutting!\\" Bismarck continued to insist on independent arbitration, as the only alternative was to recognise that Spain was in the right. On September 29, 1885, Bismarck proposed Pope Leo XIII as arbitrator, as one whose authority Catholic Spain could scarcely deny. At the same time, Bismarck hoped to restore relations with the Holy See after the bitter divisions of the kulturkampf. The Pope pronounced his verdict on 22 October 1885; as expected, he determined that the islands were Spanish. He also directed the Spanish government to set up a functioning administration as soon as possible, and granted Germany freedom to trade and settle in the Carolines as well as a possible coal and naval station on Yap. This however Germany never claimed. The Pope's verdict took no account of the wishes of the islanders themselves. The existing trade agreement between Germany and Spain was renewed on December 7, 1885, and on 17 December a new German-Spanish Treaty, was signed in Rome, giving effect to the Pope's decision. This brought the Carolines Question to a close. Aftermath German possessions in the western Pacific after the Carolines Dispute (1888) and the German-Spanish treaty (1899) Transfer of the western Carolines and Palau from Spain to Germany, Yap, 3. November 1899 German reactions to this outcome ranged from anger at a second defeat after the Kulturkampf to praise for peaceful arbitration. Indeed, the anti-colonial German Free-minded Party even saw it as a sign of the early the end of German colonialism. In Spain, discontent reigned over the concessions made to Germany. This was expressed in a popular play in which the children named ‚ÄòHispania‚Äô and ‚ÄòGermania‚Äô argued over a doll named ‚ÄòCarolina‚Äô until their father came and declared that although the doll belonged to ‚ÄòHispania‚Äô, ‚ÄòGermania‚Äô was to play with her. The Carolines Question brought the Micronesian islands into the light of international interests. Away from the areas over which Spain successfully asserted its sovereignty, on October 15, 1885, the commander of the German gunboat Nautilus declared the still independent Marshall Islands to be a German protectorate. In also taking Nauru (1888), Germany had secured control of all the islands south and west of the Carolines. In 1887 Spain began to exercise effective control over the Carolines, meeting opposition from the inhabitants as it did so. Following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Spain sold the Carolines, Palau and the northern Marianas to Germany in the German‚ÄìSpanish Treaty (1899) for 16.6 million marks. The islands became part of the German colonies in the Pacific, until they were occupied by Japan in 1914 and, after the First World War were ruled by Japan under the South Seas Mandate.

Marion Marche Perkins (1908-1961) was an American sculptor who taught and exhibited at Chicago's South Side Community Art Center and exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago. Perkins is widely considered an important artist of the Chicago Renaissance.  Early life  Marion Perkins was born in Arkansas in 1908 where he lived with his grandparents. He relocated to Chicago at the age of 8. Perkins attended Wendell Phillips Elementary and High School, but did not graduate.  Personal life  Perkins and his wife, Eva Gillion, had three sons, Robert, Toussaint and Eugene.  Career  Perkins purchased a newspaper stand in 1936 and started carving from discarded materials during the work day. Peter Pollack of the Works Progress Administration's Illinois Art Project and Southside Community Art Center noticed Perkins' work after passing the newsstand and soon introduced him to Simon Gordon, a sculptor who assisted Perkins with his formal training. In 1938, Perkins received his first commission when hired by the Biltmore Hotel in South Haven, Michigan to create statues of Dutch children. Perkins sold the newsstand and began working for the United States Postal Service in 1940 around which time his sculptures were exhibited at Howard University and the International Negro Exhibition in Chicago. Perkins entered and won a number of art competitions over the course of his career. He was awarded a $2,400 Rosenwald Fellowship Award in 1948 and received three awards from the Art Institute of Chicago between 1947 and 1952.

Administratively it is part of the municipality of Achstetten.  Geography  Stetten is located 6 km north-east of Laupheim and 14 km south of Ulm on the district road 7522. To the north Stetten borders on Dellmensingen, part of the city of Erbach in Alb- Donau district, to the west and the south on Achstetten, and in the east on the municipality of H√ºttisheim, also part of Alb-Donau district. The village is partly situated on a high plateau and partly on the slopes of the valley of the river Rot. To the east Stetten is confined by the federal road Bundesstra√üe 30.  History  Stetten is first mentioned in a document dating from 1181 in which local nobility, Henricus de Stettin, is attested. In 1385, by which time the village had come into the possession of the lords of Freyberg, the existence of a castle is confirmed. Its location is presumed to have been south of the town hall near a stream running through the village. It soon fell into disrepair and disappeared completely. Eberhard von Freyberg sold Stetten to Ulm citizen Peter Wagner in 1385. Two years later Wagner sold the whole village on to Wiblingen Abbey. The Jus patronatus of the local church was also exercised by Wiblingen Abbey. In the last years of the Thirty Years' War most of the village of Stetten was burnt down by Swedish troops in December 1646. During the course of the German mediatisation and the dissolution of Wiblingen Abbey, the village became part of the Electorate of Bavaria in 1805, and following the establishing of the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806 it was incorporated into the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. On 1 January 1975 Stetten was incorporated into the municipality of Achstetten.  Coat of arms  The coat of arms of Stetten depicts a fish under a water wheel with four spokes and eight blades, Both are held in argent on an escutcheon in azure. The water wheel symbolises the formerly important cooperative watermill whereas the fish refers to fish farming, which by using ponds and by fishing in the river Rot also was an important trade in former times. The azure indicates the water both activities are connected with.  Attractions   Parish church Saint Stephen  A church in Stetten was first mentioned in 1275 dedicated to Saint Stephen. The core of the current building is Late Gothic represented by its still existing choir. A tower was erected in 1555. The church was partially burnt down in 1646 during the Thirty Years' War by Swedish troops. At the beginning of the 18th century the church was extended with a nave in Baroque style, work which seems to have included some interlacing stucco. In 1787 and 1788 the interior was overhauled in neoclassical style, and modernised during the 1880s. Still noticeable is the mannerist tomb of Augustin Wiedemann, abbot of Wiblingen Abbey from 1572, who had previously been priest at Stetten, as well as several carved statues depicting Saint Zacharias and Saint Elizabeth from around 1725, a processional cross and an effigy of the resurrected Christ from 1735. The statues of Saint Barbara and Saint Dorothea from 1490 originally belonged to the altar of Mary in Achstetten.

It was discovered by a team of astronomers led by Csaba Kiss during an analysis of archival Hubble Space Telescope images of Gonggong. The discovery team had suspected that the slow rotation of Gonggong was caused by tidal forces exerted by an orbiting satellite. Xiangliu was first identified in archival Hubble images taken with Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 on 18 September 2010. Its discovery was reported and announced by G√°bor Marton, Csaba Kiss, and Thomas M√ºller at the 48th Meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences on 17 October 2016. The satellite is named after Xiangliu, a nine-headed poisonous snake monster in Chinese mythology that attended the water god Gonggong as his chief minister.  Observations  Gonggong and its moon Xiangliu, imaged in 2009 and 2010 with Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 Following the March 2016 discovery that Gonggong was an unusually slow rotator, the possibility was raised that a satellite may have slowed it down via tidal forces. The indications of a possible satellite orbiting Gonggong led Csaba Kiss and his team to analyze archival Hubble observations of Gonggong. Their analysis of Hubble images taken on 18 September 2010 revealed a faint satellite orbiting Gonggong at a distance of at least . The discovery was announced on 17 October 2016, though the satellite was not given a proper provisional designation. The discovery team later also identified the satellite in earlier archival Hubble images taken on 9 November 2009. From follow-up Hubble observations in 2017, the absolute magnitude of the satellite is estimated to be at least 4.59 magnitudes dimmer than Gonggong, or given Gonggong's estimated absolute magnitude of 2.34.  Orbit  Based on Hubble images of Gonggong and Xiangliu taken in 2009 and 2010, the discovery team constrained Xiangliu's orbital period to between 20 and 100 days. They better determined the orbit with additional Hubble observations in 2017. Xiangliu is believed to be tidally locked to Gonggong. Because the observations of Xiangliu only span a small fraction of Gonggong's orbit around the Sun, it is not yet possible to determine whether Xiangliu's orbit is prograde or retrograde. Based on a prograde orbit model, Xiangliu orbits Gonggong at a distance of around and completes one orbit in 25.22 days. Using the same prograde orbit model, the discovery team has estimated that its orbit is inclined to the ecliptic by about 83 degrees, implying that Gonggong is being viewed at a nearly pole-on configuration under the assumption that Xiangliu's orbit has a low inclination to Gonggong's equator. The orbit of Xiangliu is highly eccentric. The value of 0.29 is thought to have been caused by either an intrinsically eccentric orbit or by slow tidal evolution, in which the time for its orbit to circularize is comparable to the age of the Solar System. It may have also resulted from the Kozai mechanism, driven by perturbations either from the Sun's tidal forces, or from higher order terms in the gravitational potential of Gonggong due to its oblate shape. The orbital dynamics are thought to be similar to that of Quaoar's satellite Weywot, which has a moderate eccentricity of about 0.14.  Physical characteristics  The minimum possible diameter of Xiangliu, corresponding to an albedo of 1, is 36 km. In order for Xiangliu's orbit to remain eccentric over a timescale comparable to the age of the Solar System, it must be less than in diameter, corresponding to an albedo greater than 0.2. Upon its discovery, the diameter of Xiangliu was initially estimated at , under the assumption that the albedos of Xiangliu and Gonggong were equal. Photometric measurements in 2017 showed that Xiangliu is far less red than Gonggong. The color difference of V‚ÄìI= between Gonggong (V‚ÄìI=) and Xiangliu (V‚ÄìI=) is the largest among all known binary trans-Neptunian objects. This large color difference is atypical for trans-Neptunian binary systems: the components of most trans-Neptunian binaries display little color variation. Name The satellite's name is derived from Xiangliu, the nine-headed poisonous snake monster and minister of the water god Gonggong in Chinese mythology. Xiangliu is known for causing flooding and destruction. When the discoverers of Gonggong proposed choices for a public vote on its name, they chose figures that had associates that could provide a name for the satellite. Xiangliu's name was chosen by its discovery team led by Csaba Kiss, who had the privilege of naming the satellite. The names of Gonggong and Xiangliu were approved by the International Astronomical Union's Committee on Small Body Nomenclature and were simultaneously announced by the Minor Planet Center on 5 February 2020.

She was renamed MV Glenbrook for service across the River Lee in County Cork. History MV Lochalsh was built to replace several smaller ferries on the Skye crossing. The crossing was an urgent problem when STG took over control from 1 January 1969. Side-loading had been slow and the vessels could not keep up with increasing demand. In August 1969, Patrick Thomas announced a number of innovations, including the ordering of two 28-car ferries for Skye. While they were being built at a Newport yard, Ross & Cromarty County Council and Inverness County Council proceeded with new terminals for end-loading operation. There were delays with the ships and with the slip at Kyle. Lochalsh was floated out of the building dock on 11 February 1971 and towed directly to Kyle for completion and trials. She entered service on 31 March alongside . On 23 December 1988, Lochalsh was hit by a freak wave, leaving her seaward ramp trailing in the water and the vessel impossible to steer in the 60-knot westerly wind. With sixty passengers on board, she was blown eastwards and far into Loch Alsh. Two Naval tenders, from the BUTEC base pursued her and managed to get a line on board off Balmacara. She was assisted back to Kyle, finally tying up at the Railway pier at 10:10 pm. The following day, the ferry sailed to Kyleakin to offload her vehicles. The damaged ramp was lifted and welded shut to allow her to give single-ramped assistance over the festive season. Service was provided by the relief vessel, until returned from overhaul. Lochalsh sailed to Stornoway for refit on 6 January 1989. Several modification were made following this incident. Although not required for a short crossing, lifejackets were provided. The ramps were prevented from falling below a fixed point. Layout Lochalsh was very similar to Kyleakin which had been the first group ferry to be built outside Scotland, the first with drive-through capability and the first to be equipped with Voith-Schneider propulsion. She was built with large hydraulic ramps at both ends of a vehicle deck, strengthened to carry vehicles up to 32 tons. A narrow lounge along one side, with an deck open above provided passengers accommodation. While Kyleakin had only one plain gantry mast on her wheelhouse, Lochalsh had an elaborate tetrapod mast at each end. These were removed during her service in Ireland. Her Gardner diesel engines were coupled to two Voith-Schneider propulsion- units at diametrically opposed corners of her hull, making her extremely manoeuvrable. Service Lochalsh and her sister replaced a fleet of small vessels at Skye in 1970/71. Traffic continued to increase. New ferries were ordered in February 1990 from Ferguson Shipbuilders at Port Glasgow. From 28 April 1991, CalMac instituted a year-round 24-hour service. Lochalsh was displaced by arrival of the new on 13 May 1991 but saw further service between 16 and 27 May while the new vessel settled in. She was handed over to new owners on 17 June 1991 and left Kyleakin on the 19th. Her new owners, United Marine Transport, County Cork renamed her Glenbrook for service on the Carrigaloe‚ÄìGlenbrook service, soon to be joined by her sister (renamed Carrigaloe).

The estate has been owned by the Dinesen family since 1801. The main building is now operated as a hotel. It was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. History Early history Peder Skram Kragerupgaard was originally a manor in the village of Kragerup. It is first mentioned in 1327 and 1341, when it was owned by Matheaus Jakobsen Taa. A later owner was Jens Nielsen Neb, and the ownership was then passed on to his children Henrik Jensen Neb and Christine Neb and her husband Hartvig Bryske. Over the next 150 years Kragerup was generally owned by multiple simultaneous owners. Oluf Mortensen Gyrsting obtained almost full ownership of the estate towards the end of the 15th century. After Gyrsting's death, Kragerup was passed on to his son-in-law, Peder Skram. In 1533, he sold Kragerup to his new father-in-law, Ove Lunge. Friis family Christen Friis After Lunge's death, Kragerup was passed on to his grandson, whose widow brought it into her second marriage with J√∏rgen Friis of Knastrup. Friis' son from a previous marriage, Christen Friis (1581‚Äì1639), inherited Kragerup in 1610. He served in the Kalmar War in 1611-1613 and was appointed Chancellor in 1616. He constructed a new, three- winged main building in 1627 and also extended the estate through the acquisition of more tenant farms in the surrounding villages. Juul family Ove Juul Friis' son, Hans Friis, sold Kragerup in 1656 to Frederik Urne. He was succeeded by his son-in-law, Ove Juul, who was later appointed Vice Chancellor. Kragerup was later passed on to his son, Christian Juul, who one year later ceded it to his sister, Mette Marie, who married the bailiff on the estate, Povl Pedersen Lerskov, but he died in 1692. Mette Marie Juul continued to live on the estate after his death. Lerche, Fogh and Bech In 1705, Kragerup was acquired by Jacob Lerche. He extended the estate with more tenant farms. In 1721, he sold it to Andreas Fogh. He carried out many improvements on the estate and increased prosperity. He is credited for being the first potato grower on Zealand and also established a wool factory. His daughter, Christine Fogh, sold the estate to Peder Bech around 1797. Dinesen family Jens Kraft Dinesen In 1801, Kragerup was acquired by Jens Kraft Dinesen, who had sold Gyldenholm to Christopher Sch√∏ller B√ºlow the previous year. He constructed a new main wing in 1802. Dinesen was succeeded by his son Anders Didrich Dinesen. He was married to Sophie Jacobine de Neergaard, a daughter of Johan Michael de Neergaard. She managed the estate with great skill after his death but died at the age of 47 in 1857. Their son Jens Kraft Jacob Sophus Dinesen then inherited the estate. He married his younger brother's widow, Alvilde Dinesen, in 1880. Her son by her first husband, also called Jens Kraft Dinesen, inherited Kragerup in 1910. After his death in 1916 Kragerup was passed on to his son Wilhelm Dinesen. Architecture The main building is a three-winged, two-storey complex with white-washed walls and a half-hipped red tile roof. The main wing to the west stands on a rise slightly above the two side wings. It is 15 bays wide and has a central risalit topped by a rounded pediment.

This influenced the tracks to be of different moods and styles, with a classical introductory track, two upbeat songs and a calmer closing track.

Music Billboard characterized the opening track as Mon√©t X Change's \\"baritone, classically-trained opera chops singing 'Ave Maria' underneath a spoken word that speaks to her inner struggle with religion\\".

Characteristics  The vast majority of Vinohrady is made up of about 50 coloured panel houses (Czech: panel√°ky), which are visible from many parts of Brno. It is surrounded by Brno-L√≠≈°e≈à to the east and southeast, Brno-≈Ωidenice to the southwest, Brno-Malomƒõ≈ôice and Ob≈ôany to the northwest, and the village of Kanice to the north.  History  Based on archeological research, humans have been present in the area since around 500,000 years ago, during the Old Palaeolithic Period. The area was long without any development, and the southern slopes were used to grow vineyards. The current-day territory of Vinohrady was made part of the city of Brno on 16 April 1919. In 1943, Germans established a branch of the factory Flugmotorenwerke Ostmark (predecessor of current-day Zetor). There was a colony of 20 wooden houses on the hill, which inhabitants of Brno began to call Hamburg because the bulk of its inhabitants came from Hamburg. The colony was hit during the Allied bombing at the end of the Second World War. After the liberation of Brno and the subsequent expulsion of Germans, the colony was left deserted for a couple of years before being reoccupied by survivors of the war, including those who had been in Nazi prisons and concentration camps. The demise of Hamburg occurred in the 1980s in connection with the construction of the present-day housing estate. Residents protested the construction unsuccessfully and the estate was completed in 1989.

He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford in. May 1700, aged 15. He was admitted at Middle Temple in 1702 and called to the bar in 1708. He succeeded his father who died in 1727. Cocks‚Äô uncle Somers had obtained a major electoral influence at Reigate after he received a grant of the manor of Reigate. Cocks was returned as Member of Parliament for Reigate at a by-election on 29 November 1707 and was returned unopposed at the 1708 British general election . He supported the naturalization of the Palatines and in 1710 he was listed as voting for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell. As a result lost his seat at the 1710 British general election in the Tory backlash. He was returned again for Reigate in 1713 British general election and continued to support the Whigs, voting against the expulsion of Richard Steele on 18 March 1714. Cocks was returned unopposed for Reigate at the 1715 British general election and voted with the Government from 1715 to 1719, when he opposed the Peerage Bill. In 1716 after the death of Somers the Reigate property fell to the Jekyll family to which Cocks was also connected. He was returned in a contest at the 1722 British general election and was unopposed in 1727 and 1734. He acted with the Opposition during Walpole‚Äôs Administration, and made his only reported speech in 1741 in a debate on the quartering of soldiers on the civil population. He was returned unopposed at the 1741 British general election but his name does not appear in any recorded division after the fall of Walpole in 1742. In 1745 he inherited Reigate and its electoral interest and Brookmans, Hertfordshire on the death of his aunt, Lady Jekyll.

She was known for being a stowaway aboard the United States Navy ship and plying her trade while on board the battleship. She is sometimes conflated with Madeleine Blair (note spelling), who was born in St. Louis and later became a brothel madam and activist in Chicago and Canada, and whose autobiography was published in 1919. USS Arizona In March 1924, Arizona, part of the United States Fourth Fleet, was anchored in the North River off Manhattan. Some of the ship's sailors on shore leave met a 19 year old prostitute named Madeline Blair. She was a brunette with dark eyes and went under the nickname \\"Blackie\\". She told them she wanted to go to Hollywood to become a star, but did not have enough money for the fare. Arizona was due to sail to California, and the sailors agreed to smuggle Blair onto the ship to get her there. She cut her hair short and the sailors provided her with a uniform cap and coat. In amongst a group of sailors and feigning drunkenness, she was smuggled aboard the ship. The sailors hid her in an unused generator compartment, and the cooks agreed to provide her with meals for $10 per day (a sailor's pay at the time was about $21 a month) She plied her trade at $3 a time. As the ship sailed south and temperatures increased, Blair started to go up on deck when it was dark, usually wearing jeans and a work shirt. One evening whilst watching a movie from a searchlight platform, a sailor who did not know her and did not have a light for his cigarette, reached into her breast pocket (all sailors kept their matches there), and discovered her breast. Although shocked he did not raise the alarm. One sailor informed the ship's officers, but this was dismissed as absurd. Discovery After passing through the Panama Canal, on 12 April, the ship was lying off Balboa, Panama, preparing to sail for California. At the break of dawn Blair was still on deck. She stopped at a scuttlebutt to have a drink, and was noticed by the Chief radio operator and recognised her as a woman reported her to the deck officer. A search was mounted and Blair was apprehended. She refused to name the sailors who had smuggled her onto the ship. In an attempt to delay things until the ship sailed for California, she claimed there were other women aboard. A search of the ship found nothing and she was put ashore in Balboa The authorities in Balboa were unsure of what to do with her. She returned to New York on the Panama Railroad Company ship .Girl Stowaway Home in Jersey, The Los Angeles Daily Times, May 6, 1924, page 30, accessed via Newspapers.com and had the US Navy billed for the fare. Repercussions The repercussion on the ship were severe. Captain Olmstead instigated courts-martial for 23 enlisted men, sentences of up to 10 years imprisonment were imposed. Admiral Henry A. Wiley issued a letter of reprimand to all officers of the ship, including future Admiral and Chief of Naval Operations Arleigh Burke, then an ensign. Fortunately for his career and the careers of the other officers, Admiral William V. Pratt thought the penalties excessive, and when he became Chief of Naval Operations in 1930, he ordered the reprimands stricken from the officer's records. He could not reverse the results of the courts-martial of the enlisted men.

The Spanish language is used in diverse areas of science and technology. However, despite its large number of speakers, the Spanish language does not feature prominently in scientific writing, with the exception of the humanities. One estimate puts the percentage of Spanish language publications in natural sciences and technology as 0.5% of the world's total, a low number in the view that Spanish is often considered to rank second or third among languages in various metrics and estimates. In humanities a similar estimate yields 2.81%. Summarizing the situation of Spanish language in science researcher √Ålvaro Cabezas writes: \\"No serious scientist publishes his best works in a language other than English\\". The creation of new terminology in Spanish is due more to the translation of concepts from other languages than to the crafting of original ideas. Bibliometric studies Among Spanish-language articles indexed in Scopus from 1996 to 2011 10.8% qualify as \\"Life Sciences\\", 13.2% as \\"Physical Sciences\\", 44.4% as \\"Health Sciences\\", 29.6% as \\"Social Sciences, Arts & Humanities\\" and 2.0% as \\"Multi-disciplinary & Undefined\\". Thus a higher percentage of the Spanish language content is published in \\"Health Sciences\\" and \\"Social Sciences, Arts & Humanities\\" than what it is for English, Chinese or Russian. Spanish shares this trait with Portuguese, Italian, Dutch and French. A bibliometric study of publications on the subject of \\"digital communication\\" indexed in Scopus and Web of Science found that in both databases Spanish-language articles make up about 6.5% of the content. Notably, in these databases various authors with articles published in Spanish were based in non-Spanish speaking countries. A 2014 Google Scholar search on the words \\"biodiversity\\" and \\"conservation\\" yielded Spanish as the second language with most entries far behind English and just ahead of Portuguese. Causes for the limited use of Spanish The Spanish language is one of many major languages with limited use in science and technology. The main cause of this is the proliferation of English in scientific writing, which has been ongoing since English displaced French and German as the language of science in the first half of the 20th century. Another cause of the scant publication of articles in Spanish in scientific journals is the fact that scientists from Spain tend to form, at least from the 2000s, more partnerships with researchers from elsewhere in Europe or United States than from other Spanish- speaking countries. As is the case with other languages, including the historically important German, writing in Spanish limits access to influential foreign journals. Spanish language journals and articles are systematically underrepresented in the ISI database and obtaining also unfavourable starting conditions when being evaluated by impact factor, a widely used metric for evaluating scientific journals. The scientific policy of Spain has since the 1980s focused on promoting the international diffusion of research from Spain not taking into consideration which language is used. Deficient Language Modernization The Spanish language has not kept pace with the development of language in various fields of knowledge. Writing in 2007, Daniel Prado noted that Google searches on Spanish terms do often not yield quality results, hampering the work of translators and editors. Scholar Enrique Alarc√≥n explains the case of engineering where he posits three causes for the poor quality Spanish used in the subject; words exist but are unknown, confusion between similar but not identical concepts, and lack of precision when using terminology. The poor state of the Spanish language used in engineering may stem from the mishmash of engineering traditions and impossibility for individuals of having a classical education in multiple branches of engineering. Alternatively, the poor state of the language in engineering may derive from the lack of a previous tradition in certain subjects. By 2007, the Icelandic, Dutch, Danish and Swedish languages had ten to twenty times more financial resources invested in language care and improvement than Spanish, despite the small size of the communities and the economies of their respective countries. Proposed reasons to promote Spanish Scholar Rainer Enrique Hamel points at three arguments to promote the use of Spanish in science: #Language diversity in science is good for reasons akin to why ecological diversity is good. #Excessive use of English reinforces undesirable asymmetric relations in science. #Scholars from Anglo- Saxon countries are adopting bad practices like not reading research in languages other than English, reinforcing an unjustified privileged situation. \\"Practitioners and policy makers\\" may not benefit from the adding up of new scientific information if it is not in a language they understand. An example of this are protected area directors in Spain who self-report to have language barrier difficulties with publications relevant to carry out their work.

Rates of HIV in South Africa are high. PTSD in a pregnant woman may lead to complications during pregnancy and childbirth. Childhood trauma may also increase the risk of PTSD. This trauma may be physical, sexual, or emotional in nature. Rates of crime and violence are high in many poor areas of South African cities. Exposure to violence and drug abuse leads to increased PTSD among South African men, and this in turn leads to increased rates of violent crime among young South African men due to increased aggression. PTSD may also further exacerbate drug abuse due to attempts to self-medicate.  Treatment  Treatment methods include cognitive therapy. Alternatively, a multi-modal integrated system of treatment can be employed.New treatment systems may involve using a grading system which allows the person to receive a letter ranging from A-E which determines the severity of that specific persons treatment.

By December that year, there had been enough problems to warrant the appointment of a geweldiger to ensure order and the security of the Fort de Goede Hoop. Michiel Gleve was the first geweldiger.Resolution of the Council of Policy (5 December 1652). From 1653, the geweldiger reported to the Fiscal, who was the outpost's chief law officer. The outpost began to develop into a colony in 1657. As the population grew, the geweldiger's duties increased, and by the mid-1680s he was assisted by a gang of convict slaves,Resolution of the Council of Policy (14 May 1686). An additional geweldiger was later appointed, and a third in 1776.Resolution of the Council of Policy (2 January 1776). In August 1780, after complaints about the geweldiger's convict slaves being sent to arrest Whites, the Van Plettenberg administration assigned a few White law enforcement officials, called geregtsdienaars to the Fiscal's staff.Resolution of the Council of Policy (22 August 1780). From 1790, the Fiscal's men were headed by an onder-schout (later called 'under-sheriff'). Jan Hendrik Matthysen was the first appointee.Resolution of the Council of Policy (13 March 1790). Night watch (1686-1840) From July 1686, the burgher councillors (who were responsible for looking after the town) employed watchmen to patrol the streets at night, when the fiscal's men were off duty.Resolutions of the Council of Policy (3 July 1686 and 11 September 1686). This system was followed until 1840. As the men were equipped with wooden rattles, to raise the alarm when necessary, they were known as the ratelwagt (rattle watch). Regulations issued in 1714 defined their duties as watching out for fire, public mischief, housebreaking, theft or other offences, uproars in taverns, and unlocked doors and windows.Resolution of the Council of Policy (9 January 1714). Under British rule, the ratelwagt became known as the 'night watch'. Control of the watch passed to the new Burgher Senate in 1796. From 1817, the watchmen were divided into two groups, headed by commandants. Burgher watch (1699-1795) The ratelwagt were not the only ones patrolling the streets at night. From 1699, the burgher militia (citizen force) also patrolled the town. In this context, they were known as the 'burgher watch'. The militia was controlled by the krygsraad (council of war), presided over by the commander of the garrison. The burgher watch system ended when the militia was disbanded in 1795. Landdrost's \\"officers of justice\\" (1809-28) In March 1809, the Caledon administration appointed a landdrost to administer the district. This gave the district the status of a drostdy. The landdrost's responsibilities included law and order, and he had a few police riders to patrol the district, guard prisoners, keep the peace, enforce the liquor laws and prevent smuggling.Theal, G.M. (1900). Records of the Cape Colony Vol VI p 469. From 1812, the landdrost was assisted by an under- sheriff, who supervised the law enforcement officers. 1825-1882 Police Office (1825-40) In November 1825, the Somerset administration established a Police Office to oversee both the under-sheriff and his men, and the night watch. Its duties included suppressing riots and breaches of the peace, removing public nuisances, maintaining peace and decorum in public places, maintaining Table Bay port regulations, protecting property, supervising foreigners, locking up vagrants, maintaining order in markets and taverns and retail shops, and registering births and deaths and various licences.Ordinances 11 and 12 of 1825 (Cape). A police court, presided over by a commissioner (later called 'Judge of Police'), was established in May 1826 to try police cases in Cape Town. From January 1828, the court also had jurisdiction in the Cape Drostdy. The Police Office was headed by a Superintendent of Police, a post held by Baron Charles de Lorentz from 1826 to 1860. From 1834, he also presided over the police court, his title being changed to 'Judge and Superintendent of Police'. Resident magistrates' police (1828-48) Under the new system of courts introduced in January 1828, the landdrosts' judicial duties were transferred to resident magistrates. The Cape drostdy was divided into two magisterial districts : Cape (i.e. Cape Town) and Simon's Town. The magistrates took over the landdrost's police riders. The southern part of the Cape district, including Simon's Town, was formed into the Wynberg magisterial district in March 1839. Simon's Town and its environs were proclaimed a separate district again in March 1848. Town Police (1840-82) In May 1840, the Napier administration replaced the Police Office with the Town Police, a professional police force, modeled on the London Metropolitan Police. Its functions were defined as preserving the peace, preventing crime, apprehending offenders, and enforcing the Lord's Day Observance Ordinance and the liquor licensing laws. The force was confined to the Cape Town municipal area, but could pursue fleeing offenders anywhere within the Cape district.Ordinance 2 of 1840 (Cape). The Town Police were headed by an Inspector of Police, who reported to the Judge & Superintendent. John King, recruited from the London 'Met', was the first inspector. Headquarters were at 35 Burg Street, Cape Town. The Town Police were severely tested during the 1849‚Äì50 anti-convict agitation, which saw many incidents of public violence and unrest.Hattersley, A.F. (1960). The First South African Detectives. The police court was closed in 1860. After that, police cases were heard in the magistrate's court, and the Inspector of Police was under the authority of the magistrate instead of a superintendent.Abolition of Office of Judge & Superintendent of Police Act 1860. 'Rural' police forces (1848-82) From 1848, each magisterial district in the colony had a small uniformed police force, headed by a chief constable who reported to the magistrate.Ordinance 24 of 1847 (Cape). These forces were known collectively as the \\"rural police\\". Simon's Town established its police force, under John Kinsley, in March 1848. Wynberg followed, with the appointment of Thomas Shannon as chief constable in April 1848. The Cape district police force was established under Thomas Pope in May 1848. His headquarters were at Papendorp (later Woodstock). Water Police (1860-82) The Grey administration formed the Water Police in September 1860, to prevent theft in ships and on the wharves, suppress mutinies, and protect property and maintain order in Table Bay harbour.Cape Town Water Police Act 1860 (Cape). William Scott was the first Boat Officer in charge of the Water Police. The post was upgraded to inspector in 1880. 1882-1913 Cape Police District No 1 (1882-88) The Scanlen ministry had the Police Regulation Act passed in 1882, to enable the government to establish police forces. The Act authorised it to declare \\"police districts\\" and establish police forces for them, to preserve the peace, prevent crime and apprehend offenders.Police Regulation Act 1882 (Cape). These forces were \\"chiefly intended for the detection and investigation of crime and the arrest of offenders.\\"Cape of Good Hope Government Gazette 6284 (25 August 1882) : Rules and Regulations for Police Forces. They were known collectively as the 'Cape Police'. The Cape Town, Wynberg and Simon's Town districts were proclaimed as District No 1 in August 1882, and Bernard V. Shaw, formerly of the London 'Met', was appointed commissioner. He had direct control over the Town Police (which he renamed 'City Police') and the Water Police (which he renamed 'Dock & Harbour Police'). By arrangement with the Wynberg and Simon's Town magistrates, he had operational control over their police too, but they remained under the magistrates' ultimate authority. The Wynberg district police were later renamed 'Suburban Police'. By 1883, the City Police had at least one detective.Police Regulation Act 1883. Police stations were opened in Sir Lowry Road (Cape Town), Claremont and Sea Point.Reports of the Commissioners of Police for the Year 1886. From 1884, headquarters, the police stations and the Dock & Harbour Police were connected by telephone.Reports of the Commissioners of Police of the Several Police Districts of the Colony (1884) Cape Police District No 1 was closed in 1888. The commissioner's authority was transferred to the assistant magistrate of Cape Town, who was given the title 'Chief of Police'. City, Suburban and Simon's Town Police (1888-1901) City Police headquarters moved from Burg Street to Wale Street, Cape Town in 1890. Several more police stations were opened in Cape Town and neighbouring villages during the 1890s, namely Constantia, Hout Bay, Maitland,Report of the Assistant Resident Magistrate in Charge of the Cape Town, Suburban, Simon's Town and Durbanville Police Forces (1894) Durbanville, Kloof Street (Cape Town), Durban Road (later 'Bellville') (1895),Report of the Chief of the Cape Town, Suburban, Simon's Town and Durbanville Police Forces (1895) Observatory, Philadelphia, Philippi,Report of the Chief of the Cape Town, Suburban, Simon's Town and Durbanville Police Forces (1897) Kalk Bay and Muizenberg.Report of the Chief of the Cape Town, Suburban, Simon's Town and Durbanville Police Forces (1898). A detective department, headed by a detective sub-inspector, was established in 1894. Cape Police District No 3 (1901-04) The City Police, Dock & Harbour Police, Suburban Police and Simon's Town Police were combined as Cape Police District No 3 in November 1901.The Bandolier (Dec 1901). Lt Col Macleod Robinson was commissioner. District No 3 was divided into A Division (Cape Town, except the docks), Green & Sea Point and Camps Bay); B Division (Docks); and C Division (the rest of the Cape district, Wynberg and Simon's Town districts). This organisation was later changed to HQ Division (Cape Town and Camps Bay); A Division (Docks and Green & Sea Point); B Division (Woodstock and Maitland); and C Division (rest of Cape district, Wynberg and Simon's Town districts). A Morals Squad was established in 1902 to deal with prostitution.Van Onselen, C. (2007). The Fox and the Flies. Two more police stations were opened in Cape Town : one in Hanover Street (District Six (1902) and one in Riebeeck Street (1903). Cape Peninsula Urban Police District (1904-13) In April 1904. the government amalgamated the mounted divisions of the Cape Police districts into a single Cape Mounted Police. It combined the Cape Peninsula and other urban police forces into the 'Urban Police District'.Cape of Good Hope Government Gazette 8638 (8 April 1904) : Government Notice 365. District Inspector Robert Crawford was appointed commissioner.Cape of Good Hope Government Gazette 8642 (22 April 1904) : Government Notice 408. As this fragmented district proved unsatisfactory, most of the towns concerned were transferred to the CMP, and Cape Town and Kimberley each became an UPD in its own right.Report of the Commissioner of Urban Police (1904).

The major political and military event during George I's reign, a war against the Byzantine Empire, had its roots back in the 990s, when the Georgian prince David III of Tao, following his abortive rebellion against Emperor Basil II, had to agree to cede his extensive possessions in Tao to the emperor on his death. All the efforts by David's stepson and George's father, Bagrat III, to prevent these territories from being annexed to the empire went in vain. Young and ambitious, George launched a campaign to restore the David III‚Äô succession to Georgia and occupied Tao in 1015‚Äì1016. Basil II led his army against Georgia in 1021. An exhausting war lasted for two years, and ended in a decisive Byzantine victory, forcing George to agree to a peace treaty, with the following terms: * Georgia had to abandon its claims over Tao; * Georgia had to surrender several southwestern possessions (Klarjeti, Kola and Javakheti) to the Byzantine Empire; * George I had to give his three-year-old son, Bagrat IV, as a hostage to Constantinople.

Throughout the postwar period until the early 1990s, the situation of the communities of the Russian Orthodox Church in Western Europe was difficult: Augustine Roberts, one of the priests, wrote to Patriarch Alexius I in 1956: \\"in most Western European countries, belonging to the jurisdiction of Moscow is a difficult matter. We seem politically suspicious to our Orthodox and non-Orthodox brothers, and many people who are interested in Orthodoxy as such do not want to have anything to do with the \\"Soviet\\" Church, that is, the \\"bolshevik\\" one. Our pastoral and missionary work suffers from the fact that we belong to this jurisdiction. The isolation of the Russian Church in the West is catastrophic for the whole future of Orthodoxy in the West\\". In 1960, the Diocese of Chersonesus was established with its center in Paris; in 1962, the Diocese of Sourozh was established with its center in London. The Diocese of The Hague was established in 1972. The Council of bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church on January 30 ‚Äî 31, 1990, among others overseas Exarchates of the Russian Orthodox Church, abolished the Western European Exarchate. Its dioceses were directly subjected to the Moscow Patriarch and the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church.  Background  On 27 November 2018 the synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate decided to dissolve the Archdiocese of Russian Orthodox churches in Western Europe (AROCWE) \\"thereby entrusting its faithful to the Hierarchs of the Ecumenical Throne in Europe\\". This decision was made without any official requests from the hierarchs of the AROCWE and caused confusion. On 15 December Pastoral Assembly of AROCWE decided to call an extraordinary General Assembly, scheduled for 23 February 2019. This General Assembly will discuss the decision of the Ecumenical Patriarchate to dissolve the AROCWE. ROC officials responded with a reminder of the 2003 proposal of Alexy II to the AROCWE to move to the Moscow Patriarchate. On 29 November, after the synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate had ended, the same communiqu√© which had been released one day prior concerning the Ecumenical Patriarchate's decision to dissolve the AROCWE was released, in French, on the official website of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The Ecumenical Patriarchate \\"never explicitly justified\\" its decision to dissolve the AROCWE. On 30 November, the council of the AROCWE declared in a communiqu√© that this decision of the Ecumenical Patriarchate was \\"unforeseen\\". The communiqu√© added that since the AROCWE had not requested this decision, two things should be done before the AROCWE would comply to this decision: the primate of the AROCWE Archbishop , as the head of the AROCWE, will have to \\"invite the priests of the Archdiocese to a pastoral assembly, on December 15, 2018, to discuss with those who carry with him the spiritual responsibility of the parishes and faithful of the Archdiocese\\" and the AROCWE council will have to \\"convene a general assembly of the Archdiocese, in which all the clergy and lay delegates elected by the parishes and communities, which are the adherent associations of the Diocesan Union, will take part.\\" The communiqu√© concluded that since John of Charioupolis had not requested this decision, he still remained fully in pastoral charge of the Russian Orthodox Churches in Western Europe.  Creation of the PEWE  On 28 December 2018, in response to the Ecumenical Patriarchate's actions in Ukraine, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church decided to create \\"a Patriarchal Exarchate in Western Europe with the center in Paris\\" whose \\"pastoral sphere of responsibility includes\\" Andorra, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Principality of Monaco, the Netherlands, Portugal, France, and Switzerland. During the same synod, the decision was also taken to create \\"a diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church in Spain and Portugal with the center in Madrid\\" as well as \\"a Patriarchal Exarchate in South-East Asia [PESEA] with the center in Singapore.\\" On the same day, in an interview with Russia-24 channel, Metropolitan Hilarion, head of the Synodal Department for External Church Relations of the ROC, declared the ROC \\"will now act as if they [Constantinople] do not exist at all because our purpose is missionary, our task is to educate, we are creating these structures for ministerial care about our flock, there can be no such deterring factors here\\", and that the ROC will take charge of the Orthodox faithfuls of its diaspora instead of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Before that, the Diocese of Chersonesus was taking charge of the Orthodox communities of the Moscow Patriarchate in France, Switzerland, Portugal and Spain. The person chosen to be the primate primate of the PEWE as well as of the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Chersonesus was Bishop John (Roschchin) of Bogorodsk. Bishop John was granted the title of \\"of Chersonesus and Western Europe\\". Bishop John was granted the title of Metropolitan on 3 January 2019 by Patriarch Kirill at Moscow's Dormition Cathedral.  Metropolitan Anthony as ruling bishop  On 30 May 2019, the Holy Synod of the ROC decided to appoint archbishop Anthony (Sevryuk) of Vienna and Budapest as primate of the PEWE and of the diocese of Chersonesus. At the same time, John (Roshchin), who was until then the primate of the PEWE and of the diocese of Chersonesus, was appointed as primate of the ROC diocese of Vienna and Budapest to replace archbishop Anthony. On 31 May 2019, archbishop Anthony was consecrated metropolitan because of his appointment as exarch of the PEWE. The nomination of Anthony as primate of the PEWE on 30 May 2019 was, according to Novaya Gazeta, related to the fact that Anthony would be negotiating the integration of the AROCWE into the Moscow Patriarchate. On December 4, 2019, the first meeting of the Synod of the Patriarchal Exarchate of Western Europe took place in the building of the Korsun Diocesan Administration in Paris.

Founded in 1980 to provide outpatient mental health therapy and counseling, it expanded its offerings a few years later to include acclimation assistance including classes in English as a second language, job placement, and youth activities. The center provides interpreters and translation services in courts, hospitals, and businesses as well. Services are available in 35 different languages. History The Asian Pacific Development Center was founded in October 1980. Large numbers of Asian refugees had emigrated to Colorado following the Vietnam War, and a significant number were showing signs of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression. The center was formed by leaders of the city's Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, including \\"social workers, attorneys, psychologists and psychiatrists living in Denver\\", and services were provided by these professionals. In the 21st century, the center's clientele expanded as additional groups of refugees landed in Colorado, including immigrants from Korea (estimated at 25,000 in the Denver area in 2000) and Bhutan (estimated at 3,500 in 2008). The center initially offered mental health therapy and counseling on an outpatient basis. After Sumiko Hennessy, a Japanese-born professor of social work, became executive director in 1984, the center's services were expanded to help \\"overcome the Asian discomfort with mental health assistance\\". Classes in English as a second language, employment counseling, and youth activities were introduced at this time. Services The center offers services geared to youth, teens, and adults/seniors. After-school programs for youth include life skills workshops, tutoring, mentoring, and leadership training. Teens are assisted with placement in summer internships in corporate environments. The adults and seniors component reflects the center's initial founding as a mental health clinic, providing \\"psychological and psychiatric evaluation, medication therapy, individual and family therapy, day treatment, counseling for domestic abuse perpetrators, and alcohol-abuse education and therapy\\". Employment counseling and job placement are also provided. The center responds to community needs as they arise. In 1985, staff addressed the problem faced by mail-order brides in the Asian American community. Asian girls and women, primarily from the Philippines, had been photographed in suggestive poses and advertised in American men's magazines. The women, hoping to marry good husbands, were often abused by the men who chose them. The Asian Pacific Development Center sought to ameliorate the problem by opening support groups and counseling services for the maltreated wives, and furnished referrals to women's shelters. In 2017, the center sought to assist immigrant and refugee artists in Aurora to establish businesses, offering \\"free mentoring, marketing and portfolio workshops\\". In 2018, the center opened a small garden adjacent to its facility to service new immigrants who had been used to farming and a more active lifestyle in their native lands and now felt \\"depressed and isolated\\". In 2018, the center was awarded a $980,000 grant in conjunction with the Denver District Attorney's office to provide services to victims of human trafficking. Staff As of 1998, the center had a staff of 73 assisting approximately 2,500 clients in the Denver metropolitan area. Counselors communicate with clients in 21 languages, while interpreters expand that reach to 35 languages. The interpreters are also available to translate on behalf of clients in courts, hospitals, and businesses. Japanese-American professor Sumiko Hennessy served as executive director of the center from 1984 to 2000. Location After a series of moves, the center entered its current home at 1537 Alton St. in Aurora in 2013. Awards In 1998 the center received the Community Health Leadership Award from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; the $100,000 cash prize was used to fund relocation to a larger facility.

Early life Caroline Schermerhorn Astor was born in New York City on October 10, 1861, and was known as \\"Carrie\\". She was the fourth of five children born to William Backhouse Astor Jr. and Caroline Schermerhorn Astor, leader of the \\"Four Hundred\\". Her three elder sisters were Emily Astor, who married sportsman and politician James Van Alen; Helen Astor, who married diplomat James Roosevelt Roosevelt (the elder half-brother of future president Franklin D. Roosevelt); and Charlotte Astor, who married James Coleman Drayton and, after his death, George Ogilvy Haig. She had one younger brother, Colonel John Jacob Astor IV, who died aboard the RMS Titanic in 1912. Carrie was a descendant of many prominent Americans. Her paternal grandparents were William Backhouse Astor Sr. and Margaret (n√©e Armstrong) Astor while her maternal grandparents were Abraham Schermerhorn and Helen Van Courtlandt (n√©e White) Schermerhorn. She was also a great-granddaughter of John Jacob Astor, America's first millionaire, wealthy merchant Peter Schemerhorn, and Continental major and U.S. Senator John Armstrong Jr. and Alida (n√©e Livingston) Armstrong. Her uncle John Jacob Astor III was the father of William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor. Carrie grew up at her parents New York brownstone, 350 Fifth Avenue, at the southwest corner of Fifth Avenue and 34th Street, known for its ballroom. Society life 3 East 64th Street. In 1883, wealthy socialite Alva Vanderbilt, the then wife of railroad manager William Kissam Vanderbilt, planned an elaborate masquerade ball for 1,000 guests (reportedly costing $3 million) to celebrate the opening of her new home at 660 Fifth Avenue, known as the Petit Chateau. The ball was to feature entertainment given by young society figures, including a dance which young Carrie was to participate in. Unfortunately, at the last minute, Carrie was notified that she could not participate, because Carrie's mother, the Mrs. Astor and the undisputed head of New York society, had never formally \\"called upon\\" Alva. In order to appease Carrie and allow to her attend the ball, Mrs. Astor proceeded to leave her calling card at the Vanderbilt's resident prior to Alva's lavish ball. Alva then extended an invitation to the Astors and Carrie's mother attended the ball and reciprocally invited the Vanderbilts her annual ball, which was considered a formal acknowledgement of the Vanderbilt's full acceptance into the upper echelon of New York society.Vanderbilt, 104-6. After her 1884 marriage, Carrie became a noted society hostess in her own right. Despite her family's initial reluctance at the marriage, her father purchased them a new home at 414 Fifth Avenue (not far from her parents at 350 Fifth) as a wedding present, which was furnished Wilson's father. For many years, Carrie and her sister-in-law, Grace Vanderbilt, shared Box 3 at the Metropolitan Opera House, \\"alternating as hostess on opening night.\\" Move uptown After her mother's fallout with Carrie's cousin William Waldorf Astor over the use of the name \\"Mrs. Astor\\", which led to the construction of the opulent Waldorf Hotel next to her mother's residence, Mrs. Astor decamped from 34th Street and tore down Carrie's childhood home to build the larger and even more grand Astor Hotel. Her mother also built a new Astor residence uptown, at the northeast corner of Fifth and East 65th Street, for Mrs. Astor and Carrie's brother, John Jacob Astor IV, at 841 and 840 Fifth Avenue and designed by society architect Richard Morris Hunt. At the inaugural ball at her mother's new residence on February 3, 1896, Carrie led the cotillion in the new ballroom while her brother's wife (the former Ava Lowle Willing) led the cotillion from the other side. The feud with Carrie's cousin extended to Carrie as well and led her husband to hire Warren and Wetmore to design an uptown residence for the couple on East 64th Street. Wilson bought the property in 1896, began construction in 1900, and the six-story limestone mansion with forty rooms was completed in 1903. Carrie's house was around the corner from her mother and located at the northeast corner of Fifth and East 65th Street. The sixty-five feet wide residence had a Beaux Arts facade of Indiana Limestone and a mansard roof of blue slate and featured five bays and featured a circular atrium. On January 21, 1904, Carrie hosted the first large party in their new house, which featured a performance by opera singers Mme. Lillian Nordica and Enrico Caruso. A member of the Colony Club, Carrie served as the vice-president of the New York Women's League for Animals and was a director of the Beekman Street Hospital. She donated to the Merchant Marine Library Service. Personal life Portrait of Carrie's husband Orme, by L√©on Bonnat, 1894. In the early 1880s, Carrie met and fell in love with Marshall Orme Wilson (1860‚Äì1926), although her family disapproved of him and his family. He was the eldest son of Richard Thornton Wilson, a banker from Tennessee who had served the Commissary-General of the Confederacy and became rich investing in railways (leading to claims of war profiteering). Wilson and his siblings were known in New York and Newport society as the \\"Marrying Wilsons\\" due to their marriages into the wealthiest and most prominent families. His sister Grace married Cornelius Vanderbilt III, and his brother, Richard Jr. was married to Marion Steedman Mason. Another sister, Belle, was married to Sir Michael Henry Herbert (the British Ambassador to the U.S. during Theodore Roosevelt's administration and brother to the Earl of Pembroke), and Mary, who married New York real estate heir Ogden Goelet (parents of Mary Goelet, who married the Duke of Roxburghe). Reportedly, Carrie \\"starved herself into bulimia until her mother gave in and agreed to the marriage.\\" On November 18, 1884, Carrie was married to Wilson at the Astor mansion. Together, Orme and Carrie had two sons: * Marshall Orme Wilson Jr. (1885‚Äì1966), who was appointed U.S. Ambassador to Haiti by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944. * Richard Thornton Wilson III (1886‚Äì1977), who married Harriet Appleton Post (1894‚Äì1969), a granddaughter of George B. Post, in 1923. They divorced and he later became the third husband of Florence Magee Ellsworth (1902‚Äì1943) in 1942. Harriet married Sumner Welles in 1952. Her husband died on April 1, 1926, in New York City, and he was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. In his will, Carrie received their residence and all of its belongings, and their sons inherited the residual estate, including funds left by their paternal grandfather in trust for them. Carried lived another twenty-two years and died on September 13, 1948, at the home of her son Richard, 1 Sutton Place (the former home of Anne Harriman Vanderbilt). At the time of her death, she was the last surviving child of her parents. After a funeral at Trinity Church, she was buried alongside her husband at Woodlawn Cemetery. After her death, her former home was sold to the Indian Government to house their diplomats in New York for $500,000.

Biography   Writing  Van Gestel made his debut in 1962 with Drempelvrees, a collection of stories. He received the Reina Prinsen Geerligsprijs for this book. In 1976, he published the book Ver van huis under the pseudonym Sander Joosten. He made his debut in children's literature with Schuilen onder je schooltas in 1979. He received the Vlag en Wimpel award for this book. He received the Nienke van Hichtum-prijs 1987 for his book Ko Kruier en zijn stadsgenoten (1985) with illustrations by Peter van Straaten. For his children's book Winterijs he won the Woutertje Pieterse Prijs 2002 as well as the Gouden Griffel 2002 award and the Nienke van Hichtum-prijs 2003. He became the first to be awarded these three awards for a single book. Winterijs tells the story of a ten year old living in Amsterdam in the winter of 1947 developing a friendship with a Jewish boy. The story is inspired by van Gestel's brother's friendship with a Jewish boy when both were also ten years old. Van Gestel does not consider the book to be an autobiography but acknowledges that there are many similarities between the characters and people from his youth. In 2006, he won the Theo Thijssen-prijs for his entire oeuvre.  Radio, television and film  In 1986, he adapted the book Het wassende water (1925) written by Herman de Man to television. The idea to adapt the book to television came from van Gestel's experience as dramaturge for Anton Quintana's radio play also based on the same book. Van Gestel wrote the story for the 1999 film Een dubbeltje te weinig and he co-wrote the story for 1992 film Richting Engeland with Willem Wilmink. Both films were directed by Andr√© van Duren. In 1997, he adapted late medieval Dutch text Mariken van Nieumeghen into the children's book Mariken. He received the Gouden Uil 1998 award for this book and the story was used for the 2000 film Mariken. Van Gestel co-wrote the screenplay for the film with Kim van Kooten.

He joined the AP's Philadelphia bureau full-time in 1979, and transferred to the statehouse bureau in Harrisburg in 1980. He reported on the murder of mobster Angelo Bruno, Three Mile Island nuclear accident, the 1980 Pennsylvania Lottery scandal, the Centralia mine fire, the Mariel boatlift, and the campaigns of Arlen Specter and Jim Heinz. He also participated in covering the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, which were boycotted by the United States. Daniszewski then moved to the AP's General Desk in New York City, where he worked as Morning National Editor, helping to cover stories including the Tylenol murders, the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, and the murder trial of Claus von Bulow. He filed the AP's bulletin with news of the Challenger space shuttle disaster.  Associated Press Foreign Desk (1987‚Äì1996)  Daniszewski moved to the AP's Foreign Desk in 1987, and was posted to Warsaw in June 1987 to cover the Solidarity trade union and the fall of Communism in Poland. He reported on Lech Walesa, the country's first free elections in 1989, and the end of Soviet domination across Eastern Europe. On December 12, 1989, Daniszewski was shot in Timi»ôoara, Romania while covering the uprising against Nicolae Ceausescu during the Romanian Revolution. In his story on the incident that the AP published on December 26, 1989, he reported that he was shot three times, narrowly escaping death. One bullet grazed his skull, while two others hit his left arm. He wrote that he had left an embassy after filing his story via one of the few working telephone lines: > \\"What followed was a nightmare of running with nowhere to hide. Every turn > in the strange city seemed to lead to another firefight. We tried to make > our way back to the hotel, going in ever wider circles because of the > fighting. Finally, luck ran out. Driving into an intersection, somebody > flashed a light on us and shouted in Romanian. Before we could answer or get > out of the car, I saw the flash of a gun and realized in an instant they > were shooting at us. For what seemed like an eternity, we screamed that we > were journalists.\\" He was eventually evacuated to Belgrade and, after recovering, went on to cover the wars in the former Yugoslavia, including the Siege of Sarajevo. In 1993, Daniszewski became the AP's Southern Africa bureau chief based in Johannesburg, South Africa, where he led coverage of the end of apartheid and Nelson Mandela‚Äôs presidential campaign. He also covered the aftermaths of the Rwandan Civil War and the Angolan Civil War.  Los Angeles Times, (1996‚Äì2006)  Daniszewski joined the Los Angeles Times in 1996 as the Middle East bureau chief based in Cairo and reporting from across the region. In 2000, he became the newspaper‚Äôs Moscow bureau chief. He covered the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iraq, and he stayed on the ground in Baghdad to report on the impact of the \\"shock and awe\\" bombardment of the city and the U.S.‚Äôs 2003 invasion of Iraq. He remained as the newspaper‚Äôs Baghdad bureau chief during the ensuing conflict and returned regularly after being named London bureau chief in 2004. Daniszewski was a member of the Los Angeles Times team that won an Overseas Press Club award and was named a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize in 2007 for its coverage of the Iraqi Civil War.  Associated Press (2006‚Äìpresent)  Daniszewski rejoined the Associated Press in 2006, serving as Vice President of International News in New York. He negotiated the opening of the AP‚Äôs Pyongyang bureau in 2012 and Myanmar bureau in 2013. Under his leadership, the AP won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service and launched the AP‚Äôs Nerve Center. In this capacity, he oversaw more than 500 editors and reporters in close to 100 foreign bureaus. In 2013, he interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin. He also handled the deaths and injuries of multiple journalists, including the wounding of Kathy Gannon and the deaths of Anja Niedringhaus, Simone Camilli and Ali Shehda Abu Afash. In 2016, Daniszewski became the AP‚Äôs Vice President and Editor at Large for Standards, where he oversees standards around partnerships, fact-checking and trust-building. During his second stint with the Associated Press, he became a board member of several journalism organizations and groups, including the Pulitzer Prize Board in 2014. In 2012, Daniszewski founded the International Press Institute North American Committee‚Äôs Foreign Editors‚Äô Circle. In 2018, the International Press Institute appointed him as the organization's special representative for journalist safety. He is also an executive committee member of the ACOS (A Culture of Safety) Alliance, an organization dedicated to strengthening protection standards for freelancers. In 2008, he was a Sulzberger Executive Leadership Fellow at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.

As she married twice, she is occasionally referred to as Rebecca Dulcibella Orpen Ferrers, Mrs Edward Henege Dering, or Rebecca Dering.  Life  Rebecca Dulcibella Orpen was born either in 1829 or 1830, the historical record is murky as to which, in County Cork, Ireland. She was the daughter of Abraham Edward Orpen and Martha Chatterton. She appears to have spent much of her youth with her aunt, Lady Georgiana Chatterton and her husband, Sir William Chatterton, and may have eventually gone to live with them. Orpen was schooled in London, where she would have studied art and literature. Furthermore, her aunt's diaries suggest that Orpen was taught French by a governess in Paris and also knew German. In 1859, Lady Georgiana married Edward Heneage Dering. It has been suggested that Dering was actually intending to propose to Rebecca but, as a result of a misunderstanding, came to be engaged to Lady Georgiana, who was much older than him. However, that story does not appear to have strong historical substantiation. After the pair wed, Orpen and the couple travelled Europe, sketching and drawing as they went. A great many pieces Rebecca produced during this time are held by the National Trust. At the age of 37, on 18 July 1867, Rebecca Dulcibella Orpen married Marmion Edward Ferrers of Baddesley Clinton. Two years later, Lady Georgiana and her husband, Edward Heneage Dering, moved in with Rebecca and Marmion at Baddesley Clinton. The foursome, who became known as The Quartet, immersed themselves in the arts and in the restoration of Baddesley Clinton. Their other interests also included novel-writing, music, poetry, and embroidery. The Quartet were also Catholics, a not-uncommon feature of Baddesley Clinton. The Ferrers family that held the estate had historically been Catholics, and the estate had even been used to shelter Catholics when their presence in England was not legal. The diary of John Henry Newman suggests that Edward Dering, Lady Georgiana, and Rebecca Orpen were received into the Church of Rome in 1865. The Quartet were responsible for the addition of a chapel to the house's first floor, Rebecca providing paintings for it. (In the 1940s, Undine Ferrers, the wife of a distant relative of Marmion, ripped out the shrubbery had added the house, apparently feeling that the dark foliage represented \\"the dark forces of Catholicism.\\") The Great Hall, Baddesley Clinton, with Mr and Mrs Marmion Ferrers, Edward Heneage Dering and Lady Chatterton (Mrs Dering) by Rebecca Dulcibella Orpen (1870) After the foursome had lived together for seven years, Lady Georgiana passed away in 1876. She left Rebecca money in trust. In 1884, Marmion died as well. He left his wife everything that he owned, including the tenancy on Baddesley Clinton until she died. Rebecca Orpen and Edward Dering, the surviving members of the foursome, remained together at Baddesley Clinton; however, because it was not socially acceptable for an unmarried man and woman to live together alone, a local priest came to stay with them for 13 months. 21 September 1885, the two surviving members of the Quartet married. Her second husband died 22 November 1892. After his death, she continued her painting and involvement in local affairs, and she remained a staunch Catholic. She may have had old-fashioned sensibilities in some regards. For example, she \\"steadfastly maintained what Country Life described as ‚Äúthe regime of mid-Victorian England modified by the wistful love of Elizabethan manners‚Äù and she declined to have electricity installed in the house. According to an account left by her last servant, ‚ÄúThere was no electric light or lamps, only candles, rather trying in the winter, but we got used to it and managed quite well, but at times it was quite scary.\\" (Her objections to innovations did not, it seems, extend to rejecting photography.) Lady Chatterton (Mrs Edward Heneage Dering) (after Richard Buckner) by Rebecca Dulcibella Orpen (c. 1859) Rebecca Orpen was not a supporter of the suffrage movement. In a letter to Miss Mary Grafton from 1907, the year of the Mud March, Rebecca wrote \\"Don‚Äôt please encourage women[‚Äòs] suffrage! Think what it would be for poor old me!\\" Unlike some in the period, she did not take a moral objection to suffrage. Instead, she seems to have regarded extending suffrage in the UK as impractical: \\"I drive to the Poll with a lot of rough people + force my way with the crowd. As it is the carriage has to go all day carrying my tenants as voters to the poll, + if women also, where would end the fatigue and bother. This is a low view to take I know, but one has to consider how things work in practise.\\" She seems to have contented herself instead with soft power, influencing local politics by guiding the votes of 'her people,' for she tells Miss Grafton, \\"I got all my people to vote right + secured the thanks of the member Sir A Muntz,\\" who was the local MP. Rebecca remained at Baddesley Clinton until her own death, 31 years later on 12 September 1923.  Art  She was a prolific artist, working in both oil paints and watercolor. 78 of Rebecca Orpen's paintings are known to still survive. She also made sketchbooks full of sketches and preparatory drawings for her larger pieces. These pieces include self-portraits and portraits of both her aunt and their husband. Much of her art remains at the house to this day. She continued painting until she was 90 -- even after she was confined to her room, she had her paints and easel brought up.  Legacy  Orpen had no children with either of her husbands. She left behind, instead, a legacy of art and contributions to the maintenance of an historic English home. Baddsley Clinton is now a National Trust property, and many of Rebecca Orpen's effects, including many paintings, are now held by the Trust. Some of her sketches and letters are also had by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.

Biography Koret was born in 1900 to a Jewish family in Odessa. He immigrated to the United States with his family as a baby in 1901 where he grew up poor in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Koret moved to San Francisco at age 17, began working for his father's men's clothing company. In 1937 the two founded Koret of California. The company's greatest success arose from its invention in 1961 of Koratron, a new process for permanent press fabrics that was widely adopted in the clothing industry, eventually earning patent license revenues from more than 400 manufacturers that were far greater than the company's clothing sales. Due to a series of unsuccessful corporate acquisitions the company was near bankruptcy in 1973, when the Korets convinced their friend, Tad Taube, to take over as CEO. Taube began increasing their fortune through further company growth and successful real estate investment. After a series of expansions, divestitures, and a public offering, Koret of California was sold for $71 million in 1979 to its first patent licensee, Levi Strauss & Company. The company was spun off by Levi's in a LBO in 1986, and after further corporate changes is now an Oakland, California-based subsidiary of Kellwood Company, distributing mid- priced clothing to department stores throughout the United States. Philanthropy and awards In the late 1970s Taube convinced the Korets, who had no children, to donate their estate to charity, the Koret Foundation. Koret received the community service award of the American Jewish Congress and was to receive the Gates of Jerusalem medal from the State of Israel Bonds but died before he could receive the award. Personal life Koret married twice. His first wife was Stephanie Shapiro, a Jewish immigrant from Romania, whom he married as a teenager; she died in 1978 of dementia. In January 1981, he married the personal assistant of his wife, Susan McClain (born Whae Hwa Gee in 1938 in Korea and widowed from a U.S. Army master sergeant). She converted to Judaism. They ran the foundation together with Taube until Joseph Koret's death in 1982, at which time Susan Koret became chairperson for life with Koret writing \\"I have given much thought to the future of the Koret Foundation and it is my desire, as well as Susan‚Äôs, that she prepare herself to become a director and moving force in the foundation.\\" References Category:1900 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Jewish American philanthropists Category:American textile industry businesspeople ","title":"Joseph Koret"},{"id":"60054667","text":"The resistivity of solvent extract (ROSE) test is a test for the presence and average concentration of soluble ionic contaminants, for example on a printed circuit board (PCB).

On February 23, 2019, the Boeing 767-375ER(BCF) used for this flight crashed into Trinity Bay during approach into Houston, killing the two crew members and one passenger on board. The accident occurred near Anahuac, Texas, east of Houston, shortly before 12:45 CST (18:45 UTC). Debris was found in the shallow waters of Trinity Bay, ranging from small articles of clothing to large aircraft parts. This was the first fatal crash of a Boeing 767 freighter.  Background   Aircraft  The Boeing 767-375ER(BCF) ( 25865/430) aircraft was registered N1217A and was nearly 27 years old at the time of the accident, having been built in 1992. It was originally ordered by Canadian Airlines, but first placed into service by China Southern Airlines through GPA, an aircraft leasing company. In 1997, it was transferred to LAN Airlines and flew for 19 years before being stored in January 2016. It was converted into a freighter in April 2017, and placed into service for Amazon Prime Air by Atlas Air. In August 2018, Amazon named two aircraft in its fleet, including N1217A as CustomAir Obsession. The name, painted on the aircraft just aft of the cockpit windows, was a near homonym of \\"customer obsession,\\" an Amazon leadership principle. The aircraft had accumulated more than 91,000 hours over 23,300 flights and was powered by two GE CF6-80 turbofan engines.  Crew and passenger  There were three people onboard the aircraft. Captain Ricky Blakely of Indiana (60), First Officer Conrad Jules Aska of Antigua (44), and Mesa Airlines Captain Sean Archuleta of Houston (36; a jumpseater aboard the flight), who was in his final week of employment at Mesa Airlines, and was traveling home before beginning new-hire pilot training with United Airlines, scheduled for the following week. Captain Blakely joined Atlas Air in 2015 and became a Boeing 767 captain in 2018. Before being hired by Atlas Air Blakely had previously been an Embraer ERJ-145 captain for ExpressJet. He had also been a Beechcraft 1900 first officer for CommutAir, and a flight instructor for FlightSafety International. Blakely logged a total of 11,172 flight hours, including 1,252 hours on the Boeing 767. However, Blakely had experienced difficulties during training for his type rating on the 767. On October 31, 2015, Blakely was declared unfit for a checkride due to unsatisfactory remarks on his training which included the following: * Allowing airspeed to exceed flap limits during stall recovery training * Forgetting to set the missed approach altitude * Difficulties in performing missed approaches Blakely underwent remedial training the next day on November 1, this time with satisfactory results. The day after, he had his 767 checkride, and received his type rating on the aircraft two days later. Despite Blakely's improvements, Atlas Air placed him in the pilot proficiency watch program (PWP) due to his training issues. First officer Aska joined Atlas Air on July 3, 2017 and received his type rating on the Boeing 767 two months later. He had logged 5,073 flight hours with 520 of them on the 767. Aska had previously been an Embraer E175 first officer with Mesa Airlines (and served with five other airlines prior to that) and also had experience on Embraer's EMB 120 Brasilia and ERJ aircraft families. Shannon Ricks (43), an Atlas Air 767 captain who had flown with Aska described him as a \\"nice guy\\" and \\"definitely in the top half of the people I've flown with.\\" However, Aska had also experienced training difficulties with Atlas Air, moreso than Blakely. He had also recorded training failures with previous employers. His first issues were reported the same month he joined Atlas Air, when he was declined oral exam for his type rating on the 767 as he needed remediation training. Following the training, Aska passed the oral exam. Aska went through five fixed-based simulator tests, experiencing difficulties with normal procedures. In August, following two full-flight simulator training sessions, Aska's simulator partner complained that he was being \\"held back\\". Atlas Air had to restart full-flight simulator training for Aska due to unavailable seat support. Aska's first checkride on the aircraft ended in failure due to poor crew resource management (CRM) and improper controlling of the aircraft. His examiner described him as stressed and lacking situational awareness. Aska underwent remedial training on September 25 and the next day, he reattempted his checkride successfully, receiving his type rating on the aircraft. Christian Hutchcroft (33), another Atlas Air 767 captain, noted that Aska had \\"no real interaction with Ricky Blakely,\\" indicating that Flight 3591 may have been the first flight in which Blakely and Aska flew together. Both pilots had previous experience in landing at George Bush Intercontinental Airport.  Accident  Atlas Air 3591 was on approach towards Houston when it flew through the forward edge of a cold front, which produced an area of instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) with clouds and turbulence, with cloud tops varying from approximately to of altitude and cloud bases varying from to above ground level; the pilot of another nearby airliner reported IMC, and a video taken by a ground witness showed a shelf cloud passing over the area at the time. The accident aircraft made a sharp turn south before going into a rapid descent. Witnesses to the crash described the plane entering a nosedive; some also recalled hearing \\"what sounded like lightning\\" before the Boeing 767 hit the ground. At 12:36 CST (18:36 UTC) radar and radio contact was lost. There was no distress call. Shortly before 12:45 CST (18:45 UTC), Flight 3591 crashed into the north end of Trinity Bay at Jack's Pocket. The area of water is within Chambers County, Texas, and is in proximity to Anahuac. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an alert after radar and radio contact was lost around southeast of its destination. Air traffic controllers tried at least twice to contact the flight, with no response. Controllers asked pilots aboard two nearby flights if they saw a crash site, both of whom said they did not. The United States Coast Guard dispatched a helicopter and several boats to search for survivors. Numerous other agencies responded as well. The largest piece of aircraft debris found was less than in length. Some of the debris had the Amazon logo visible. The accident site was only accessible via airboat and helicopter. The water varies in depth from zero to deep and is partially mud marsh.  Victims  On February 24, Atlas Air confirmed that all three people on board died. The victims were first identified on social media by friends and family. By February 26 the bodies of all three had been recovered, and by March 4 all had been positively identified.  Investigation  NTSB investigators examine debris at the edge of Trinity Bay NTSB investigators recover the flight data recorder from Trinity Bay Investigators from the FAA, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) were dispatched to the accident site with the NTSB leading the accident investigation. A dive team from the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) was tasked with locating the aircraft's flight recorders and dive teams from the Houston and Baytown police departments were also on-scene assisting in the search. The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were located and transported to an NTSB lab for analysis. It was thought that crews would likely remain at the accident site for weeks for recovery. As of March 2019, the cause of the accident had not been determined. It was noted that storm cells were nearby at the time of the accident, but this is not unusual for Bush Intercontinental. CCTV cameras at the Chambers County jail show the airplane in a steep, nose-low descent just prior to impact. The FAA, Boeing, Atlas Air, National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), International Brotherhood of Teamsters (the pilots' labor union), Air Line Pilots Association, and engine maker General Electric assisted or offered their assistance to the NTSB inquiry. After listening to the cockpit voice recorder the NTSB stated that \\"Crew communications consistent with a loss of control of the aircraft began approximately 18 seconds prior to the end of the recording.\\" On March 12 the NTSB stated that the airplane \\"pitched nose down over the next 18 seconds to about 49¬∞ in response to column input.\\" Later that same day the statement was changed to \\"...in response to nose-down elevator deflection.\\" On December 19, 2019, the NTSB released a public docket containing over 3,000 pages of factual information it had collected during the investigation, with a final report to follow at an unspecified later date. The docket contains information on \\"operations, survival factors, human performance, air traffic control, aircraft performance, and includes the cockpit voice recorder transcript, sound spectrum study, and the flight data recorder information.\\" On June 11, 2020, the NTSB announced that the next board meeting would determine the cause of the accident; the NTSB determined during a public board meeting held on July 14, that the flight crashed because of the first officer‚Äôs inappropriate response to an inadvertent activation of the airplane's go-around mode, resulting in his spatial disorientation that led him to place the airplane in a steep descent from which the crew did not recover. The NTSB released an animation of the mishap sequence of events from the selection of Go-Around thrust to the fatal crash 31 seconds later. On August 6, 2020, the NTSB posted the final accident report to their website, which stated: The NTSB concluded that the aircraft was likely flying in IMC when the go-around mode was actuated, and that the crew could not see the ground until the aircraft exited the clouds approximately above the bay, at which point recovery from the steep descent would have been impossible.  Lawsuits  On May 20, 2019, the estate of Captain Sean Archuleta filed a suit against Amazon and Atlas Air in federal court. The suit accuses the defendants of failing to operate the aircraft in a safe manner. On September 9, 2019, the family of first officer Conrad Jules Aska filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Amazon and Atlas Air, citing improper training and negligence.

Her work is found in major collections worldwide and she has been highly recognized for her etchings and engravings, many of which were inspired by time spent in Great Britain.  Early life and education  Norma Gloria Morgan was born in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1929. She is African-American. Her mother raised her, after the early death of her father, and worked as a domestic worker, a seamstress, and designer. Morgan showed interest in art from childhood, painting a classroom wall mural at the age of thirteen and receiving recognition for her painting, Reflections, completed when she was seventeen. She studied two years at the Art Students League of New York, privately with Hans Hofmann in her early 20s, and later with Stanley Hayter. It was Hayter who taught her engraving.  Career and life  Morgan received a fellowship to study in England in her twenties and spent much of her time exploring the Moors. This time inspired work that centered on natural imagery, especially skies and clouds. She went back to Great Britain in 1961 and stayed there until 1966. Her work was selected to represent the United States in the First World Festival of Negro Arts, held in Dakar, Senegal, in April 1966. The other American artists included in this exhibition included Barbara Chase-Riboud (at that time known as Barbara Chase), Emilio Cruz, Sam Gilliam, Richard Hunt, Jacob Lawrence, and Charles White. Among the awards she has won for her work are the John Hay Whitney Fellowship, the Louis Comfort Tiffany Grant, three gold medals from the American Artists Professional League, and the gold medal from Audubon Artists. Morgan spent her active years living in both New York City, where she worked primarily on engravings in her apartment, and Woodstock, New York, where she had space for large painting. She has a love of the outdoors and activities such as cross-country skiing and lake swimming. She also played mandolin, meeting with other musicians to play in Washington Square Park. In interviews, Morgan has explained that her motivations for her artwork go \\"beyond\\" the black experience and feminist identity. Her works span Realism and Surrealism and fantasy, and feature figurative works of family members, landscape and vistas.

Summers was educated in the Indianapolis public schools. After graduating from Crispus Attucks High School (when it was the only secondary school open to African Americans in the city), he attended the Indiana Academy of Mortuary Science, and graduated with an associate degree. He then attended Indiana University and graduated. In 1948, he married Joyce Benson, who had graduated from Crispus Attucks High School that year, and would survive him by decades (dying in 2014). They had daughters Natalie and Vanessa Summers, who survived them and had children. Career In 1962, Summers established the Summers Funeral Chapels, and became a leading local businessman, serving both African American and white families in central Indianapolis. He was a member of the local Better Business Bureau (later becoming a director), African Methodist Episcopal Church, Freemasons (Fidelity Masonic Lodge #55) and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, as well as county, state, and national funeral directors and morticians associations, and a board member of the Alpha Home for the Aged.
